# Transcript

(0:00:30) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al. Oh
(0:00:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And my name is Johnny, and we're going back to back, back to back health.
(0:00:40) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, we're here to again to talk about God is your games
(0:00:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Ooh, no spookiness this time. I actually got through the intro without laughing.
(0:00:49) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think we've done that so we have done back to back I think did me did me and Kevin do back to no Kevin did back to back but not me because Kevin did is his solo one
(0:01:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: In a row look at that crazy
(0:01:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yes, we're we're recording we're gonna talk about
(0:01:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Johnny and me have both done a demo from the what they call it next fest steam next fest October 2024
(0:01:16) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's a thing they do every so often where they get a bunch of games to release demos
(0:01:21) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So we have each played a demo from a game that we have talked about previously on the podcast
(0:01:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And we're going to talk about them to each other before that we have obviously
(0:01:30) Demos Are Good — Track 2: lots of news. We also then have a new segment, which I will get to. But first of all, Johnny, what have you been up to?
(0:01:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I have been up to pretty much the same thing that everyone has been up to this week. I assume that's Pokemon Pocket. It's such a good game. I... So I am like a big card gamer TCG in general,
(0:01:45) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Oh yeah. I definitely had that on my list.
(0:01:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: not the Pokemon one because they're games really bad, but you know I played Magic the Gathering,
(0:02:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: - Mm-hmm.
(0:02:05) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I played Hearthstone, Modern Snap.
(0:02:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And now Pokemon Pocket.
(0:02:11) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And my biggest concern coming into the game is that the actual gameplay wouldn't be that good.
(0:02:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's definitely better than I expected.
(0:02:21) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's probably not amazing, like it's not as good as any of those other games that I mentioned.
(0:02:27) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But it is a lot stronger than I thought it was going to be.
(0:02:32) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And the thing I am maybe enjoying the most is the fact that there isn't a letter.
(0:02:38) Demos Are Good — Track 3: and I do.
(0:02:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I just find myself playing games because I enjoy playing the games, and it's really nice to not have the pressure of "I need to play games so I can hit double triple platinum and unlock, you know, X of this new currency and do all of these other things".
(0:02:56) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I'm really enjoying that the reason to log in on a consistent basis is to open a pack and to get new cards.
(0:03:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And I just play the game. I mean, I want to play the game. It's... it sounds...
(0:03:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: That's really sad that that is, in fact, a nice feature to have in the game.
(0:03:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Interesting. Um...
(0:03:14) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Other than that, I'd be really enjoying, like, just opening the packs and sync cards.
(0:03:19) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like, I don't really care that much about getting a full collection.
(0:03:23) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I just care about collecting the good cards that I want to play a deck with.
(0:03:27) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But last night, I did a tin pull on the Charizard pack,
(0:03:32) Demos Are Good — Track 3: and I got two of the Charizard Immersive cards.
(0:03:35) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And let me tell you, those immersive cards are really pretty.
(0:03:36) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Ridiculous.
(0:03:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Really cool.
(0:03:40) Demos Are Good — Track 3: The level of detail that has gone into the artwork for those is pretty crazy.
(0:03:48) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And I think those cards are really cool.
(0:03:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yes, you can tell why there's only three of them.
(0:03:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yes.
(0:03:53) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah.
(0:03:54) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And so it's really cool to have two of those.
(0:03:56) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So now I am desperately pulling on the Charizard pack to try and get the rest of the cards.
(0:04:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I would like to flesh out my Charizard deck because I am in the fun position where I have two of the immersive Charizard's.
(0:04:07) Demos Are Good — Track 3: but I only have one child.
(0:04:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Fair enough. I feel like we're playing pocket completely differently, because I don't care about the battles. I don't find the battles particularly fun, and I just want to complete my collection. I have, yeah. Yeah, I've not finished all of them. I've done, is it four?
(0:04:23) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Interesting. Have you done the solo battles?
(0:04:31) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Are there four sets of them, is that? I think I'm halfway through the third tier. Yeah, I'm almost exactly. I'm three out of seven in the third tier, and I've completed the first and second tier. So why would say is they're fine. I don't dislike the battles. I do, I like the changes they've made, like you, I like the changes they've made to the game. I think it does make it better.
(0:04:33) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, there's four tiers of--
(0:04:59) Demos Are Good — Track 2: The smaller decks, the energies being separate. I like those things about it. I kind of wish they
(0:05:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: more to make it more different. I don't. Part of the problem, I think, is that there are only a few
(0:05:20) Demos Are Good — Track 2: decks that are good enough to be able to, you know, actually win, and but they're
(0:05:24) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But, so I do not think that that is the case at all.
(0:05:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: okay. We can come back to that in a minute. I granted I haven't put as much time into you as you,
(0:05:35) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So you might be you might be fair however. I think part of the problem
(0:05:40) Demos Are Good — Track 2: is there are too many cards for me to be able to feel comfortable doing the battling. If we compare it to Marvel Snap which in most cases I think is bad how people are comparing it to Marvel Snap but the one thing I would say I do compare them in is that with Marvel Snap obviously there are only a few strategies that work however the number of total cards is much smaller so that
(0:06:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: a card you're you're probably you're quite likely for it to be useful to you whereas there are over 200 cards already in pocket with just the first set and so I feel like most cards that I get are useless and I'm never going to use them for anything for battling.
(0:06:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, there are definitely a, like, I don't disagree, I think with anything you said other than, you know, the number of cards that are useful.
(0:06:38) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But I think that there is too much filler stuff that's just there to make up cards when you open packs,
(0:06:46) Demos Are Good — Track 3: and like, they're just never close enough to even being useful in a deck.
(0:06:52) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And I do wish that there was maybe slightly more changes from the TC card.
(0:06:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I don't really like how much coin flipping there is in the game, but I also, it also seems necessary based on the way the game is designed,
(0:07:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Oh, everywhere. Oh, I can't stand it.
(0:07:11) Demos Are Good — Track 3: because you need that sort of coin flipping to enable certain strategy.
(0:07:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like, you need that element of randomness because there aren't many elements of randomness in the way the game plays out otherwise.
(0:07:25) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Mm-hmm. Do you need randomness?
(0:07:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So it's... ahh...
(0:07:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: the way... the way pocket and a TCG is designed, I feel like you do, so what are the reasons I said that?
(0:07:37) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I've been playing a lot of Marawak EX deck, and Marawak EX does 80 damage, or you flip two coins that it deals 80 damage for each head.
(0:07:49) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's a very aggressive deck, and it's the sort of deck that couldn't exist the way the rest of the game is designed without the...
(0:07:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: the element of randomness that is introduced by flipping coins, you would basically have to depower Marawak to...
(0:08:06) Demos Are Good — Track 3: like you could have Marawak as just a, you know, two energy, 80 damage, first stage card, which would be fine,
(0:08:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: but one of the reasons the deck actually works is like, if you fall a little bit behind as more powerful decks sort of ramp up and get going with their thing,
(0:08:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: you can still just randomly spike two hits and knock out an EX and still win the match, so it gives the deck a lot more play,
(0:08:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: otherwise it'd just be a lot of situations where it's like, oh I just instantly lose here, like there's no possible way for me to win.
(0:08:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And that's where I think that random... like the element of randomness is an important element for the way the TC... like the game is currently designed.
(0:08:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: That doesn't mean it's good design, it doesn't mean I like it, I totally agree, I wish they had done more to change it to find a different way.
(0:08:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I like to introduce that randomness, but I see why it is necessary.
(0:09:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I guess the thing is right, like, there already is randomness in a TCG because you have your deck and your drawing cards from it, so you're never going to get everything
(0:09:14) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, a pocket has a lot less of that than most other TCG's, like, decks are relatively consistent, I find.
(0:09:25) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And the other aspect is that, like, yeah, but, like, pretty much every deck has two professors' research to pokeball.
(0:09:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: if you if you build your car your deck well.
(0:09:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like, the consistency is pretty high within pocket, but the big difference is actually the way the game plays out.
(0:09:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Once your Pokemon are on the board, the game becomes very deterministic.
(0:09:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's almost more chess-like than it is like other TCG's, and it's about how you're then maneuvering the pieces on the board in order to win.
(0:10:02) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And so you do need some onboard randomness with the way the game plays out in order for it to remain interesting.
(0:10:08) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Otherwise, you would just have a lot of board states where it's like, "Oh yeah, we've seen this before, and this player wins."
(0:10:14) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Hmm, you're not convincing me to enjoy the battles.
(0:10:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But my intent was not to convince you to enjoy the battles, like they are like I don't think they will be universally appealing from a competitive way in the way that something like Marvel snap is because it's a lot more straightforward.
(0:10:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I think the way the TCG is designed, and this is my experience from playing where like at the moment I would say I'm winning quite a lot because people simply don't understand how to effectively use their board in order to
(0:10:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: win and you just get tons of free knockouts because people don't understand how to retreat, what to put in the front, you know, what to make their active Pokemon, when to sacrifice something, like people are very bad.
(0:11:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, that- I mean, that- that- presumably there's no skill-based match- matching, right?
(0:11:07) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So, like, because there's no ladder, you're not going to end up in that situation where you're mostly battling people who are on a similar level to you.
(0:11:15) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So, you know, that's, I guess, the disadvantage of that, because you-
(0:11:20) Demos Are Good — Track 2: well, the disadvantage for other people, not for you, the advantage for you,
(0:11:22) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yes. Yes. Yeah.
(0:11:24) Demos Are Good — Track 2: the disadvantage to new people, um, is that you just end up getting thrown into battles with people who are good.
(0:11:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: _laughs_ It's really a week.
(0:11:32) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, yeah. I would like a form of competitive that isn't a ladder. You know, if it was a, you know, try and win five games without losing against other people that are also trying to do the same thing, or like something like that, I think would be quite appealing.
(0:11:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: - Really?
(0:11:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I suspect they're doing- I would be- because they've obviously not got something just now, and I don't think that's purely development time based,
(0:11:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: - Ah.
(0:12:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: right? Like both this and the trading, I don't think they're not in the game because they didn't have enough time to do it. I think they're both deliberate choices to get people to focus on what they want to focus initially, because if they had trading straight away people would, like, immediately, like people who poured in gold would just immediately get everything because they'd have enough other things to trade for what they're missing in.
(0:12:21) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I suspect they don't want people to just immediately do that and, with the ladder, I think they're trying to think up some new better ways of doing competitive than just a ladder.
(0:12:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think if they were just doing a ladder they would have just put it in because that's not a difficult thing to do.
(0:12:37) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, I tend to agree. I'm really, like, I believe that they're watching to see, like,
(0:12:43) Demos Are Good — Track 3: how are people enjoying the battles? What are they playing? You know, how much are they playing?
(0:12:47) Demos Are Good — Track 3: All those sorts of things so they can make a really intentional decision around whatever they choose to implement from a more ranked form of play within the game.
(0:13:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: The last point I'll make on Parker we can move on is just, I think, the state of the game.
(0:13:07) Demos Are Good — Track 3: The moment is a lot of people are attracted to the EX decks. In particular, you see a lot of Pikachu EX and Mewtwo EX as kind of the the decks that everyone, I think, is default assumed as one of the best decks. They are the most linear, like, they are very linear, they have low randomness and they are very powerful. I think there are a range of strategies that have not been fully I really explored it, that are very good.
(0:13:37) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like I've had very good success with my aggressive Mariwaki, so it's Mariwaki Exins and Sandslash,
(0:13:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: a kind of the two main Pokemon. It's just very aggressive, it really punishes,
(0:13:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: like the bad draws for those decks can even beat their good draws.
(0:13:54) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I think there's a lot of non-Ex Pokemon that are also very good, and I think there's a lot of like decks that just don't use Exes that haven't been properly explored. I've been,
(0:14:06) Demos Are Good — Track 3: One of the reasons I've been pulling onto-
(0:14:07) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I think a lot more of the cards are playable than you currently see if you play the game.
(0:14:14) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Or the other deck you see a ton of is like this Articuno deck that's just horrendous, they try and use Misty to spike doing something powerful and turn one, even where they get it, like I just don't think it's very good, there's just other Pokémon that do more with more consistency.
(0:14:37) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So yeah, like I- correct, correct.
(0:14:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: All I see is people complaining about not getting any heads on MISTI, yes, just maybe you should be doing something else then.
(0:14:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I do think that this is probably just one of those things where you're going to end up.
(0:14:56) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like, it's only been out for people who weren't pretending to be in New Zealand.
(0:15:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's only been out for a few days, right, less than a week.
(0:15:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think you're just going to see a lot of people realizing different things.
(0:15:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: over the next few weeks and thinking up new strategies, right, like that's just part of how it goes.
(0:15:14) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Fair enough. Yeah, I think I just point, I'm not against the idea of trying to get more interested in the battles, I just it's yeah I just I've not had a huge like you can tell by the fact that I've not really done all of the solos yet and I was pretending to be in New Zealand so I've been playing it for a month and I'm still not finished all of them.
(0:15:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Right like that. I'm just I've just not been particularly interested in that and I'm just enjoying
(0:15:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Meanwhile, I've done all of the solo battles and all of the challenges other than
(0:15:49) Demos Are Good — Track 3: The challenges on the final phase because they are they are quite difficult challenges that I will need to work towards doing
(0:15:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I'll probably I'll get there, right? And maybe I'll enjoy them by the end. I don't know. But I think I'm just exhausted with the idea of trying to figure out a dick is part of the problem. And yeah.
(0:16:08) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Oh, I'll send you some decks because I got through pretty much all of the solo battles with the Warner Battle mechanic.
(0:16:14) Demos Are Good — Track 2: What? I can't imagine wanting to use that because surely you want to battle because you want to battle.
(0:16:22) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Uh, but some of, like, so I like battling other people, right? Like, for me, I kind of just enjoy the challenge of, like, can I build a deck that's good enough to get through these solo battles without me having to, to play? And, like, occasionally I'll look over and see what the, uh, but what I bet was doing, and I'm like, oh, Jesus. What a terrible system.
(0:16:41) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's not very good.
(0:16:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I don't none of that sounds interesting to me like it just
(0:16:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But they're a wood cell.
(0:16:50) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like with like if we compare it to snap again for the last time I enjoy
(0:16:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I enjoy getting a good deck that works, but I don't want to do it multiple times
(0:16:59) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Right like I have like three decks that I've built
(0:17:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Realistically that I've used properly in Marvel snap in the is two years. It's been out right in the two years it's been out I've really like I have a lot more decks than that
(0:17:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but I don't use most of them and most of them are just like copied from the internet and find that interesting I don't enjoy going like a lot regularly here's it let me figure out a new deck with this strategy I just yeah I don't know I'm enjoying snaps still because yeah I'm still really bad this uh this season for some reason I've still not even hit 80 But um, maybe one day I'm up to
(0:17:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: 79 now. So maybe I'll finally get to 80 this season.
(0:17:48) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I feel like I bounced off snap as soon as pocket came out like it's just and I think I've just enjoyed not having the pressure to log in and do dailies that take so much time.
(0:17:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Okay, so that's sorry. That's the other thing I enjoy about pocket is the fact that you can complete your dailies without having to do a battle.
(0:18:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Oh, yeah, you don't, there are so many things you can do to do the dailies. Right? The dailies is like three, three or four. Is it four? I think four dailies you have to do. But there's like eight options or something like that. So yeah, like you log on. That's one of them. You, you open a pack. That's another one. You do a wonder pick. That's another one. And then you open a second pack or you do a battle or you do another one to pick or there's something else. I can't remember what it was.
(0:18:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: That's it. You've done all you need to do. Yeah. I'm still on the symbiote, Black Panther deck. I've changed a few couple of things around because obviously they made it more difficult to do that one because Black Panther is now five power. So you can shank shank shank shi before you combine it with symbiote.
(0:18:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, yeah, what are you playing a Marvel snap this season?
(0:19:01) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So I've done a couple of things to try and improve that.
(0:19:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I've added in Agent Venom, so I've tried to, if I don't have Black Panther, I'll play an Agent Venom to put it down to 4 Power.
(0:19:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I have Mr Negative, who has been useful in some cases, where he obviously is not helpful for Black Panther,
(0:19:21) Demos Are Good — Track 2: because he just switches 5 with 5, but has allowed me to do other things.
(0:19:27) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Obviously, Arnhem then becomes a 0 cost 6. Power card, I have what's going on.
(0:19:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Jane, are you playing Jane Foster?
(0:19:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: What's her name? What's her name? Why can't I remember her name?
(0:19:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I'll send you my list out.
(0:19:44) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Oh, Dreadful. Ironheart. Ironheart. There we go. Got there. Ironheart, obviously, is then a 0 cost 3. Power.
(0:19:46) Demos Are Good — Track 3: What should I do?
(0:19:55) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I think when, if the person I'm playing doesn't have Shang-Chi, then most of the time I'll win,
(0:20:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I feel like a lot of people have Shang-Chi just now. And that's annoying.
(0:20:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah and it's probably only going to increase, because I think the next season pass card is like a, um, a chonkster as well.
(0:20:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: All right. Yeah. So we'll see. I'll keep going. Hopefully I'll get there. I don't think I'll get to infinite, but I'm hoping to at least get into into the 80s.
(0:20:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Well good luck. It's always frustrating when you can't quite find a dick that's like working for
(0:20:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah. But I've not been going down. So that's something.
(0:20:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: One way of thinking about it. Yeah. I think that's what I've been playing as well. Just pocket and Marvel snap, but we've been playing pocket very differently.
(0:20:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: That's what we've been up to. Our new section we're going to get into, which is the recent releases section.
(0:20:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: We're not going to do this every episode because there's not a game release every week, although sometimes it does feel like it.
(0:20:59) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Hey sure about that.
(0:21:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But we've got about two months worth of game releases that I noticed in my list when I was updating it.
(0:21:12) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I thought let's talk about them because I thought it may be useful for people.
(0:21:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They have played like heard about a game that we've talked about, but they've not managed to actually play it and they had, you know, forgot about it or whatever.
(0:21:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like, I'm sure people will hear about it and then they go, oh, I want to play that game, but they never actually do anything about it because it's not out at that point.
(0:21:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They've not gone and wish listed or whatever. So we're just going to mention these. We're not going to talk a huge amount about them just a little bit.
(0:21:42) Demos Are Good — Track 2: We're probably not gonna give much opinion about it because they are
(0:21:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: we've not played I think any of these games you've not played any of these games have you no so we probably don't have enough to have proper opinions on them it's probably enough nonsense to talk about so yeah we've got the the first one is Melobot a last song which was the the game where you're a little robot going around and trying to heal plants of some evil thing.
(0:21:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: No, I have not.
(0:22:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But now if you were interested in that one we have garden which life which probably don't need to explain garden which life there you go done.
(0:22:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Amber Isle a reminder though the switch version of this was delayed I think it's coming out this month but it is on steam if you were wanting that orange season finally out of early access how long was it in early access for a long time 2017 April 2017 was when it started in early access.
(0:22:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: There's a strange name in that time the last farmer which is the post apocalyptic.
(0:22:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: The least cozy game that you've ever mentioned on this show yes
(0:22:56) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I don't know is this less cozy than pumpkin panic.
(0:23:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Okay fair enough and the newest one which only came out on Friday if you're listening to this less than a week ago if you're listening to this on release day it was less than a week ago.
(0:23:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I imagine the marvellous the new marvellous it's not rain factory honestly.
(0:23:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: of all of these, uh, the one that I'm most looking at is, is Melobot. Uh, I've just kind of,
(0:23:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I think over the past sort of year or so, I've found enjoying more structured games, you know,
(0:23:32) Demos Are Good — Track 3: with a narrative, um, uh, Kevin I covered. Was it Kevin I who covered Mushy, um, comes home,
(0:23:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: whatever that game was called, the one where you're the mushroom that goes around and, and adventures And smooshy, there we go.
(0:23:45) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Oh smooshy smooshy
(0:23:48) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And Melabot has similarish vibes to it, so that's the one that's sort of standing out.
(0:23:56) Demos Are Good — Track 2: was you in Kevin? Yeah, I agree. I'm also kind of interested in trying form as you are, just because I want to see how it actually feels playing. Having seen gameplay of it since it's released, I'm less interested in it now, but I'm still keeping my options open. I'm not gonna buy it at full price. 50 quid's a lot for a game. I'm not sure if I'm gonna enjoy.
(0:24:19) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, it seems like an expensive game.
(0:24:21) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, well it's by Marvelous, so they don't
(0:24:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Do indie cost game alright. Well next we've got the news. We've got the big news Johnny
(0:24:33) Demos Are Good — Track 2: We finally got information about animal crossing pocket camp complete before we get into the news about this. How you feeling about this?
(0:24:38) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, uh conflicted because it seems really good and I'm not sure if I want to get back into
(0:24:45) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Okay, oh
(0:24:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Animal Crossing pop again. Yeah, I played it when it first came out maybe for a couple of months and you know I enjoyed it for what it was but you know it was a mobile game with microtransaction
(0:24:52) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Did you play pocket camp
(0:25:08) Demos Are Good — Track 3: problems and that was a bit of an off-putting feature to me and I kind of eventually just got sick of it and and deleted it but you know it's Animal Crossing yeah
(0:25:17) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Well, have I got news for you? There are no micro payment. What was it many? I can't.
(0:25:25) Demos Are Good — Track 3: microtransactions And...
(0:25:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Micro transactions. I was like micro payments. It's not there was the term that we use. Yes,
(0:25:31) Demos Are Good — Track 2: micro there are no micro transactions in the new version pocket count complete. So we knew that it was coming out. I think we knew it was coming in December, but we now know it's coming on the 3rd of December that is six days after pocket count goes
(0:25:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: down, which I initially thought, huh, that's weird. Why have they got it so close to it going down,
(0:25:53) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but not like straight after. But then of course I realized that they'll probably want some time between pocket camp going down and people starting to transfer their save data in to make sure that the save data transferring servers working fine with all the latest because like people will be able to change things in their save data up till the second that the game goes down. And so that or probably take a long time to back up that data and make sure that it's all right before the transferring starts so exactly exactly so it's the Thursday the 28th of November it goes down and then Tuesday the 3rd the new game launches its base price will be 20 US dollars
(0:26:21) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, and just smart to give yourself a couple of days to be like, "Who knows what could go wrong?"
(0:26:39) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but until the end of January it will be half price so that's cool I like that I suspect that means
(0:26:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: 9% of people will buy it at half price
(0:26:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I imagine so. Like it feels like it's like, it's more like it's, the normal price is $10.
(0:26:56) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I'm gonna see you decide to get in late and then you get the dumb, dumb tax up in additional $10.
(0:26:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: yeah you got the you weren't paying attention uh tax uh so confirmation that it adds almost all past items um they have said little asterisk some events and items will not be available but they haven't said what I suspect there's like oh that's true it did say may not so I wonder or what's happening there, like how...
(0:27:05) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Great.
(0:27:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: think a lot of it said may not be available. I just wonder if it's kind of a it could be licensing or I was just wondering if it's kind of like cover because maybe there was some random item that was in you know very briefly but like didn't actually do anything and that's like you know games just develop weird things that like not everything's gonna transfer and someone's like I I managed to get my hands on an item that is like spoiled.
(0:27:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Is it a licensing of something?
(0:27:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: food that's not in the game why isn't that transferred over and they're like we said some items may not go away please please stop racing yes yes so my my my reading of it is all of the items you would actually want will be
(0:27:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, or there's an item from an event seven years ago that actually breaks the game.
(0:28:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, so they've announced that all of the previous events will come back in a four year cycle. I'm sure
(0:28:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: This is the thing that like terrifies me about this game.
(0:28:23) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Well, the good thing is that there will be a new currency called leaf tickets, which will allow you to buy items outside of their events and seasons. How we get those leaf tickets. I do not. But that is a thing.
(0:28:38) Demos Are Good — Track 3: My assumption, and this is entirely speculation, is that when you use to generate the leaf tickets, which are no longer in the game, they were the paid currency, you will now generate the, yeah, you will now generate this instead, and be able to use it that way.
(0:28:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, they weren't, they were called something else.
(0:28:56) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Leaf coins or something.
(0:29:01) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Right, I can't find the name initially,
(0:29:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but yeah, there was a,
(0:29:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think they were a coin, the one in non.
(0:29:09) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, maybe we'll see.
(0:29:12) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And they've announced that there will be new events that will all happen by the end of September 2025.
(0:29:20) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So as part of the four year cycle of events,
(0:29:24) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but they're all in the functions.
(0:29:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Sorry, I found the answer. So they were called leaf tickets. They're now called complete tickets and
(0:29:33) Demos Are Good — Track 3: You get them from working in events
(0:29:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So yeah, I assume it's just the sort of direct like it's basically just replacing the paid currency
(0:29:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: with an unpaid one and Now that unpaid one is used to purchase stuff that you may have missed
(0:29:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: thought the new one was called Leaf Tokens. Leaf Tokens. And the old one was Leaf Ticket.
(0:29:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Leaf tokens, yes, okay
(0:29:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I will also say I suspect that this will be time travel, a bowl, all of these events because I don't think there's going to be any real. There's not going to be any online other than the transfer.
(0:30:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: What about the Whistle Pass, where you can see your friends?
(0:30:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So the friends stuff, as far as I can tell, is just your data is encoded in a QR code,
(0:30:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: which the game then interprets as your character. That's not connected to the internet.
(0:30:31) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Ah, yes, that looks like- yep, yep, that looks like you are correct.
(0:30:36) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So I don't think the game will connect to the internet at all, at all, except the initial transfer.
(0:30:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So I suspect if you change your calendar, you'll get better at whatever event.
(0:30:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So if you really care about a specific event and you've missed it, or you don't want to wait for years, you could probably do that. But we'll find out when it launched. Another...
(0:30:56) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I mean, this is just very hard to criticize, right?
(0:31:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like, it just looks so good.
(0:31:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I have something to criticize it. So I need to double check. I need to find out when this launch is what the case is with this. But they have a note on the press release that says,
(0:31:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: please note that if you delete the app, save data will also be deleted. Save data isn't
(0:31:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: entirely saved on your device. And I understand that from a sake of they're saying it's a game,
(0:31:24) Demos Are Good — Track 2: it's a local game, it's not on the line. It's not online, so we can't save your data to our cloud.
(0:31:33) Demos Are Good — Track 2: However, especially on Apple devices, they have cloud save. And if they've turned off cloud save,
(0:31:39) Demos Are Good — Track 2: which is an active thing they have to do, I will be very annoyed, just saying. Like, you don't need create your own server and make sure that you keep our
(0:31:49) Demos Are Good — Track 2: account data up to date. I don't care about that. But Apple has a way for you to do cloud save. Please do that. So I can play it across multiple devices.
(0:31:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So you have a hypothetical criticism,
(0:32:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I have a high, well, I have, well, no, they've said if you delete the app, save data will also be deleted. That would not be the case if they used cloud save.
(0:32:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, but Nintendo doesn't know how the internet works out.
(0:32:13) Demos Are Good — Track 3: That's not to feel it of enough, if you have a company, I would agree, but Nintendo doesn't know.
(0:32:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Well, this is the thing, I am not going to say that I am 100% sure that that means they don't have cloud save, but it definitely makes it feel like they don't have cloud save anyway, we'll find out I'll definitely be buying this game.
(0:32:30) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, I think I will buy it as well because like I don't want to pay the sucker tax if it turns out that I do want to play it so
(0:32:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, I mean it looks it looks good
(0:32:40) Demos Are Good — Track 2: yeah well and if nothing else if I'm never gonna play this I at least want to encourage them doing this again so I'm going to give them the money to say yes this was worth doing please do it for future apps
(0:32:54) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, um, the one thing I'm curious about and and you and I won't be able to answer is but I'm curious if anyone has been playing
(0:33:02) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Animal Crossing pocket camp at this whole time how they feel about now having to pay to keep playing
(0:33:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Because you know, it's nice from yours in my perspective where we've put no time
(0:33:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: If it all money into this game in the last four or five years and now there is a thing that you
(0:33:24) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Can purchase that is a complete experience. I do wonder if someone who has been playing full-time feels like maybe there should have been some way to You know burn it for free if you've been actively playing for the last couple of years or something like that Like I just I'm a little bit curious about that side
(0:33:39) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah I would understand that. I do think that if you've been putting in loads of money into the game, probably $10 is not much for you.
(0:33:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: If you're someone who's not been plowing lots of money into it, you're probably quite happy with paying to not have to deal with that.
(0:33:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Maybe I'm assuming a lot of things.
(0:34:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: We may never know it, but listeners, if you are one of those people getting, getting contact, is it howasseason.club, there's a little form right there on the page.
(0:34:09) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yes, yes, I think oh, yes, just - I was gonna talk about the friends feature So I kind of talked about that but basically there is a new friends feature if you have friends currently in the game
(0:34:25) Demos Are Good — Track 2: When you do your save transfer those friends those friends cards
(0:34:30) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Assuming that both you and they have logged into the game since the update was released like two days ago if you've done that, you will...
(0:34:39) Demos Are Good — Track 2: get their campercard automatically.
(0:34:41) Demos Are Good — Track 2: If you haven't, then you'll have to scan their QR code to get it.
(0:34:45) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think the campercard thing is cool.
(0:34:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: The fact that you can...
(0:34:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Because they didn't need to do that, right?
(0:34:50) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They could have just not had any friends' features in it.
(0:34:53) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But the fact that they've built in a new feature to have your friends' campercards and even be able to see their characters in a specific place in the game,
(0:35:03) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I feel like goes above and beyond.
(0:35:06) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, I think that's that's how a lot of this feels like yes they are creating a new product that they are hoping to sell and to make money off of but they could have done a much lazier job of this and probably sold it for the same price and
(0:35:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Probably sold a very similar amount, but this feels
(0:35:24) Demos Are Good — Track 3: More like they want people to have a really good experience with this and have been very intentional about how
(0:35:31) Demos Are Good — Track 3: This has been designed as an experience to continue on from the
(0:35:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: online mobile sort of experience.
(0:35:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: for sure. And my final point was just if you want to transfer your save data, make sure you've connected your Nintendo account before the servers go down. If you've been playing the game and you have it on your phone and you've been actively playing it, I suspect you've probably already connected your Nintendo account because I think when they released that feature there was bonuses and stuff like that. But, and if you haven't been actively playing the game, you either have already
(0:36:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: connected it and that's fine or you don't have your save data anymore because they only, I think you can only get it on multiple devices if you connected your Nintendo account. But just saying
(0:36:16) Demos Are Good — Track 2: if you do, if you are one of the people that's been actively playing it and you have it on your phone and you haven't connected your Nintendo account, you need to go do that before the 28th of November. Go do it now. Alright, I think that's everything. There is a 12 minute video if you want to watch it to get more information, but I feel like I've pulled out all this stuff that actually matters, but it will be in the show notes as well, the link.
(0:36:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Next we have, Sunhaven have released a new update, 1.7, which doesn't really feel like much of an update, and I'm not sure why they're calling it 1.7, but it is what it is. They have released a bunch of new items and get this 25 new DLCs.
(0:37:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: This game is just like a DLC machine.
(0:37:03) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:37:06) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Twenty-five.
(0:37:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: This is wild, to just come out all at once.
(0:37:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, it's uh, it's a lot.
(0:37:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I just, yeah, I don't know what to say, they're now up to 30 DLCs, so they only had four before this.
(0:37:22) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Crazy crazy
(0:37:24) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like every time I see some haven't it's kind of full into the category of games I feel like I would like to play but I just realistically do not see myself ever having the time to play it
(0:37:35) Demos Are Good — Track 3: because this game looks big and very in-depth and
(0:37:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, like I would love to have the time to play through this because I think the game looks also but realistically
(0:37:46) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Most of the comments on Steam are just complaining about how many DLCs.
(0:37:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: 25 new DLCs, huh? That's like Christmas for the developers.
(0:37:57) Demos Are Good — Track 3: to be fair they're all relatively cheap you know they're a couple of dollars for new furniture so like to me this is the good side of DLC risk you know if you want to do a certain theme you can buy some extra furniture and skins and I think they do mounts and stuff and most of them and
(0:38:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: if you don't it's not like you're really missing out on anything like I don't know this is to be is a very good way of doing the LC. I mean 25 is a law, it's kind of crazy but you know.
(0:38:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I agree. I don't actually have an issue with the DLC. I think the main issue people have is that they're releasing DLCs while still not releasing the Switch version, which that's not how this works, the same people aren't doing those two things. I just understand their frustration with the... what's the word I'm looking for? How they're framing it, right? And they're still not really talking about the Switch version. They are continuing to say that they're not going to release at least another major update until the Switch version.
(0:38:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Great, but they did call this 1.7 which is what they've been doing with all their other major updates.
(0:39:06) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Feels a little bit disingenuous to be like "oh no more major updates" but here's an update 1.7 which doesn't have anything major in it so that's what makes it not a major update.
(0:39:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And, well, interestingly on the Steam page, there is a type field, and under type, this is labeled major update, but I feel like a number of games have increasingly been going silent on Switch ports for games, and it just feels like, you know, the Switch is at the end of its life cycle. A lot of...
(0:39:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: games with, you know, more financially strong backing. I struggle to produce games that run on Switch and I just wonder if a lot of these studios are struggling to get their games running on Switch and when I look at something like Sunhaven and what that's trying to do, I just imagine it's tough to put in a way that actually makes the game workable at this stage.
(0:40:07) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I mean, I've said for a long time that I don't think any Kickstarter should promise any consoles at all, like I just think there's no positive to that.
(0:40:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think you could say we hope to do this, but do not allow people to bat based on that and do not make it a stretch goal, because you will come across problems.
(0:40:29) Demos Are Good — Track 2: If you are not a console developer, you do not know what it is like to port to console. You do not know if you're going to have to do it yourself.
(0:40:37) Demos Are Good — Track 2: If you're going to be able to find someone else to do it, you don't know if they're going to be, you know, shot down randomly while you're doing it, looking at you humble games.
(0:40:45) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like, there are just so many possibilities. The only thing you, as our developer, have to control is the stuff that you are doing, which is probably just the Steam game.
(0:40:56) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yep. I agree.
(0:40:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like, is there any game recently that has come out on everything that it's said and has had no issues and nobody's complained about how long it's taken? Even Stardew gets complaints about how long it takes.
(0:41:07) Demos Are Good — Track 2: For the updates to console, do you think you're going to do better than Stardew?
(0:41:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yes, I always assume I'm gonna do it.
(0:41:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Uh, didn't Mica came out on everything at the same time, right?
(0:41:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Did it not?
(0:41:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Nope. Don't think it's out on Xbox yet.
(0:41:22) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Oh, that doesn't count.
(0:41:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So, I think it just came out on Steam and Switch at the same time, but they had to delay for the Switch version, and they decided to delay everything, which I do think is probably the sense that the Switch is going to happen.
(0:41:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But, only works if it's a short-term delay. You know, you don't want to delay for years. Like, imagine if Coral Island had delayed until their Switch version was out, they'd still not be out.
(0:41:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah.
(0:41:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Uh, yes.
(0:41:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Which one could argue would be a good thing? I wouldn't argue that, but one could.
(0:41:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Good. I'm glad we're agreed.
(0:42:00) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Anyway, that was a long time for such a small update. Next, we have Slime Rancher 2, have announced their next update.
(0:42:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Into the Labyrinth. It is coming December 12th this year, and we don't know anything about it other than players will finally be able to enter the Grey Labyrinth and begin to unveil the mysteries of Rainbow Island.
(0:42:22) Demos Are Good — Track 2: There you go, Johnny. You will finally be able to enter the Grey Labyrinth. Just what you've always wanted.
(0:42:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Finally, yep, I've been, I've been hanging out to do whatever that is and to learn about the thing, yep, cool, good job.
(0:42:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: - The mysteries of Rainbow Island.
(0:42:40) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I'm sure for people who are playing this game,
(0:42:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: they're excited to finally be able to enter the Grey Labyrinth.
(0:42:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I just, yeah, it's very funny when an update is like that.
(0:42:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Very funny wording.
(0:42:53) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Next, we have an exciting update for Google Town.
(0:42:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Are you excited about this, Johnny?
(0:42:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: The Dinkum, Google Town crossover.
(0:43:01) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I mean, it's hard to not be excited and like, I haven't loved my time with Go Go Town, but
(0:43:08) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I mean, you can ride a wallaby. And like, calling it the Dinkum update, I guess, Dinkum Australian word. So it's Australian update. And, uh, ah, is it a game?
(0:43:20) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Well, there's not just that income is also an Australian gay another game
(0:43:25) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's a game so it's a crossover
(0:43:27) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I had not heard of this game. I just assumed it was like, we're just putting a bunch of Australian
(0:43:31) Demos Are Good — Track 3: games into Go Go Town.
(0:43:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: because they're both Australian games by Australian. So I think that's the idea. And
(0:43:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: so it's kind of like Minecraft, but farming is probably a simple way of putting it. But they obviously have a lot of Australian animals in it, hence the wallaby. So yeah, if you were waiting for the ability to write a wallaby, or what is that? Is that a beard of some kind? What's
(0:44:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: a bear in the bottom of this? That's not a wallaby. A what? Koaka.
(0:44:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: That's the Wallaby. Surely that's a Wallaby. Maybe it's a Kawaka. Kawaka. Yeah. Q-O-K-K.
(0:44:15) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Oh, it might be that, yeah. Yeah, it looks more like that. It definitely looks like a,
(0:44:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: is this a rodent, the koaka? It definitely looks like a large rodent, rather than
(0:44:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It could be a build, nah, it's not a build.
(0:44:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It doesn't have to be the right nose.
(0:44:30) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It looks yeah, yeah, I'd go with Quack up. It's definitely if it's if it's a wallaby. It's a very badly designed wallaby
(0:44:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people fully design a lot of things, but.
(0:44:44) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, it's cool. I like I feel like I think this game is going to pull me back in eventually
(0:44:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: After there's like six updates or something like that and there's enough more content for me to want to get back in
(0:44:57) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, I feel the same like this is a game that I will check in on every once in a while to see like does it have enough
(0:45:06) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And finally we have the first update for Mika and the Witch's Mountain is now out.
(0:45:14) Demos Are Good — Track 2: We have a bit more information about the minigames so one of them the Churro Express minigame.
(0:45:20) Demos Are Good — Track 2: You are helping deliver Churros and the Save the Kitty's minigame.
(0:45:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Can you guess what this is?
(0:45:27) Demos Are Good — Track 3: You're going to put kittens up really high for other people to then have to say.
(0:45:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: yeah exactly and there's a new pet companion I don't know what the point of this is one of the first rewards you've earned is the companion Edgar the crawl who will now fly with you every time you get on your broom that's all it says does he do anything or just fly around with you and it so is it just a
(0:45:54) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I hope there was nothing that indicates that this actually is what happens is that
(0:46:01) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Edgar might start to like point out like secrets or collectibles. That would be a
(0:46:07) Demos Are Good — Track 3: really nice thing for
(0:46:09) Demos Are Good — Track 3: them to do and I feel like it must do something because it says you have to have like a keychain equipped for
(0:46:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Edgar to appear. So presumably that means there is like some feature attached to it But like I would really...
(0:46:24) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I would really like it if he was pointing out collectibles because I still have a few to get in the game and I don't really don't want to look them up and it would be really nice if there was like a little in-game hidden system and I think this was...
(0:46:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, I agree. I would be again. Johnny's just making this up. We don't know that this is the case There's nothing that suggests. It's the case. This is just that we would we would like that, please
(0:46:46) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Alright, that's all of the game news. We also have one new game to talk about and that is now
(0:46:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: How do you think this is pronounced doleok town or dolok town?
(0:46:57) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, but I would say don't work town. Yeah
(0:46:59) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Dolek, or dolek, dolek.
(0:47:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Let's go with dolek tone.
(0:47:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Is a cosy pixel art farm simulation game set in a post-apocalyptic world?
(0:47:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Is your bingo card full yet?
(0:47:11) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Build your dream farm from scratch and explore this mysterious wasteland, harvest plant build and battle against ferocious creatures while discovering the untold stories of this forgotten land.
(0:47:24) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Did it capture your interest, Johnny?
(0:47:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Uh, no. Which, like, I don't want to sound down on it, but, like, the- the- this is just not the style of game that appeals to me particularly.
(0:47:38) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Um, like, I think- I think this game will appeal to a lot of people.
(0:47:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I am just not one of those people. Um, you know, it has a very strong sort of 2D platformer, um, adventure, uh, look from the gameplay.
(0:47:54) Demos Are Good — Track 3: the the town boot.
(0:47:56) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Doing does feel reminiscent of the way that you build up the boat in Spirit Fero with things stacked on top of each other and that side I do quite like the look of, it's more just the sort of core gameplay adventure loop is it's just not really
(0:48:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: - Yeah, I'm quite interested in this one.
(0:48:17) Demos Are Good — Track 2: As you say, the building feels very spirit fair,
(0:48:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: and I really like how they did that in spirit fair,
(0:48:22) Demos Are Good — Track 2: and so doing more of that, I think would be really fun.
(0:48:25) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It definitely seems more farming focused than that,
(0:48:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: whereas spirit fair was like,
(0:48:29) Demos Are Good — Track 2: here is your one farming block.
(0:48:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: This is much more like, here's a bunch of area you can use for farming, which I like how they've,
(0:48:39) Demos Are Good — Track 2: it's too deep, but they still allow you to have quite a lot of area for farming.
(0:48:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Building up that like that, I think is really clever.
(0:48:46) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I really like the graphics.
(0:48:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's pixel art, but it feels not just,
(0:48:50) Demos Are Good — Track 2: it doesn't feel like it's just trying to be stardier.
(0:48:53) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It does have a very distinct style.
(0:48:55) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I agree, I think this art style is really cool and innovative,
(0:48:59) Demos Are Good — Track 3: which is, it's very hard,
(0:49:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I think to do something different in pixel art in 2024,
(0:49:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: but this is doing it.
(0:49:05) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah. Yeah, I'm definitely going to keep an eye on this one. Um, we don't have any release date announced. Um, as far as I can see, it's just planned for steam. Um, there is a steam page with a bunch of information on it. Um, and a demo. Oh, she didn't, she'd have wished we'd known before I'd played my other demo and I could have played this one instead. Not that that says anything bad about the demo. Yeah, no, this is definitely on my, I've added to my wishlist now, keeping an eye on it.
(0:49:33) Demos Are Good — Track 2: All right, I think that's all the news.
(0:49:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Whoo, she said like fear dinkum, which is just like, um, I was gonna say it's kind of just like saying fear. I don't it's
(0:49:36) Demos Are Good — Track 2: What does "dink" mean?
(0:49:46) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Don't you just love trying to explain slang, it is the best.
(0:49:48) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah
(0:49:51) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Look, I'm now trying to Google like the definition so I can provide something that's
(0:49:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: and genuine, honest, true.
(0:49:59) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, so
(0:50:01) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, although the search result that I got was saying
(0:50:06) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's Australian and New Zealand. It's definitely not a New Zealand slang term. It is just a no.
(0:50:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Well, interestingly, my web search is trying to imply that it's English, and I have literature.
(0:50:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Well, that's definitely wrong.
(0:50:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Claims that it's possibly from Lincolnshire, Okey dokey, but that is a different, so their definition is doing one's fair share of work, which feels different, it feels like...
(0:50:22) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Interesting.
(0:50:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Ah, but no, that, that, that, that, I can see that as an origin, but that is not how it would be.
(0:50:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, it feels similar enough that they could be related, but...
(0:50:40) Demos Are Good — Track 2: not. You wouldn't use it in that context. Is that fair? Okay, cool.
(0:50:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yes. Yes.
(0:50:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Let's talk about some demos. So, Johnny has played the Luma Island demo, and I have played the overthrown demo, both on Steam Next, and I thought we could talk about that, because we did that in the last neck fest. Was that in me or something? Or maybe earlier than that, and you played...
(0:51:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Light your frontier, and Johnny Plades.
(0:51:08) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I did.
(0:51:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Great.
(0:51:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Say field. Is that correct? Cool. So we're going to do a similar thing. Do you want to talk about Luma Island first? We'll talk about yours.
(0:51:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, let's let's talk about Luma Island. So, Luma Island feels Stardew-esque in the sort of core gameplay loop.
(0:51:33) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Where it is different is it is 3D and it has a moveable camera which confused me for the first two days because I didn't realize the camera was moveable because that's just how my brain works.
(0:51:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Why is that not the first thing you do? The first thing I do in any game is see if I can move the camera. [laughs]
(0:51:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But I'm so used to it now that you can't move the camera that I didn't even occur to me to do it until I changed its own and I came back and I was like where am I and I realized I was on my farm but the camera was facing a different direction that was how I found out I could turn the camera.
(0:51:50) Demos Are Good — Track 2: The first thing I do in any game is see if I can move the camera. [laughs]
(0:52:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yes, which would have made it a lot easier if I had had to realize that sooner.
(0:52:17) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So I really like.
(0:52:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: What I played off the demo and the demo was five days and I probably wasted a lot of those five days, so it didn't get to experience everything that I think was in the demo, but the.
(0:52:31) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think that's pretty standard for demos is not being able to access everything with one playthrough
(0:52:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, yes, what I really liked that this game is one but on boarding experience was very good, which I normally don't expect in demos, but it had a really nice cadence of like the quests were telling you to do, you know,
(0:52:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: it started off very specific things, walking you through all of the steps that you needed to do in order to craft something and build it, and then they sort of were progressing to the next quest is do like you've got the chain of actions and we've taken you through how to do them all so the next quest is just here's the end result you need to get to and it was a really sort of nice onboarding experience, but the thing that really sort of stood out to me is early on in the game.
(0:53:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So there was one hall to get a permit to, you know, basically start making money and there were, I think, five different professions.
(0:53:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: There was cook, brewer, like a crafter, artifact one, and I'm forgetting the fifth one now.
(0:53:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But the purpose of the professions is they were sort of difficulty, so there was a difficulty associated with each of them, which I really liked and I assume the difficulty was.
(0:53:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: More attached to like how hard it was going to be to make money and progress rather than like a combat difficulty or anything like that.
(0:54:00) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And yeah, it kind of just, to me, this game has the vibe of, yes, it has its roots in the games that we love that have caused us to, you know, be on or listening to a show like this one.
(0:54:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: But it was doing enough that was different that feels like, yes, this is a game I would really like.
(0:54:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: to play more of and see more of because it's doing enough things that feel different, right?
(0:54:27) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And so the profession I picked was the Brewer because it was like, I was like, yes, this is interesting because this is like a thing that exists in a lot of games in that you can ferment your crops in a keg. But usually that's about as far as it goes. And this was very much like for the brewing it was you had to harvest some crops um you had
(0:54:50) Demos Are Good — Track 3: the keg but you also had to make the glass bottles for things to go in and it just all made sense and like it just had a really good feeling to it so yeah I was a really big fan of my time
(0:55:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Okay, so my thoughts about this game when I see it are
(0:55:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: That I really like how it looks except the character models. How does it feel to you when you're playing at graphics?
(0:55:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: fine. I would say yeah, like I'm not big on the character models either, but I don't know that that was something that I really thought about that much in my time playing the game. And one of the things that I think, and I've just been sort of looking through the Steam page, as I've been talking to remind myself of things, is a lot of what they seem to show online is, you know, like going towards playing in multiplayer with us a lot of the characters.
(0:55:48) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I will say though the one thing I didn't do was the more adventuring side of the game with the dungeons and some of those sorts of things that I didn't get a chance to do and so that might feel slightly different because that is very much about where your character is and what they are doing. I was more doing the farming and mining.
(0:56:18) Demos Are Good — Track 3: and actually this is just another thing that I like so there was a mine on your farm that is just a mine like it I get the sense that the monster fighting and the mine are separate areas which again
(0:56:35) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I am a fan of because I think combat in these games can be very hit on this and I get frustrated with the idea that often in order to do the mining which is always a critical
(0:56:49) Demos Are Good — Track 3: game so you then have to do the combat which not everyone wants to do so I would be a big fan if all of the mining you could do without engaging.
(0:56:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah.
(0:56:59) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, interesting.
(0:57:01) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So it definitely feels how you're describing it like it is basically a good 3D stargu-like,
(0:57:11) Demos Are Good — Track 2: and it's doing some things different,
(0:57:12) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but it's not trying to completely reinvent the wheel.
(0:57:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah it very fair. The one other thing I will say which I think might be, I think it will change for a lot of people how they feel about the game, is that to me the area by where your house is is very hilly and you know one of the things that I think is often appealing is you've usually got your farm with a big sort of flat area where you can do what you want so I don't know that this will be a great game if you're into
(0:57:46) Demos Are Good — Track 3: designing farms this this probably doesn't feel like that sort of game like you'll be able to do something right because you still build stuff and put things down but nothing like some of the you know beautiful farms that you see in something like a coral eyes or a star
(0:58:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's probably harder to, even if you could do that, it would be harder to show off in a 3D game anyway, right?
(0:58:11) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Because on 2D games, you just like, you zoom out and you got a screenshot, right?
(0:58:16) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And they quite often even have a feature designed to do the full zoom out to take the picture of it all.
(0:58:23) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Whereas on 3D, it's much more focused on the, you know, more curated areas.
(0:58:31) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's harder to do that in 3D than it is in 2D.
(0:58:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Okay.
(0:58:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yes, I agree. So yeah, um, trying to think of anything else that really stood out to me about this game, there was something interesting that was going on where you would do like, you know,
(0:58:46) Demos Are Good — Track 3: chopping a tree and you would get nature essence or something like that. So there was definitely hints at like something more going on in relation to the island and like, and things to explore that seemed again, interesting and like they were trying to do something different. It wasn't clear.
(0:59:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like with these essences like that, I assume that are probably just another form of currency or something like that, but there was, um, it felt like there was a decent amount going on in this game and it comes out relatively soon and like this demo made me really excited to, um, to play this game.
(0:59:25) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, yeah, I think it comes out in the 20th of November. I think
(0:59:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Uh, 21st it's saying for me, but nad time since.
(0:59:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So close Yeah, that's almost certainly a time zone thing. Okay interesting. Um, I feel like I would expect that you're bored of stardula
(0:59:35) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I am actually so I'm really pleased you said that because it reminded me of, um, when I was done with the demo, how I felt was like, I have been very bored of Stardew likes and I was not bored of this one. And like I've tried in the past year, I tried roots of patches.
(1:00:05) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And a couple of others where it just felt like you're kind of going through
(1:00:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: the same start for every game. This game did not give me that vibe at all and I think because the onboarding was pushing much more towards your profession in the time I was playing, I never got a quest that was to go and talk to 10,000 villages and do a bunch of boring nonsense that I don't really want to do like I feel like this game really
(1:00:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: was like encouraging me to one explore the profession that you've picked but two kind of just do
(1:00:44) Demos Are Good — Track 3: what you want to do I'm not sure if there are any social mechanics in the game the impression I got is that there's not which I'm totally fine with like I just like this game does not have the vibe of like yeah we are building this game around strong characters and doing romance and like I kind I'm not hoping it's not in the game because...
(1:01:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: it just didn't feel necessary or needed.
(1:01:09) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like, this is a game that feels more about doing farming,
(1:01:15) Demos Are Good — Track 3: exploring, you know, like picking a profession and really sort of following that through.
(1:01:21) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Like, this game feels much more about you and your adventure in relation to the island,
(1:01:26) Demos Are Good — Track 3: not in relation to the other characters on the island.
(1:01:30) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Which I think was part of what was appealing to me,
(1:01:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I'm very bored with, you know, just romancing random NPCs because that's part of the game and even though they have, you know, all bland sort of stereotypical personalities.
(1:01:41) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah
(1:01:46) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yes, as an aside, I'm not gonna put this into the podcast because
(1:01:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It's apparently still meant to be secret, but they are about to announce that the reason that they've delayed sugar do
(1:01:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Island is because of adding romance and
(1:02:02) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Oh my god. No!
(1:02:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Okay.
(1:02:05) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They added the kickstarter, but they're like we're not announcing it for two weeks and I'm like why
(1:02:11) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Are you announcing it here then?
(1:02:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Fine. I'm not going to talk about it on the podcast till it's officially public just because it's easier, but yeah It's it's literally they're saying we're doing this because of romance
(1:02:24) Demos Are Good — Track 2: The grant allowed them to the money to to add romance in and I'm like no really
(1:02:33) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Okay, so any last thoughts about this demo and
(1:02:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: What's your one what should be people's one takeaway?
(1:02:41) Demos Are Good — Track 3: My last thought about the demo is if I think of anything I've said has interested you like download it and give the demo a go this game comes out soon and I think I think it will appeal to a lot of people particularly if you're found a lot of stuff lately hasn't been quite hitting the mark for you I think it's just doing something different enough and then there was a second question, and I talked too long, and I forgot what you're saying.
(1:03:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Mm-hmm. What's the one takeaway?
(1:03:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I think for me the takeaway is about the professions you know one of the things that I really enjoyed listening to in the early days of the harvest season was when you would do the challenge episodes around you know we're gonna do Stardew but animal farming or there was the mining challenge you know some yes some of those sorts of things I really enjoyed and what I liked about this is like kind of just having that direction off off.
(1:03:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: mining one. Yeah.
(1:03:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I'm gonna do a playthrough and this time I'm going to be a brewer or this time I'm going to be a shift to kind of push you to maybe do some of those like like I am interested in doing a playthrough as a cook because I often don't engage with the cooking mechanics much in these games because cooking food just doesn't do that much and but that being your profession totally changes that narrative so that that that is the thing that really sort of just was like this is something
(1:04:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: that I didn't know I wanted in these sorts of games and so I've just looked into the Steam page so there was only five professions I recall seeing in the demo but the Steam page says pick from seven unique in depth professions.
(1:04:15) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah. Yeah, I know you're right. That does sound very...
(1:04:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So well, you don't expect them to fit everything in the devil
(1:04:30) Demos Are Good — Track 3: No, no, but just just to be and like seven feels like the right amount because I'm assuming there'll be like a fishing you know you'll be able to be a fisherman for one of them and probably a few other things so.
(1:04:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: A really big fan of what this demo showed and very excited to give this a go.
(1:04:47) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So what did you try?
(1:04:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Interesting. So I tried, let me just double check the name because I keep calling it the wrong thing,
(1:04:54) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I tried overthrown. So this is, you are, you find a magic relic that gives you powers basically,
(1:05:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: and you're building a town, you know, bringing people into your town to help you fight other bandits and animals and stuff.
(1:05:18) Demos Are Good — Track 2: That's the basic idea that the thing that really drew me to this game is how very much like Southfield how different it feels to play physics wise and just like general right you're not just kind of walking around and occasionally jumping at most you are running and you can run like so fast you run across water.
(1:05:41) Demos Are Good — Track 2: You can, you know, jump up cliffs. You are grabbing things.
(1:05:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: One of the things that I really like is so you have a sawmill for making planks from trees and you can either cut down a tree and throw it at the sawmill or you can pick up the sawmill and throw it at the trees and it will do the exact same thing.
(1:06:06) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And I just really like that silliness to it and the the playfulness of we're just going to do weird stuff.
(1:06:17) Demos Are Good — Track 2: That part of it felt great. The movement.
(1:06:21) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I feel like there's a little bit of tweaking they need to do especially for like controllers because obviously I was playing this on my steam deck.
(1:06:28) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But in general the movement, the fluidity of that felt pretty great.
(1:06:36) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I really liked it.
(1:06:39) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It felt the demo felt pretty bare bones and it felt kind of more like a tech demo than anything else.
(1:06:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So it's hard to know how this would feel as a full game like what is your end goal and how do you stay interested because obviously there is a bit of a thing in with some games in their uniqueness is it's just a gimmick.
(1:07:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And I don't and I feel like this could either end up being just a bunch of gimmicks smoosh together or it could feel like a really nice fulfilling game.
(1:07:12) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I like how they kind of be separate.
(1:07:17) Demos Are Good — Track 2: The building is like a build menu, and that, you know, you can choose something, and then you're still moving around, but you are moving around in a slightly different way, like you're not kind of like running around in that area, but it's not the only time you can move things, like if you're just, if you're not in the build menu, you can still go up and pick something up, pick up a build menu.
(1:07:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And that's how you do the weirdness with the, you know, moving buildings around and throwing them at trees, or, you know, simple things like if you've got a bandit who comes to try and get stuff, you can pick up a building and throw at them, for example, and kill them like that.
(1:08:08) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, unfortunately you answered but not in the way I was hoping the one question that I had about this game because it has very strong Minecraft vibes to the game and my question for this has been what is the gameplay loop, what is the narrative because the vibe that it's giving off is very much like no you just build stuff for the sake of building it and it's silly which for me would not be an...
(1:08:39) Demos Are Good — Track 3: it's almost like it very much at the moment to me has the vibe of like a game that I would happily have on like a second screen while I'm playing something else...
(1:08:49) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I'm watching someone play this game, but I'm not sure I'm seeing it like a strong desire to actually play it myself.
(1:08:52) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, it definitely feels like a city builder rather than, uh, you know, it doesn't feel like there's a huge amount of narrative, and it might just be that they're saving that for the game, um, but it, yeah, it definitely, it doesn't feel like that kind of really exists.
(1:09:16) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And maybe it will at some point, um, but yeah, I don't know, it's difficult to know.
(1:09:21) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I love how...
(1:09:22) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It feels to play so much that I'm not willing to ignore anything else, but hard to explain
(1:09:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: is this the sort of game where there are some games where there's like almost a joy of movement and it's just a fun world to be in and to explore and sometimes that can be
(1:09:46) Demos Are Good — Track 3: enough for a game is that like would you say that's how you're time?
(1:09:50) Demos Are Good — Track 2: it kind of in so much as like I've definitely had fun in my playing of the game and in that movement the movement is definitely enough to have fun but I guess the question is how long can you have that fun that
(1:10:06) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yep. And like I mentioned a certain amount of that comes down to how many of these silly interactions are there like the idea of throwing the sawmill at the trees is a very good one right it's very a very funny idea a very good idea and as we've been talking I opened the Steam page where they've got the developer playing the game and the thing that is standing out to me the most is there is literally just trees.
(1:10:36) Demos Are Good — Track 3: You know so I'm curious how deep do those silly things go because if they kind of really lean into that side of the game and the mechanics you can imagine lots of weird combinations of stuff where you could be there could be that kind of constant sense of discovery that would be awesome to keep going through right.
(1:10:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think the simple answer is probably no to that it feels like as I said it feels more like a tech demo than a game demo and I feel like there could be more like that eventually but I don't feel like it's ready for that and I don't know I don't know how much of this is it's a demo therefore they didn't put everything in and how much of it is they just don't have the other stuff it's difficult to know I'm gonna keep my eye on this no matter what right like this this the movement is I feel with the movement like I felt with Fay Farm where there's something here and it may not be enough for me to it's definitely not gonna be enough for me to plow a hundred hours into a game but there's something here that I would like in general, and there's maybe
(1:10:58) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So did you other than throwing sawmills at trees did you come across other biomes or other sort of fun.
(1:11:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: something that people could learn from this, in other games as well.
(1:12:02) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, even things like with the sword, you know, you can do like a super jump almost right like
(1:12:12) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, it's like a helicopter jump.
(1:12:13) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, yeah, I think those sorts of things seem good and yeah movement in
(1:12:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: There's lots of games we like to play has been pretty bad or basic for a long time. So I feel like
(1:12:27) Demos Are Good — Track 3: even if nothing else this game could produce some cool ideas.
(1:12:32) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I could hopefully make their way into other other games.
(1:12:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, it's not even just farming games right like games in general movement has stayed pretty static for 10 years, right like
(1:12:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Not to say that they're the other games are bad in their movement, but they've not really tried to do a huge amount different
(1:12:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, I think there's a lot happening here, and I'm hopeful for this
(1:12:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But it's definitely not the same as your your experience with luma where it's
(1:13:04) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like a deliberately limited demo of a really great game that's coming out soon
(1:13:11) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Instead, this feels like a really interesting tech demo that could lead to a really detailed and deep game
(1:13:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But also might not
(1:13:21) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Do we have any indication on when overthrown is planning on coming up?
(1:13:25) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So they've said they've said 2014
(1:13:29) Demos Are Good — Track 3: 2014, well time travel.
(1:13:30) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Sorry 2024
(1:13:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I presume that's for early access because they've said it's gonna be early access and I feel like that's probably deliberate So yeah, I it'll be interesting to see whether the early access game is just the demo But slightly further on or whether it would make it clear that the demo was less
(1:13:55) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Than the early access game and just are a demo of how the game might feel in certain situations
(1:14:02) Demos Are Good — Track 3: So, based on what you played of this game, let's just assume no early access.
(1:14:10) Demos Are Good — Track 3: What release date would you hope to hear that would be an exciting release date because it means that they are hopefully taking the time to flesh this out until the game I think
(1:14:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like that's 2026, which would be feasible for a game coming out in early access this year to be like, because they have the core stuff down, right? Like,
(1:14:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: they have the interesting idea, they have the movement down, they have me hooked on that idea. But now they need to have a reason to keep playing it past the first day. And a a year and a half to two years,
(1:14:47) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I suspect would be enough time for that.
(1:14:49) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Because that's much easier than creating very core concept,
(1:14:53) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but not easier, it's faster, right?
(1:14:56) Demos Are Good — Track 2: To create quests and create story lines,
(1:14:59) Demos Are Good — Track 2: it's faster to do that than to create physics in a game.
(1:15:03) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I'm also, there's a lot of polish needed in this game as well.
(1:15:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Like the menus feel a little bit flaky,
(1:15:10) Demos Are Good — Track 2: and as I said, the controller support is there.
(1:15:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They've done the thing that I keep telling developers to do,
(1:15:16) Demos Are Good — Track 2: which is build in control of the support from the start.
(1:15:19) Demos Are Good — Track 2: If you play it on the Steam Deck, it will show you the right things.
(1:15:22) Demos Are Good — Track 2: But there's a few bits and pieces that feel like they're missing from controllers.
(1:15:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And there's a few bits that definitely feel like they're more focused for a mouse.
(1:15:30) Demos Are Good — Track 2: You can do everything with the Steam Deck,
(1:15:32) Demos Are Good — Track 2: but it just feels a little bit janky.
(1:15:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, so, yeah, it sounds like some good bones, but it's really going to be.
(1:15:34) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I'm hopeful, I'm hopeful, but I want to see where they go with it.
(1:15:42) Demos Are Good — Track 3: And what I really hope, and I don't know who the developers of this game are,
(1:15:46) Demos Are Good — Track 3: but this - I'm hoping that they have sufficient runway to turn this into the game that it could be.
(1:15:52) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yes. Yes. Yeah, I hope they're not going, "Oh, we need to get this released next year," or something like that, and it not be enough.
(1:16:02) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They do seem to have done a couple games, so they've done one called Lance a Lot from 2016, and then they've redid it in 2017.
(1:16:12) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And they've got one called Bonsai Royal, which looks interesting, a top down on...
(1:16:19) Demos Are Good — Track 3: That's a great day, okay.
(1:16:22) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Yeah, a top down online shooter where contestants scavenge the map for weapons.
(1:16:27) Demos Are Good — Track 2: They definitely seem to have made games that...
(1:16:28) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Alright, that is, that is, I was expecting, I was sorry, I think you were saying like,
(1:16:33) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Bonsai, Essen, Bonsai Tree Royale, and I was like, is this just like, trying to grow
(1:16:37) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Bonsai Trees in a computer?
(1:16:38) Demos Are Good — Track 2: No, I think, yeah, no, it's not that, but I think that's where they're trying,
(1:16:43) Demos Are Good — Track 2: they're using the same word deliberately, because the whole point of Ponzai is like cutting it,
(1:16:49) Demos Are Good — Track 2: right, in specific ways to shape it in a specific way. I suspect that's what they're doing here,
(1:16:53) Demos Are Good — Track 2: is that it's focused on swords and focused on cutting people down. I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking it. Yeah, it's not their first game. They have successfully created games that have
(1:17:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: positive reviews in the case of Lancelot and positive review case of Bonzai. Oh, it's not Bonzai,
(1:17:13) Demos Are Good — Track 2: it's Banzai Royale. God, I'm an idiot.
(1:17:16) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Yeah, but that's why we love you.
(1:17:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Okay, I'll ask you the same question.
(1:17:22) Demos Are Good — Track 3: What's the one thing that people should take away from the demo of Overthrown?
(1:17:26) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I think if you are, if you enjoy 3D action adventure games, but you feel like none of them are doing interesting things, this is the one that's at least trying to do something interesting.
(1:17:41) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And even if it ends up failing, the industry as a whole could learn a lot.
(1:17:46) Demos Are Good — Track 2: So I'd say at least go try the demo because I feel like there's something.
(1:17:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: It'll be interesting to see what comes of this, either of these because, well...
(1:17:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Southfield got delayed.
(1:18:01) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I guess a lot of your frontiers are doing all right, right? They're keeping good, yeah.
(1:18:04) Demos Are Good — Track 3: They're putting out stuff.
(1:18:07) Demos Are Good — Track 2: All right, well, thank you for joining me to talk about our October 2024 demos episode.
(1:18:15) Demos Are Good — Track 2: See how many more we can get of this.
(1:18:17) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Look, I think it's always fun, and I kind of feel like in the last sort of couple of years the return to demos, I much prefer demos to Early Access, and like the Luma Island one,
(1:18:29) Demos Are Good — Track 3: like it did what a demo was supposed to do. It gave me a taste of the game, it got me excited,
(1:18:33) Demos Are Good — Track 3: and now I'm going to buy this game. And it was not even on my radar before else just did we do this episode. So, you know, like, maybe that's the other thing to take away,
(1:18:43) Demos Are Good — Track 3: is like demos are good. Early access is
(1:18:47) Demos Are Good — Track 3: bad.
(1:18:48) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I'm not sure if that's my takeaway, but I'm sure it is.
(1:18:53) Demos Are Good — Track 3: It's my takeaway because the Little Island didn't do an early access. I'm liking these days for Little Island more and more and more. They just they just understand how things are supposed to work in the world.
(1:18:58) Demos Are Good — Track 2: You mean they agree with you?
(1:19:07) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Correct! Thanks!
(1:19:08) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Alright well, on that note, thank you Johnny for joining me.
(1:19:15) Demos Are Good — Track 2: What do you want to tell people?
(1:19:17) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Look, as always we love to hear from
(1:19:20) Demos Are Good — Track 3: listeners whether that's sending an email
(1:19:24) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I will give the email address. I don't remember it, but you can't. There is a form on the website at harvestseason.club that you can use to give us feedback.
(1:19:31) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Ask a question and if you want to provide a bit of extra support patreon.com/thspod. You can join us like and talk about all of these games. Talk about Pokemon Pocket, I guess. Talk about Luma Island because
(1:19:47) Demos Are Good — Track 3: when it comes out like and it comes out of really convenient time. I go on holiday for a bit over a week and I come back and then like two days later Luma Island comes out. So like I mean the dance just really nailed it. They're really nailed it.
(1:19:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: I don't think there is any, any convenient time for me for games coming out because it's just everything is too busy all the time now, yeah, cool, yeah, people can find me as at the Scott bot on mastodon.scot, you can find the podcast on tumblr as @thspod, you can
(1:20:12) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Where can people find your needs?
(1:20:27) Demos Are Good — Track 2: see my website @harvisseason.club where you will also find links to everything we talk about and a link to our Patreon as Johnny mentioned, yeah, I think that's everything,
(1:20:40) Demos Are Good — Track 2: oh yeah, no, if you do come into the slack, tell us what game you have been playing from the next fest, Steam next fest, because there's lots, so what have you been playing, listener?
(1:20:51) Demos Are Good — Track 2: Alright, thank you Johnny again for joining me.
(1:20:54) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Thanks all. (laughs)
(1:20:57) Demos Are Good — Track 2: And until next time, have a good harvest!
(1:20:59) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Have a good harvest.
(1:21:02) Demos Are Good — Track 1: The harvest season is created by Al McKinley, with support from our patrons, including our pro farmers, Kevin, Stuart, and Alisa.
(1:21:03) Demos Are Good — Track 3: Ooh.
(1:21:15) Demos Are Good — Track 1: Our art is done by Mike of the Brave, and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
(1:21:19) Demos Are Good — Track 1: Feel free to visit our website, harvestseason.club for show notes and links to things we discussed in this episode.
(1:21:34) Demos Are Good — Track 3: I don't know how we managed to turn the friggin' Sunhaven nothingness into like a 15 minute conversation.
