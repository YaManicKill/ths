# Transcript

(0:00:30) Kev: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Kevin
(0:00:36) Codey: and my name is Cody.
(0:00:38) Kev: And we are here to talk about cottagecore games whoo
(0:00:44) Codey: are we here to talk about cozy games I just wanted to to trigger al a little bit
(0:00:46) Kev: I hope not
(0:00:52) Kev: I'm triggered
(0:00:54) Kev: Doesn't sound like coat. It doesn't sound like a cozy game from what you've described sounds like an addiction
(0:01:00) Kev: Stop welcome
(0:01:02) Codey: a plague that needs to be released
(0:01:04) Kev: Welcome to the the township intervention of podie today everyone
(0:01:10) Codey: yeah for sure
(0:01:14) Codey: I played Township, and when we needed a topic on a dime, I was like, "Can we please cover this game so I can uninstall it?"
(0:01:25) Kev: Yeah, I mean, yeah, oh, yeah
(0:01:28) Kev: if people only knew like it was like I
(0:01:33) Kev: Mean first of all, I guess supposed to do an episode out and we had a pivot like twice and then he grew sick
(0:01:39) Kev: It's how the Cody had to join and then we had to pivot with that
(0:01:41) Codey: He was very ill, yeah.
(0:01:44) Codey: Oh yeah, we had to pivot.
(0:01:45) Codey: I had a small breakdown because of personal reasons,
(0:01:49) Codey: but I am here and I am queer.
(0:01:50) Kev: >> Yeah. Yeah, we'll get to there after we talk about.
(0:01:53) Codey: Okay, so township episode, that's what today is.
(0:01:58) Codey: And that's what today is.
(0:02:08) Kev: I don't I don't know if I'll even I don't recall if I'll says it but we've got the you know how it works folks
(0:02:14) Kev: We got the show notes. You got the transcript on the website all those good things
(0:02:18) Kev: And speaking of good things. Hopefully what have you been up to Cody?
(0:02:18) Codey: yeah. I have been getting healing from tearing my calf muscle. Yeah so I tore
(0:02:30) Kev: Oh, oh, that's not great.
(0:02:34) Codey: my calf muscle. It is, at least it wasn't the Achilles. We initially thought it was
(0:02:41) Codey: the Achilles but it was not that. So tore that and then...
(0:02:48) Codey: I am in physical therapy now and it's honestly already so much better so it did
(0:02:52) Codey: not it did not slow me down y'all. Last week, sorry what? I tried to run for four
(0:02:54) Kev: That's great. How did the tearing occur?
(0:03:01) Codey: whole seconds. I ran for four seconds and I tore my calf muscle. And this kids is
(0:03:08) Kev: just
(0:03:09) Kev: immediate collapse
(0:03:10) Codey: why you don't exercise. No. I am a super clumsy human and super oxidized.
(0:03:11) Kev: But.
(0:03:18) Codey: I had a mini meltdown because I did not want to go through that again but it was
(0:03:32) Codey: not it is thankfully not that it was just a calf muscle and it cannot keep me
(0:03:36) Codey: down. I am already out of the boot. I'm already doing stuff though the the
(0:03:40) Kev: Yeah, that's great.
(0:03:42) Codey: physical therapist today had me do lunges for a whole minute and I had to
(0:03:48) Codey: go. I kept trying to go and she was like girl no you're done like stop she's
(0:03:53) Kev: I'm going to tear it again.
(0:03:53) Codey: like yeah basically she's like you're pushing yourself too hard and I was like
(0:03:58) Codey: I should be able to do this and she was like girl no to come back next week. They
(0:04:04) Kev: Silence.
(0:04:04) Codey: love me there because they know me if they remember me from my ACL tear and
(0:04:08) Codey: how like they would say like okay you can stop at 10 and I'd be like I'm gonna
(0:04:14) Codey: to do 20, or like they would put
(0:04:18) Codey: the weight on like 30 pounds or something.
(0:04:20) Codey: And then they'd come back and they were like, did you make,
(0:04:22) Codey: did you up the weight?
(0:04:23) Codey: And I was like, 30 was too light.
(0:04:26) Codey: I wanted 40.
(0:04:30) Codey: So they're, they're very aware that they need to like reel me in.
(0:04:34) Codey: Um, so that was the big thing two weeks ago.
(0:04:37) Codey: And then last week I was at the B lab down in Maryland.
(0:04:42) Codey: So there's a gentleman down there who is the B God of the East coast.
(0:04:48) Codey: And pretty much any B and he can identify it for you and tell you all about its
(0:04:50) Kev: Yeah, I remember we talked about this
(0:04:51) Codey: national history. Yeah, he is amazing and he's so sweet.
(0:04:54) Codey: And so we went down to have him identify some of our bees. Um, and I,
(0:04:59) Codey: and when we go down,
(0:05:00) Codey: he doesn't accept payment because he's he works for the government.
(0:05:04) Codey: So he like can't accept payment and he also can't be on
(0:05:09) Codey: like a, he can't be an author on papers. It's like too difficult for him.
(0:05:13) Codey: He doesn't want to. So usually when we go down to do stuff like that,
(0:05:18) Codey: and he identifies things for us, we just do things for them.
(0:05:21) Codey: So they basically had a bunch of bees that needed to be organized.
(0:05:24) Codey: So we did that. It was very interesting. Unfortunately,
(0:05:27) Codey: he got COVID very quickly into us being there while we were there.
(0:05:32) Codey: He liked by the second day, he was very ill.
(0:05:36) Codey: So we didn't see him anymore.
(0:05:37) Codey: And he still has our bees because he was not able to do them.
(0:05:41) Codey: And I hope honestly that he as well, I actually have not asked for an update.
(0:05:45) Kev: Wop wop, that's rough.
(0:05:46) Codey: I need to do that.
(0:05:48) Codey: But I mean, we still did our part and so now we're just waiting and now I'm
(0:05:53) Codey: back and I am ready to hit the ground running with my research and stuff and
(0:05:58) Codey: continuing to play Coral Island. Yeah, no, I'm not. I'm not gonna run literally for
(0:06:00) Kev: Figuratively, please don't run from the literally
(0:06:05) Codey: a while. Still playing Coral Island and I am now, I have upgraded my home to the
(0:06:14) Codey: max level. And I am I have proposed
(0:06:18) Codey: to Scott once. Um, and he said no. So he said no. So I tried to propose to him one
(0:06:22) Kev: Wait, they can say "no"?
(0:06:25) Kev: Whoa.
(0:06:28) Codey: day and he was in the thing was like, your house is in big enough. And so I was like,
(0:06:31) Codey: okay, so I went and like updated my house. No, no, no, no. No, I upgraded my house and
(0:06:32) Kev: Oh, that's why. Oh, that's how it is.
(0:06:36) Codey: then I went back and he was like, you know, I'm just not ready to take that next step
(0:06:39) Codey: with you. And I'm like, boy, you have 10, we have 10 hearts. Like I don't know what
(0:06:46) Codey: you want.
(0:06:48) Codey: I tried to give him the diamond and everything and the diamond ring and he was just like "Nah."
(0:06:54) Codey: So I don't know if there's this magical other thing that happens or something.
(0:06:58) Codey: So I'm just still throwing fossils at him and hugging him whenever I can and taking him on dates.
(0:07:04) Kev: is diamond to your face!
(0:07:08) Codey: I don't know if I have to ask him at a certain point because then I went to the cavern recently and he was there.
(0:07:16) Codey: And he was just like I...
(0:07:18) Codey: just I always feel like magical when you're here in the cavern with me and I
(0:07:21) Codey: was like oh am I supposed to propose to you in the cavern so or or maybe in the
(0:07:25) Kev: Oh? Oh?
(0:07:27) Codey: museum I don't know maybe he just didn't want it under that tree with the doctor
(0:07:31) Codey: watching so
(0:07:32) Kev: you know what that would be that would be that's actually kind of cool if it's
(0:07:36) Codey: a little awkward
(0:07:39) Kev: like a location requirement or whatever right to be meaningful or special
(0:07:41) Codey: yeah oh and I have also made it to the Savannah now
(0:07:48) Codey: but fun fact you make it to the Savannah and then before you can enter the cave
(0:07:53) Codey: of memories you actually have to like do another thing so I'm just perpetually
(0:08:02) Codey: fighting these quests and these thresholds but I'm gonna get there I'm
(0:08:06) Codey: still motivated to get there I'm still enjoying myself what about you Kev so
(0:08:12) Kev: Sick what wait? I'm just think what it what is
(0:08:18) Codey: memories there's a couple other animals that unlock once you get to the Savannah
(0:08:23) Codey: there was like ostriches there and there's like some kind of kind of
(0:08:26) Codey: buffalo and some other stuff I don't know if you have to go to a certain
(0:08:29) Codey: person there's not a map and the fun thing about the cloud gaming servers is
(0:08:40) Codey: sometimes if you do too much in a day it it protests and it just erases all of
(0:08:48) Codey: the progress for the day so I have lost I've like and usually I'll play for like
(0:08:49) Kev: Oh, that's great.
(0:08:55) Codey: an hour hour and a half and then I hit the point where it like I it's like
(0:08:59) Codey: saving the game day or whatever and it says saving game and then it just like
(0:09:04) Codey: shuts down and is like lost connection to the server and then when I start it
(0:09:08) Codey: back up it just goes straight to the like loading up and it has to it starts
(0:09:14) Codey: the day all over. So whenever, whenever I do something new
(0:09:18) Codey: I usually like go like with the Savannah. I went to the
(0:09:22) Codey: Savannah. I like progressed the quest for the Giants and then I
(0:09:27) Codey: was like, this is not I like basically stood on the cliff
(0:09:30) Codey: overseeing the Savannah and I was like, oh, this looks really
(0:09:32) Codey: nice and then I went home and ended the day at 7 AM because I
(0:09:36) Kev: Ha ha ha ha!
(0:09:37) Codey: was like, I don't want to do anything else today. I just
(0:09:41) Kev: Sick.
(0:09:43) Codey: want this to make sure that it saves the fact that I got to
(0:09:46) Codey: to the Savannah.
(0:09:48) Codey: Man, I have not attempted that, maybe I can, maybe I should try that, but I just always
(0:09:50) Kev: Can you not save without the sleeping part?
(0:10:01) Codey: go home and sleep.
(0:10:03) Codey: I'm also at the point where, sorry this is suddenly coral island cast, I'm at the point
(0:10:09) Codey: where I have the computer and all of the upgrades and so I can look whenever there's, I can
(0:10:13) Codey: look and see what insects are spawning, what critter ocean critters are spawning, and what
(0:10:18) Codey: I don't have in the museum, I can find it, but I'm in the middle of Spermanir, the end
(0:10:24) Codey: of spring now I guess, and I've caught all of the spring stuff.
(0:10:28) Codey: So I am kind of like almost at the point literally of just like starting the game, ending the
(0:10:33) Codey: day.
(0:10:34) Codey: Starting the day, ending the day to like get through spring because I just want to be in
(0:10:36) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:10:38) Codey: summer so I can start getting the summer stuff.
(0:10:42) Kev: Mm-hmm can't can't change that DS clock. Oh, I know crossing
(0:10:46) Codey: No, I'm not going to do that, I would just start day and do.
(0:10:51) Kev: Yeah, oh man good times good times
(0:10:54) Codey: But what are you up to?
(0:10:57) Kev: Oh
(0:10:58) Kev: for
(0:11:00) Kev: I actually I was somewhat ill last week and I just
(0:11:06) Kev: You may hear me coughing due to it, but just a heads up for folks
(0:11:11) Kev: Thank you bees. I consumed much honey during the recovery period so you know they helped
(0:11:18) Kev: As I am
(0:11:19) Kev: These cool
(0:11:21) Kev: But when I do game the brief moments, I mean it's it's all
(0:11:26) Kev: Right now. I'm in a very much like
(0:11:29) Kev: I'm doing my dailies sort of thing for different games right like I'm not I
(0:11:34) Kev: I don't have... I think mostly the
(0:11:36) Kev: time I would say to dedicate to a big
(0:11:39) Kev: venture trying to clear stuff or
(0:11:41) Kev: whatever so a lot of grindy mindless
(0:11:44) Kev: stuff that's fun for me right that's
(0:11:47) Kev: stuff like Marvel snap Pokemon unite
(0:11:51) Kev: probably the biggest time sink is still
(0:11:54) Kev: zenless zone zero are you familiar with
(0:11:57) Kev: that one Cody okay so well I think I'll
(0:11:58) Codey: I am not, what is that?
(0:12:02) Kev: talk about it here but brief recap for
(0:12:07) Kev: it is a mi hoyo game which is the
(0:12:09) Kev: genshin impact company so it is it is a
(0:12:14) Kev: gotcha game much like genshin impact
(0:12:17) Kev: and their other one honkai but this one
(0:12:20) Kev: is a while genshin is kind of like
(0:12:22) Kev: breath of the wild the honkai is a turn
(0:12:25) Kev: based RPG sort of thing this one is more
(0:12:28) Kev: character actually bashing stuff buttons
(0:12:31) Kev: to beat up bad guys real-time that sort
(0:12:34) Kev: thing.
(0:12:35) Kev: It is a...
(0:12:35) Kev: Um, it is uh...
(0:12:37) Kev: It's a very stylish and fun game, um, it's also very heavy on the lore and the world, building a whole bunch of nonsense.
(0:12:47) Kev: Basically, they live in a world where there's just space-time distortions that'll just pop up everywhere, and people turn into monsters in them.
(0:12:56) Kev: And so, yeah, people trying to navigate life, that kind of risk around the corner, um, where it could just pop up anywhere and you can turn into a monster.
(0:13:07) Kev: But, uh, yeah, that's uh, they- that's what I've been up to, I'm caught up with the story, it's a relatively new game, it's only started in the summer, so it's only up to like the 4th chapter right now.
(0:13:21) Kev: Um, and so, you know, each chapter you get a different crew that you can play as, they'll give you trials, and then- or, you know, trial usages, and then later you can pull for them as part of the gacha or whatever, right?
(0:13:33) Kev: And so there's different factions and whatnot.
(0:13:36) Kev: You have this fancy butler group, they call themselves a housekeeping group, but they're really fun, so on and so forth.
(0:13:48) Kev: There's animal people in this world too, like it can vary from your typical cat boy/girl to full on wolf furry or just a bear.
(0:13:58) Kev: You can play as just a bear guy. He's Ben, I love him, he's an accountant.
(0:14:00) Codey: Oh my gosh.
(0:14:02) Kev: Um, yep, um, the game
(0:14:06) Kev: is quite uh because if it's a bacha daily nature they fill it up with all
(0:14:14) Kev: sorts of extra content lots of little minigame events and things like that to
(0:14:18) Kev: keep you busy there was an event where I ran a restaurant for a little bit there
(0:14:23) Kev: was there there's an arcade with in-depth minigames that have sucked me
(0:14:28) Kev: in lately and so on and so forth um but yeah so that's one of my go-tos that I
(0:14:33) Kev: just grind through and enjoy.
(0:14:36) Kev: Mahoyo games are more or less designed to be on anything, including mobile.
(0:14:46) Kev: This game will run on a strong enough phone or whatever.
(0:14:50) Kev: I play on the Playstation, but it's cross save and whatever, so you can play pretty much wherever.
(0:14:58) Kev: I don't think it's on the Switch that might be the only one it's not on because they don't have Mahoyo games on the Switch.
(0:15:04) Kev: Other than that, it's on pretty much anything.
(0:15:06) Kev: Uh, um, nah, so that's roughly what I've been up to, like I said, just very zen me time, uh, no pun intended with the name there, but uh, but yeah, that's roughly what I've been up to.
(0:15:20) Kev: Um, oh, oh, no, there is one other thing, actually, just this past week.
(0:15:26) Kev: Um, art, uh, so, oh gosh, I haven't actually posted on, like, art account yet, but it is, uh, uh, Inktober or, you know, uh, League of Legends.
(0:15:36) Kev: Inktober since that one's taken and actually there's this one guy who
(0:15:43) Kev: organizes thing for pixel artists specifically in September since I
(0:15:48) Kev: forgot about it last month I'm doing it this month and the theme is a quite fun
(0:15:52) Kev: one it's a monster maker not like a universal spooky monsters but as in
(0:16:08) Kev: I put it on the Slack where we hang out with friends,
(0:16:14) Kev: but I'll be posting it soon on my art account.
(0:16:17) Kev: I'll be able to get that going.
(0:16:19) Kev: So that's certainly been fun.
(0:16:22) Kev: But yeah, that's roughly what I've been up to.
(0:16:26) Kev: There we go.
(0:16:27) Kev: All right.
(0:16:28) Kev: Now let's see what the world of Cottagecore has been up to,
(0:16:31) Kev: shall we?
(0:16:32) Codey: world of cozy.
(0:16:33) Kev: So unfortunately, let's go.
(0:16:39) Kev: All right.
(0:16:40) Kev: First, let's talk about cozy researching,
(0:16:44) Kev: because Research Story has an update.
(0:16:48) Kev: I only had 0.10 update.
(0:16:50) Kev: That's-- no, I thought they were farther in.
(0:16:52) Kev: OK.
(0:16:54) Kev: The cosmetic things, some small fixes.
(0:16:59) Kev: But the next update, 0.11, will be a bigger one
(0:17:04) Kev: that they're hoping to complete by the end of the year, which
(0:17:07) Kev: will include.
(0:17:08) Kev: All NPC orange heart events, like similar to their dating stuff, the greenhouse, not
(0:17:13) Kev: our premium show, but probably farming ad nauseam, uh, house upgrade 2, and, oh good,
(0:17:21) Kev: gosh, timbers, we're variant creatures, what, oh, you know how, you know how, you know how
(0:17:24) Codey: Shinies
(0:17:29) Codey: Your shiny shiny research story Pokemon
(0:17:33) Kev: every farming game doesn't have to have romance, so guys, every, mmm, mmm, oh come on, d-
(0:17:38) Codey: creature collector.
(0:17:38) Kev: does not need, does not need SHINEEES, if it does it, it's-
(0:17:44) Codey: I will say though that in the real real every now and then I do see like an actual shiny like
(0:17:50) Kev: Yeah, sure.
(0:17:52) Codey: Pokemon quote-unquote Pokemon like wild wildlife like every now and then at the Wildlife Center will get like an all-black
(0:17:59) Codey: squirrel or an all-white raven
(0:18:02) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I mean yeah for sure that right absolutely right like I mean I'll buy noism
(0:18:03) Codey: Yeah, and so they basically are like real-world shinies, but they do
(0:18:11) Kev: Right like is the you know poster child for real life change, but even other odd color parents
(0:18:13) Codey: Yeah, it's albanism, albinism and melanism are the two.
(0:18:18) Codey: So melanism is when things are darker and albinism.
(0:18:20) Kev: Ah, I didn't realize
(0:18:21) Codey: Oh, and then leucistic is another thing.
(0:18:25) Codey: It's not, it's like albinism, but it's not as intense.
(0:18:30) Codey: Like leucistic things will usually only have
(0:18:32) Codey: either part of the like skin won't be,
(0:18:37) Codey: or like the fur or feathers.
(0:18:40) Codey: So it won't be all of them that are lighter colored,
(0:18:42) Codey: but they also do not.
(0:18:43) Codey: have the red eyes so albinism is like an entire lack of anything and so they
(0:18:48) Kev: Right, right
(0:18:50) Codey: don't even have eye color so it's just like red but so yeah there's actually a
(0:18:53) Kev: You right
(0:18:55) Kev: Okay
(0:18:57) Kev: Okay
(0:18:57) Codey: secret third thing.
(0:18:59) Kev: The secret third shiny very that's that'll save Pokemon go. Um, I
(0:19:03) Codey: Leucistic. So yeah.
(0:19:06) Kev: Yeah, I'm looking at the pictures right now. Okay, I see there's obviously no albinism with the the total lack of
(0:19:12) Kev: Pigmentation you can see the red shows up because of the blood vessels and all that right
(0:19:16) Codey: Yep, yep
(0:19:17) Kev: But yeah, I'm seeing these are
(0:19:18) Kev: Some of these are just like white animals, but like look more normal. Yeah, I'm more shiny variance. That's really cool
(0:19:20) Codey: Yep
(0:19:23) Codey: Yes, those would be leucistic so so I will say so so if they do exist
(0:19:28) Codey: They're not it's not shiny
(0:19:30) Codey: But the calling it the shimmers. I think is where we're like, okay, come on
(0:19:33) Kev: Mhmm.
(0:19:36) Codey: I really am sorry. (laughs)
(0:19:37) Kev: So...
(0:19:38) Kev: See...
(0:19:39) Kev: We're a game called "Research Story".
(0:19:41) Kev: It would be co-
(0:19:42) Kev: I would be...
(0:19:43) Kev: Have the TOTALLY opposite reaction if they just went by these actual names, right?
(0:19:48) Codey: Yeah, like find the loose the leucistic variant, the
(0:19:48) Kev: Like...
(0:19:48) Kev: Th-that would be so dope.
(0:19:51) Kev: Yeah.
(0:19:52) Kev: That would be so dope.
(0:19:54) Codey: dude, so super zoo story should do that because it's a wildlife
(0:19:57) Codey: thing. Because so oftentimes melanistic or leucistic animals
(0:20:03) Codey: depending on their habitat, like, it can really reduce their
(0:20:07) Codey: ability to survive in the wild. And so some of them, like some
(0:20:10) Codey: leucistic, like, if we get a super leucistic animal, like we
(0:20:15) Codey: are a leucistic groundhog that was just
(0:20:18) Codey: white like a white groundhog that thing's not going to survive so we don't end up releasing
(0:20:18) Kev: Yeah.
(0:20:24) Codey: those um melanism it depends so like we get melanistic squirrels all the time and we just
(0:20:30) Codey: they're fine and it's a recessive trait so if you put we always release them on the property because
(0:20:30) Kev: Yeah, sure.
(0:20:36) Codey: then they'll produce more melanistic squirrels with the melanistic population we already have
(0:20:42) Kev: Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, that definitely sounds like a win-win, because yeah, if you're, you know, like a white, like, literal walking target, um, yeah, and so you can hang out in a zoo and be a cool thing that people are gonna want to see.
(0:20:52) Codey: Yeah, a hundred percent.
(0:20:58) Kev: Yeah, no, that, that, uh, that seems like a win-win to keep those.
(0:21:02) Kev: Um, oh, man.
(0:21:02) Codey: Yeah.
(0:21:06) Kev: Oh, you got small tangents around wildlife talk. I saw, where did they go? Katie? Katie did?
(0:21:12) Codey: A katydid!
(0:21:12) Kev: Those are the, yes, I saw one for the first time the other day outside. Um, the mmm, those are so cool.
(0:21:18) Codey: Yeah, so you
(0:21:20) Codey: Yeah, you can hear them. Um, I mean they're basically nighttime crickets, right? So like crickets usually will chirp
(0:21:28) Codey: um
(0:21:29) Codey: during either dawn or dusk
(0:21:31) Codey: Um, but katydids do it at night
(0:21:34) Codey: And so they make and they're called katydids because they sound like they're saying katydid katydid katydid like whatever
(0:21:40) Kev: Just like Pokemon!
(0:21:41) Codey: Just like Pokemon.
(0:21:42) Codey: And there's some really cool ones we I actually saw one so they're usually herbivorous so they
(0:21:47) Codey: eat like plant material because they're basically they're kind of like a grass they're super related
(0:21:51) Codey: to grasshoppers and crickets but there is one that's a predator it's just a leaf with yeah they
(0:21:52) Kev: Yeah, it's just a leaf with a grasshopper head, that's all it looks like.
(0:21:58) Codey: do mimic leaves to like not getting um but I did see one in Costa Rica that was predatory
(0:22:06) Codey: so it mimics leaves and it actually eats other things and it was on this it was eating beetle
(0:22:06) Kev: Oh, oh dang.
(0:22:12) Codey: on this one it was really cool and they are pretty they're they don't they are not
(0:22:17) Codey: predatory very often so it was really cool to see that
(0:22:22) Kev: - Yeah, no, that would be fascinating.
(0:22:28) Codey: Yeah
(0:22:30) Codey: It's basically yeah
(0:22:32) Codey: It's basically like if you saw it if you found a cow in the wild and then the cow like ate like I guess
(0:22:38) Codey: Well, so bird cows will cows and deer and everything they'll eat birds
(0:22:44) Codey: If they find like if they find baby bird a baby bird nest, they'll eat them
(0:22:44) Kev: they were really huh I hadn't
(0:22:50) Codey: They yeah nature is wild
(0:22:54) Kev: what's that family guy clip are you scary
(0:22:58) Codey: Yeah, nature is scary, 100%.
(0:23:02) Codey: Things do whatever they need to do.
(0:23:06) Kev: hey that's my pink sorry i'm just google image searching I didn't know that that's so cool
(0:23:09) Codey: They can, there are some pink, pink kitty dead.
(0:23:11) Kev: Thanks for watching!
(0:23:12) Codey: There's some really cool butterflies that have pink,
(0:23:12) Kev: If you enjoyed this video, please subscribe and like!
(0:23:13) Kev: Thank you for watching!
(0:23:15) Codey: like pink edges on their wings and stuff too.
(0:23:20) Codey: More shimmer Pokemon like it, or not Pokemon,
(0:23:22) Kev: Yeah
(0:23:23) Codey: life like in research story but
(0:23:24) Kev: But the real ones dude do the real ones at least that's research story
(0:23:32) Kev: Look if it to me and Cody, there's a good chance we'll get into wildlife talk
(0:23:36) Codey: Tangents!
(0:23:40) Kev: She lives in it by her profession I live in it by my where I live
(0:23:47) Kev: Okay, so that is research story again the original thing that
(0:23:58) Kev: check the link it'll be in the show notes um speaking of updates that are
(0:24:02) Kev: out now Horticular our gnome game has an update um boy I don't remember
(0:24:18) Kev: So it focuses largely on community feedback with huge changes to how you can build and manage your habitats in your garden
(0:24:27) Kev: because being the premise of the game is you're a bunch of gnomes trying to restore a garden.
(0:24:33) Kev: So yeah, there's a pretty decent size, right? Like it's 1.1.
(0:24:43) Kev: A lot of UI stuff and how the creatures will interact with you.
(0:24:47) Kev: Thank you.
(0:24:48) Kev: There's a pretty decently sized changelog to describe it, but I do appreciate the response, basically, because it's all community feedback, so this sounds like a really nifty feature.
(0:25:02) Kev: Good for them.
(0:25:04) Kev: Apparently, one of the big things is creatures will let you know earlier if they don't like their habitat.
(0:25:12) Kev: And so on to it.
(0:25:12) Codey: Yeah, so apparently before, like they would just move.
(0:25:15) Codey: And so you would just like, you'd be like,
(0:25:17) Codey: where did they go?
(0:25:18) Codey: Um, but now they'll let you know earlier.
(0:25:19) Kev: It's like Animal Crossing.
(0:25:22) Codey: Yeah, you see, you see your person,
(0:25:26) Codey: instead of just like them being gone,
(0:25:27) Codey: you actually get to see them walking around
(0:25:29) Codey: with a thought bubble now.
(0:25:30) Codey: I'd be like, no, what are you, what do you want?
(0:25:30) Kev: Oh, man
(0:25:34) Kev: The good old days of og Animal Crossing where Oh
(0:25:36) Codey: How, where you just got, you just got,
(0:25:38) Kev: Ah.
(0:25:40) Codey: you re-log.
(0:25:42) Codey: You re-logged on after you dropped it for a while and then your favorite villager is like gone and you re- just...
(0:25:44) Kev: Yup, yup, or if you play with friends the risk, the russian roulette that you lose your
(0:25:48) Codey: Just...
(0:25:52) Codey: Oh, yeah.
(0:25:54) Kev: neighbor to the wild times og in a crossing, why, oh my goodness, um so there you go.
(0:26:00) Codey: And then you gotta like...
(0:26:03) Codey: and then you never like that friend again because they stole...
(0:26:07) Codey: they stole blue bear from me.
(0:26:13) Kev: Um, so there you go. Horticular off faster response time than animal crossing. There you go folks
(0:26:20) Codey: Did you mention that it's 20% off on Steam until October 21st?
(0:26:24) Kev: Well, there you go
(0:26:25) Codey: There you go.
(0:26:27) Kev: All right
(0:26:28) Kev: Next up actually I think stay at the time of recording
(0:26:32) Kev: I think I saw like steams doing an animal fest thing that might be part of it
(0:26:38) Kev: So yeah, yeah, there's probably actually a handful of cottage core s similar
(0:26:43) Kev: Games on sale on that people might like so I suggest you guys hop on steam and check it out
(0:26:49) Kev: I really appreciate those themed weeks and and sales and whatnot
(0:26:55) Codey: My wallet doesn't appreciate them.
(0:26:56) Kev: Wow true true well, you're right. I appreciate in theory, but I can't partake in it right now
(0:27:03) Kev: - No, no.
(0:27:03) Codey: Yeah, no, I don't you like mentioned that it's on and I was that there's like that that sale and I'm like
(0:27:03) Kev: Yeah, um...
(0:27:09) Codey: I'm not looking I'm not gonna do it
(0:27:12) Kev: Don't look, don't look.
(0:27:16) Kev: Alright, next up we got my time at Sandrock. We got the 1.4 update dropping October 8th, which will already be out by the time you guys are listening to my voice, our voices.
(0:27:30) Kev: You unlock brand new host marriage quests for Justice. Oh, uh, Grace, she, P, I don't even know how to pronounce that, Logan.
(0:27:40) Kev: Emora Feng, Mian Nia, and Unseo.
(0:27:42) Kev: I appreciate doing stuff with your spouse. Hopefully.
(0:28:10) Codey: Yeah I am actually feeling related to that. I'm feeling bad about trying to get Scott to marry me
(0:28:16) Codey: because I don't want him to just lose his entire autonomy. So it is nice to like think of or that
(0:28:23) Codey: know that some games are giving them some form of after marriage life for sure.
(0:28:30) Kev: Yep, so yeah, that's one of the big things, but there's a handful of other things in the
(0:28:39) Kev: update, some Kickstarter designed stuff, including a new quest, some monsters, a bus system for
(0:28:51) Kev: start running from Porsche.
(0:28:52) Kev: I don't know what that means, but some home furniture stuff and so on and so forth.
(0:29:00) Kev: Yeah, all that is part of the free update.
(0:29:03) Kev: There is... let's see here... oh, new voice recordings, huh?
(0:29:08) Kev: I didn't know that.
(0:29:09) Kev: That's interesting.
(0:29:10) Kev: Yeah, again, that's all out, or should be up by the time you guys hear this.
(0:29:16) Kev: Yeah, so go check it out.
(0:29:17) Kev: Again, Steam page has all the details and whatnot.
(0:29:20) Kev: Also, my time at Evershine, geez Louise, Kickstarter's up to 1.8 million.
(0:29:28) Kev: Juh-m-million!
(0:29:30) Kev: Dollars with roughly two weeks to go as of this recording
(0:29:30) Codey: Yep.
(0:29:35) Codey: Yep.
(0:29:36) Kev: Okay, good for you, Evershine. They're they're out there. They're hustling
(0:29:37) Codey: Wild.
(0:29:41) Codey: They are...
(0:29:42) Kev: Alright
(0:29:44) Kev: speaking of
(0:29:45) Kev: Hustling question mark. I don't know because this feels like it should have been there already
(0:29:51) Kev: winds of Anthos a
(0:29:55) Kev: There's been a slight DLC delay. It'll be October 10
(0:30:00) Kev: Only a week late from the original date and again by the time you guys listen this will probably be out
(0:30:05) Kev: And that's you can camp wherever you are, which really feels like they should have been there at the beginning
(0:30:10) Codey: Yeah and you can like bring your pets camping with you and like all this other
(0:30:15) Codey: stuff it was it was a cute little sounding update and so yeah they just
(0:30:18) Kev: Yeah.
(0:30:20) Codey: they just gave it up an extra week to probably finish some stuff. You know I'm
(0:30:22) Kev: Can you make curry with your friends, though?
(0:30:25) Kev: Yeah.
(0:30:26) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:30:26) Codey: sick of making curry in games.
(0:30:30) Codey: I want to make macarons with my friends.
(0:30:35) Kev: Oh my- backgrounds are real hard to make, aren't they like-
(0:30:37) Codey: They are, yes, that's how you
(0:30:40) Codey: test a friendship for sure.
(0:30:42) Kev: Oh my- IRL over cooked the Macarons of Challenge.
(0:30:46) Codey: Oh gosh.
(0:30:47) Codey: Yeah.
(0:30:47) Codey: That's how that's going to be me and my boyfriend this upcoming weekend.
(0:30:51) Codey: He said that he's going to make macarons for this party we're going to.
(0:30:54) Codey: And he is of the mind that like, if it is at all, not incorrect, but like not
(0:31:00) Codey: to his standards, he just, he just tosses them and I'm like, they're still delicious.
(0:31:04) Kev: oh yes no no no yeah oh that's how you grow that's the training you gotta you
(0:31:05) Codey: They just didn't rise the way you wanted them to please let me eat them.
(0:31:09) Codey: And he's like, no!
(0:31:10) Codey: They're mediocre!
(0:31:12) Codey: I'm like, no!
(0:31:18) Kev: gotta take your licks and it's usually not as bad as you think as someone who
(0:31:20) Codey: No, dude, he's such a perfectionist.
(0:31:24) Codey: It's never as bad, yeah.
(0:31:24) Kev: likes to cook right like you're your own harshest critic
(0:31:27) Codey: It's never as bad.
(0:31:29) Codey: And we can just tell people I made them.
(0:31:31) Codey: I don't care.
(0:31:32) Codey: Like, if they look bad.
(0:31:34) Kev: >> They got damaged in transit.
(0:31:36) Codey: a couple of them lost their lives on
(0:31:38) Kev: No, there's no macarons in this update.
(0:31:45) Kev: But what there is, is something else people aren't probably sick of.
(0:31:49) Kev: Fish bow, Moonstone Island.
(0:31:52) Codey: ♪ Fish Bow ♪
(0:31:52) Kev: Continuing their tradition of crossing over with things and
(0:31:57) Kev: fish bowing everything, yeah, they crossed over the hills.
(0:31:59) Codey: Crossing over.
(0:32:04) Codey: No, do you know crossing over with John Edwards?
(0:32:07) Codey: Like, or whatever, whoever it was.
(0:32:09) Codey: It was this show.
(0:32:11) Codey: There was this guy who was a medium
(0:32:13) Codey: who would help people, quote unquote,
(0:32:16) Codey: help people talk to their loved one from beyond the grave.
(0:32:20) Codey: So, and that was called.
(0:32:22) Codey: He crossed he so like I'm like thinking about like fishboat like leading a séance like fishboat being the medium to like sorry I'm we're off the rails y'all yeah pretty much Jesus you call fishboat to talk to grandma and figure out where the treasure was buried
(0:32:34) Kev: Call California
(0:32:36) Kev: Fishbows to get guidance
(0:32:38) Kev: on your life and
(0:32:40) Kev: finances
(0:32:48) Kev: Sick, I'd be
(0:32:50) Kev: be down for that.
(0:32:52) Kev: I mean, you can have that idea and give us our medium... give us our psychic medium fish bow.
(0:32:55) Codey: Just free, just completely free.
(0:33:00) Kev: It wouldn't be outlandish. There are psychic types in that game.
(0:33:06) Codey: Dude, and he already looks like he already kind of has this like mystical look to him
(0:33:12) Kev: yeah just put on a hat on the bowl oh okay fish boat is coming to chloromon
(0:33:13) Codey: Just put on a hat yep, okay, but what about what about fish bow?
(0:33:22) Kev: which is another creature collector that I didn't really know existed until today
(0:33:27) Kev: but it has nice key art i'll say
(0:33:39) Kev: uh there's actually a few other ones including the standard avatar um the wizard guy forget his name
(0:33:44) Kev: and uh but yeah fish bow uh what what's interesting is so fish bow is is like the
(0:33:51) Kev: fish bow with legs but here it's a guy with the fish bow for the head um so you have full arms
(0:33:57) Kev: and everything um so yeah koromon that's only five dollars on steam right now um
(0:34:12) Kev: um so yes oh so yeah that's uh that's I think that's there's nothing I think actually in
(0:34:20) Kev: uh moonstone island in regard to this but they're just announcing that fun little crossover
(0:34:25) Kev: so go check out uh quorum on and get your your your fish bow for for you um okay speaking of
(0:34:33) Kev: things for you and by for you I mean for me and probably cody super zoo story the kickstarter is
(0:34:38) Codey: Whoo
(0:34:40) Kev: Now Live!
(0:34:42) Kev: So this is the game we've we've covered it before
(0:34:46) Kev: Actually, but it's a your
(0:34:50) Kev: Typical cottagecore farming thing, but it's focused on a zoo instead of a farm, right?
(0:34:55) Kev: Which is a cool concept in my opinion or fresh spin on it. Um
(0:35:00) Kev: The Kickstarter is now live. The goal has been crushed. We are at 60k. What was their original goal?
(0:35:09) Kev: or no
(0:35:12) Kev: The original goal was 60k. We're almost at 100k at the time of this recording. Um
(0:35:18) Kev: So, you know, it's it's going to be made theoretically
(0:35:24) Kev: Currently only on Steam, but there are going to be stretch goals
(0:35:30) Kev: When some which are we are they've already hit they're adding some
(0:35:34) Kev: extinct and rare animals
(0:35:37) Kev: We're getting the animal encyclopedia already. We are close to the bird aviary
(0:35:42) Kev: So we can house the birds and the insects. That's an important one. Go fund it guys. It's only like 4k more. Come on
(0:35:50) Kev: I want a two camp
(0:35:53) Kev: So there you go, so put that in there and there's several other
(0:35:58) Kev: stretch goals
(0:36:00) Kev: Consoles are pretty high up there. That'd be nice. But second island expansion. What does that mean?
(0:36:08) Kev: Yeah, so yeah go check it out um if you
(0:36:12) Kev: haven't seen it like the whole Kickstarter has you know all the
(0:36:15) Kev: details on the game um it looks pretty quality a lot of love in this one out of
(0:36:19) Kev: you know if it's going to be a Stardew like clone whatever um they are putting
(0:36:24) Kev: a lot of effort into the zoo aspect of it all the animals look really nice it
(0:36:28) Kev: looks like you know a lot of care and systems do that and of course you have
(0:36:34) Kev: all your relationships and romances and so on and so forth and there is farming
(0:36:39) Kev: of course. Festivals, all.
(0:36:42) Kev: All that good stuff.
(0:36:43) Kev: Oh, there's dinosaurs! That's already in there. Sick.
(0:36:48) Kev: Super Zoo Story. I'm already locked down. I'm going to get this one 100%.
(0:36:54) Codey: Yeah, so I'm I just figured out my Kickstarter I've been literally
(0:36:59) Kev: I'm looking down the list as well.
(0:37:04) Kev: It's...
(0:37:05) Codey: The whole time that you've been talking I've just been like trying to figure out my kickstarters
(0:37:12) Kev: All these are quite reasonable $35 the highest there's there's not the 2000. Oh wait, those are all gone. Never mind
(0:37:19) Kev: Oh wait, there they are. I was looking the wrong one. Oh, no, there it is. There's the three thousand one. Oh
(0:37:21) Codey: there we go. Okay, back. Back this project. Digital game key. Do I want to do I want beta
(0:37:23) Kev: My god. Oh, oh you can design your NPC for marriage
(0:37:29) Kev: You know if I had the money I'd love to do one of those one day just for the giggles
(0:37:33) Kev: Um.
(0:37:36) Codey: access? I don't think I do. I don't care about in game. I don't know. I'm just going to do
(0:37:46) Kev: Yeah, probably $20 usually a safe one to go with right that's usually play the game and stuff
(0:37:52) Codey: Uh, it needs my, oh, cool.
(0:37:54) Codey: Nevermind.
(0:37:54) Codey: My card is saved on this computer.
(0:37:55) Kev: Hey, that's your credits
(0:37:59) Kev: Yeah, yep, yep, so check it out folks if you have it, you know 3k just sitting around
(0:38:01) Codey: No, oops, that's not right.
(0:38:06) Kev: Drop it in and you know drop drop it in
(0:38:09) Codey: What 3k.
(0:38:10) Kev: Yeah to get to get to design an NPC for marriage candidate
(0:38:14) Kev: So, you know for the
(0:38:17) Kev: The sake of the podcast just just dropped 3k and you know, I could add fish bow in or or owl
(0:38:23) Codey: I did it! I pledged.
(0:38:24) Kev: You're pick
(0:38:26) Kev: There we go. One step closer to the bird sanctuary
(0:38:30) Kev: So this has 23 days to go grab a couple weeks, but don't forget
(0:38:34) Kev: I know everyone will forget and we'll remind you when it's about to end but check it out
(0:38:39) Kev: Back it looks like a great game
(0:38:42) Kev: Very excited for super-easy story
(0:38:43) Codey: I never I never back things. This is come on y'all join me
(0:38:47) Kev: >> Yeah, there you go.
(0:38:50) Codey: I want the console releases at 210. Okay, and we're almost at 100 we can do it. We got 26 days left. Oh
(0:38:56) Kev: We got extinct animals, but which extinct animals did they get the good ones?
(0:39:03) Codey: Yeah, let me look at that they had the list
(0:39:06) Kev: Holy Marsupial wolf, the quagga.
(0:39:10) Codey: Marsupial the marsupial wolf makes me
(0:39:13) Codey: super-sack because that like we still have pictures of it like like it became
(0:39:20) Codey: extinct so recently that we had photographs of it
(0:39:26) Kev: Moas? I'd like a moa.
(0:39:27) Codey: well it says they only list a couple what is a quagga oh it's
(0:39:32) Kev: Have you ever seen that show extinct or alive?
(0:39:37) Kev: No, so it's it's about a guy like I think he's the grandson of the guy who
(0:39:44) Kev: Hey, you like found the the modern-day coelacanth or whatever, right?
(0:39:48) Kev: So he's dedicated to conversation
(0:39:50) Kev: So the grandson's dedicated to conservation all that and he goes out and tries to find animals that are supposedly extinct to see if
(0:39:57) Kev: They're still out there, which is cool. Yeah
(0:39:58) Codey: Okay.
(0:40:00) Kev: Yeah.
(0:40:00) Codey: Wonder if there's an Ivory Build Woodpecker episode.
(0:40:03) Kev: I believe there is actually, yes.
(0:40:06) Codey: That was, that was drama.
(0:40:13) Kev: He actually has a pretty high success rate, all things considered.
(0:40:16) Codey: Well, yeah, I'm not gonna bring it up. Let's continue.
(0:40:21) Kev: I mean, yeah, all right, all right.
(0:40:24) Kev: But yeah, Super Zoo Story, you can enjoy extinct animals without all that drama,
(0:40:30) Kev: the Wooly Rhino or the
(0:40:32) Kev: the wolf okay I like in the notes even alcis my god is this game going to get me to kick start it
(0:40:41) Codey: No, no, so I wrote that, sorry I wrote that, and yeah it did.
(0:40:43) Kev: oh oh okay well there you go
(0:40:47) Codey: You started talking about it again, or you started talking about it and I was like, yeah.
(0:40:53) Kev: all right so that's all for the updates and such um let's talk about new game announcements um and
(0:41:00) Kev: And we're going to start off with one
(0:41:02) Kev: And here and dear to me in whether I want to or not genetically speaking gotcha on the grassland
(0:41:10) Kev: Where you play as a lot and cowboy in all caps per the steam page?
(0:41:12) Codey: Mmm.
(0:41:17) Kev: Where you farm the farm and there's adventures grasslands and of course highlands they have to be cozy
(0:41:24) Codey: They are cozy they are quoted as cozy
(0:41:26) Kev: Yup, yeah, so it's uh, I
(0:41:31) Kev: I will say despite, y'know, all-
(0:41:34) Kev: All the general, uh, or the usual, uh, descriptors, I think the game looks fun.
(0:41:39) Kev: Um, it's a 3D game, it has a very, sort of, cartoony art style to it, kinda reminds me of Fabledom, I would say.
(0:41:47) Kev: Um, you can feel the Latin influence, the music, uh, some of the character designs and architecture, stuff like that.
(0:41:55) Kev: Um...
(0:41:56) Codey: even if even if y'all aren't in the in the market for a new game go watch this
(0:42:02) Codey: trailer it slaps that music that me I was like dancing
(0:42:05) Kev: It's pretty good.
(0:42:09) Kev: It's got a pretty dang good soundtrack or, you know, demo music, whatever you wanna.
(0:42:15) Kev: Yeah, there's a fire horse. There's magical creatures. There is a Ponyta in this game.
(0:42:22) Kev: So yeah, that is Gaucho in the Grasslands.
(0:42:26) Kev: It looks very cool.
(0:42:27) Kev: "Relief date aiming for February 2025." Not terribly far away, to be quite frank.
(0:42:33) Kev: I highly suggest everyone check this out.
(0:42:35) Kev: I love the trailer, again, for nothing else for that sick, uh, music.
(0:42:39) Kev: Um, yeah, that looks great, um, uh, obviously heavy bias here for the Latin stuff, but, uh,
(0:42:46) Kev: you know, any sort of, you know, minority thing.
(0:42:47) Codey: also the the dog has a mustache and the dog also has like those like eye tufts that you he like
(0:42:51) Kev: Yeah.
(0:42:55) Kev: As, as is in Mexico, as,
(0:42:57) Codey: can't see he's just so cute
(0:43:02) Kev: is pretty good.
(0:43:04) Kev: It's the, um...
(0:43:06) Kev: Yeah, the, the, the...
(0:43:07) Kev: Yeah, everyone knows that design now. It's pretty popular these days.
(0:43:10) Kev: The thick eyebrows and the mustache.
(0:43:12) Codey: The thick eyebrows.
(0:43:14) Kev: That you can't...
(0:43:14) Kev: Yeah, it's good, good, good stuff.
(0:43:17) Kev: Um, looks very colorful.
(0:43:19) Kev: Very, very cool looking game.
(0:43:21) Kev: Uh, and if, say, you need more cowboy-ing,
(0:43:25) Kev: uh, you can also look at...
(0:43:27) Kev: Seattle County.
(0:43:29) Kev: Seattle Country!
(0:43:31) Kev: Uh, I'll read the blurb, um...
(0:43:58) Kev: Should I have read that in a, in a, in a western twang?
(0:44:00) Codey: Yeah, you should have you should have a hundred percent. Let's do it. Please do it again
(0:44:02) Kev: I can do it.
(0:44:05) Kev: It's like, oh, alright, here we go.
(0:44:07) Kev: Here, here you go, Al. Here's your editing work.
(0:44:09) Kev: Alright, so, uh, here's Cattle Country. I'll read the blurb here.
(0:44:13) Kev: Howdy, partner.
(0:44:15) Kev: Welcome to Cattle Country.
(0:44:17) Kev: The only cozy cowboy adventure life, Sim.
(0:44:20) Kev: The trauma-determined pioneer traveling west to start a new life.
(0:44:25) Kev: Make a home in the mountains.
(0:44:27) Kev: Take on bandits.
(0:44:29) Kev: Discover destiny plots.
(0:44:31) Kev: Build a farm.
(0:44:32) Kev: Develop your town.
(0:44:33) Kev: and make friends with
(0:44:34) Codey: I was not what I was expecting!
(0:44:42) Kev: nailed it.
(0:44:43) Codey: Nailed it.
(0:44:45) Codey: I want you to talk like that forever now.
(0:44:49) Codey: My dopamine just went through the roof.
(0:44:52) Codey: Also, if you are... the word cozy was said in a title, take a shot.
(0:45:00) Kev: Ugh, that's already two sh\*t.
(0:45:04) Codey: I love water.
(0:45:05) Codey: Take a shot of water.
(0:45:10) Kev: So this one, unlike Gasho and the Grasslands, is more Stardew-esque with your top-down-pixel-ish
(0:45:18) Kev: book.
(0:45:21) Kev: They do try to, you know, have that more pioneer Western-y.
(0:45:25) Kev: Not even Western, more pioneer I'd say, right, because when I think Western I think out in
(0:45:30) Kev: more desert-y with the tumbleweeds and whatnot.
(0:45:33) Kev: We got grassy areas, so they're more pioneer-y.
(0:45:36) Kev: But they got the music, they got some of the designs.
(0:45:41) Kev: All things considered, like, it does look fun, you got guns and you're pew-pewing at
(0:45:46) Kev: other cowboy guys, I guess.
(0:45:49) Kev: You got fishin', you've got top-and-trees, lumberjacks, houses riding a horsey, mining-
(0:45:57) Kev: although all of the usual, uh, fixings.
(0:45:59) Codey: Oh yeah, it takes some... ugh.
(0:46:01) Kev: Yup, there you go.
(0:46:04) Kev: Um, so that is, uh, and with an open beta coming October 25th.
(0:46:11) Kev: So get in the saddle.
(0:46:14) Kev: Um, and wishlist now.
(0:46:16) Kev: They should have, they should have hired me to do the western voiceover.
(0:46:20) Codey: They really should.
(0:46:21) Kev: Um, but yeah, no, uh, no, uh, actually.
(0:46:33) Kev: Um, there's a saloon. I mean of course there is. I like western cowboy motifs. I don't
(0:46:42) Kev: think they're leaning heavily enough into it actually. That's probably my biggest complaint.
(0:46:48) Kev: The color palette just should be more brown and orange and whatnot, but I digress. Yeah,
(0:46:55) Kev: check it out. It is one of those. Uh, all right, next up, uh, gone.
(0:47:02) Codey: they don't they don't have it in this one this upcoming one
(0:47:03) Kev: Well, actually I'm sure Cozy is, do they have Cozy in there? Oh, I don't know if they actually
(0:47:09) Kev: have Cozy. Nope, there's no Cozy, but they do have another hallmark of several cottage
(0:47:16) Kev: corgames as sexy fish people. Um, and we're talking about forgotten waters and underwater
(0:47:26) Kev: farm sim. Create your dream farm in an underwater world. Grow, build, and thrive under the
(0:47:34) Kev: sea. Um, so yeah, you play as a fish person, uh, with feet, no, no more tail or whatever.
(0:47:41) Kev: Um, think of like, uh, Luca. That's what I'm thinking of. Yassified Luca. With an octopus
(0:47:45) Codey: Yeah, okay, yep.
(0:47:48) Codey: Just fine.
(0:47:51) Kev: for hair. Like it's, it's like, it's literally just an octopus sitting on your head. That's,
(0:47:56) Codey: Yeah, it is
(0:47:57) Kev: that's, that's forming your dreamy locks. Um, so yeah, uh, you know, I digress.
(0:48:03) Kev: It is underwater largely, but I think you can go to the surface because you're having
(0:48:07) Kev: dinner with what looks like a regular human. Yep. So this is, this is just Luca, the, the,
(0:48:10) Codey: yeah at one point you're in like a tavern that is like doesn't seem like it's under the water
(0:48:15) Codey: looks like you're dating a land a lander lander land lover I don't know
(0:48:23) Kev: the game. It really is. Have you seen Luca? Oh, well, it's, uh, yeah, I enjoyed it. It's
(0:48:24) Codey: oh wow okay I have not you recommend it okay
(0:48:31) Kev: It's not bad, it's not, you know,
(0:48:33) Kev: not one of the top tier, but I enjoyed it for what it is. It's a fun.
(0:48:35) Codey: Right. I've been I've been making my way through them.
(0:48:40) Codey: I just saw Princess and the Frog for the first time like not too long ago so and that's been a while.
(0:48:42) Kev: Uh, that one's... Oh man. Like, that one's not stellar, but the fact that it's 2D makes
(0:48:53) Kev: it so much better. Oh yeah, oh no, Dr. Facilier is top tier, and his song is such a banger.
(0:48:54) Codey: Dude, but I I really liked that the villain and his songs they were
(0:49:04) Kev: Like holy mackerel. Oh my god, yeah, he is. He's fantastic building this song. Ah! Friends
(0:49:10) Codey: Yup.
(0:49:10) Kev: on the other side that's what you
(0:49:12) Codey: Oh, you're pretty.
(0:49:12) Kev: can have with you play for the other side so this is a Kickstarter on they
(0:49:16) Codey: 100%.
(0:49:22) Kev: have already they've just hit their goal of pen that's a little over 10,000
(0:49:29) Kev: almost at 11,000 about two weeks ago or at least time recording October 23rd so
(0:49:38) Kev: So wait, what?
(0:49:40) Kev: One of the stretch goals is the jellyfish will assist-
(0:49:42) Kev: I'm not sure if that guy in the bottom left, he's kinda got a lot of metal going on. He might be a robot man- I don't know.
(0:49:44) Codey: I I need to see that
(0:49:50) Codey: How do they do that I need to know
(0:50:01) Codey: question mark
(0:50:12) Codey: Okay
(0:50:12) Kev: Girl person, I don't know, Bernie.
(0:50:14) Kev: Oh man, they're running the gambit of fish people. We got one with no pupils, we got Amaya, we got- looks like just an air stewardess Lee.
(0:50:28) Kev: Okay, yeah, there you go. And all sorts of other characters. Yeah, there you go. There's all your attractive fish people and underwater crops.
(0:50:42) Codey: I like so from looking at the trailer I was like really not sure what they were
(0:50:42) Kev: What did I just date Sidon from Breath of the Wild? That's the ultimate one, really.
(0:50:53) Codey: going for but they say it for you they say quote inspired by beloved classics
(0:50:57) Codey: such as harvest moon rune factory and chrono trigger so that's that's what
(0:51:02) Codey: they're going for
(0:51:04) Kev: for auto triggers specific that's a good one too
(0:51:05) Codey: I that is very specific that is that is going back to nostalgia it combines
(0:51:12) Codey: farming resource management and combat to sustain the underwater town you must
(0:51:16) Codey: tend to the land sow seeds and nurture crops however you must safeguard against
(0:51:20) Codey: hostel sea creatures and lurking enemies in the depths
(0:51:25) Kev: Okay, so there's looks to be a little bit of creature East I'm well enough for monsters. I guess again chrono trigger, right?
(0:51:32) Kev: That's that's what it's all about
(0:51:35) Kev: Yeah, no, I mean they do have some fun monster design. So let's they have piqued my interest with
(0:51:42) Kev: With this chrono trigger thing because that's quite a call-out. You don't see very frequently in this sphere of the gaming world
(0:51:50) Kev: Yeah, check it out. That is again called forgotten waters
(0:51:54) Kev: It's already back
(0:51:55) Kev: So again theoretically it should happen, but it's Kickstarter so you know
(0:52:03) Kev: So there we go, that's uh, that's that's the news that's in all the new games
(0:52:05) Codey: that's that's the news.
(0:52:10) Kev: Alright and now we can dive on in and free Cody from
(0:52:18) Kev: From her chains
(0:52:20) Codey: Thank you.
(0:52:20) Kev: Tell us about townshades
(0:52:22) Codey: Okay, so I will take the reins.
(0:52:25) Codey: So this is one of those games,
(0:52:26) Codey: if you've played any game, period, that has ads,
(0:52:31) Codey: you have probably seen ads for Township.
(0:52:34) Kev: If you lived in face, if you touched Facebook in like the 2010 to 2015 years, you have seen this game.
(0:52:43) Codey: Yeah. So this game did just celebrate its election.
(0:52:46) Codey: year anniversary so it's only been around for 11 years. It is. So it's been around for a while.
(0:52:47) Kev: Right, it actually is from that era.
(0:52:51) Kev: I didn't know, I was kidding.
(0:52:55) Codey: And I basically think of this game as if FarmVille and Candy Crush had a baby. Because it has both of
(0:53:05) Codey: those mechanics and it kind of has like half and half. Like half the game is farming and it's part
(0:53:13) Codey: It's like the town part of it.
(0:53:16) Codey: Which is the Farm Bill part and then the other half is this like adventure side that is, it doesn't make sense as to why it's even happening.
(0:53:26) Codey: But, but you do it.
(0:53:29) Codey: Um, one thing, okay, I'm gonna crap on this game a lot.
(0:53:34) Codey: And, and I, spoiler, I'm not going to recommend it unless you really just do need your mind occupied at all times.
(0:53:44) Kev: I feel like there are better things to offer by your mind.
(0:53:44) Codey: times.
(0:53:47) Codey: There are better things, but this game is actually ad-free. I did not hit a single
(0:53:57) Codey: ad. It doesn't offer for you to watch ads to increase things or anything or to
(0:54:02) Codey: like decrease times. It just asks for the currencies. So that was pretty... I
(0:54:08) Codey: appreciated that. I appreciated that it was truly ad-free.
(0:54:14) Kev: That is wild, like even I'll play, like one of the games I play is called Battle Cats and it's not egregious, but you know, they always have the "hey watch your ad to get your free can of cat food" or whatever, so I'm shocked to hear that, that's wild.
(0:54:28) Codey: Yeah, yeah, I the game the biggest game mobile game that I play
(0:54:35) Codey: Consistently is actually a cross stitch one that I play with my grandma and we send photos back and forth
(0:54:42) Codey: So like if I take a really cute photo of like Stella, I'll send it as a cross stitch
(0:54:47) Codey: like
(0:54:48) Codey: puzzle for her to fill in
(0:54:50) Codey: and and she'll
(0:54:50) Kev: Oh, that's such a cool concept. I love that.
(0:54:52) Codey: Yeah, so you basically create a cross stitch with
(0:54:58) Codey: Like the app and then like a cross stitch thing and then you do it on your on the phone
(0:55:04) Codey: So it's like a kind of like a color. It's like a puzzle or a color by number
(0:55:08) Codey: Thing it's a color by number basically
(0:55:12) Codey: And then you can send it and so I also while I was in Costa Rica was sending her a lot of really cool photos
(0:55:18) Codey: So she basically every day had a small little cross stitch to do and it would reveal a photo of what I was it too
(0:55:25) Codey: So and she sends me pictures too and that
(0:55:28) Codey: game had ads and I saw township ads all the time but I recently actually they
(0:55:36) Codey: had a thing where it was like buy in-game currency one time and get rid of
(0:55:41) Codey: ads forever and there was this $2 deal and I was like honestly I've been
(0:55:46) Codey: playing this game quite a bit and I don't see it going anywhere so I'll
(0:55:49) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:55:50) Codey: give them two dollars and then I won't have to deal with the ads anymore which
(0:55:54) Codey: was nice. But yeah, don't have to even worry about that with Township, they just...
(0:55:58) Codey: straight up are ad-free. The frustrating thing then is that there isn't a way to
(0:56:06) Codey: counteract the fact that they want you a million times, like in any way, shape,
(0:56:12) Codey: or form, to buy their currencies. So this game is... it just bombards you with, like,
(0:56:22) Codey: for the next 30 minutes by this many, like...
(0:56:28) Codey: spend this much and... don't get one, don't get two, but get four times as much currency
(0:56:35) Codey: or whatever, and it's just like... it has a bunch of different currency systems, so
(0:56:41) Codey: all of these games usually have a free currency system, which is the coins, and I
(0:56:46) Codey: always have a ton of the coins, so that's annoying, because I'm like, "please just
(0:56:51) Codey: let me get rid of these things." It has that pay... paid currency.
(0:56:58) Codey: Which is dollars, and it does the thing... the standard thing where it throws a bunch
(0:57:03) Codey: of the dollars at you at the beginning, so you think that you're gonna get them
(0:57:06) Codey: all the time, and then it's... it trickle feeds them to you at the, like, late game,
(0:57:06) Kev: First hits free. Oh
(0:57:11) Kev: Yeah
(0:57:12) Codey: and so then you... then every time that "buy ten things, get a hundred right now for
(0:57:20) Codey: the next five minutes," but, like... right in this moment, if you ex...
(0:57:22) Kev: Right now 25 minutes until you can never ever have this again you fool
(0:57:29) Codey: if you ex out of this, it will never happen, like, yeah. So I could see how people could
(0:57:34) Codey: get, like, sucked into that kind of stuff, and then of course you can use that paid currency
(0:57:40) Codey: to reduce times on anything, and, you know, unlock things that you otherwise would... otherwise
(0:57:51) Codey: would have remained locked behind a paywall, blah, blah, blah. So on the main screen, like,
(0:57:56) Codey: as I was writing.
(0:57:58) Codey: The show notes, there are, there were three reward-based systems as well.
(0:58:04) Codey: So one is like, if you build the next community buildings, for example, I
(0:58:10) Codey: think I was building like a wedding, a wedding chapel and a, you know, that
(0:58:15) Codey: kind of stuff, like a firehouse and whatever, um, if I build those, I get to
(0:58:22) Codey: like open a box that gives me like rewards and experience.
(0:58:28) Codey: Um, so that was one reward system.
(0:58:30) Codey: Another reward system was for me to do certain tasks.
(0:58:33) Codey: So it's like, send resources by helicopter five times, send
(0:58:40) Codey: resources by train five times.
(0:58:42) Codey: Like you make four donuts today, like, and then you get rewards for that.
(0:58:49) Codey: And then another one is this piggy bank that I just unlocked.
(0:58:52) Codey: So as you go, it unlocks more reward systems.
(0:58:56) Codey: so I cannot even imagine.
(0:58:58) Codey: How stressed my phone would be if I made it to like another level
(0:59:04) Codey: because it would just unlock a new reward system and I'd be like.
(0:59:08) Kev: oh my god this is dangerous nothing nothing like good old-fashioned uh the word um just
(0:59:08) Codey: Ah.
(0:59:15) Kev: this word there obfuscation right levels of obfuscation
(0:59:18) Codey: cap capitalism. Yeah, so that one's a piggy bank. The most
(0:59:25) Codey: recent reward system I got was a piggy bank. And you earn thing
(0:59:29) Codey: you earn cash in the piggy bank. And it currently says that I
(0:59:34) Codey: have like 76 of the earned currency like the dollars in
(0:59:40) Codey: that piggy bank. But to access them, I have to pay $3 of like,
(0:59:46) Codey: IRL money like real
(0:59:47) Kev: That's that's just uncalled
(0:59:48) Codey: money yeah so it's like you got you've earned all this stuff like do you want
(0:59:54) Codey: this money you should you should pay to get this money I was like no dude no so
(1:00:00) Codey: that
(1:00:01) Kev: Hey, dig some. Oh, that's great.
(1:00:03) Codey: yeah pay pay to even access the stuff that you've already earned quote unquote
(1:00:08) Codey: so that's like I think the biggest issue that I have with this game is just and
(1:00:13) Codey: And you know, it makes sense, it's free to play, it does.
(1:00:18) Codey: It doesn't have ads, they're gonna, they have to throw a money, like actual give us money
(1:00:24) Codey: system at you or whatever.
(1:00:29) Codey: I genuinely don't really know how to get around it, like my brain was thinking like if they
(1:00:35) Codey: could put out like a $10 or $15 version of the game, that would get rid of all of that.
(1:00:42) Codey: But I don't know.
(1:00:44) Codey: I don't.
(1:00:45) Codey: I think that's just the nature of games these days.
(1:00:49) Codey: And so, that's whatever.
(1:00:50) Kev: you
(1:00:51) Kev: well, I
(1:00:53) Codey: Mobile games.
(1:00:55) Kev: Mean yes and no, right
(1:00:56) Kev: I mean I took four of it right like so many mobile games apps or not even mobile a lot of the console games
(1:01:02) Kev: Right games as a service subscriptions. Yada. Yada. Like absolutely right? It's all about the long-term monetization, right?
(1:01:09) Kev: But at the same time, I think other games in this modern day and age are a little better about it
(1:01:15) Kev: For instance, uh, Xenless Zone Zero, the game I discussed earlier, I forgot to mention.
(1:01:20) Kev: Umm, and of course they sell you, like, being a gacha game, that's where you can dump money in.
(1:01:26) Kev: I haven't dumped any money in, actually.
(1:01:28) Kev: But, uh, the point is, like, they can still offer, a lot of games these days still offer a lot without having to pay.
(1:01:36) Kev: Or, or be so heavy handed about it.
(1:01:40) Kev: Excuse me. Um, so much of, uh, what you described does feel, like, very much from the era of that Facebook gaming era.
(1:01:48) Kev: You know, Candy crushed.
(1:01:48) Codey: - Yep.
(1:01:50) Kev: You know, I'm a farmer.
(1:01:52) Codey: Farm Bill.
(1:01:53) Codey: - Yep, and so that's how the game is.
(1:01:56) Codey: So that's the currency,
(1:01:57) Codey: and then there's the two parts of the game.
(1:01:59) Codey: There's the Farm Bill part, and there's the Candy Crush part.
(1:02:01) Codey: So the Farm Bill part has six categories of things
(1:02:05) Codey: that you can build,
(1:02:06) Codey: and as you level up, more things unlock.
(1:02:10) Codey: So the six things are houses, community buildings,
(1:02:14) Codey: factories, farming, decorations,
(1:02:18) Codey: the actual category.
(1:02:20) Codey: So it basically is all centered around the fact
(1:02:24) Codey: that you have a population size,
(1:02:27) Codey: and when you are at a smaller population size,
(1:02:32) Codey: at a certain point, you hit a point where you're like,
(1:02:35) Codey: okay, well, you have the capacity to have 100 people
(1:02:40) Codey: in your population,
(1:02:42) Codey: but there's only enough houses for 60 people.
(1:02:45) Codey: So then you're like, okay, I'll build more houses,
(1:02:47) Kev: Right.
(1:02:48) Codey: and then at a certain point,
(1:02:50) Codey: it's like there's enough houses,
(1:02:53) Codey: you don't have enough stuff to have a higher population.
(1:02:58) Codey: So then you have to build the community buildings.
(1:03:01) Codey: So that's when you'd build a police station,
(1:03:04) Codey: and then suddenly your population goes up,
(1:03:06) Codey: but it's like, oop, you could have 150 people,
(1:03:09) Codey: but you don't have enough houses,
(1:03:11) Codey: and so then you buy houses,
(1:03:13) Codey: and it just basically, you just do that forever.
(1:03:16) Kev: Of course. That...
(1:03:18) Codey: Arcontinually, building community buildings
(1:03:21) Codey: to increase your population,
(1:03:23) Codey: and then building houses for them,
(1:03:24) Kev: You gotta click those cookies!
(1:03:25) Codey: and then gotta click the cookies.
(1:03:28) Codey: So you do that, and the higher your population gets,
(1:03:33) Codey: the more fields you can have for farming,
(1:03:37) Codey: because the people work in the fields,
(1:03:42) Codey: and so then that's how you can make it,
(1:03:44) Codey: so you don't only have like 10 fields or whatever.
(1:03:49) Codey: You can grow more things at one time.
(1:03:50) Codey: And then the community buildings,
(1:03:52) Codey: like the chapel, the fire station,
(1:03:54) Codey: the police station, all of those things,
(1:03:56) Codey: they will, they take time to take like however long,
(1:04:00) Codey: I guess it gets longer and longer the later level you are,
(1:04:04) Codey: but to, once the time is up,
(1:04:07) Codey: it then requires building resources.
(1:04:10) Codey: So this is when it's like to finish building this building,
(1:04:13) Codey: you need six hammers and two panes of glass
(1:04:17) Codey: and five bricks.
(1:04:19) Codey: And you get all of that from like some of the quests that you do
(1:04:23) Codey: The train like putting resources on the train to be shipped off
(1:04:28) Codey: And then you also can sometimes get them in the Candy Crush half of the game
(1:04:33) Codey: So basically like or you can just buy them like underneath each of them
(1:04:39) Codey: It's like and I just want to buy it and then you can pay for it for like 50 in-game cash
(1:04:44) Codey: To just or you can like you can also ask your friends like you can do the thing where you're
(1:04:48) Codey: Where you ask a friend like hey, can I have a hammer and then but like I
(1:04:50) Kev: Oh yeah, oh the good old Facebook send your basket friends for help, oh, yeah
(1:04:58) Codey: Did not connect this to my Facebook I did not do any of that I was just like nope
(1:05:03) Codey: So I didn't worry about any of that
(1:05:06) Kev: There's something almost nostalgic about that now.
(1:05:09) Codey: It is yes a hundred percent
(1:05:12) Kev: Can you imagine that in the modern day, on your Switch, you're playing Animal Crossing and you can send notifications to your friends?
(1:05:22) Codey: One of my grandmother's friends, her name is Betty, she and I played Farmville together and I remember my grandma asked me once, she's like, "Betty said you didn't send her something today. Are you mad at her?"
(1:05:38) Codey: I was like, "No, I just haven't played today."
(1:05:42) Kev: That's exactly what I want.
(1:05:44) Codey: No. So that's like, good, good.
(1:05:52) Codey: Nostalgia of Facebook gaming right there.
(1:05:56) Codey: So that's two of the buildings houses and community buildings factories and farming are you pay for them with the coins, they're free to like, that's, they don't cost anything they're not going to be like where the building resources they just get built.
(1:06:14) Codey: These are all based on time constraints so like it takes 10 minutes for cows to be milked it takes a minute for wheat to be farmed and everything and then you can
(1:06:22) Codey: you know, scroll your finger over all of the to harvest everything.
(1:06:25) Kev: Unless you buy that super milk.
(1:06:30) Codey: Yeah, we haven't. I don't. They might. I mean, I honestly didn't look that hard.
(1:06:37) Codey: So yeah, you get access to more plots as your population increases the folks in town are always asking for the resources that you can create.
(1:06:44) Codey: So you farm for those resources or use the factories to create whatever materials they want. So, for example,
(1:06:52) Codey: at the time of writing the show notes, someone was asking me for this is one person was asking me for a shirt, a cheese and two cream. So the shirt can be produced at the tailor shop for one cotton fabric and the cotton fabric can be produced at the textile factory with two cotton.
(1:07:12) Codey: So it's like this you have to do this here and that there and like make like harvest to cotton and then make it cotton fabric and then make it a shirt.
(1:07:22) Codey: The cheese and the cream can be produced at the dairy factory one cheese for two milk and one cream for one milk. So it's basically just, you know, you wait for it to process or whatever.
(1:07:38) Codey: And then you turn those in you get coins you get resource you get experience. I don't think you get any resource like building resources or anything from that but sometimes there's a quest that's like complete five.
(1:07:52) Codey: And then of course he's getting increasingly more elaborate as you level like some of the first ones were just like two eggs. I just want a carrot, you know, and now it's like everyone wants everything.
(1:07:54) Kev: Yep, yep, yep.
(1:08:09) Codey: Another of those categories was decorations. I don't care, so I didn't look at him.
(1:08:14) Kev: that's correct.
(1:08:17) Codey: And then this special category includes things that it's so that, for example.
(1:08:22) Codey: There was this thing called the house of luck, which you can pay.
(1:08:26) Codey: It says the dollars.
(1:08:27) Codey: I think that's not accurate.
(1:08:28) Codey: I think it's there's like a an extra currency that you get from like visiting friends villages.
(1:08:33) Kev: Of course!
(1:08:38) Codey: Which I don't have any friends in the game, so I didn't do that.
(1:08:41) Codey: But you can get the the you can use that to spin like a wheel and receive things.
(1:08:49) Codey: And then you have to pay more to like, spin again.
(1:08:52) Kev: There you go.
(1:08:53) Codey: Or you can buy those with money.
(1:08:58) Codey: The city market has, there's like a guy who has resources that you may need.
(1:09:02) Codey: So like a guy who's selling like five cookies.
(1:09:04) Codey: So instead of having to sit and make five cookies and you know,
(1:09:08) Codey: the cookies require milk and eggs and flour like or wheat or whatever.
(1:09:13) Codey: You can just buy them from the sky and sometimes it's for the cat,
(1:09:18) Codey: the dollars and sometimes it's just for the coins.
(1:09:20) Codey: So I was like, oh wow, like I can just.
(1:09:23) Codey: This all oh, and I will say that it also thresholds your barn.
(1:09:26) Codey: So your barn has a limited amount of size, of course, like a limited storage.
(1:09:33) Codey: Um, and so you have to use the building resources to increase the storage of your
(1:09:38) Codey: barn and of course the built, the building resources, no, even though there wasn't a
(1:09:38) Kev: Or you can buy a Superbar.
(1:09:44) Codey: second part, the resource building resources take up space in your barn.
(1:09:47) Codey: Like every single thing you have takes up space in your barn.
(1:09:51) Codey: So.
(1:09:52) Codey: That is the Farmville side of it.
(1:09:54) Codey: Do you have any questions about that?
(1:09:56) Kev: "Nope, that sounds exact-"
(1:09:57) Codey: Okay.
(1:09:59) Codey: I had only made it to cows, chickens and sheep.
(1:10:06) Codey: Um, and then I had, I'd like opened up a fast food restaurant and like opened up
(1:10:10) Codey: all this other stuff, like as factories that you can use to make stuff for people.
(1:10:14) Codey: But I just kind of stopped doing all of that.
(1:10:17) Codey: Um, so that is the Farmville side of it.
(1:10:19) Codey: And then, like, after you play on that side for a bit.
(1:10:22) Codey: "oh looks like you're waiting for things to happen go on an adventure" and I was
(1:10:28) Codey: like okay so you go on the adventure side and it opens up a whole new map
(1:10:35) Codey: where you are literally discovering like basically going through a map the first
(1:10:41) Codey: one is like a like an old amusement park so there's like different like a
(1:10:48) Codey: merry-go-round and a ferris wheel and like all of these
(1:10:52) Codey: weird broken-down things that have been taken over by sludge there's no lot like
(1:11:00) Codey: it doesn't explain anything but you're this you are these two guys I guess
(1:11:07) Codey: you're the one guy at first but then you unlock more people as you go along and
(1:11:11) Codey: it doesn't it does absolutely nothing when you unlock more people and you just
(1:11:15) Codey: go along and use energy to unblock the path in front
(1:11:22) Codey: of you so there's like stuff in your way to continue the story on that side so
(1:11:28) Codey: for example I just did a thing where you come upon these bears that are mad and
(1:11:34) Codey: won't let you pass so you go to find honey but then when you go to the honey
(1:11:41) Codey: the bees are hungry and they need you to bring them grapes so you go get grapes
(1:11:48) Codey: for them. I don't know you go find a smoker first and then you
(1:11:52) Codey: go get grapes for them and then your friend falls in a hole
(1:11:56) Codey: so you need to go get a rope to get him back out of the hole
(1:12:00) Codey: and like all of these things are taking you to like different parts of the map
(1:12:03) Codey: so you have to unlock all of the spots and use energy for that
(1:12:06) Codey: and of course when you run out of energy you replenish that energy by playing
(1:12:11) Codey: Candy Crush and I'm not even going to explain
(1:12:16) Codey: how that works. If you don't know what Candy Crush is
(1:12:19) Codey: Don't even look it up. Count yourself lucky. Move on.
(1:12:22) Codey: your life. It's 100% Candy Crush. It's Facebook Tetris. And I was on like level 120 by the
(1:12:28) Kev: It's Facebook Tetris, basically.
(1:12:34) Codey: time I stopped. Yeah. The Candy Crush railed me in. And it's
(1:12:35) Kev: Of course.
(1:12:38) Kev: Okay, that's, that's where I was, like, everything, you know, obviously designed to get your hooks in,
(1:12:45) Kev: but there had to be something, and that's, that's the one that gets you, that reels you in.
(1:12:53) Codey: because my mom is also very is actually addicted to Candy Crush and is like still actively
(1:12:58) Codey: playing it and she's on like level 7000 something whatever right now. Whatever the max level
(1:13:02) Kev: yeah
(1:13:03) Codey: is she's probably attained it. Yeah. They are I do really like it and it's very colorful
(1:13:06) Kev: The thing it's just the Tetris like puzzle games are just inherently fun, right? So
(1:13:16) Codey: and it's like wow you've unlocked something and it's like all really cool and stuff but
(1:13:19) Codey: But like, I, yeah, I just.
(1:13:23) Codey: It got its hooks in me for sure.
(1:13:25) Codey: Um, so yeah, and you do that and you're finding chests and resources and you
(1:13:30) Codey: complete quests on that side too.
(1:13:32) Codey: So it's like, you need to get, remove 600 green blocks while you're
(1:13:37) Codey: playing Candy Crush, doesn't call it Candy Crush, but it is.
(1:13:42) Codey: Um, and then you get resources from that side and, uh, you only have, so if, if
(1:13:48) Codey: you hit a level that you can't beat, you only have five chances to like,
(1:13:52) Codey: pass that level or whatever, like you, you have lives and it gets rid of them.
(1:13:57) Codey: And sometimes you can find stuff that gives you, um, like unlimited lives, but
(1:14:04) Codey: it just is never certain, I guess, I don't know.
(1:14:09) Codey: So, yep, and it just, it gets its hooks in you.
(1:14:14) Codey: And so you do that while you're waiting for your factories and your farm stuff
(1:14:18) Codey: to grow and all of that stuff.
(1:14:19) Codey: then when you're done with, then you go back.
(1:14:22) Codey: Go over there and then you check on all of that and fulfill quests and then you go back over to the Candy Crush thing and you just keep going back and forth forever until you throw your phone across a bridge.
(1:14:32) Kev: correct. There you go. Um, it's pretty diabolical slash ingenious to combine the two, right?
(1:14:42) Kev: Like, somebody looked at Farm Villains and said, you know what, we need something to
(1:14:46) Kev: do while they're waiting. What if we put Candy Crush? And lo and behold, it works.
(1:14:50) Codey: Yeah, yep, 11 years.
(1:14:57) Codey: They just celebrated 11 years.
(1:15:00) Kev: There you go.
(1:15:01) Codey: It's wild.
(1:15:04) Kev: If you like Facebook games, well, stop. First, just stop.
(1:15:09) Kev: There's better things in this year.
(1:15:10) Codey: No, everyone is allowed to like what they like.
(1:15:11) Kev: here.
(1:15:13) Codey: If you really think that you miss Farmville,
(1:15:17) Codey: you miss those days,
(1:15:19) Codey: or if you have been wanting to do Candy Crush
(1:15:21) Codey: and Farmville all in one game,
(1:15:23) Codey: this is the game for you.
(1:15:26) Codey: Don't spend too much of your own personal money.
(1:15:29) Codey: You can just wait for a lot of these things
(1:15:31) Codey: and just wait to earn more energy back.
(1:15:35) Codey: Wait for things to come in.
(1:15:40) Codey: Like you get daily reward bonuses and stuff.
(1:15:42) Codey: Like that's, you can just do that too.
(1:15:44) Codey: Like, it's just,
(1:15:46) Codey: stay disciplined friends.
(1:15:49) Codey: Cool, I'm gonna uninstall this right now.
(1:15:52) Kev: Hehehe, there's Disciplined!
(1:15:55) Codey: Delete, delete.
(1:15:56) Kev: She managed to hold on to until this episode. There you go.
(1:16:01) Kev: Ah, there's...
(1:16:02) Codey: And that's Township, woo.
(1:16:03) Kev: Town... Town... I was about to say Town... Oh my gosh, okay, Town Ship, yay, woo!
(1:16:08) Kev: We did it! Cody survived the ordeal to get to this episode, and now the episode.
(1:16:10) Codey: We did it.
(1:16:17) Codey: Yup, thanks.
(1:16:20) Kev: All right, yeah, well, thank you so much, Cody, for reporting and sharing.
(1:16:26) Codey: Yeah, of course.
(1:16:29) Codey: I was glad, I was like,
(1:16:30) Codey: "Oh, I get to record with Kevin.
(1:16:31) Codey: "I haven't talked to Kevin in a while."
(1:16:32) Kev: yep this was a lot of fun um good tangents um welcome to the the amazon cast we like aminals
(1:16:34) Codey: Yup.
(1:16:39) Kev: um and if you want to as let's say find more animals well you should probably go seek you
(1:16:46) Kev: potty if they do want to see more animal stuff where do they find you and your stuff because
(1:16:48) Codey: Yep, I am @hikingbeaglebeagle on Instagram and then you can also find me on the Slack.
(1:17:01) Kev: You can find me at Koopapres on Twitter if you want to see my personal account, which is mostly other people's funnier, smarter, more interesting memes and such.
(1:17:12) Codey: Art account art account art account
(1:17:15) Kev: Or the art account, which I... well, I forgot to update, but we'll be doing that post-taste.
(1:17:21) Kev: Follow my October, September, whatever, month-long journey at Spriter Squared. I'm gonna probably... maybe you'd like to...

(1:19:23) Kev: All the episodes and stuff with the other listeners. The THSLack, yes.
(1:19:26) Codey: the the THS slack
(1:19:30) Codey: you said ISE
(1:19:31) Kev: I'm gonna have to play that back I'm really shocked I said okay anyways find a slack there to listen to talk with all our friends and all the hosts hanging out there.
(1:19:34) Codey: you said ISE
(1:19:38) Codey: that's a different that's a different podcast y'all
(1:19:42) Codey: that's a different thing
(1:19:46) Codey: yep
(1:19:54) Codey: Yep.
(1:19:57) Kev: I see the rain the discourse from the
(1:20:01) Kev: Slack from the the the tier lists. That's a very good. Yeah
(1:20:08) Kev: War and work started
(1:20:11) Kev: But also you can gain access to the greenhouse our premium
(1:20:19) Kev: Content show of other topics not necessarily cottagecore stuff
(1:20:24) Kev: For instance if you didn't get enough of our bad tier lists
(1:20:28) Kev: We and I did rank fix our movie
(1:20:32) Kev: Wasn't happy left here. So, you know, it was good times
(1:20:38) Kev: But yeah, um, that's all for this week folks. Thank you Bodhi for coming on recording
(1:20:45) Kev: Thank you. I'll for I guess
(1:20:48) Kev: being sick and letting
(1:20:51) Codey: I did, I did thank Al for being sick
(1:20:53) Codey: so that I could cover Township.
(1:20:54) Kev: That is true
(1:20:56) Codey: I did.
(1:20:58) Codey: Staking one for the team.
(1:21:00) Kev: Hey, yeah, um, I'll show you
(1:21:01) Kev: Should
(1:21:03) Kev: Should be back next week. Um, and I actually I will be as well for a very
(1:21:10) Kev: Episode I am very excited about and we
(1:21:13) Kev: Discuss something. I don't think we've really talked about before not a game
(1:21:19) Kev: I'll just leave it at that. I don't know as I'll said it what it's gonna be next week. I don't know
(1:21:22) Codey: I don't remember but I'm looking at the thing and very hmm so I don't know if he said yet so
(1:21:25) Kev: Yeah, well, of course you can see what it is, but it is
(1:21:30) Kev: Yeah, I don't know
(1:21:31) Kev: But it's gonna be a fun one a little a little different from our usual because well, you'll just see it's not
(1:21:40) Codey: Yeah
(1:21:43) Codey: Yeah
(1:21:43) Kev: Um, but so look forward to that. Um, and until next time everyone have a good harvest
