# Transcript

(0:00:30) Codey: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Cody
(0:00:36) Jonnie: My name is Johnny.
(0:00:37) Codey: And we are here today to talk about cottagecore games
(0:00:42) Jonnie: Whoooo!
(0:00:45) Codey: Okay, I'm not gonna ask Johnny how he's doing cuz we're that'll just get us right into the issue so the issue at hand
(0:00:54) Codey: So I'm going to first mention today's topic is what game what games we think shouldn't
(0:01:00) Codey: Include farming. So these are games that do not have like big farming components or there
(0:01:06) Codey: It's like a series that has not had a farming game
(0:01:10) Codey: Specifically that we think are like ripe for the plucking
(0:01:15) Codey: So that's what we're gonna talk about we also have a bunch of game news
(0:01:19) Codey: And then we're I'm gonna talk about what I've been up to but Johnny does not want to talk about what he's been up
(0:01:26) Codey: To he has something else to talk about
(0:01:28) Jonnie: Well, that's because I haven't had time to play games because I've been raging about last week's episode
(0:01:35) Jonnie: uh where Kev and Al made a
(0:01:39) Jonnie: Tier list and I'm hoping you can hear the finger quotes that I was making when I said that they made a tier list
(0:01:41) Codey: Uh-huh.
(0:01:43) Codey: I did.
(0:01:46) Codey: I did hear those finger calling.
(0:01:46) Jonnie: because
(0:01:48) Jonnie: I'm sorry guys. But what was that? That was a terrible tier list first of all. Okay. I am a tier list purist
(0:01:56) Jonnie: I feel like so many tearless now, they just...
(0:01:58) Jonnie: ...people undermine the purpose of having an S-Tear.
(0:02:02) Jonnie: S-Tear is meant to be for the elite.
(0:02:05) Jonnie: You cannot have 20 characters in S-Tear.
(0:02:05) Codey: Yeah.
(0:02:09) Jonnie: Which I don't know how many they put in, but it was a lot.
(0:02:12) Jonnie: There were too many S-Tear characters.
(0:02:12) Codey: Yeah.
(0:02:14) Jonnie: Are you a purist when it comes to tearless Cody like me?
(0:02:17) Codey: I, yeah, I think that like, so from listening to the episode I didn't have any strong feelings but I did feel like there were some people that they put in the S tier that I felt like they were more, they felt more strongly about and like that's the situation where like, that's like, those should be the people
(0:02:35) Codey: in their own tier, or like in a tier above S tier or something or like bump everyone else down to A I'm not entirely sure how they want to work on that but as it stands like it was just kind of, I mean, I didn't necessarily disagree with where they put a lot
(0:02:51) Codey: of people, but I agreed with some of the sentiment talked about in the slack. So what what were those sentiments.
(0:02:58) Jonnie: And so, like, so first of all, too many in S-Tear. Agree with you, Coda. You bump everyone down.
(0:03:05) Jonnie: Also, no F-Tear. Like, Stardew Valley has F-Tear characters. It's very clear.
(0:03:05) Codey: Correct.
(0:03:07) Codey: Yeah.
(0:03:12) Jonnie: A tier list is not about being nice and making friends.
(0:03:15) Jonnie: A, these are digital characters. Who cares?
(0:03:17) Jonnie: And B, who's saying that Demetrius, Pan, and, uh,
(0:03:22) Jonnie: Mayor Lewis are not F-Tear. They're my personal F-Tear characters. Uh, like, they are F-Tear.
(0:03:28) Jonnie: No D. Add an F-Tear.
(0:03:29) Codey: Okay.
(0:03:31) Jonnie: Oh.
(0:03:32) Codey: Yeah.
(0:03:33) Codey: Well, and I feel like they would have, the boys,
(0:03:35) Codey: I mean, Kevin and Al are probably like,
(0:03:38) Codey: they think Clint is F-tier.
(0:03:40) Codey: Like I was shocked that they didn't use F-tier for that.
(0:03:44) Jonnie: Oh, so Clint is below F tier. Clint is in Clint tier.
(0:03:48) Jonnie: I have done my own tier list, which I have put into the Slack, so if you are interested
(0:03:53) Jonnie: in seeing a real tier list, patreon.com/dhspart.
(0:03:54) Codey: Yeah.
(0:03:59) Jonnie: I don't know, maybe Al can link my tier list in the show notes for this one, because I
(0:04:03) Jonnie: feel like it's a much better tier list. It's soon to be officially endorsed by the show.
(0:04:08) Codey: Yeah.
(0:04:09) Jonnie: It's just objectively, objectively better.
(0:04:12) Jonnie: But I even feel like some of the
(0:04:14) Jonnie: choices of who they put into S-Tear is just like confusing.
(0:04:19) Jonnie: So my personal S-Tear, just to be clear, is Hayley, Linus, and Willy.
(0:04:25) Jonnie: Right?
(0:04:25) Jonnie: For me, they're the three characters with the most story that, not that I relate to,
(0:04:32) Jonnie: that's the wrong word, but that I feel some attachment to the story, right?
(0:04:36) Jonnie: And each person, I'm sure, would have different characters that they would put in there.
(0:04:40) Jonnie: I'm sure everyone would probably have Linus.
(0:04:44) Jonnie: Who's, when I'm saying like, "What do I like about the characters in the game?"
(0:04:49) Jonnie: Like, those are the stories that I'm most going to refer to.
(0:04:52) Jonnie: And like, that's independent, right?
(0:04:54) Jonnie: Like, the character I probably romance, or have romance the most across the game is Leah.
(0:04:59) Jonnie: But Leah is like a solid B-Tear character, you know?
(0:04:59) Codey: Yeah, I was going to say.
(0:05:02) Codey: Wow.
(0:05:03) Jonnie: She's fine, but boring, so she's a B-Tear character.
(0:05:05) Codey: Yeah.
(0:05:07) Codey: I guess like that was the other thing is that they were going off of like how they thought the characters were.
(0:05:13) Codey: It was unclear to me how the grading was because they were like, no, no, like not how we feel that they are as a character that has been created but who they are as people.
(0:05:25) Codey: and that's like kind of difficult to judge because
(0:05:29) Codey: you're getting like the one-sided situation from a lot of these people
(0:05:33) Codey: like I don't know clint's backstory I don't know I don't know who hurt him you know
(0:05:38) Jonnie: Clint hurt Clint. It's all his own fault.
(0:05:43) Codey: oh no
(0:05:44) Jonnie: And that's why he gets Clinted. That's why he gets Clinted here.
(0:05:47) Jonnie: Um...
(0:05:49) Jonnie: Uh...
(0:05:50) Jonnie: Do I have anything else to say about the...
(0:05:52) Jonnie: Oh, look, I feel like the other thing that really stood out to me on the tier list is
(0:05:58) Jonnie: there's like a little snip that I took of S-tier
(0:06:00) Jonnie: that has Jodie, Leah, Robin, and Penny all together.
(0:06:00) Codey: Yeah.
(0:06:06) Jonnie: I just, I don't want to know, you know, if there's-
(0:06:08) Jonnie: there's maybe a sort of similar visual style between those four characters.
(0:06:12) Jonnie: Um, I'm just gonna let that one-
(0:06:12) Codey: Uh-huh, perhaps perhaps all with a certain hair color perhaps
(0:06:20) Jonnie: Right? Right?
(0:06:25) Codey: Yeah, I I didn't even think about that until you showed me you showed me the picture and I was like, oh no
(0:06:27) Jonnie: But to be honest, right.
(0:06:35) Jonnie: And it's just funny because the way they put it in the t-
(0:06:35) Codey: They're all
(0:06:38) Jonnie: list that they were just all together with Linus sort of hanging out in the middle and I was like, "Yeah, it's just Linus and his lady, sir."
(0:06:42) Codey: Yeah!
(0:06:44) Jonnie: Just hanging out.
(0:06:46) Codey: Linus and his four redheads, yeah.
(0:06:48) Jonnie: Yup.
(0:06:50) Jonnie: But to be honest, this is why I like tier lists, right?
(0:06:54) Jonnie: Like one, people have different approaches.
(0:06:56) Jonnie: And I think people do tend towards being too nice.
(0:06:58) Jonnie: And it's like, we're just going to, you know, push things up above where they need to be, which I would like to see people move away from.
(0:07:04) Jonnie: away from, but it generates
(0:07:08) Jonnie: good discussion right because it's it's one of those things where it's like
(0:07:11) Jonnie: actually the act of going through that it's kind of or through creating my
(0:07:15) Jonnie: own tier list it's thinking about like what what is it that I like about
(0:07:18) Jonnie: characters in games and I think when I look at my
(0:07:23) Jonnie: s tier the thing that I it's like I like characters that
(0:07:26) Jonnie: uh go on journeys and have probably relatable but not wholly positive
(0:07:32) Jonnie: stories right like um all three of the characters i
(0:07:38) Jonnie: have like uh challenges or or negative aspects
(0:07:42) Jonnie: but but overall their stories are a positive ones
(0:07:45) Jonnie: um or or about kind of like I guess different perspectives
(0:07:49) Jonnie: um on things so anyway that was that was the thing I learned about myself
(0:07:53) Jonnie: from uh from doing the tier list um I also just put all of the the minor
(0:07:57) Jonnie: characters and dekes i'm like how do you rate the bouncer which you know
(0:08:00) Jonnie: kev was keeps keeps him to have a real love for the bouncer
(0:08:02) Codey: Yeah, yeah, Kev was like S tier immediately and I was like this bro has two lines my guy
(0:08:06) Jonnie: - Oh.
(0:08:10) Jonnie: _laughing_ Right?
(0:08:12) Codey: Or like the dwarf like all of these people that like you don't really see that much of
(0:08:18) Codey: And I don't have enough information to make an educated guess
(0:08:21) Codey: I think it would be so another thing is that I haven't really personally gotten into a lot of the like
(0:08:27) Codey: Backstory of a lot of the characters in Stardew Valley, but I have been doing that for Coral Island
(0:08:32) Codey: I'd love to make an S a list for Coral Island. I would get heated about that for sure
(0:08:38) Jonnie: I feel like that sounds like a great idea for an episode, and I know immediately that we would disagree on some characters.
(0:08:42) Codey: Yeah
(0:08:46) Codey: HAHAHA!
(0:08:46) Jonnie: Because if I remember rightly, you are a fan of Scott, and I think he is like the driest possible character in that entire game.
(0:08:55) Codey: I am very close to marrying Scott right now.
(0:09:03) Jonnie: Ahh...
(0:09:03) Codey: So I was, so I guess we'll move forward
(0:09:08) Codey: into what I have been up to.
(0:09:10) Codey: On top of tearing my calf muscle,
(0:09:14) Codey: I have also, that has given rise
(0:09:16) Codey: to a lot of time of sitting down,
(0:09:19) Codey: which means I can play games, which is great.
(0:09:24) Codey: I've been playing Disney Dreamlight Valley still,
(0:09:26) Codey: trying to get like 100% on a lot of the achievements.
(0:09:29) Codey: Right now I'm trying to finish off the critters.
(0:09:31) Codey: I only have two more critters.
(0:09:33) Codey: And I actually, it's a big tip
(0:09:35) Codey: for people who are playing Stardew Valley
(0:09:37) Codey: and who are looking for certain critters.
(0:09:39) Codey: You, each critter like comes out at a specific day
(0:09:44) Codey: at a specific time.
(0:09:45) Codey: So like the two things that I want,
(0:09:47) Codey: which I think are like the pink crocodile
(0:09:49) Codey: and the red fox are both on Saturdays.
(0:09:54) Codey: I usually don't play on Saturdays.
(0:09:57) Codey: So that's why I don't have them yet.
(0:09:59) Codey: But they both come out on Saturday
(0:10:01) Codey: and they come out at different times
(0:10:02) Codey: and they have different,
(0:10:03) Codey: like all the critters have different requirements.
(0:10:05) Codey: Like the crocodiles want a certain,
(0:10:07) Codey: like lobster is their favorite
(0:10:08) Codey: and the foxes want sturgeon or whatever it is.
(0:10:13) Codey: And so I finally just looked all of that up
(0:10:15) Codey: because I had realized that they were only there
(0:10:19) Codey: at certain times.
(0:10:20) Codey: And so I was like, okay.
(0:10:21) Codey: And when you go into the game,
(0:10:24) Codey: you can look at the critter page
(0:10:25) Codey: and it'll be like, not here today.
(0:10:27) Codey: Like this one's not here today.
(0:10:30) Codey: But I was like going online
(0:10:32) Codey: and I was just never seeing them around.
(0:10:34) Codey: And so I finally was just like, screw it.
(0:10:36) Codey: I'm Googling it.
(0:10:37) Codey: And I found out it's Saturday.
(0:10:38) Codey: So tomorrow is going to be lit for me.
(0:10:41) Codey: I'm hoping to get both solidified.
(0:10:43) Codey: That'd be awesome.
(0:10:45) Jonnie: Can I ask, when you say you're 100%ing all of the achievements, is that including the like, you know, harvest 10,000 blueberry achievements, like all of those things?
(0:10:56) Codey: I already have that I already have those the one that I it is the one that I don't have
(0:10:58) Jonnie: Oh my god.
(0:11:00) Jonnie: Cody?
(0:11:02) Jonnie: It's a lot!
(0:11:05) Codey: right now that's really frustrating is like water 7000 plant crops because I have water
(0:11:12) Codey: like so I would plant for a long time I was planting when it was raining so it's super
(0:11:17) Codey: simple and you can just literally plant like wheat and then harvest like by the time you're
(0:11:22) Codey: done planting like a little like eight by eight square.
(0:11:26) Codey: it's already like ready on the other side so then you just go back to harvesting and then you just
(0:11:30) Codey: go plant again. um but one of them is to water 7000 plants and so now i'm having to plant all
(0:11:38) Codey: this stuff that I don't care about uh just so that I can but it's fine because there's another
(0:11:43) Codey: achievement where you're supposed to buy seeds buy like 600 seeds or something from each of the
(0:11:50) Codey: biomes and I think I still need to buy like another 300 seeds from the Glade of Trust so
(0:11:54) Codey: I need to buy seats anyway.
(0:11:56) Codey: It's fine, I almost have all of this stuff for the gosh, what was the Tiana DLC called?
(0:12:05) Codey: I don't remember, but it's the one that like brought in Tiana and a bunch of her furniture
(0:12:12) Codey: and wardrobe stuff.
(0:12:14) Codey: I've almost completed that star path and have everything that you get from that.
(0:12:20) Codey: I think it still has a couple days, so I'm going to hope that that's true because then
(0:12:24) Codey: And I think that they're gonna start like a spooky--
(0:12:26) Codey: Halloween path--star path.
(0:12:28) Jonnie: Do you get anything for completing all of the achievements other than, like, there was
(0:12:34) Codey: No. It's that currency. Yeah, you get like the dreamlight. I have like almost 100,000 dreamlight.
(0:12:43) Codey: You which you use dreamlight to either to like unlock new realm. So like when they open whatever
(0:12:50) Codey: the next realm is, let's say it's hocus pocus. If they unlock the hocus pocus realm, and then you
(0:12:56) Codey: have to go to the castle and like open the door, the gateway to that realm, that's like where you
(0:13:01) Codey: use the dreamlight.
(0:13:04) Codey: and usually the doors only need like 10,000 and I have almost 100,000.
(0:13:09) Codey: yeet.
(0:13:10) Jonnie: One last question because I feel like you and I are sort of the DTV correspondence on the show and I haven't played since, you know, you and I, I think last talked about it, and that was, you know, when the story finished and I hit credits on the game, how do you feel the game is going in terms of, like, is it kind of just adding new stuff and mini stories and it's kind of just like, if you're into it, it's good or like, is the game expanding beyond that?
(0:13:14) Codey: yeah.
(0:13:17) Codey: oh yeah.
(0:13:21) Codey: mm-hmm.
(0:13:21) Codey: yeah.
(0:13:40) Jonnie: Or is it that you need to play it, you know, with the style paths as they're coming out? Like, what's, what's your current take on state of the game for maybe someone that dabbled in it a little bit when it was an early access or something like that? Where are you at?
(0:13:47) Codey: Yeah, so I would say the star paths are important if you're interested in collecting all of
(0:13:59) Codey: the like outfits and furniture things.
(0:14:04) Codey: I thought that the dapper delights I think is actually what it's called star path that
(0:14:09) Codey: has a lot of Tiana stuff.
(0:14:11) Codey: I really liked all a lot of the stuff that was in that star path so and also just from
(0:14:16) Codey: playing consistently.
(0:14:17) Codey: have a ton of moonlight, or moonstone, or whatever the heck it's called.
(0:14:21) Codey: So, you know, paying 2,500 moonstone to, which I've never had to pay real money.
(0:14:28) Codey: I always just get it for free by playing the game.
(0:14:32) Codey: Paying 2,500 moonstone to get access to the full star path was a no brainer for me.
(0:14:38) Codey: But that's really what the star paths are good for, is just the furniture, the wardrobes,
(0:14:46) Codey: that kind of thing.
(0:14:47) Codey: And so if you're really not into that, the star paths are not necessary.
(0:14:53) Codey: Every time they release a star path, they kind of have been releasing a new character
(0:14:58) Codey: along with it.
(0:14:59) Codey: But you don't have to do the star path, you can just come and be like "I wanna meet Tiana,"
(0:15:03) Codey: or "I wanna meet Mulan," or whatever.
(0:15:05) Codey: But also I don't think that that content goes away.
(0:15:07) Codey: I don't think that if you miss when Mulan shows up, that you're not gonna get to ever
(0:15:13) Codey: meet Mulan.
(0:15:14) Codey: It's just that you're probably not going to get immediate access to the site.
(0:15:17) Codey: I'm assuming that they'll become available like through the store, but that's, um, like through, uh, Scrooge's store, but you can't pick what shows up there.
(0:15:29) Codey: It just kind of like randomly goes through a bunch of stuff.
(0:15:33) Codey: So if you're wanting something specific, you kind of just have to like, um, and then the achievements, I mean, there's no purpose.
(0:15:40) Codey: I did this with World of Warcraft too.
(0:15:42) Codey: Um, I just went and like pet all of the critters and did all of the silly stuff.
(0:15:47) Codey: Just because it, seeing little achievements like being done just makes my dopamine skyrocket.
(0:15:55) Codey: So that's, that's, that it's not necessary at all.
(0:16:00) Codey: So if it's, if you're like, not really sure, or if you're not really tied to any of these characters,
(0:16:04) Codey: or if you don't super care, like I would just wait for a big content update or something.
(0:16:09) Codey: Um, I'm assuming eventually this like rift in time thing will just become free to play and you won't have to like,
(0:16:16) Codey: to like because it's a paid deal.
(0:16:17) Codey: You'll see currently, but, um, and it has like, it adds a whole nother dimension
(0:16:22) Codey: cause it adds a whole extra tool.
(0:16:26) Codey: Um, which I think messes with time, but I have not even, since I don't have that,
(0:16:32) Codey: I haven't even unlocked any of that stuff yet.
(0:16:34) Codey: And I think it also adds multiple characters that I again, don't have access
(0:16:39) Codey: to, but I'm not really that worried about it.
(0:16:41) Jonnie: nice it's good to hear like it feels like they're developing that game in a really positive way
(0:16:41) Codey: So yeah.
(0:16:43) Codey: Yeah.
(0:16:47) Jonnie: but also a way that kind of you know ultimately these games are you know need to make money so
(0:16:53) Jonnie: it sounds like they're striking that balance in a in a healthy way which not many games do these days
(0:16:56) Codey: Yeah
(0:16:58) Codey: Yeah, I definitely agree. I think the other thing
(0:17:04) Codey: So the other thing I've been playing is coral island and last time al and I talked about coral island we were talking about 1.1
(0:17:11) Codey: And I we talked about like the different things that 1.1 brought and how we didn't get to any of them
(0:17:18) Codey: so I finally got to give the mer people what they
(0:17:25) Codey: which was like five osmium
(0:17:26) Codey: crops and five osmium essences and then once you give that to them it basically
(0:17:32) Codey: like allows you to get a tail and and then the moving around in the underwater
(0:17:38) Codey: area is so fast so that's great after that they then ask for you to bring them
(0:17:47) Codey: 75 osmium crops and 30 osmium essences and that's where I'm currently stuck
(0:17:54) Codey: because I like can't go into a
(0:17:56) Codey: bunch of the buildings because they're like you're not allowed in here and
(0:17:59) Codey: stuff like that like just getting a tail doesn't mean that they all
(0:18:01) Codey: automatically accept you but that also means that I need to like harvest 75
(0:18:07) Codey: osmium crops I finally have improved a lot of my stuff to be able to do that
(0:18:12) Codey: but whatever I'm in my second year now and I almost have most of the lake shrine
(0:18:19) Codey: like temple like finished but I'm not entirely sure like how much I can really
(0:18:25) Codey: do without.
(0:18:26) Codey: Like getting the very specific fish that you can only get in the first seven days of fall.
(0:18:33) Codey: That kind of stuff, but I'm really enjoying coral island right now. Like I that's that has
(0:18:37) Codey: my full attention really except for tomorrow when it's going to be Disney dream my about.
(0:18:43) Jonnie: Yeah, I've been thinking about maybe jumping back into Coral Island now at one point.
(0:18:48) Codey: Yeah, so yeah, that's what we've been up to.
(0:18:54) Codey: So we're going to jump into game news here. The first thing on our list that Al has procured for
(0:18:59) Codey: us is Fey Farm, which is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S,
(0:19:10) Codey: and the Windows Store. So I guess that's it's only been on Switch and Steam, yeah? Question mark.
(0:19:18) Jonnie: Sure, why not?
(0:19:19) Codey: Okay. It does say... okay, I should just read more. That's gonna happen on the 22nd of October,
(0:19:31) Codey: and on the Twitter post that they posted a quote, "The new versions will include all content up to
(0:19:37) Codey: date and full cross-play with the existing PC and Nintendo Switch edition." So yeah, currently it's
(0:19:43) Codey: on PC and Nintendo Switch, and you'll be able to cross-play with everything.
(0:19:49) Codey: So if you're wanting it, if you've been like, "Oh man, I've been waiting for it
(0:19:53) Codey: on PlayStation or Xbox, like here's your time." Did you play Fey Farm? I can't remember. I think
(0:19:58) Codey: you were mad at it, right?
(0:19:58) Jonnie: Yeah, well I like how Fae Farm plays as a game. There's lots of good quality of life stuff that
(0:20:06) Jonnie: they do. The movement is very fun. Unfortunately, the quest story world... it wasn't there for me.
(0:20:15) Jonnie: And you know, it was so far away that I didn't really have any desire to go back. I know they've
(0:20:20) Jonnie: done a number of updates on it. So I think if you're someone who more... you're just like,
(0:20:26) Jonnie: I like farming, I like doing that sort of stuff.
(0:20:29) Jonnie: I think this is a very good game for that.
(0:20:32) Jonnie: If, like me, you prefer more of a story narrative to your games, this is not one too satisfying.
(0:20:40) Codey: Well, maybe that's something maybe that's next after console not what
(0:20:46) Jonnie: Well, they did some work on it, but it was just that the characters were so bland that
(0:20:53) Codey: Oh, I remember this, mm-hmm.
(0:20:54) Jonnie: it just felt like it was, yeah, it was just so far away that I know that I've done some
(0:20:58) Jonnie: work on it, but it's like some work on it would maybe get it to a point where it's
(0:21:02) Jonnie: acceptable.
(0:21:03) Jonnie: It felt, to me, it felt like it needed a huge overhaul and there was a lot of, like, some
(0:21:08) Jonnie: of the major quests in the game, it would kind of, you would get to an important point
(0:21:12) Jonnie: and it would be like, "And you went and did the thing!" and then you wake up the next
(0:21:16) Jonnie: "Oh, okay, I would kind of like to see me doing the thing, that would be, that would be cool!"
(0:21:22) Codey: Would have been cool, I don't know, maybe.
(0:21:26) Codey: Okay, well maybe that'll come later.
(0:21:30) Codey: Next on our list is My Time at Evershine,
(0:21:34) Codey: which I did not remember this game,
(0:21:37) Codey: so my brain thought that this was Ranch of River Shine,
(0:21:42) Codey: which I think was the horse game.
(0:21:45) Codey: This is not that.
(0:21:46) Codey: Next, my time game, so my time at Portia, my time at Sandrock, this is the third installment of that.
(0:21:52) Codey: So the Kickstarter is now live and there is a new fancy trailer.
(0:21:58) Codey: The Kickstarter goal was $200,000 and that goal was hit in 35 minutes.
(0:22:06) Codey: They then unlocked $500,000 in 3 hours, $800,000 in 11 hours,
(0:22:14) Codey: And then, uh, 20--
(0:22:16) Codey: 26 hours was when they reached a million, and at the time--let me see if it's changed drastically since I looked.
(0:22:24) Codey: Uh, yep, it's--it did. It went up 30 more thousand dollars.
(0:22:28) Codey: Um, it is at almost 1.3 million dollars right now. Wild.
(0:22:32) Codey: And it still has quite a way to go.
(0:22:33) Jonnie: Yeah
(0:22:36) Jonnie: It's it's pretty nuts, but this is one of those things that I feel like is
(0:22:42) Jonnie: Just generally good right like I think in general around here
(0:22:47) Jonnie: we're not huge fans of these games, but they clearly have their fans and
(0:22:53) Jonnie: They obviously my time at Sandrock landed because my time at ever shine got funded so well and I feel like
(0:23:01) Jonnie: You know looking at the trailer for my time
(0:23:03) Jonnie: Like it looks like a good next iteration on this formula that is
(0:23:10) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah, um it and they've got a lot of stretch goals that they hit as well
(0:23:16) Codey: Um, so at 200 i'm just going to go through these rapid fire
(0:23:19) Codey: Um, 200 000 was an in-game t-shirt for all backers 250 was uh flirting
(0:23:26) Codey: Uh to build emotional connections with npc's faster. Okay, uh, 300 000 you got the bathtub
(0:23:35) Codey: Okay. 400,000 was player voted interaction so it's a new.
(0:23:40) Codey: Romance interaction players can design and vote on their favorite designs interesting looks like some options might be hug or I can't see that picture very well hug or something else for romance 500,000.
(0:23:54) Jonnie: And it looks like maybe a kiss.
(0:23:56) Codey: Okay, disgusting at 500.
(0:24:00) Codey: It was you unlock they unlocked voting for someone a character from either my time at Portia or my time at Sandrock that can vote.
(0:24:11) Codey: So it would be a character that would come into ever shine 600,000 was swimming 700,000 was hot springs 800,000 was a new special pet Oh, they got me players can submit their designs are taking people's designs 900,000 was a pajama set million was 10 new photo poses and then they put they had hidden goals and of course those goals are unlocked at this point so we have to do that as well.
(0:24:40) Codey: We have the hidden goal of log on will will be Logan Logan will be visiting my time. I don't know. Is this Logan a character a good character from
(0:24:46) Jonnie: - Logan.
(0:24:53) Codey: The thing.
(0:24:54) Jonnie: I don't know.
(0:24:55) Codey: Okay.
(0:24:56) Jonnie: It looks like it's,
(0:24:56) Jonnie: I'm assuming it's a character from my time at Samurai.
(0:24:59) Codey: Okay. Yeah, he has like a cowboy hat thing and then a visitor from the past the builder from Sandrock will visit settlement to with Logan for a story quest, you'll be able to tweak their appearance name and really.
(0:25:11) Codey: To get the desired effect. So that is where we currently that's it.
(0:25:15) Codey: I think we've already got that. No, no, wait, it's not clear to be what's going on with this goal thing. I think it is. Yeah. So at 1.2 million was that and we were already, we're already at that at 1.4 million the stretch goal, you can now adjust your height cue the that should have been option thing and then so that was what we're still going for and at 1.7 million is another romance.
(0:25:40) Codey: Yeah, not gonna play this but cool.
(0:25:41) Jonnie: Look, I keep thinking about whether or not I want to try my time at Samrock just to see
(0:25:47) Jonnie: what they're doing, so I'm not going to commit to not playing this.
(0:25:54) Codey: I don't know it gives me like when I watch the trailer, it's giving like final fantasy vibes and I I didn't like final fantasy internet come at me. Okay.
(0:26:04) Jonnie: I don't say that I don't like Final Fantasy because I've never played Final Fantasy.
(0:26:09) Codey: Okay.
(0:26:10) Codey: cool. This is a safe space.
(0:26:14) Codey: Next up is light year frontier. They have a new neighbors and animals update.
(0:26:21) Codey: So this is an update that will that is out now actually, it became available out a couple days after we're recording but it will be out by the time this comes out.
(0:26:32) Codey: A big question a lot of people had is if they have save files already is that going to work with a new update it will 100% so you're.
(0:26:40) Codey: They will just like if you have an early access save it will just merge right into the new update. I believe this is also a free update, which is cool.
(0:26:51) Jonnie: Ah yeah, so like, yeah Frank, if I remember rightly, is still in demo.
(0:26:55) Codey: Yeah. Oh, no, no, it's in early access now.
(0:26:59) Codey: Early access and it has a demo, but the demo is trying to see it the demo itself is coming down on October 8 so you.
(0:27:10) Codey: Yeah, so you can get if you buy it, then you can access it now and play it now, but if you have I don't think that you're safe from the demo goes over I think it's your save from early access.
(0:27:22) Codey: So the demo was just like a small like if you can just play it for free and see how you like it, but then if you buy it as an early access game, then you'll get access to this update and whatever file you have will move on to the update.
(0:27:38) Codey: This update is including, so it's called.
(0:27:40) Codey: Neighbors and animals, so the neighbors, uh, you invite two new characters, um, to
(0:27:46) Codey: your area and it's a rancher named Diane who of course helps you with the animals.
(0:27:51) Codey: Um, and a field research scientist, uh, named all, it doesn't really say what
(0:27:57) Codey: exactly he is, but he does, he helps you like splice seeds together.
(0:28:02) Codey: Um, and he has flowers in his beard and I love that.
(0:28:06) Jonnie: Yeah, I tried Lightyear Frontier, it didn't really grab me, I guess this is, I think if you were enjoying Lightyear Frontier, this sounds great, but it doesn't seem like a huge uptake from my perspective.
(0:28:15) Codey: Yeah I think like it's just a little bit of extra like a couple characters and
(0:28:24) Codey: then the animals but other than that I don't I also don't really think this is
(0:28:28) Codey: adding that much and I am not a fan of space so. Next on our list is Stardew
(0:28:37) Codey: Valley. 1.6 is now coming to mobile and switch on the fourth of.
(0:28:45) Codey: and concerned ape said quote the console and mobile ports will release at version
(0:28:52) Codey: 1.6.9 which will also come to PC around that time. I'm looking forward to having
(0:28:58) Codey: 1.6 fully released on all platforms then I would like to finish Haunted
(0:29:04) Codey: Chocolate to your next. Thank you. Correct. Correct. So yeah if you
(0:29:06) Jonnie: I will believe it when I see it.
(0:29:08) Jonnie: Sorry, in reference to haunted chocolate yet not 1.6 coming to mobile.
(0:29:16) Codey: console and mobile ports for that are coming out super cool November 4th and so
(0:29:22) Codey: if you've been waiting to jump back in until that it's it's gonna I also like
(0:29:27) Codey: how it's like not only coming to console and mobile at that point but it's also
(0:29:31) Codey: just going straight to like the most updated version and so it's not like oh
(0:29:37) Codey: some are gonna be at 1.6.2 and some are gonna like or anything like that like
(0:29:40) Codey: everyone is going to be up to date at the same time. I really like that.
(0:29:45) Codey: Next we have paleopines. So there are two upcoming DLCs. The trick-or-treat DLC and
(0:29:53) Codey: the spooktacular DLC. We're getting into spooky season y'all. For trick-or-treat,
(0:30:00) Codey: quote, "This DLC is all about a brand new nighttime adventure. Explore paleopines after dark, collect
(0:30:06) Codey: treats from your townsfolk pals, and uncover a mysterious trickster who's up to no good.
(0:30:12) Codey: there's even a cool minigame award off
(0:30:15) Codey: some rewards and a chance to befriend some spooky colored dinos that look like
(0:30:20) Codey: they've crawled straight out of a Halloween movie. I don't think that
(0:30:24) Codey: they've put pictures of this up. Oop there's a trailer video I'm gonna watch
(0:30:29) Codey: it now because just come out of a Halloween movie like I don't know what
(0:30:35) Codey: Halloween movies y'all are watching but if a dinosaur came out looking like what
(0:30:40) Codey: I would expect coming out of a Halloween movie it would be a little gory
(0:30:45) Codey: cuz I watched yeah okay so I just saw one of them was a dinosaur with a pumpkin on
(0:30:46) Jonnie: Yeah, I'm guessing these are going to be a little bit cuter.
(0:30:52) Codey: its head that is actually adorable unfortunately and then spooktacular DLC
(0:31:03) Codey: quote want to make your ranch the spookiest place on the block the
(0:31:06) Codey: spooktacular DLC has everything you need decorate your land with spooky scarecrows
(0:31:11) Codey: bubbling cauldrons and more you can even get in on the fun with some fang
(0:31:15) Codey: fantastic thing thing vampire hot outfits for your rancher dress up and
(0:31:21) Codey: show off the Halloween spirit okay so that is more like I don't know why these
(0:31:26) Codey: are they at different times why are there two why are why are they why are
(0:31:29) Jonnie: Who knows? Who knows?
(0:31:31) Codey: they
(0:31:32) Jonnie: Because more DLC means more money.
(0:31:33) Codey: it's true well I thought that okay I don't know they're cute though if you
(0:31:39) Codey: like paleopines and you're just looking for more skins and cute minigames and
(0:31:44) Codey: stuff, let's come out.
(0:31:45) Codey: Okay, I feel like this is the one that's going to take a lot
(0:31:49) Codey: of our, a lot of our time, unless you don't have too much
(0:31:53) Codey: to talk about it. But I assume you do. Last but certainly not
(0:31:56) Codey: least, tales of the Shire. So on September 22, it was Hobbit Day,
(0:32:02) Codey: because correct me if I'm wrong, that is Bilbo and his uncle's
(0:32:09) Codey: birthday. No, Bilbo and thank you Frodo and Bilbo's birthday.
(0:32:10) Jonnie: Ah, photo of Bilbo's birthday?
(0:32:15) Codey: So that came out on Hobbit Day and it was a 18 minute trailer.
(0:32:18) Codey: It was super cute. What did you think about the trailer?
(0:32:22) Jonnie: I don't think there was anything new revealed in the trailer or in the in the showcase, I think it was mostly just new like more detail on stuff we already knew, so there wasn't a ton, I think that I have to say about it, other than putting a bunch of New Zealanders to speak on camera is like the worst possible choice to get people excited about your game
(0:32:48) Codey: What? I loved it!
(0:32:53) Jonnie: As a people, we are not exciting to listen to and terrible on camera and I was just like this was certainly a choice and not a very good one
(0:32:54) Codey: Did you know anyone who was on camera?
(0:33:06) Codey: Okay, awesome.
(0:33:06) Codey: Because New Zealand is such a tiny place, clearly.
(0:33:09) Codey: You guys all know each other.
(0:33:11) Codey: Well, that's super cool.
(0:33:13) Codey: Okay, but like what, so of the things that we saw some more content on, like did you
(0:33:18) Codey: have anything that you were really jazzed about or anything?
(0:33:21) Jonnie: So for me, the thing that I am most excited about with this is the focus on cooking.
(0:33:28) Jonnie: And for me, it's the idea that the game is built around a specific aspect of cosy games.
(0:33:38) Jonnie: We have had so many cosy games that just do the Stardew Valley thing of,
(0:33:45) Jonnie: "We're going to do all of it, and it's all equally important."
(0:33:50) Jonnie: what I like about this.
(0:33:51) Jonnie: Is that it's like very focused around the thing that is important to Hobbits, right?
(0:33:55) Jonnie: Um, there was a game I recall, I don't think it's ever come out yet, but it's been around
(0:34:02) Jonnie: in the news for a while, which was based around building and owning an inn.
(0:34:06) Jonnie: And the more we learned about that game, the less it felt like it was in any way connected
(0:34:09) Jonnie: to owning an inn, because it just had every feature from every other cozy game.
(0:34:10) Codey: Yeah.
(0:34:15) Jonnie: And that's the thing that has me most excited.
(0:34:18) Jonnie: and you see it through some of the little choices
(0:34:21) Jonnie: that you're making as well, like the fact that it's not a grid based placement system for decorating in your hobbit hole
(0:34:24) Codey: Yup.
(0:34:28) Jonnie: so that it can be a chaotic mess, like I imagine a hobbit hole would be, to me it just feels like those little decisions are...
(0:34:37) Jonnie: it makes sense in the game that they are building and in the world that they are building that game in.
(0:34:42) Codey: Yeah, I really like that was one thing that really stuck out to me is like the customization
(0:34:49) Codey: capabilities of the decorating where it like showed a character putting something on a
(0:34:56) Codey: couch like a pillow and they were able to like position it any way they wanted and like
(0:35:02) Codey: turn it like just like 10 degrees or whatever and just make it like exactly how they wanted
(0:35:07) Codey: it and I thought that I love when games do that like I've always loved it.
(0:35:12) Codey: The Sims, after the first couple of Sims, they've added a way that you can do that.
(0:35:17) Codey: There is a grid-based system, but you can hit a key and then it'll let you put things
(0:35:21) Codey: wherever you want.
(0:35:23) Codey: So it gives more, it doesn't feel as rigid.
(0:35:26) Codey: I super appreciated that about this.
(0:35:29) Codey: They also said as you play, some of the spaces in your home are boarded up, but as you're
(0:35:37) Codey: playing the game, you get access to more of those rooms.
(0:35:40) Codey: get someone to help you.
(0:35:42) Codey: Take the boards off of one door and then they're like, and then you can
(0:35:45) Codey: decorate that room, that room, however you want.
(0:35:48) Codey: And I was like, and they showed a really cool library.
(0:35:50) Codey: And I was like, y'all know, I'm just going to make a lib, all libraries.
(0:35:54) Codey: Right.
(0:35:55) Jonnie: yep
(0:35:57) Codey: I'm going to have a living room, like a living area that has like a desk.
(0:36:02) Codey: Uh, and then of course you have your pantry with all your food and your
(0:36:05) Codey: kitchen and like probably a kitchen table room or what is that called?
(0:36:08) Codey: Dining room, uh, probably a bedroom.
(0:36:11) Codey: right, but every other
(0:36:12) Codey: room that I unlock is just going to be another version of a
(0:36:15) Codey: library because that would be what my house would look like.
(0:36:19) Codey: So I also really, the highlight of the video for me was the art
(0:36:25) Codey: director's dog. There's a moment where he like talks about I
(0:36:28) Codey: don't even know what he says but he starts walking and the camera
(0:36:31) Codey: just like zooms in at his feet and there's just a dog walking
(0:36:34) Codey: next to him. It's this little white poofy dog. So cute. I
(0:36:38) Codey: I loved that.
(0:36:39) Codey: Have you pet that dog?
(0:36:40) Jonnie: have not pet that dog. Okay, I'll add it to the list of things to do next time I'm in Wellington.
(0:36:47) Codey: Okay, cool.
(0:36:49) Codey: The other thing that I really wanted to point out was the cooking mechanic.
(0:36:53) Codey: They really seem to have a lot of options and
(0:36:57) Codey: a lot of different ways that you could do that.
(0:37:00) Codey: So for example, they had, I think you were cooking meat or something, but
(0:37:04) Codey: you were cutting it.
(0:37:05) Codey: And there was an option between going really chunky or really fine cut.
(0:37:12) Codey: It just had to do with how long you chopped for, right?
(0:37:17) Codey: So if you chopped for only a small amount of time, it was on the chunkier side.
(0:37:21) Codey: And then there's a bar that it's the longer you chop that just keeps moving to
(0:37:25) Codey: the right and it's just finer and finer and finer.
(0:37:28) Codey: And it kind of gives you a discrete or a continuous scale.
(0:37:32) Codey: And I really like that cuz it allows for a lot of nuance in cooking.
(0:37:36) Jonnie: Yeah, I agree. Right. For me, that's one of the things that seems like has been done really well about the game is because different recipes, as I understand it, will require like some might want chunkier meat or some might want more finely diced.
(0:37:51) Jonnie: Right. And so you can. And I can't remember if it was shown in this video or a previous one, but there was different sort of flavor scales.
(0:37:58) Codey: Yeah, yeah, it was like smokey, smokey versus something else, yeah.
(0:38:01) Jonnie: So you're actually.
(0:38:04) Jonnie: Exactly. So you're actually cry-
(0:38:06) Jonnie: crafting dishes rather than, rather than just like kind of the standard cooking, right?
(0:38:14) Jonnie: Which is just like do the action on time, which is fine.
(0:38:18) Jonnie: You're doing real cooking and that's very much at the core of the game and it seems like it's got a-
(0:38:25) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah for sure. Um, was there anything else that you wanted to talk about with Tales of the Shire?
(0:38:30) Jonnie: Oh yeah, so the other thing, in general discourse about this game, I see a lot of commentary
(0:38:39) Jonnie: around the art style, and obviously because it's the internet, most of the commentary
(0:38:45) Jonnie: you see is people that don't like it, and for me the art style is unique.
(0:38:52) Jonnie: I totally get why people may not love this art style, but I almost feel like a lot of
(0:38:57) Jonnie: the reaction is because art has become
(0:39:00) Jonnie: a little bit homogenous in games recently and this is a different art style. Yes, like it is
(0:39:08) Jonnie: a relatively simple art style but I think it works for what the game is and it's not something
(0:39:15) Jonnie: that I'm going to sit stand here and say it's my favorite but I think it works and I feel like
(0:39:20) Jonnie: it's getting a lot of overly negative views on the art style simply because it's not
(0:39:27) Jonnie: aligned to what we commonly think of art style.
(0:39:30) Jonnie: Where it's like either your pixel or you know like this kind of you know legend of uh not legend
(0:39:38) Jonnie: of Zelda Breath of the Wild style like you know like it just feels like there's a small number of
(0:39:44) Jonnie: categories now and if you don't fit into one of those then people look at it and go that it's bad.
(0:39:48) Jonnie: But when I look at this I get um uh to me it kind of aligns to the an art style that was sort of
(0:39:56) Jonnie: preeminent in you know mid-2000s. I think of games like Fable.
(0:40:00) Codey: Mmm, yeah.
(0:40:01) Jonnie: And you know Fable is like very English, old England inspired. Obviously Lord of the Rings,
(0:40:08) Jonnie: the Shire, very inspired by that region of the world. So there's something like actually
(0:40:13) Jonnie: that I like about this art style that makes me feel slightly nostalgic. So anyway I just
(0:40:18) Jonnie: see a lot of negative discourse and I think that's largely driven by people being less accepting of
(0:40:24) Jonnie: things that are trying something new and I quite like what this is doing.
(0:40:28) Codey: - Yeah, I think that that was my initial gut reaction too,
(0:40:31) Codey: was like, oh, this is the unknown.
(0:40:33) Codey: Like, ah, spooky.
(0:40:35) Codey: But I feel that like the more I see trailers of it,
(0:40:39) Codey: the more it's like endearing to me.
(0:40:40) Codey: And I think it's just something I just need to get used to.
(0:40:42) Codey: I don't think that it's bad.
(0:40:44) Codey: I think it's just different.
(0:40:45) Codey: And I'm excited to see where it goes.
(0:40:46) Jonnie: Exactly, uh, only other thing is, uh, Lidl. Lidl, best character.
(0:40:52) Jonnie: Lidl is the goose that's got the armour.
(0:40:53) Codey: Oh cute. Cool. Well that is the news. Okay so today we are talking about what games should include
(0:41:06) Codey: farming. So these are games either that we're coming up with off the top of our head or existing
(0:41:11) Codey: games that just like why don't they have a farming aspect to them really. So when this was pitched to
(0:41:19) Codey: to me. I think it was pitched because of some of the conversations that like Al
(0:41:23) Codey: and Kevin had been having. And I was like really sitting there. I was like, man, okay,
(0:41:29) Codey: think of games that are not farming games. My brain went to like Call of Duty. And I was like,
(0:41:36) Codey: no, or like Baldur's Gate. I don't think that's gonna have farming in it. I do know World of
(0:41:42) Codey: Warcraft did have farming in it in the midst of Pandaria expansion. It was actually pretty cool,
(0:41:47) Codey: but it was just kind of like a small little way to get experience with a certain fact.
(0:41:53) Codey: I didn't even think about that!
(0:42:12) Jonnie: The first game that came to mind for me was Skyrim, yeah, to me, yeah, so to me it was
(0:42:24) Codey: Oh my gosh! Okay, elaborate. I'm here for it.
(0:42:28) Jonnie: one of those like Skyrim is such a big game right and when I was thinking about what would
(0:42:37) Jonnie: make sense for a sort of genre to add farming too.
(0:42:43) Jonnie: The thing that really stood out to me is like how would it meaningfully add something to
(0:42:48) Jonnie: the gameplay of the game right and I don't recall if Skyrim had like if you could build
(0:42:56) Jonnie: farms when you could do some of the house building stuff but that was sort of you know
(0:43:01) Jonnie: very limited and you know I guess when I say Skyrim right it's like any sort of Bethesda
(0:43:06) Jonnie: style open world game I kind of feel like this applies to where it would be great if
(0:43:11) Jonnie: if you could...
(0:43:14) Jonnie: just...
(0:43:14) Jonnie: more farming, because farming is a...
(0:43:18) Jonnie: like, often you get resources from farms that exist, right?
(0:43:22) Jonnie: Like, whether it's potatoes or whatever it is.
(0:43:26) Jonnie: But equally, kind of, the more I thought about it, the more the thing that stood out to me
(0:43:32) Jonnie: is the ability to do farming in a way that's slightly different
(0:43:36) Jonnie: because you have so many different locations that you could do farming in.
(0:43:40) Jonnie: and what I started thinking about.
(0:43:41) Codey: Yeah.
(0:43:42) Codey: Oh, I'm sorry.
(0:43:42) Jonnie: was the idea of like, imagine what farming would be like in Fallout, where you have soil that is full of radiation, and maybe you are generating all of these, you know, plants that have mutations on them, or maybe in Skyrim, where you're farming near the mountains, and you know, it's really icy, maybe that changes how you farm, or in a game like Starfield, which nobody played because it was terrible, like, what is it like farming on?
(0:43:44) Codey: I'm sorry.
(0:43:46) Codey: I'm sorry.
(0:43:48) Codey: I'm sorry.
(0:43:50) Codey: I'm sorry.
(0:44:09) Codey: Yeah.
(0:44:12) Jonnie: a planet that's further away from the local star that the planets are orbiting around, so I got really excited about like, the variation that's possible within those sorts of things.
(0:44:20) Codey: Yeah.
(0:44:26) Codey: Yeah, I think that that is really a cool idea, like I'm thinking about, you know, the farm that
(0:44:33) Codey: you would have in like Whiterun or around Whiterun will be completely different than the one around
(0:44:38) Codey: Markarth, which is going to be a higher elevation versus like the one in the swampy area that I
(0:44:46) Codey: hate going to that's gonna have completely different things like it's
(0:44:50) Codey: like water and then like of course the solstheim when you go there there's
(0:44:57) Codey: probably different crops there I'm sure I'm all in for this I did a quick
(0:45:03) Codey: Google and apparently there is like a content creation thing that someone made
(0:45:07) Codey: that does this which I'd prefer it to be there are so many mods you can get for
(0:45:14) Codey: this game it's ridiculous but I don't know it's I would like it to be more of
(0:45:19) Codey: of a, like, in the--
(0:45:20) Codey: game thing. Um...
(0:45:22) Jonnie: Yeah I want it to be inbuilt right because like I can imagine you know like maybe there's a farming guild and you need to go and grow certain crops or at which role might require a farm in like you could I think you could build a lot more story around the nature of farming in an open world game.
(0:45:23) Codey: Yes.
(0:45:41) Codey: Yeah, the only so there's there is one plantation that you can get in the game right now. It's called Golden Hills plantation
(0:45:49) Codey: So you just you start the farm, but then you have to hire a steward hire people to work the farm
(0:45:56) Codey: Tell them them what to plant tell them what to build
(0:46:01) Codey: By animals and then you just come up and the stewards like here's your money. Here's here's the
(0:46:05) Jonnie: Yeah, that doesn't sound correct.
(0:46:06) Codey: Here's the profit and it's like okay, but like I want to do it
(0:46:11) Codey: And there could be magic that is just like growing
(0:46:17) Codey: like helping to grow
(0:46:20) Codey: Trying to think of what magic system conjuration
(0:46:22) Codey: Ah.
(0:46:23) Jonnie: but it could be it could be a new magic system right like because those those games don't really have strong nature based stuff but it exists because you have dry ads and like that the some of the lore exists but it's not something that's been integral to the player character.
(0:46:32) Codey: yeah
(0:46:37) Codey: uh-huh
(0:46:40) Codey: Yeah, it's really not so there's the
(0:46:43) Codey: Six types of magic are alteration, conjuration, destruction, enchanting, illusion, and restoration, but like farming doesn't really fit in
(0:46:50) Codey: Oh my gosh. I am
(0:46:52) Codey: You've sold me. Um, I love Skyrim
(0:46:56) Codey: so
(0:46:57) Codey: I can't believe that didn't come to my mind
(0:47:00) Codey: Um, it's like a whole new skill tree, too
(0:47:03) Codey: Okay
(0:47:03) Jonnie: Yeah, it's- there's so many options, right? What about you, Cody? What was- what was the thing that sort of landed for you?
(0:47:10) Codey: So, of course the lowest hanging fruit the fruit that's basically on the ground at this point, um is pokemon
(0:47:18) Codey: Um and people are gonna be like oh you berries
(0:47:22) Codey: There's so much more that you could do with that
(0:47:24) Codey: um
(0:47:25) Codey: Or like working with pokemon the pokemon that are food already like using them to help
(0:47:32) Codey: You farm like
(0:47:35) Codey: I could see like the
(0:47:37) Codey: Uh olive guy helping you with like trees and he's helping you take care of trees and he gives you advice on like how to
(0:47:46) Codey: Harvest different tree-based fruits
(0:47:48) Codey: um, you know
(0:47:51) Codey: Miltank and other such things, uh, that Wooloo wool so much wool from that baby writer
(0:47:59) Codey: Uh, all the pigs could find truffle. I mean there's like
(0:48:03) Codey: So many options for that
(0:48:05) Codey: There is a player made game when I was googling if this exists or not
(0:48:11) Codey: In any way, there's a player made game that someone said that is going to have this but to my knowledge it has been in
(0:48:18) Codey: creation or like in
(0:48:21) Codey: Development for like a decade at this point so and it's not sanctioned so
(0:48:27) Codey: I am not gonna hold my breath on that
(0:48:30) Codey: Oh.
(0:48:31) Jonnie: And even the ability to use Pokemon for the jobs, whether it's using ground-type Pokemon to help
(0:48:39) Jonnie: level out and create the plots that you farm in, or using Gurdo and Kin to build your farm buildings.
(0:48:50) Jonnie: And just some of those things that are kind of implied already within Pokemon that we never
(0:48:57) Jonnie: really get to do I think would be a very cool
(0:48:59) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:49:02) Codey: The automation would be
(0:49:04) Codey: You befriend a water type Pokemon and every morning its job is to go water all your stuff you befriend a
(0:49:12) Codey: Grass type Pokemon and they fertilize your stuff
(0:49:16) Codey: like it is
(0:49:18) Codey: so like it is
(0:49:20) Codey: It's right there and it could be its own game
(0:49:23) Codey: But I also thought of it as maybe like something that you could do within Pokemon go
(0:49:30) Codey: um
(0:49:31) Codey: One thing that I thought of was if you could have a your farm like at your house
(0:49:37) Codey: so you
(0:49:39) Codey: You get to place a farm in the real
(0:49:42) Codey: But in virtual
(0:49:44) Jonnie: okay I love that idea aside from the fact that it's in Pokemon go because
(0:49:45) Codey: And that is a place that you will go back to and tend things
(0:49:52) Codey: Oh
(0:49:52) Jonnie: that game sucks it's a terrible game but like the idea of like your house being a
(0:49:54) Codey: Oh no!
(0:49:59) Jonnie: farm in a go style game where maybe you have to go out and click seeds or do a
(0:50:06) Jonnie: certain number of steps to grow things that sounds amazing I am I am very into
(0:50:10) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, like okay, but maybe something that you could like connect to Pokemon go so that you could have okay, okay, okay
(0:50:11) Jonnie: that idea
(0:50:16) Jonnie: No, no, no.
(0:50:18) Jonnie: It's strictly better by not being connected to Pokemon Go.
(0:50:19) Codey: Yeah
(0:50:23) Codey: Yeah, so it could be a mobile game and it could be just something that you like
(0:50:27) Codey: physically go out into the world and you befriend these Pokemon and then you bring you've convinced them to come back with you and
(0:50:32) Codey: You could even have maybe multiple farms
(0:50:34) Codey: Where you could have one where you live and one where you work
(0:50:38) Codey: But that's like something that you either that's
(0:50:40) Codey: either the pay to win program or something that you could do
(0:50:47) Codey: like earn like just earn a bunch of currency and then buy like a one use other farm or one week
(0:50:54) Codey: long farm or something like that. I'm not entirely sure of all the logistics but same situation of
(0:50:59) Codey: like you know befriend different Pokemon, find seeds, have your Pokemon bring back seeds like
(0:51:04) Codey: Pikmin basically but Pokemon. I don't know there's like so many different ways you can go with it
(0:51:11) Codey: berries but also just bring in the food because the other thing is like in the newest games they've
(0:51:17) Codey: added so much so many different like cooking mechanics and I you know every week when I
(0:51:22) Codey: listen to IS it's super effective they're talking about Pokemon sleep and how in Pokemon sleep you
(0:51:29) Codey: know your some Pokemon collect certain like someone brings milk and someone else brings
(0:51:34) Codey: this other thing and then you make it into something that Pokemon like or something like
(0:51:38) Codey: like that. So like they already are thinking about the cookie.
(0:51:41) Codey: And that might be like, say you've befriended these starter level or entry level Pokemon,
(0:51:48) Codey: but you know that Snorlax wants a giant donut. So you need to collect all of the resources
(0:51:56) Codey: to craft this giant donut to then go offer it to Snorlax. And if he doesn't like it,
(0:52:03) Codey: he's not moving. But if he likes it, maybe he'll move. And if he really likes it, he'll
(0:52:08) Codey: come live with you.
(0:52:10) Jonnie: that sounds pretty great
(0:52:11) Codey: Yeah, and slowpokes get to keep their tails in that right
(0:52:14) Codey: now. No, no, they get to keep they keep their tail. Though I
(0:52:14) Jonnie: oh slowpoke tail farming back in that sounds great
(0:52:20) Jonnie: I mean I heard what you said
(0:52:22) Codey: wonder I like just put this together that slowpoke dropping
(0:52:27) Codey: drops its tail, right? Or like the people cut its tail off? Or
(0:52:30) Codey: does it drop its tail? Because there are some salamanders that
(0:52:33) Codey: will just straight up drop their tail and regrow it. I mean, it's
(0:52:36) Codey: not, it's not great for them. Like they it takes a lot of
(0:52:39) Codey: energy for them to regrow a table.
(0:52:41) Codey: But it's like better than straight up getting murked.
(0:52:44) Codey: You know, if you, if there's a predator coming, you just drop your
(0:52:47) Codey: tail and it wiggles a bunch.
(0:52:48) Codey: And the predators like, what the heck are that?
(0:52:51) Codey: The more, you know, listeners, let us know if you think Slowpoke is a salamander.
(0:52:56) Codey: Um, uh, do you have any other ideas of like games that could include
(0:53:00) Codey: farming or should include a farming?
(0:53:02) Jonnie: Yeah, so one of the other things I started thinking about was, like, the idea of, you
(0:53:05) Jonnie: know, if we're going to put fun again, like, what's the purpose behind having it and how
(0:53:12) Jonnie: would it change the overall structure of a game?
(0:53:14) Jonnie: And one of the genres I started thinking about was JRPGs, right?
(0:53:18) Jonnie: So something like Dragon Quest or, you know, there's, like, the Octopath Traveller games
(0:53:25) Jonnie: that have come out, you know, one of those sorts of things.
(0:53:29) Jonnie: and what appealed to me is a lot of
(0:53:32) Jonnie: JRPGs follow a similar similar formula where you're traveling around the world
(0:53:36) Jonnie: You know you you routinely encounter bad guys, and you might have like a hub
(0:53:45) Jonnie: World or a hub
(0:53:47) Jonnie: Hub town that you're sort of going to and visiting and it's like so the idea of farming you know initially
(0:53:52) Jonnie: I was thinking like well you you have potions that heal you and all of that sort of stuff wouldn't it be cool if you
(0:53:57) Jonnie: Were farming to acquire some of that stuff which was you know
(0:54:00) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:54:02) Jonnie: Kind of appealing and then the more I thought about it the more
(0:54:05) Jonnie: I was like actually what would be great is many JRPGs. You know it's it's some sort of end of the world scenario
(0:54:13) Jonnie: There's some bad guy who's you know building up an army and those sorts of things and you know everyone in your hub world
(0:54:19) Jonnie: Or the towns you visit they're all down and depressed. I was like wouldn't it be cool if
(0:54:24) Jonnie: you could utilize farming as a way of
(0:54:28) Jonnie: Changing the way you progress through the game and what I was thinking
(0:54:32) Jonnie: about is you know often in a JRPG you go out and grind against you know low
(0:54:35) Jonnie: level mobs to build up experience points that's a fairly routine thing what if
(0:54:40) Jonnie: another option instead of doing that was you went back to the town and you were
(0:54:45) Jonnie: farming and you were sort of contributing to society and that impacted
(0:54:50) Jonnie: the rest of the way you play through the game because maybe the bad guy is
(0:54:53) Jonnie: recruiting less bandits to his cause right because actually those people now
(0:54:57) Jonnie: have a place to live because you've put work into the town so maybe you can
(0:55:02) Jonnie: through a game being weaker or at a lower level than you otherwise might need to be
(0:55:08) Jonnie: because there's like the army is smaller that you're having to fight against
(0:55:12) Jonnie: because you've done good in the world and that really appealed to me as sort of
(0:55:16) Jonnie: a core concept.
(0:55:18) Codey: Yeah, I mean that's kind of what you've already mentioned fable, but wasn't that true and fable that like your actions like impacted
(0:55:26) Codey: Your goodness level or whatever and the way that the game progressed
(0:55:31) Jonnie: It did, yeah, so it was kind of your, it was your light side, dark side meter item, if you did light side stuff, then in theory, I think you got less money, but you know, things were maybe easier or there were less fights to be in.
(0:55:46) Jonnie: I think that was the very light summation of what happened.
(0:55:49) Codey: yeah yeah and so maybe it's like okay here is this enemy force and tackle like it provides
(0:55:59) Codey: you with different different paths of like okay they're because of uh these areas they're like
(0:56:07) Codey: they're like taking advantage the armies are taking advantage of these areas that have less
(0:56:12) Codey: infrastructure less um knowledge about like farming or whatever because they took all the
(0:56:19) Codey: and then you come in and you're like okay let me show you like teach a new generation to do it and
(0:56:23) Codey: then that means like less people get recruited slash maybe like the old people that got like
(0:56:30) Codey: the farmers that got stolen by those armies or something might be able to come home I don't know
(0:56:36) Codey: and then that way that way it's like another it's instead of the direct like okay we're gonna fight
(0:56:42) Codey: them like it's like no you there's other there's more than one way to to fight an army to minimize
(0:56:50) Jonnie: Exactly, yeah. So that idea I think was like, also, yeah, it kind of just stood out and like,
(0:56:57) Jonnie: how do you use farming to do something other than just produce resources to then produce
(0:57:02) Jonnie: more stuff and kind of changing up?
(0:57:05) Codey: That to me like feels very Age of Empires almost like where you have but Age of Empires like makes it so that you end up moving beyond like farming needing as much farming.
(0:57:17) Codey: No, I guess you always still need the same amount of farming. You just become more efficient at it.
(0:57:21) Jonnie: Yeah, I guess I don't recall which game it is. I'm assuming it's something like a civilization
(0:57:26) Jonnie: where there are multiple win states, right? Like it's not always just dominate and kill,
(0:57:26) Codey: Yeah.
(0:57:32) Jonnie: you know, the opposing team. It's like there are more diplomatic styles of victory. And so it's
(0:57:32) Codey: Yep.
(0:57:40) Jonnie: maybe you're, rather than just having to attack, you could build up your farming and, you know,
(0:57:46) Jonnie: maybe you're the supplier of the world's food. And that leads to your victory condition because
(0:57:51) Jonnie: you are strategically important because you supply food, not because you are a military. Yeah.
(0:57:55) Codey: You supply everyone else with food
(0:57:57) Codey: and you threaten to withhold the food.
(0:58:00) Codey: I went real dark, real fast, y'all.
(0:58:03) Jonnie: Cody's like, how do I turn food into a weapon? Done.
(0:58:04) Codey: I need this game.
(0:58:06) Codey: I'm gonna turn basically biological warfare,
(0:58:09) Codey: but based on biological needs,
(0:58:12) Codey: develop strains of food that doesn't produce
(0:58:15) Codey: or that makes people sell those seeds,
(0:58:18) Codey: like seeds that aren't viable to people.
(0:58:21) Codey: I'm going full dark.
(0:58:22) Codey: I'm on my dark run of Fable right now of my world.
(0:58:28) Codey: Man, it's been a hot minute since I played Fable.
(0:58:30) Codey: Now that's gonna be on my mind.
(0:58:33) Codey: Yeah, I could totally see that.
(0:58:34) Codey: And I feel like those games are so,
(0:58:36) Codey: like people play those games a lot.
(0:58:38) Codey: Like I remember people playing like Fire Emblem.
(0:58:43) Codey: Ugh, now I'm trying to think of how to put it
(0:58:44) Codey: into a persona, as Jeff is playing a lot of,
(0:58:47) Codey: but I don't, I don't speak to that, I guess.
(0:58:50) Codey: So the other one that I, I didn't come up with.
(0:58:53) Codey: The other one that, uh, Alan Kev mentioned on the last pod episode was a
(0:58:59) Codey: Mario farming game where Rosalina farms stars.
(0:59:04) Codey: Do you understand what that means?
(0:59:07) Jonnie: I guess, like, Mario is kind of one of those things where you could almost apply it.
(0:59:13) Jonnie: You could almost put Mario characters into any sort of game.
(0:59:19) Jonnie: I don't really know enough about Rosalina to draw the connection to Farming Stars.
(0:59:26) Jonnie: Other than, yeah, I guess that feels like a thing that a Mario game could do.
(0:59:30) Jonnie: For me, the question, though, is going to be what makes it stand out and different and
(0:59:37) Jonnie: as I think a really good example to go back to what we're talking about at the start
(0:59:41) Jonnie: of the episode, you know, Disney Dreamlight Valley, wow, a classic cosy game in a lot
(0:59:46) Jonnie: of its gameplay, really lent into the interaction of the villagers in a way that no other cosy
(0:59:52) Jonnie: game has and in a way that is incredibly done, right?
(0:59:57) Jonnie: And that is the point of difference.
(0:59:59) Jonnie: So for me, I think what I struggle to see with the Mario game and, you know, partly
(1:00:05) Jonnie: because I haven't put any thought into it is like the
(1:00:07) Jonnie: but what would be the thing that makes it different from you.
(1:00:08) Codey: Yeah, I guess I mean like the only reason that you get stars in that game is because
(1:00:17) Codey: you're trying to be a higher level to go save the princess or whatever right and like but
(1:00:24) Codey: what if you've already what are you doing are you just stockpiling in case someone
(1:00:28) Codey: comes and steals your princess.
(1:00:30) Jonnie: Look, I-I think the premise of Mario games is don't think too hard about why you're doing any of this, 'cause it's...
(1:00:38) Codey: I shouldn't be looking for logic in nostalgia.
(1:00:40) Jonnie: Correct.
(1:00:42) Codey: Okay, yeah, there.
(1:00:44) Codey: Alan Kev, feel free in the discord or not discord slack go ham on us if you have better
(1:00:51) Codey: ideas or if you think that we did not do that topic justice for sure.
(1:00:58) Codey: Did you have any other suggestions or any other possible games?
(1:01:01) Jonnie: So the other game idea that I was thinking about was in sort of a metroidvania genre
(1:01:09) Jonnie: where you could, like I can imagine some time to farming, and I'm thinking about a game like a Hollow Knight, where it's, you know...
(1:01:18) Codey: Yeah, I was gonna say I'm immediately my brain is a Hollow Knight right now
(1:01:21) Jonnie: Yeah, so if you sort of think about that as the base, but, you know, all of the enemies are plant-based,
(1:01:28) Jonnie: I can see a world where you're effectively trying to.
(1:01:31) Jonnie: Grow the boss to sort of progress to the next level.
(1:01:36) Jonnie: So, you know, that's that's your reason for exploring where you have to go
(1:01:39) Jonnie: and collect a certain sort of water or unblock a passage so that there's
(1:01:43) Jonnie: enough light shining down to then grow the boss to try and kill it.
(1:01:46) Jonnie: But but ultimately, what I was thinking about in regards to these sorts of games
(1:01:50) Jonnie: is more some of the cool things I think you could do at the end state,
(1:01:53) Jonnie: because my sense of what draws a lot of people into these games is not the
(1:01:58) Jonnie: Like, obviously people enjoy playing through them, but...
(1:02:01) Jonnie: You know, Hollow Knight has a bunch of ridiculous endgame challenges for people to play through.
(1:02:07) Jonnie: And something that appeals to me and feels very tied into the idea of growing and planting things is like...
(1:02:12) Jonnie: What if you start to mix seeds together, right?
(1:02:14) Jonnie: So you have different seeds that represent different bosses, and you get different combinations that come out.
(1:02:20) Codey: Oh my gosh. That is wild. I'm like thinking of like the calm- so you played Hollow Knight, right? But you didn't really like it?
(1:02:29) Jonnie: I'm just generally not a fan of those
(1:02:32) Codey: Okay. Like I'm thinking of the like so dung defender, for example, is one of my favorite
(1:02:40) Codey: bad guys. And then there's another bad guy who's in a really spooky like citadel area. Can't remember
(1:02:45) Codey: his name but I hate him because he was really hard to beat like a merger of those two
(1:02:50) Codey: I would probably just give up the game right there but some people would love
(1:02:55) Codey: that would be like okay it takes like a little bit of one mechanic and a little
(1:03:00) Jonnie: exactly, right? Where, you know, I think you could come up with very interesting challenges based off
(1:03:05) Jonnie: of that. I think, you know, the idea of merging things through the idea of kind of growing,
(1:03:13) Jonnie: you know, a little bit of relation into the spraying of seeds and how that works because
(1:03:18) Jonnie: it doesn't just need to apply to enemies, right? Like it could apply to weapons where maybe you
(1:03:22) Jonnie: have a sword and then you plant the sword and you put in the gun seed and then you've got a sword
(1:03:28) Jonnie: gun and, you know, like...
(1:03:30) Codey: Yeah.
(1:03:30) Jonnie: and maybe how they grow could be different, right?
(1:03:32) Jonnie: Like, 'cause you've got other games in the genre, more like a Dead Cells,
(1:03:37) Jonnie: where you have variation within weapons, and so maybe at the start of your run,
(1:03:42) Jonnie: you plant your seeds for the next run based on what you've got,
(1:03:45) Jonnie: and maybe you get all sorts of weird combination weapons or...
(1:03:49) Jonnie: I guess I just sort of fell in love with the idea of combining things
(1:03:55) Jonnie: in a way that sort of seeds, you know...
(1:03:57) Jonnie: It's almost like inspired by the Animal Crossing.
(1:04:00) Jonnie: You know, cross-pollination of flowers to get new colored flowers, but just, you know,
(1:04:04) Jonnie: and to me it sort of made sense in that Metroidvania sort of style of game.
(1:04:10) Codey: Well and it makes complete sense in some of those games too so because like Hollow Knight is very
(1:04:14) Codey: nature-based I mean they're all like insectoid creatures so and it would make sense that like
(1:04:20) Codey: a thing that you might as a weapon would be like a plant um or plant-based like I'm imagining you
(1:04:28) Codey: grow like a blackberry bush or something you take the thorniest thorn off the blackberry bush but
(1:04:34) Codey: because you spliced the seed or watered the seed with the
(1:04:40) Codey: water from the toxic realm it's poisonous poisonous blackberry thorn
(1:04:46) Jonnie: Yeah, right. And like, that's how that sounds amazing. Right.
(1:04:49) Jonnie: And just the ability to sort of imagine all of the possible combinations.
(1:04:55) Jonnie: And that's the sort of stuff that gets me excited, I think, when I think about game design and game aspects is like,
(1:05:00) Jonnie: how could people way more creative than me take this in so many different.
(1:05:04) Codey: And it could be that each boss you defeat gives you a way to modify a different part
(1:05:14) Codey: of a weapon.
(1:05:16) Codey: So like, "Oh, you defeated this boss by being really fast, so now you can affect the speed
(1:05:21) Codey: of your weapon."
(1:05:22) Jonnie: That'd be amazing
(1:05:24) Codey: And this one did weird stuff where you were really defensive, so now you're able to...
(1:05:30) Codey: Yup!
(1:05:31) Codey: You have all the good ideas.
(1:05:32) Codey: I am NOT a creep
(1:05:33) Jonnie: What else have you got, Cady? Those were all of my ideas, I think.
(1:05:35) Codey: That- that-
(1:05:38) Codey: No, that- so that was it.
(1:05:40) Codey: Pokemon was my big idea, which is very low-hanging fruit.
(1:05:44) Codey: And then the other idea that I pitched is the one that they talked about last time.
(1:05:48) Codey: I really- I was sitting down trying to think about how to add farming to different things
(1:05:54) Codey: and my brain kept going to like games where you collect insects and I was like those all
(1:06:01) Codey: pretty much already have farming in them.
(1:06:03) Codey: or I was trying to think like, what--
(1:06:04) Codey: games would you-- would I add, like, insect collection to, uh, but that--
(1:06:08) Jonnie: and did you come up with any? What game would you add in sect collection to?
(1:06:11) Codey: Oh, for me, it's everything.
(1:06:13) Codey: I mean, every single thing I want insect collection to be added to,
(1:06:17) Codey: because I am an entomologist and it's what I study.
(1:06:20) Codey: Um, I mean, you kind of already do it in Skyrim, but you could do it
(1:06:24) Codey: at like more of a higher level.
(1:06:27) Codey: I'm thinking like the guy who studies the Nirnroot and he wants you
(1:06:31) Codey: to collect Nirnroot from like all over Skyrim.
(1:06:34) Codey: And Oblivion, because it's originally from that one.
(1:06:37) Codey: Um, but like, sorry, it's hidden.
(1:06:40) Codey: Someone who wants you to collect all the insects, um, from all of the different
(1:06:44) Codey: areas, because those are going to be different.
(1:06:45) Codey: Like, you're going to catch different things in Markarth versus, uh, the
(1:06:49) Codey: Rift versus Falkreath, like those areas.
(1:06:52) Codey: Um, but I don't think they ever really do that very much.
(1:06:57) Codey: You basically just like collect a bee and then you can use that in alchemy and
(1:07:01) Codey: collect this other thing and then you can use it in something else.
(1:07:04) Codey: I'm like, I want it just for the natural history aspect of it.
(1:07:08) Codey: And like the collect, like just the, so that you can think.
(1:07:11) Jonnie: I think that's a good point though, from like a, you know, whether it's things like insect catching or farming, all those sorts of things, I think one of the things that appeals to me about it having more of a presence in games is that, like I, we talked at the start about how into, you know, the story of games I am and that includes the world building, and one of the things that I like in games is when they have something like insect collection, and you can tell that they've really thought about,
(1:07:11) Codey: And that is not all.
(1:07:41) Jonnie: that insects interact within the world that they're in, and we haven't just randomly dropped a bunch of moths and flies in, and oh, the one that glows comes out at night, and that was about as much thinking as was put into, into where these things live, right, because I think those little things can add a lot to your experience in a, in a world, and, and sort of building that sense of immersion of, if you are walking through a, you know,
(1:08:11) Jonnie: the right flowery field, and you come across brightly colored insects that, you know, blend in, or whatever those things are, that like, if you just know a little bit, you're like, oh, this makes sense, or this correlates to things that I know from, you know, from science, it's kind of like the more chill version of what Apica was doing.
(1:08:30) Codey: - Yeah, for sure.
(1:08:32) Jonnie: But I like it when that level of thinking is in a game.
(1:08:33) Codey: I mean, yeah.
(1:08:35) Codey: And this is another thing that just from this conversation,
(1:08:38) Codey: my brain has just like jumped to a different thing.
(1:08:43) Codey: Why is it that when in these games,
(1:08:48) Codey: when you catch a fish or a bug,
(1:08:51) Codey: you automatically know what it is
(1:08:53) Codey: versus when you catch collect like a geode or a fossil,
(1:08:58) Codey: like you need to take it to a specialist.
(1:09:00) Codey: I can tell you right now I get so many messages from my friends who are like
(1:09:05) Codey: what is this and they will straight-up misidentify insects. They'll be like it's
(1:09:09) Codey: it's a yellow jacket and I'm like it's not it's not gonna hurt you it's actually
(1:09:13) Codey: a bee or oh this is a bee nope that's actually a wasp. Oh look at this fly
(1:09:20) Codey: that's a beetle but okay like it's real cool. What?
(1:09:23) Jonnie: So me and some friends, we do a lot of hiking,
(1:09:26) Jonnie: and part of that is we see a lot of birds,
(1:09:28) Jonnie: and so we kind of like to identify birds.
(1:09:28) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:09:30) Jonnie: And our joke is anytime anyone sends a picture of a bird,
(1:09:35) Jonnie: and tries to identify, the instant response is,
(1:09:37) Jonnie: it's a sparrow, 'cause we just assume
(1:09:38) Jonnie: that everything is a sparrow.
(1:09:39) Jonnie: So it could be the most amazing thing,
(1:09:40) Codey: True
(1:09:41) Jonnie: we're just like, that's a sparrow.
(1:09:42) Codey: I mean that is very fair
(1:09:45) Codey: but
(1:09:46) Codey: We're like here in the United States and like where we're at. It's warblers like every kind of it's just a warbler
(1:09:51) Jonnie: Mmm. Yeah.
(1:09:52) Codey: It's always a warbler
(1:09:54) Codey: Just another type of bird
(1:09:56) Codey: but like
(1:09:57) Codey: People in a lot of these games. It's just like you've collected the super rare
(1:10:03) Codey: Striped green Sphinx moth or the super rare. There were a couple that I just collected in the game
(1:10:10) Codey: that I in Core Island that I was like, this is really niche and like
(1:10:16) Codey: No one could just like collect it and know what that is
(1:10:20) Codey: Like I I want there to be a system where you collect a bug like in Core Island
(1:10:24) Codey: For example, where you collect a bug, but you aren't skilled enough to know what it is yet
(1:10:29) Codey: So it's just like mystery beetle or mystery fly and then you have to take it to Elinor who is amazing by the way
(1:10:36) Codey: Why can't I romance the elder entomology?
(1:10:40) Codey: That's who I want to marry. It's not Scott. Scott's the proxy.
(1:10:41) Jonnie: Cuz all people are gross Cody
(1:10:44) Codey: They don't deserve love.
(1:10:45) Jonnie: Correct that's what that's what all of these games the teacher gets
(1:10:48) Jonnie: You
(1:10:49) Codey: I love Eleanor so much. I give her an insect every time I see her.
(1:10:55) Codey: She's like one of the only people in the village that are in the town that like accept
(1:10:59) Codey: an insect as a gift and are like, she's like, "Oh my gosh, how did you know I would love
(1:11:03) Codey: this?" and I'm like, "Because I know you." But yeah, I want, I, I, because the other
(1:11:10) Codey: How much of a rabbit hole do I want to get down to?
(1:11:12) Codey: I get worried that it's going to have people just think that they can just pick something
(1:11:17) Codey: up and know what it is. When like, because it happens online, people will be like, "Oh,
(1:11:22) Codey: this is this kind of bee." Like, "Oh, this is a Lacey O'Glossum curtainata or something
(1:11:28) Codey: like that." And I'm like, "Really? You identified that from this tiny, tiny little grainy, like
(1:11:33) Codey: yeti picture that you took on your phone when one of the world experts on that group."
(1:11:40) Codey: You can't identify them when they're under a microscope? Like, you, you, you think that
(1:11:44) Codey: you did that? Really?
(1:11:46) Jonnie: I don't think games are at risk of perpetuating that, it's just stupid people plus the internet, that's really the main driver of that one.
(1:11:55) Codey: I would love for it to be like a mystery thing and then you have to research it and then you have to like look at it and be like, "Oh wow, it's this because of this reason."
(1:12:05) Codey: I just want an entomology game, for real.
(1:12:06) Jonnie: What? No way. That had not come across at all through this conversation.
(1:12:10) Codey: I just want a game that's 100%.
(1:12:13) Codey: You catch bugs in all the different areas and then you have to look at them under a microscope and exactly be like, "Oh it's a beetle because it has hardened elytra and it's a fly because it only has two wings and it has two hull tiers instead of pine wings."
(1:12:25) Codey: Oh, it's this, blah, blah, blah, blah.
(1:12:27) Jonnie: So listeners, if you were ever curious of whether or not Cody enjoyed her job
(1:12:28) Codey: That's what I want.
(1:12:32) Jonnie: I think the fact that the game that you most want is just your job as a game
(1:12:38) Codey: My job.
(1:12:40) Codey: It is.
(1:12:41) Codey: It really is.
(1:12:44) Codey: I would love so much.
(1:12:45) Codey: Okay.
(1:12:46) Codey: Well, yeah, that's all I had.
(1:12:47) Jonnie: I think that's all I had as well.
(1:12:47) Codey: I've now gone rant, rant over.
(1:12:50) Codey: Um, well, so that is it for this episode.
(1:12:56) Codey: Where can people find you on the internet, Johnny?
(1:12:58) Jonnie: As always, if you want to chat about anything we've talked about, if you've got some cool ideas for games that should include farming, go to patreon.com/thspot.
(1:13:10) Jonnie: If you sign up for the Patreon, you get access to the Slack where we berate Al and Kevin over their terrible tier lists.
(1:13:16) Codey: We do. And every now and then I post pictures of my dogs or the myriad tattoos that I get.
(1:13:25) Codey: I just had to stop myself from getting another one. My bank account is very happy that I did that,
(1:13:31) Codey: but I don't know, lots of see lots of cool stuff. Bugs. I post pictures of bugs sometimes. Not as
(1:13:37) Codey: often as I would probably like to. I should probably post more. So that's where you could
(1:13:42) Codey: You can also find me, or you can see the Durange postings.
(1:13:47) Codey: That I do on Instagram. My Instagram handle is hikingbeagle, B-E-Eagle.
(1:13:54) Codey: And that is the only place I'm going to say that I am because all of the other places are awful.
(1:14:00) Codey: You can find Al to tell him about why, ask him about why he only likes red-headed women and Linus.
(1:14:12) Codey: at thescotbot on mastodon.scot and on Twitter.
(1:14:16) Codey: You can find the podcast on Tumblr and Twitter at THSPod.
(1:14:21) Codey: At our website, you can provide feedback and receive the links to all of our show notes,
(1:14:29) Codey: including the transcripts of each episode are available in our show notes.
(1:14:35) Codey: And that is at HarvestSeason.club.
(1:14:38) Codey: And there you can access the Patreon that Johnny just mentioned and come and join the
(1:14:44) Codey: the fun and tell us what you want to
(1:14:46) Codey: have a episode on. Let us know if you want more of me just ranting, though I
(1:14:52) Codey: don't know how many people actually want to listen to that. Thank you, Johnny, for
(1:14:56) Jonnie: At least one, Cody. At least one.
(1:15:02) Codey: joining me, and until next time, have a good harvest.
(1:15:04) Jonnie: Thanks, Cody.
(1:15:06) Jonnie: Have a good harvest!
(1:15:07) Theme Tune: The harvest season is created by Al McKinlay, with support from our patrons, including our
(1:15:18) Theme Tune: pro farmers, Kevin, Stuart and Alisa.
(1:15:22) Theme Tune: Our art is done by Micah the Brave, and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
(1:15:26) Theme Tune: Feel free to visit our website, harvestseason.club, for show notes and links to things we discussed
(1:15:32) Theme Tune: in this episode.
(1:15:42) Jonnie: Good we were like opposite ends of the speed spectrum
(1:15:46) Jonnie: Uhhh...
(1:15:47) Codey: Dude, I feel like I'm dialed into how Al does it.
(1:15:51) Codey: So I do it a very specific way.
(1:15:55) Codey: And yeah, maybe we should--
(1:15:59) Codey: yeah, you are not--
(1:16:03) Codey: and that is cooler and more original.
(1:16:05) Codey: And I appreciate that about you.
