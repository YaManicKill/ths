# Transcript

(0:00:30) Jonnie: Hello Divers and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Jonny.
(0:00:35) Kev: And my name is Kevin.
(0:00:37) Jonnie: And we're here today to talk about... Cottagecore games!
(0:00:40) Kev: Are-- no, or-- well, is Dave Cottagecore?
(0:00:43) Kev: I don't know.
(0:00:45) Kev: Maybe?
(0:00:45) Jonnie: I'm pretty sure it's Cottagecore. Like, it's very... It's very Cottagecore.
(0:00:49) Kev: Yeah.
(0:00:50) Kev: It's Vibes, right?
(0:00:51) Jonnie: Yeah, I think... Yeah, yeah.
(0:00:53) Jonnie: I think this is gonna end up being episode 3 in Dave the Diver month, because, you know, I caused a bit of chaos for Al and...
(0:01:00) Jonnie: We shuffled the episodes!
(0:01:04) Jonnie: As always, transcripts are available... Transcripts are available in the show notes and on the website.
(0:01:08) Jonnie: But today, the topic that we're going to be talking about is the Dredge DLC.
(0:01:14) Jonnie: Kiv, we're a year on for when we first covered Dredge as a part of fishing month, which was this time last year.
(0:01:17) Kev: Jeez, I guess it has been a year.
(0:01:23) Jonnie: Dredge, definitely not Cottagecore. Dave the Diver, more Cottagecore than Dredge.
(0:01:27) Jonnie: That's what I'm going to say, even with the Dredge elements thrown in.
(0:01:28) Kev: Yep, you know what, there is farming in Dave, so close enough.
(0:01:30) Jonnie: So, as always, no news for this episode. There will be a bit of a catch-up in a couple of weeks
(0:01:45) Jonnie: when we're all back to recording at... Just a little bit ahead of when the episodes are released,
(0:01:51) Jonnie: instead of a lot ahead of when the episodes are released. But what have we been up to?
(0:01:55) Jonnie: Kiv, what have you been up to?
(0:01:56) Kev: Um, so actually just this week, I actually hit credits on Dave the Diver, the whole thing.
(0:02:03) Kev: Um, so I guess, you know, I'll say that for a second when we get to the main topic, but
(0:02:09) Kev: um, I spent a lot of time doing that, but other than that, um, the big one, have you
(0:02:14) Kev: heard of Zenless Zone Zero?
(0:02:16) Jonnie: I have not.
(0:02:16) Kev: Okay.
(0:02:17) Kev: Have you heard of miHoYo?
(0:02:19) Kev: I sure hope you have.
(0:02:21) Jonnie: No.
(0:02:22) Kev: Okay.
(0:02:23) Kev: Okay, um, have you heard of genshi?
(0:02:23) Jonnie: I don't know any of these words.
(0:02:26) Kev: It may not work.
(0:02:28) Jonnie: Yes, that's like the...
(0:02:30) Jonnie: That's like the...
(0:02:30) Kev: That may not work.
(0:02:32) Jonnie: The big titty...
(0:02:34) Jonnie: Gacha game, right?
(0:02:38) Kev: That's correct. Well, that descriptor might not be narrow enough, but yes, you're on the right track.
(0:02:44) Jonnie: Okay.
(0:02:44) Jonnie: It's the really popular big titty.
(0:02:46) Kev: Yeah, the really popular one. Yeah, that one. It's not nike.
(0:02:52) Kev: So, miHoYo is the company/developer.
(0:02:56) Kev: We're behind Genshin Impact.
(0:02:58) Kev: They have, since Genshin published a few other, released a few games.
(0:03:04) Kev: One of them called Honkai Star Rail, which is very similar to Genshin, but that one's turn-based while Genshin is a Breath of the Wild style game.
(0:03:14) Kev: And then, just, I think at the start of July, they released a game called Zenless Zone Zero, which again, very similar.
(0:03:23) Kev: Similar which has gotcha mechanics
(0:03:26) Kev: Animes style type thing
(0:03:28) Kev: the genre this time is more of a
(0:03:32) Kev: Character action game for lack of a better word of putting it and think near automata that will make fry
(0:03:38) Kev: The mash buttons and get hit lots of enemies basically
(0:03:42) Kev: The game is free. I got it on my playstation, but you could even get it on mobile
(0:03:49) Kev: It is terrifying how excellent the game is
(0:03:55) Kev: the actual
(0:03:56) Kev: combat portion is
(0:03:59) Kev: simple compared to other games, but it is a
(0:04:02) Kev: Very it feels good. It controls very well
(0:04:06) Kev: the visual presentation is
(0:04:09) Kev: Beyond stellar the it has a very it very strong aesthetic like a urban cyberpunk ish kind of thing
(0:04:19) Kev: The the other colors are bright the music is
(0:04:23) Kev: Phenomenal, even the UI feels Persona.
(0:04:27) Kev: Very, very nice.
(0:04:30) Kev: It is, as with the other ones, it does have the gacha mechanic for different characters you can play as.
(0:04:37) Kev: But here's the great thing, right? I don't really care about most of the characters, so I'm okay.
(0:04:44) Kev: I did a pull or two or whatever and got some characters, but I'm not hurtin' like some other games might be.
(0:04:52) Kev: Um... yeah.
(0:04:53) Jonnie: So I've just looked this up in the background while you've been talking about it and like because I'm a bit of a sucker
(0:04:58) Jonnie: for a for a gacha game
(0:04:59) Jonnie: But there was something about like the Genshin impacts and Honkai star rails and never really pulled me and I was like
(0:05:04) Jonnie: I don't know I feel like this one's this one and hearing me talk about it sounds pretty good because it's been a sucker for
(0:05:08) Jonnie: a long time and
(0:05:11) Jonnie: Like so my first real experience with with gacha games was our Final Fantasy record keeper. I don't know if you recall
(0:05:18) Kev: Oh, that's a deep thought. All right.
(0:05:20) Jonnie: That one yeah, and I go really into
(0:05:23) Jonnie: that one which was weird because like that's like the only Final Fantasy game
(0:05:26) Jonnie: I've ever played right so I have no connection to the characters it just
(0:05:30) Kev: Hahaha!
(0:05:30) Jonnie: turns out that I really like those sorts of games and then slightly more recently
(0:05:33) Kev: Okay.
(0:05:35) Jonnie: there was the Marvel Strike Force uh gotcha that was yeah I well I don't know
(0:05:38) Kev: Okay.
(0:05:39) Kev: Oh, that was Gotcha? I didn't realize that.
(0:05:43) Jonnie: if it was exactly gotcha I can't remember exactly the the recruitment
(0:05:48) Jonnie: mechanics but it was kind of like enough of overlap where it was you know just
(0:05:52) Jonnie: designed to get you to put money
(0:05:53) Jonnie: in for absurd you know resource upgrading stuff to five stars
(0:05:54) Kev: Sure. It's designed, yeah, designed for the micro-generated action shirt.
(0:06:00) Jonnie: exactly and so I kind of been feeling the pool and there was there was one
(0:06:00) Kev: Um...
(0:06:07) Jonnie: afk journey that was like all over ads on every platform like two or three
(0:06:12) Kev: Yeah, oh, yeah.
(0:06:12) Jonnie: months ago and I downloaded that tried that one that one that one didn't quite
(0:06:16) Jonnie: grab me it had some pretty cool mechanics going on but it just there
(0:06:19) Jonnie: wasn't maybe quite enough going on. But yeah, I guess given the
(0:06:23) Jonnie: legacy of the developer and me maybe feeling like I'm ready to
(0:06:27) Jonnie: be heard again by another Gachi game. I've just downloaded
(0:06:28) Kev: Yeah
(0:06:30) Jonnie: this one.
(0:06:31) Kev: Okay, um well dang yeah, yeah, I've heard of afk journey. I think I heard you talk about it
(0:06:39) Kev: but
(0:06:40) Jonnie: I probably did. I probably talked about it on the show.
(0:06:41) Kev: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's been a minute. But um, I
(0:06:46) Kev: Mean like if you are in need of another gotcha to anyone else like I can heartily recommend this one
(0:06:52) Kev: like you know, I'm still
(0:06:55) Kev: early in pretty much. I don't think I played a full week at this point.
(0:06:59) Kev: Maybe. I haven't hit any huge road blocks. What's fun about this one is there's a lot of skill to the component, right?
(0:07:09) Kev: Because you can dodge attacks and parry and stuff like that, right? So, you know, you can, you don't feel bottlenecked by not having S rank characters or whatever.
(0:07:20) Kev: Yeah, I got through, they give you three starter characters and I got through most of it.
(0:07:25) Kev: pretty much everything I played up to now with those three
(0:07:28) Kev: because I enjoyed them.
(0:07:30) Kev: I'm sure some people might dig some of the other characters, I don't think there's one or two that I think are cool, but I'm not dying to get them.
(0:07:40) Kev: I haven't wailed yet, as the term goes.
(0:07:44) Kev: There is a bear, there's a playable bear there, that's kind of fun.
(0:07:48) Kev: He's a bear with a big cinder block, like cement blocking, I don't know what it is, he works in a construction company.
(0:07:56) Kev: company.
(0:07:56) Kev: Anyways.
(0:07:58) Kev: No, it's great, it's free, the biggest con I think it has, well, it's free to download,
(0:08:03) Jonnie: Kevin, you can't keep saying a gacha game is free. We all know they're not really free. They're like fake-free.
(0:08:10) Kev: free to start.
(0:08:15) Kev: But the biggest knock I have against it aside from, you know, the trappings of the genre,
(0:08:22) Kev: the gacha mechanics or whatever.
(0:08:25) Kev: The game is just fake.
(0:08:29) Kev: Filled to the brim with nonsense words and features and holy mackerel it is overwhelming.
(0:08:38) Kev: Because they have to make up a name for every little thing, there's bangboos and proxies and carrots and oh my goodness it's beyond overwhelming.
(0:08:51) Kev: But that's okay because when I get to the actual little gameplay where I fight stage-full venomous,
(0:08:58) Kev: none of that matters and I enjoy myself.
(0:09:03) Kev: So yeah, if you can get past the wave of just overwhelming nonsense, jargon, techno-babble, I think it's a great time.
(0:09:15) Jonnie: Awesome, I am looking forward to getting sucked into this whole-
(0:09:18) Kev: He's sick. Let me know when you get in and we can...
(0:09:22) Kev: Geez, I don't know what multiplayer stuff there is but we can at least talk about our units.
(0:09:28) Jonnie: Exactly exactly
(0:09:30) Kev: What's your favorite JPEG that you pulled?
(0:09:32) Kev: Okay, but yeah, that's all I've been really up to aside from Dave. What about you, Johnny? What's been going on with you?
(0:09:41) Jonnie: Nothing too much I kind of been dead for the last month
(0:09:44) Jonnie: So I think last time I was on the show Al and I were talking about starstruck vagabond
(0:09:50) Jonnie: and
(0:09:51) Jonnie: The couple of days before we recorded that episode work called me and I said hey
(0:09:55) Jonnie: We need someone to go on an international trip.
(0:09:58) Jonnie: For like two weeks, in like three days, how would you like to be that person?
(0:10:02) Jonnie: And I was like shocked, because it was an international trip, but it was an international trip home.
(0:10:07) Jonnie: So I got up at 4am to record that episode with Al, and then immediately went to the airport to get on a flight to disappear for two weeks.
(0:10:14) Jonnie: Which was great.
(0:10:16) Jonnie: And then I got back, and as happens with international travel now, you sit on a plane with a bunch of other gross humans, and then you come back and you get really sick.
(0:10:24) Jonnie: um and so that's kind yeah
(0:10:24) Kev: Oh, yeah, good time.
(0:10:28) Jonnie: so that's kind of what happened with me. I just got really sick and uh I feel like there's two
(0:10:34) Jonnie: there's two versions of being sick right like there's the version when you feel poorly you
(0:10:40) Jonnie: probably shouldn't be out in public but kind of mentally you're fine right and like it's one of
(0:10:44) Jonnie: those great times of being sick where you can sit down you play video games
(0:10:46) Kev: Yeah, sure the maybe more inconvenient time or what have you yeah, I get that
(0:10:53) Jonnie: Then there's the sort of sick where your brain just doesn't work and all you want to do is sleep or do the most mindless activity possible.
(0:11:05) Jonnie: And I was in the second category so I have literally not played anything for about a month and a half now.
(0:11:05) Kev: And of course, jeez Louise, what did you have?
(0:11:14) Kev: What took you out of that long?
(0:11:15) Jonnie: I don't know like it was well so was the travel like I didn't get to put the time to play any game cells on the travel and then it was just.
(0:11:23) Jonnie: What are those sicknesses that like it just kind of wiped me out for about a week it was probably covered if I'm being honest.
(0:11:30) Jonnie: And then by the time I was kind of better work was then crazy enough that it was just like the brain space to actually sit down and play something was just not there.
(0:11:39) Jonnie: So I literally have not played anything in a couple of weeks.
(0:11:40) Kev: Mmm good times
(0:11:42) Jonnie: And then as I started to feel better the Olympics started and I am very into watching the Olympics in Australia.
(0:11:52) Jonnie: the olympic sta-
(0:11:53) Jonnie: I really like they start their day at about 6 30 our time so you kind of get home and you're
(0:11:57) Jonnie: like making dinner and the olympics is just firing up for the day so you can get very sucked into
(0:12:00) Kev: Oh, that's nice, that's good timing.
(0:12:03) Jonnie: yeah it's it's really good timing um this week in particular i've got really into watching judo
(0:12:09) Jonnie: uh which is a it's so cool it's such a cool sport uh not a sport that I have any interest in doing
(0:12:09) Kev: Oh, Judo's so cool.
(0:12:16) Jonnie: like sometimes you watch an olympic sport and you think oh could I do that judo zero interest in
(0:12:20) Jonnie: doing, but man it's a cool sport.
(0:12:22) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I haven't followed Judo.
(0:12:25) Kev: Have there been gold medalists yet?
(0:12:28) Jonnie: - Yeah, there's been medals, I think.
(0:12:31) Jonnie: I think they're through most of the judo now,
(0:12:34) Jonnie: but it's just been really interesting sort of, you know,
(0:12:36) Jonnie: seeing like, it's one of those martial arts
(0:12:38) Jonnie: that's very, like most martial arts, very technique driven.
(0:12:42) Jonnie: But I guess it kind of being that more grapple
(0:12:44) Jonnie: or throw style has been very interesting for me.
(0:12:47) Jonnie: And it's one of the things that I love about the Olympics
(0:12:49) Jonnie: is learning about weird niche sports
(0:12:52) Jonnie: that you don't really see any other time
(0:12:54) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Well, first off, on Judo, I did Taekwondo when I was younger, for many,
(0:12:55) Jonnie: and getting into it.
(0:12:56) Jonnie: Have you watched any of the Olympics, kid?
(0:13:02) Kev: many years, actually. So I love martial arts. Judo, obviously, is a different beast, because
(0:13:08) Kev: it feels almost at times like one move, a touch of death sort of thing. So the, you know, the mental
(0:13:16) Kev: dance, the standoff feels extra intense, in my opinion. But I...
(0:13:24) Kev: Personally, I've caught up with a lot of the highlights and, you know, headlines and things
(0:13:30) Kev: like that. I haven't really sat down to watch many of the events themselves. I've watched
(0:13:33) Kev: some of the gymnastics stuff, because out in the United States, we have, you know, it's a mobile.
(0:13:38) Kev: So, of course, that gets the, well, the press coverage. But I will say, this Olympics probably
(0:13:45) Kev: the strongest memes to come out. Maybe all of them. Shooting in particular. Hats off to that
(0:13:53) Kev: Turkish guy.
(0:13:55) Jonnie: That Turkish guy is so cool. He makes every other shooter just look super friggin lame.
(0:13:55) Kev: Okay. Okay.
(0:14:00) Jonnie: Like I don't like shooting. Like I hate it when they have all of the eye masks and everything
(0:14:06) Jonnie: else. It's the same with archery where it's like to me the skill is meant to be in you the human
(0:14:11) Jonnie: doing it. Not having all of this stuff to point you and having it be a good contest and like how
(0:14:15) Jonnie: still can you hold your arm. So I think that dude makes the rest of the shooters look hella
(0:14:16) Kev: The-
(0:14:20) Kev: Oh, absolutely, the- like, the- you know, the picture, the picture once he- like, the part that kills me is his other hand's just in his pocket.
(0:14:28) Kev: Like, he's not, you know, doing it to a hand at old or anything, just- just bam.
(0:14:28) Jonnie: - Yeah, it's (laughs)
(0:14:33) Kev: Uh, I don't know if you ever heard, but he- it turns out he actually did, in fact, serve in the Turkish military.
(0:14:38) Kev: And he, uh, actually did the same thing like 10 years ago, where he got- I don't- I don't know if it was what, uh, event it was,
(0:14:45) Kev: but he did some shooting and.
(0:14:47) Kev: No, no, no equipment was over.
(0:14:49) Kev: Wild, wild stuff.
(0:14:50) Jonnie: Yeah, he won a world championship like 11 years ago or something like that, yeah
(0:14:50) Kev: Um, okay.
(0:14:53) Kev: That's what it was.
(0:14:54) Kev: Okay.
(0:14:54) Kev: Yeah.
(0:14:55) Kev: Um, oh yeah, good, good stuff.
(0:14:58) Kev: Um, yeah, Olympics, good time.
(0:15:01) Jonnie: The other spot I'm going to talk about briefly, because I find the acts mind-blowing and how they do it even more insane, but it's synchronized diving.
(0:15:10) Kev: Oh, oh, yeah, I saw I did see some of that
(0:15:13) Kev: that's
(0:15:14) Kev: Insane insane. What was it? China that did the two women? I think I think there's women that uh,
(0:15:19) Jonnie: Yep, there's that video of them diving side by side, and the first time you watch it you think there's just one of them because they are that in sync.
(0:15:20) Kev: Yeah, you know the one though with the red
(0:15:27) Jonnie: It's so good. And those people are so, they're so impressive. It's just the technique to do that individually combined with having to time that perfectly with another human being is insane.
(0:15:33) Kev: Oh, yeah
(0:15:41) Kev: it really is like holy moly it's like specific rib they're moving in sync they're sharing the
(0:15:48) Kev: same brain path that's it's oh man you're right sync synchronized diving is is so cool so cool
(0:15:54) Jonnie: Cool, um, the only other thing I want to bring up, it's somewhat news, but I just
(0:16:01) Jonnie: saw that the the hardy hank plush is now out on makeshift. I'm like really 50/50 on it if
(0:16:08) Kev: Oh, it is really good. I'm yup. Yeah. Yeah, the good good call cuz well, I guess I don't know when people are gonna listen to this one. It'll probably still be up the campaign or whatever. But yeah, I think that thank thank from Baren breakfast as a makeshift plush. It's really, really good. I'm I'm hurting cuz I'm hoping I can get it. I'm I'm doing the best the budgeting to do it, but it is really good.
(0:16:08) Jonnie: I want to get it because it's so cool.
(0:16:36) Jonnie: All right, well shall we get into Dave the diver X
(0:16:42) Kev: Let's dive right in okay, so first off
(0:16:45) Kev: I'm gonna update my thoughts because when I talked with Al we I don't know if it's like chapter 2 or 3 something like
(0:16:51) Kev: That and like I said, I hate credits this week
(0:16:55) Kev: So all the stuff I said in the episode maintains true I like the mechanics I
(0:17:02) Kev: like the fish part of it
(0:17:05) Kev: the I did more bosses and
(0:17:08) Kev: It's interesting how they approach bosses
(0:17:12) Kev: some of them were fairly challenging, I think
(0:17:16) Kev: Al was right that they add a lot of weird one-off mechanics later in the game
(0:17:21) Kev: Which I didn't mind as much as him, but it is an interesting design choice to say the least
(0:17:28) Kev: The story was you know
(0:17:31) Kev: Very basic or whatever, but it was for their fun characters
(0:17:36) Kev: and
(0:17:38) Kev: Seeing some of the the horrors of the deep good times good times
(0:17:43) Kev: And I'm not even talking about the mutated dredge whores. I'm talking about the regular whores
(0:17:47) Kev: Yeah, but I mean overall I really really enjoyed it. I did the Godzilla DLC as well
(0:17:53) Kev: That was super fun and enjoyable
(0:17:56) Kev: We have another episode on that so I won't get into detail, but yeah two thumbs up for me on Dave the diver overall
(0:18:03) Kev: What about you Johnny?
(0:18:07) Jonnie: No, and I have to say I did not get into Dave the Diver that much, and so you kind of like roped into doing this diving, you know, thing, anyway, and then Goncho shows up and he's like, he shows up and he's like, you're going to be my waitress now and like serve people, which you do did the tutorial of that, I got everything perfect, right, I put everyone's tea perfectly.
(0:18:33) Jonnie: And his immediate comment was "It was a bit sloppy."
(0:18:37) Jonnie: I was just like f\*ck off and I turned the game off and I haven't played it since.
(0:18:38) Kev: Oh good times, that's...
(0:18:41) Jonnie: Like that, it really, it really annoyed me.
(0:18:43) Jonnie: Yeah, okay, I need to do a version of that without Squirt.
(0:18:45) Jonnie: I need to do a version of that without Squirt, it just like, it rained me so much.
(0:18:52) Jonnie: Yeah, so I probably didn't get into Dave the Diver that much.
(0:18:56) Jonnie: I didn't really like the start of the game, I guess to be blunt.
(0:19:01) Jonnie: I didn't like the serving aspect of the sushi side of things.
(0:19:07) Jonnie: I want to play Dave the Diver, not Dave the Waitstaff.
(0:19:09) Kev: Yeah, you know what, you're right, it is, that's a very minimal part of the game, like, you could probably skip that whole gameplay portion, like manage the restaurant maybe, but yeah, you know, that part is more or less negligible because the diving portion is absolutely the bread and butter, the main sell of the game.
(0:19:11) Jonnie: I
(0:19:30) Jonnie: Yeah, and so when they said like oh now and the way I feel like it's done is where the the sushi chef
(0:19:37) Jonnie: Just like forces you to
(0:19:39) Jonnie: Serve the sushi. I just didn't get why that was even in
(0:19:44) Jonnie: The game like that to me like there's nothing
(0:19:48) Jonnie: fun or enjoyable about
(0:19:50) Jonnie: That it's not like I'm not playing Dave the server at a restaurant. I'm playing Dave the diver
(0:19:57) Jonnie: I want to go diving and bring stuff back and have that yet
(0:20:00) Jonnie: Do all of the upgrades and all of those sorts of things that that you and I talked about on the first episode
(0:20:05) Jonnie: That sounded great, but I don't want to have this
(0:20:10) Jonnie: Stupid minigame. I have to do
(0:20:12) Jonnie: Every you know after every couple of dives to go and do it and I didn't like the way it was done
(0:20:19) Jonnie: Like I thought the the goncho the the character the way he kind of forces you into doing it
(0:20:26) Jonnie: Really brought to me the wrong way. I thought the whole approach of that character was really annoying
(0:20:30) Jonnie: and off-putting and I kind of just turned off the game after that because I was like I'm just not
(0:20:34) Jonnie: interested. Like if there was an option to just skip that entire portion of the game and just get
(0:20:41) Jonnie: like you know from tonight's you know sushi sales you get however much money that's what I want. I
(0:20:48) Jonnie: don't want to do a timer based running and meeting people and you know fulfilling their orders to me
(0:20:54) Jonnie: that's just yeah it wasn't something that appealed to me and so I kind of just didn't...
(0:21:01) Jonnie: I didn't give the game a chance because I wasn't interested in that.
(0:21:03) Kev: Mm-hmm. Well, you know what I'll agree that Dave needs to learn how to say no cuz he just goes with every single thing everyone requests him
(0:21:12) Kev: You hadn't seen half of it
(0:21:15) Kev: Poor Dave he puts it way too much
(0:21:16) Jonnie: Yeah, and like, I kind of get that that's the character, which is fine, it just really
(0:21:23) Jonnie: annoyed me in the context of the game being Dave the Diver, and that being the part of
(0:21:29) Jonnie: the game that I was interested in, and it just kind of felt like this weird minigame
(0:21:32) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:33) Kev: Yeah, I'm surprised they don't give you an option to just you know auto or skip it or whatever
(0:21:38) Kev: Um, at least I don't think so. I'm trying to think I mean later on they they give you tools to
(0:21:46) Kev: Skip a lot of it if you want to but like there's no just one button. I just want to you know, just
(0:21:51) Kev: Skip the night or whatever
(0:21:52) Jonnie: Yeah, so, you know, it's a bit unfortunate because for me it doesn't really feel connected to the rest of the game
(0:22:00) Jonnie: In a way other than maybe they had this idea for this as a mechanic and they kind of weached it in because
(0:22:07) Jonnie: Personally, it's just I don't find that I don't find the mechanics that were inherent in that side of the game fun
(0:22:14) Jonnie: I don't really like rushing around
(0:22:18) Jonnie: meeting orders
(0:22:20) Jonnie: needing to do things perfectly.
(0:22:23) Jonnie: In a game that to me is, I'm interested in the exploration and catching fish and finding stuff.
(0:22:30) Kev: You're right, it is super conally dissonant, right, just because the diving parts, they can get stressful, but they're also very chill at the same time because you're exploring, and it's generally low pressure, unless you're under attack by Narwhal, but yeah, you're right, it is kind of awesome.
(0:22:53) Jonnie: Yeah, so anyway, that's kind of, you know,
(0:22:56) Jonnie: my take on the game was like,
(0:22:57) Jonnie: I liked what I saw from the diving side of things.
(0:23:01) Jonnie: And I kind of just wish that that was what I could have done.
(0:23:03) Jonnie: But let's talk about the Dredge DLC.
(0:23:06) Jonnie: And where I want to start this conversation, Kev,
(0:23:08) Jonnie: is the thing that sort of stood out to me the most
(0:23:12) Jonnie: when I was looking into the DLC is kind of how you engage
(0:23:15) Jonnie: with the Dredge, yeah, the Dredge DLC,
(0:23:19) Jonnie: where it can only happen on days that are foggy.
(0:23:23) Jonnie: And that's not every single day.
(0:23:26) Jonnie: So there's, you know, you can only do it once
(0:23:28) Jonnie: every couple of days.
(0:23:28) Jonnie: And how did you feel about that?
(0:23:30) Kev: Yeah, this is probably the one of the biggest talking points about the DLC or at least the same negative talking points
(0:23:40) Kev: So like I mentioned I just hit credits
(0:23:45) Kev: It's been I don't remember how many weeks since I first started playing before I even sat down with Al to record it. Um,
(0:23:51) Kev: The I hit the dredge DLC for the first time just last night
(0:23:56) Jonnie: Wow.
(0:23:56) Kev: Yeah, it's it is
(0:24:00) Kev: Random
(0:24:01) Kev: Completely random. I got it post credits. I don't think that's nice. That's a requirement
(0:24:05) Kev: In fact, I I know it's actually not you have to only hit like chapter 2 till that can unlock but yeah
(0:24:12) Kev: it took that long for me to
(0:24:15) Kev: To see it right and like I guess you could find a speed run through it by just skipping dives
(0:24:20) Kev: Basically, you know just going in and out or whatever but obviously I was enjoying the game and playing it
(0:24:25) Kev: So I wasn't in a rush to do that per se
(0:24:28) Kev: And I wanted to see how long it would take
(0:24:30) Kev: Yeah, it took me many weeks to hit the DLC, which is absolutely wild and kind of an awful way to
(0:24:37) Kev: To make it accessible, you know, it'd be nice if there's a person you could just talk to say hey, I want to dredge it up
(0:24:44) Jonnie: Yeah, that's interesting, right? And it's an interesting way of doing DLC,
(0:24:50) Jonnie: particularly in a time where you expect that a lot of people have already completed a large
(0:24:56) Jonnie: portion of the game, and so they're having to play through multiple days just to engage with
(0:25:01) Jonnie: the DLC content. So that kind of was the one thing that stood out to me that felt
(0:25:05) Jonnie: a little bit interesting, and your idea of like, is there just someone that you could talk to to
(0:25:09) Jonnie: be like, "Hey, up the fogginess so that we can engage more with this" would have been...
(0:25:15) Jonnie: would have been a good little move. But maybe let's talk about some of the new mechanics that
(0:25:23) Jonnie: the Dredge DLC introduced. And starting with the biggest one, because it just seems like a huge
(0:25:28) Jonnie: thing to add to the game, is the fact that you can drive the boat kind of like you can in Dredge.
(0:25:31) Kev: Yep, yep, yeah, so that's the first it's the it's really the first thing you do with the DLC. Obviously, you know, it gets foggy and some guy approaches you. And then when you start it, yeah, you're driving the boat straight up to it's like even the visual style is very dredge like it. I don't know how the dredge ship, obviously, I have not played dredge myself right now. But I don't know how it controls work and whatnot. But it feels fine. It looks a lot like what I've seen.
(0:26:01) Kev: I don't know how it works from dredges ship controlling. Granted, the map is a lot more simple. I don't think there are at least I haven't yet seen the threats in the overworld to attack the boat like in dredge.
(0:26:16) Jonnie: No, and I don't think there are any threats in the overall to attack the boat, but it
(0:26:20) Jonnie: kind of is just crazy to me that that was like, you know, that's a huge thing to add
(0:26:24) Jonnie: to a game, right?
(0:26:25) Kev: Yeah, it definitely is.
(0:26:25) Jonnie: Where it's not like, you know, movement mechanics and, like, there's physics, like, there's
(0:26:31) Jonnie: a lot that has to go into adding something like that to a game like this where there's
(0:26:38) Jonnie: no, like, there's the movement, obviously, of Dave, but that's very different to the
(0:26:43) Jonnie: movement of a ship.
(0:26:44) Jonnie: So it kind of feels like a mini response.
(0:26:46) Jonnie: Just a new big system to add and even particularly the way that the art assets work, right?
(0:26:52) Jonnie: Because it's, I don't know, this was just one of those things.
(0:26:54) Jonnie: It's like, it's awesome that they did it because it kind of really links the Dave, the diver to dredge in a, in a very clean, thematic, visually aligned way.
(0:27:05) Jonnie: It just seems so crazy to add this to, to what Dave, the diver was.
(0:27:10) Kev: Yeah, absolutely, right, because the second portion is, you know, the actual dive portion where you're down in the water, hunting down the aberrations.
(0:27:18) Kev: But yeah, it was really nice. They went the extra mile. Like this is what I'd call an A+ collaboration crossover because, you know, really blending the DNA of the two games.
(0:27:29) Jonnie: Absolutely. And so, you know, from there, there was a few minigames that I saw that were added
(0:27:35) Jonnie: that were very reminiscent of the Dretching minigames from Dretch. We've got sort of the
(0:27:42) Jonnie: reticle moving around and it's kind of like a little timing-based minigame. Did you get to try
(0:27:50) Kev: Um, no, I didn't because, uh, like I said, I just did last night.
(0:27:54) Kev: I didn't even get fully through the night or whatever, but I pretty, so you have to
(0:27:58) Kev: hit a vortex to dive right in, to start the diving portion.
(0:28:02) Kev: And I pretty much just did that right away.
(0:28:04) Kev: I, like, I didn't really, uh, I don't know.
(0:28:06) Kev: I just didn't think about looking more.
(0:28:08) Kev: Um, but that is fascinating.
(0:28:09) Jonnie: Cool. Well, let's, let's, yeah, let's talk about the diving then, how does it compare
(0:28:15) Jonnie: tonally to the rest of Dave's The Diving?
(0:28:18) Kev: Okay, so it is a night dive which, so as we discussed with Al, or you know when we
(0:28:28) Kev: talk about the episode Al, a regular night dive is already pretty dangerous because everything
(0:28:33) Kev: is already aggressive and then will attack you. And so here it's again the same time the ocean
(0:28:41) Kev: looks darker. They do change the color scheme to better match dredge.
(0:28:49) Kev: But other than that, I guess it's kind of what you'd expect because yeah, it's slightly dredge
(0:28:57) Kev: colored but there's the scary aberration fish and you're just hunting them all a day of the
(0:29:03) Kev: diver mechanics. Yeah, I'm kidding.
(0:29:04) Jonnie: And so when you've kind of got that total, I'm assuming there's a bunch of aberrant fish that you are now catching and that have been added.
(0:29:14) Kev: Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, they're all, you know, well, I guess it's kind of true and dredge that they're normal fish, but just, just weird like there's a three headed fish, some fish now have fangs, some have horns, so on and so forth, right.
(0:29:28) Kev: There's a, I saw Marlin with very scary eyes. So yeah, what's nice is that in regular night dives, a lot of fish can be grouped together.
(0:29:44) Kev: And they can attack you can be difficult to navigate that many aggressive fish at once, but at least from what I experienced the dredge fish were pretty spaced out so you could engage on them one on one with a little more room to breathe.
(0:29:58) Jonnie: Nice, was there anything else that felt different about the dives,
(0:30:02) Jonnie: or was it really kind of just like a different dive in a slightly different location with some
(0:30:10) Kev: There's also new weapons, which is interesting because the weapon is a big part of how you interact with the game, right?
(0:30:23) Kev: So, for instance, one of them is called the... was it made rain gun? Yeah, it is... it can... yeah, so your oxygen is your health, right? So you can recover...
(0:30:41) Kev: You can recover health using that gun, which is an interesting mechanic because, you know, over... well, I'd say it's fairly grounded.
(0:30:50) Kev: There's CC people. Dave is generally fairly grounded with their mechanics, but this one's a little more video game-y and whatnot, and they just explain it away because they're aberrant fish and it works like that.
(0:31:01) Kev: I'm trying to think... was the gravity gun you? Okay.
(0:31:06) Jonnie: I think the only new weapon was the life force one. I think the gravity gun was
(0:31:11) Kev: Oh, was it? Okay. Yeah, because I found that on the dive. I didn't know if that was new. That might have been just my first time encountering it.
(0:31:16) Kev: But yeah, I'm trying... again, I didn't get the chance to play as much as I wanted, but at least when you first dive in, like, I didn't...
(0:31:28) Kev: It's... I'm trying to think here, like, all the... like, so the fish will attack you. I can't think of any of them doing super crazy and whatnot. I think some of them are pretty fast.
(0:31:41) Kev: But that's... yeah, no, otherwise it feels a lot like a night dive, which I think it's not bad.
(0:31:48) Kev: Oh, there are... so there are crabs in the game in standard, Dave. You unlock them pretty late in the game, and you can get aberrant crabs and whatnot as well.
(0:32:01) Kev: And from what I understand from the DLC, there are, like, three areas. I didn't get to all of them. There are...
(0:32:10) Kev: I don't know all of them. I've heard that they're kind of samey, but... oh, one interesting thing about the aberrant fish.
(0:32:19) Kev: You have to use them that night, or they'll just disappear. You can sell them to a certain vendor, but unlike other fish, they cannot stay in your inventory or at the restaurant.
(0:32:34) Jonnie: And I also read that they can only be sold to a certain character that comes in to specifically
(0:32:42) Jonnie: eat that sushi.
(0:32:43) Jonnie: It's not like anyone that comes to the sushi restaurant will eat aberrant fish.
(0:32:47) Jonnie: Which makes sense, right?
(0:32:48) Kev: yep yep yep not everyone's that adventurous I think would you eat a
(0:32:49) Jonnie: Like, not everyone is about that aberrant fish.
(0:32:53) Jonnie: Yeah.
(0:32:54) Jonnie: I mean, probably.
(0:32:55) Kev: three-headed cod I probably would too
(0:32:56) Jonnie: Who knows?
(0:32:58) Jonnie: Probably.
(0:32:59) Jonnie: Who knows?
(0:33:00) Jonnie: Hey, that's how I become Codman.
(0:33:05) Kev: but yeah I'm trying to think no I think one thing that is really unfortunate
(0:33:13) Kev: From what I understand, there's no new bosses in the dredge DLC.
(0:33:18) Kev: And that's really unfortunate, because the Godzilla DLC brought in a boss, and dredge has a good helping of monsters to choose from, right?
(0:33:31) Kev: So it's a shame we didn't get a single one of them.
(0:33:34) Jonnie: Yeah, it's even maybe a shame that there wasn't some, like, a madness-style mechanic.
(0:33:40) Jonnie: You know, you could imagine it sort of sitting alongside the oxygen meter, and maybe rather
(0:33:44) Jonnie: than a boss, you know, there's just the risk that you get attacked by some Cthulian-inspired
(0:33:54) Jonnie: creature or, you know, they didn't really play with, I guess, that sort of madness-Cthulian
(0:33:59) Kev: Ooh, yeah, that's good.
(0:34:00) Jonnie: side of things, which would have been really fascinating I think in the way data is set up.
(0:34:05) Kev: I didn't even think about that.
(0:34:06) Kev: That would have been a great mechanic, right?
(0:34:07) Kev: Like, obviously dredged tonally, you know, that's very different, right?
(0:34:11) Kev: The horrors and whatnot, but at least just a different meter.
(0:34:15) Kev: We call it a fear meter, whatever you want to call it.
(0:34:16) Kev: Like, uh, uh, it is a shame that they didn't introduce something.
(0:34:21) Jonnie: Yeah, and I think that's probably the the biggest outside of the difficulty of interacting,
(0:34:26) Jonnie: but the biggest criticism I've seen of the the the dredge DLC is just the the lack of those
(0:34:32) Jonnie: you know bosses that you know are a decent portion of the game and to your point would have
(0:34:40) Jonnie: made sense to add in the context of of dredge and what that brings to the day of the dive universe.
(0:34:48) Jonnie: Anything else I guess about the DLC specifically?
(0:34:51) Kev: so I will say that um there are there is a good amount of the fifth um gosh how many are there
(0:35:00) Kev: there's looking at at least 30 of them which is a pretty good amount to be quite frank um so I do
(0:35:08) Kev: give them props for that like I said there are three smallish areas um so it is a fairly sizable
(0:35:17) Kev: DLC, you know, at least compared to the Godzilla.
(0:35:21) Kev: The Godzilla one, while a lot of fun, was relatively small in scale.
(0:35:26) Kev: It's like a couple of boss fights, really, and finding Godzilla, which is a very minor thing.
(0:35:33) Kev: I do wonder if these aberrants are from Dredge directly, or if they made up new ones.
(0:35:39) Kev: Like, I'm looking at this one called the Gazing Shark. It looks like a hammerhead, but with giant eyes at the end.
(0:35:44) Kev: I don't know.
(0:35:45) Kev: But yeah, other than that, like, I can't have any direct thoughts.
(0:35:49) Kev: Or I don't have any
(0:35:51) Kev: More detailed thoughts.
(0:35:53) Kev: Um, like I said that
(0:35:54) Jonnie: Cool. Well, one thing I am keen to talk about a little bit is how cool the idea of this as a
(0:36:01) Jonnie: DLC is. It's really cool to see two indie developers teaming up and doing a cross-collaboration
(0:36:10) Jonnie: like this. There hasn't been a ton of these before. I'm probably struggling to think of any,
(0:36:15) Jonnie: but I'm sure these sorts of collaborations have been done somewhat infrequently in the past.
(0:36:21) Jonnie: But I think in the stage that really...
(0:36:24) Jonnie: I would say popular within the niche of people that are following gaming stuff elsewhere, right?
(0:36:36) Jonnie: They're not getting to the level of AAAs, but within people that are engaging with gaming culture or gaming communities,
(0:36:42) Jonnie: these games kind of get to a level of popularity.
(0:36:44) Jonnie: It's really nice to see this sort of collaboration coming through as a way to introduce people to other games
(0:36:54) Jonnie: who haven't played, but it's probably been on their list and could be a little bit of a prompt to get them to do it.
(0:37:04) Jonnie: So I would love to see more of the style of collaboration between games because I just think it's such a cool concept.
(0:37:12) Jonnie: The overlap really made sense, right?
(0:37:14) Jonnie: It wasn't just like, "Hey, we're two indie developers that want to cross-promote our games."
(0:37:20) Jonnie: It's like no there's actually a way that we can do this that makes total sense in the
(0:37:24) Jonnie: context of both of our games and I just think it's really clever in that regard.
(0:37:31) Kev: Okay, so, like, okay, I was going to say that, right? Like, this, like, I know we kind of covered it quickly, because it's somewhat, so aside from the dredge, you know, the actual boat controls, like, a lot of it is just, you know, more stylized, Dave, the divering, right, and that's not a bad thing, and so, but, like, overall, I do really enjoy this DLC, for a lot of the same reasons you said, I think is really, really successful.
(0:37:57) Kev: I think I should put, we should put an asterisk though, Dave the Diver is...
(0:38:01) Kev: not an indie game. It's by Mint Rocket, which is a subdivision of Nexon, which is a huge Korean game.
(0:38:11) Kev: They do MapleStory and other things. But, I mean, Dredge though, that one's indie, and it's very cool that they got to do such an in-depth collaboration, right?
(0:38:25) Kev: I think it especially benefits Dredge, because Dredge got a lot of love for sure, but I think...
(0:38:31) Kev: Dave had a little more lasting power, maybe because of these DLCs, so I agree. It is a great way to get people's eyes on Dredge.
(0:38:39) Kev: I've wanted to play Dredge for a while, and this certainly does motivate me to play it.
(0:38:46) Jonnie: Yeah, absolutely. And I don't know why, but for some reason, maybe I just assumed that
(0:38:51) Jonnie: Dave the Diver was edgy because it gives big indie energy.
(0:38:52) Kev: well I mean
(0:38:56) Kev: yeah I mean it's pixel right like first of all it's the pixels and and it's the
(0:39:01) Kev: it's doesn't feel triple-a because it's not you know big
(0:39:05) Kev: high-five le graphics fast-action or whatever right
(0:39:08) Kev: uh... it
(0:39:09) Kev: and it's not just you let's not forget the game awards uh... nominated a the
(0:39:13) Kev: doctor for the game of the year and uh... everyone got a
(0:39:18) Kev: got a little upset at them for that uh...
(0:39:21) Kev: But, uh, yeah.
(0:39:22) Kev: Uh, uh, you know, but regardless of that, like, I think the points still stand.
(0:39:27) Kev: Like it's, it was a really good way to integrate the two together.
(0:39:32) Kev: Um, like I, I struggled to think of the last cola, uh, crossover collaboration
(0:39:38) Kev: that worked this well, because I'm obviously thematically to fish games or
(0:39:42) Kev: whatever, but even the boat just worked really well, um, with, uh, Dave the
(0:39:48) Kev: diverged like I know it's a fridge mechanic or whatever but it
(0:39:52) Kev: feels right at home and in Dave the Diver because of the setting in this
(0:39:57) Kev: you know it's special blue hole place and and they introduced a lot of one-off
(0:40:04) Kev: things like that so it doesn't stick out or any particular way which is I think a
(0:40:10) Jonnie: Yeah, absolutely
(0:40:12) Jonnie: One final question if they were gonna do a collab with David I was gonna do a collab with
(0:40:18) Jonnie: another game property
(0:40:21) Jonnie: Thing where would you want that color to come from?
(0:40:24) Kev: Yeah, that's what I've been thinking about because yeah, that's that's the next question right um
(0:40:29) Kev: I'm just honestly I'm trying to think here um
(0:40:35) Kev: Well see okay, are we talking about putting something in a day the diver or getting Dave the diver into something else?
(0:40:42) Jonnie: Let's say putting something into Dave the Diver.
(0:40:42) Kev: because
(0:40:45) Kev: Okay
(0:40:47) Kev: Because I was about to bring up new kids gonna be tough to compete with that
(0:40:52) Kev: Okay bringing something
(0:40:54) Kev: Else into you know what you know what I I would be remiss if I didn't bring up a big the cat DLC
(0:41:08) Jonnie: Big the cat, oh, I love it.
(0:41:10) Jonnie: That's a real throwback for...
(0:41:12) Kev: and you know they they kind of got that same body shape going on give them a little
(0:41:17) Kev: you know when you complete the dlc a little big the cat so you can wear i'm down for this
(0:41:22) Kev: i'm down for this help them uh help them fish for froggy way way down there and you yeah and
(0:41:27) Kev: eggman has a machine down there yeah I mean there already were robots machines you have to fight in
(0:41:32) Kev: read the diver yeah i'm down for this um yeah what about you you have any ideas
(0:41:34) Jonnie: amazing amazing that sounds great um maybe slightly uh more grim but I would really love
(0:41:44) Jonnie: to see kind of like a uh dave the diver final dlc that's a collab with spirit thera
(0:41:50) Kev: Darn it darn it. That's perfect. I didn't think about it. That's perfect
(0:41:57) Jonnie: like just the whole vibe of the game I feel like a closing moment that is somehow linked
(0:42:01) Jonnie: into sphera would be yeah kind of kind of
(0:42:04) Jonnie: amazing it feels like there's a
(0:42:05) Kev: Okay, hold on, but here's the monkey paw you have
(0:42:09) Kev: You know a big part of spirit fair is is taking care of the guests, right?
(0:42:13) Kev: So now you have to do that with the bancho where it's sushi restaurant
(0:42:16) Jonnie: Look, I'm okay, if it was more like Spiritfare, I could suffer through that.
(0:42:26) Jonnie: I would probably play through Dave the Diver just to experience a little bit more.
(0:42:30) Kev: I can see it working. You have the spirit fair boat, you know, has the multiple levels so you're doing the sushi portion
(0:42:35) Jonnie: Yup
(0:42:37) Kev: But you have to go up and down the levels
(0:42:38) Jonnie: That's a and or you could just have the restaurant be a new room on the Spiritfarer boat
(0:42:43) Jonnie: Maybe Dave the diver needs to come to Spiritfarer mate. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm thinking about it the wrong way around
(0:42:47) Kev: maybe does Dave die at the end of it yep there you go yeah you're right that
(0:42:49) Jonnie: Yes
(0:42:51) Jonnie: That is that I feel like that is the natural that that is the natural ending
(0:43:03) Kev: truly would be the final DLC there you go with perfect I love it ship it I'm
(0:43:08) Kev: reaching out to mint rocket right now
(0:43:10) Jonnie: - Amazing.
(0:43:12) Jonnie: - Well, I think that was everything I had to cover.
(0:43:18) Kev: Oh one thing not specifically to dredge something that I forgot to mention that I want to say since last episode
(0:43:24) Kev: I don't think I ever brought up that I am in fact a real certified scuba diver. So I
(0:43:31) Kev: Very much appreciate this
(0:43:34) Kev: obviously, I will not be diving to the
(0:43:37) Kev: Abyss, you know
(0:43:39) Kev: abyssal horror deaths sword and polar waters
(0:43:41) Kev: But it is it is very cool to see that I love scuba diving. So it is very cool to see
(0:43:48) Kev: game kind of capture that love up
(0:43:51) Kev: Yeah, all right. Um, all right, I guess then
(0:43:55) Kev: If that's the case, I think that puts a nice little bow on day of the diver month
(0:44:01) Kev: Like I know you weren't
(0:44:02) Jonnie: No, there's still one more episode to go, Kim. One more episode to go.

(0:44:18) Kev: There you go. Well, okay
(0:44:20) Kev: Well in that case, I think that covers the dredge DLC
(0:44:24) Kev: It's you know, like I still give it two thumbs up as DLC. Definitely. It's great crossover
(0:44:31) Kev: Like it's hard to talk about because of it. It's so much, you know, just kind of pointing out what's great about David diver the base game
(0:44:40) Kev: But it works really well, so, you know two thumbs up
