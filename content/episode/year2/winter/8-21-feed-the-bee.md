## Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season.
(0:00:34) Al: My name is Al, and we're here today to talk about Cottagecore games.
(0:00:36) Codey: and my name is Cody.
(0:00:41) Codey: Woo.
(0:00:45) Al: A welcome back Cody. It's been a while.
(0:00:47) Codey: Oh, thank you.
(0:00:48) Codey: It has really been playing a lot of stuff
(0:00:51) Codey: that I haven't played slash.
(0:00:53) Al: Don't you don't you don't you start yet.
(0:00:55) Al: That's not we're not going into that section yet. We'll get there.
(0:00:58) Al: - Yeah.
(0:00:59) Codey: What?
(0:01:00) Al: I didn't ask you what you've been up to, hello.
(0:01:02) Codey: Well, yeah, I'm just saying that that's why
(0:01:04) Codey: I haven't been on the pod.
(0:01:04) Al: Okay, okay, it sounded like you were introducing that section. You gotta wait, you gotta wait.
(0:01:07) Codey: No, no, no, my, my, my horses are held.
(0:01:10) Codey: Nah, nah, nah, my horses are held.
(0:01:15) Al: They're heavy. This episode, we are going to talk about Minecraft again.
(0:01:22) Codey: Woooo!
(0:01:24) Al: Specifically, Cody has been playing a bee-breeding mod in Minecraft. So we're going to talk about-
(0:01:30) Codey: Thank you, Devin, my best friend who I play Minecraft with.
(0:01:36) Codey: Who told me, "Hey, I put a mod that you might like on," and surprise I do.
(0:01:42) Al: Lo and behold, it was leaked.
(0:01:46) Codey: Correct.
(0:01:47) Al: Excellent.
(0:01:48) Al: So we're going to talk about that.
(0:01:50) Al: Before that, we have obviously a lot of news.
(0:01:53) Al: It's a decent chunk of news, a decent chunk.
(0:01:54) Codey: No, it's-- it seems on the lighter side, I would say.
(0:01:56) Al: It's not like an insane amount of news, but it's enough news.
(0:01:58) Al: It's not.
(0:02:04) Codey: Listeners, after the news section,
(0:02:06) Codey: let us know if it's a light amount of news
(0:02:08) Codey: or a lot amount of news.
(0:02:08) Al: Look, it all depends on how long it takes, right?
(0:02:11) Al: so we'll be clocking the tape.
(0:02:12) Al: But before that, Cody, what have you been up to?
(0:02:14) Codey: OK, so I'm not going to say anything
(0:02:16) Codey: during the news section because I want to be right.
(0:02:24) Codey: - Hello, I have been up to science.
(0:02:29) Codey: So I'm getting to that point where,
(0:02:32) Codey: whoo, I'm getting to the point where like a year from now,
(0:02:35) Codey: I'm hoping to be defending my dissertation
(0:02:38) Codey: and that is horrifying.
(0:02:41) Codey: For a long time throughout your degree,
(0:02:43) Codey: it's like, oh, like two years from now,
(0:02:45) Codey: oh, like, it's like, you can kind of shove it forward
(0:02:48) Codey: in the future.
(0:02:50) Codey: And now it's like, oh, oh shoot, you know.
(0:02:54) Codey: Um, I was also just at a conference.
(0:02:56) Codey: So the entomological society of America's conference was in Phoenix, Arizona.
(0:03:02) Codey: Um, so we went there and that was a thing that we did.
(0:03:06) Codey: I actually, so it was actually, okay.
(0:03:09) Codey: So when you go to conferences, like near the end of, of one chapter of your life,
(0:03:13) Codey: you're like, what am I going to do next?
(0:03:15) Codey: And it was actually really gratifying because I had a few humans come up to me after like my talk
(0:03:19) Codey: or that they just knew of me.
(0:03:21) Codey: And they were like, Hey, I want to talk to you.
(0:03:24) Codey: And they're possibly interested in hiring me.
(0:03:27) Codey: So that was really interesting.
(0:03:30) Codey: One of them was, uh, a department of fisheries and wildlife on the Pacific Northwest,
(0:03:34) Codey: which is where exactly where I want to be and exactly the kind of thing I want to do.
(0:03:39) Codey: However, uh, government jobs are a little up in the air right now because of things.
(0:03:44) Codey: And so, um, I'm kind of like, about that, like, like, Oh no, what do I do?
(0:03:52) Codey: but I had someone from like literally
(0:03:54) Codey: one of the best institutions for entomology
(0:03:57) Codey: within the United States come up to me
(0:04:00) Codey: and we were chatting and then he was like,
(0:04:01) Codey: "Oh, when are you done?
(0:04:02) Codey: Because we're gonna be hiring a forest entomologist
(0:04:04) Codey: here in a year."
(0:04:05) Codey: And I was like, "Holy crap."
(0:04:07) Codey: So that's cool too.
(0:04:09) Codey: So now I'm really, now the fire is under
(0:04:13) Codey: the proverbial butt at this point
(0:04:15) Codey: because I need to get this stuff finished.
(0:04:19) Codey: But more importantly, I finally married Scott
(0:04:22) Codey: in Coral Island.
(0:04:22) Al: Wooo! You made your decision.
(0:04:24) Codey: I also, I made, well, there was no decision to be made.
(0:04:28) Codey: I just, he finally accepted my offer.
(0:04:30) Codey: They like have, I think you have to go through
(0:04:33) Codey: a certain amount of their heart events or whatever.
(0:04:34) Al: You do, yeah. I ended up in that same situation with, oh goodness, I've forgotten my wife's name.
(0:04:42) Codey: Alice, was it Alice?
(0:04:44) Al: Was it Alice? No, it wasn't Alice.
(0:04:47) Codey: It was the computer programmer girl, right, Suki?
(0:04:49) Al: Yeah, no, not Suki. Suki's Alice.
(0:04:52) Codey: I don't remember.
(0:04:54) Codey: I also went for Alice for a bit.
(0:04:57) Codey: But yeah, so I finally married him.
(0:04:58) Codey: He finally got through all of his heart events.
(0:05:00) Codey: And I'm happy to say that for a few days of the month,
(0:05:04) Codey: at least, he does go to work.
(0:05:06) Al: Oh, thanks.
(0:05:07) Codey: There's been a couple times where I see him
(0:05:09) Codey: Walking around the town and i'm like who let you out?
(0:05:11) Al: It probably doesn't help that Lily, that's her name, that I married Lily who, you know,
(0:05:12) Codey: Got it.
(0:05:22) Al: when she's not married to you, spends all her time in her house. So that probably doesn't help.
(0:05:26) Codey: Yeah
(0:05:28) Al: But the weird thing about it was not necessarily that she was in the house,
(0:05:31) Al: because when she's in her house, she's like sitting at a computer doing work,
(0:05:35) Codey: Yeah
(0:05:36) Al: or, you know, in the kitchen. Whereas when she's in your house, she's standing next to the bed,
(0:05:40) Codey: Yep
(0:05:41) Al: staring off into space.
(0:05:42) Codey: That's what Scott does too, and I just feel so bad for him, especially because when you talk to him
(0:05:47) Codey: He says cute things like you know people say that marriage changes a man
(0:05:51) Codey: And you have changed me in all the most enticing ways. I love you, and I'm just like what the heck
(0:05:56) Al: - No!
(0:05:57) Codey: Or he'll be like
(0:06:00) Codey: Like babe, I love you so much. Thank you so much for for doing this and I'm like you're just standing next to me
(0:06:06) Codey: Please sometimes he goes outside for morning coffee, which is nice, but
(0:06:10) Codey: Yeah, so I finally did that I also finally have unlocked the cave of memories
(0:06:15) Codey: Oh, and I finally finished the frickin temple. I did that I did the temple
(0:06:16) Al: Oh, nice.
(0:06:20) Al: Nice.
(0:06:22) Codey: So now I'm just trying to I don't even remember what I got be honest
(0:06:23) Al: "Is all you ever hoped?"
(0:06:29) Codey: Yep, nope can't remember so
(0:06:30) Al: I don't know if there's like an overall unlock, I think.
(0:06:37) Al: There's different ones for different parts of it.
(0:06:40) Codey: - Yeah, yeah, the last thing that I needed
(0:06:42) Codey: was an osmium garlic, and I got that.
(0:06:47) Codey: I haven't finished the Cave of Memories 100%.
(0:06:49) Codey: I finished enough to bring Gort back to the people.
(0:06:56) Codey: He went dark, he was dark is the, yeah.
(0:06:56) Al: >> Cool.
(0:07:02) Codey: So I'm trying to reach the bottom
(0:07:03) Codey: of the Cave of Memories now,
(0:07:05) Codey: and then just generally hitting that point
(0:07:07) Codey: where I'm racking up money with nothing to spend at all.
(0:07:10) Codey: But more importantly, Minecraft.
(0:07:12) Codey: But I will talk about that later.
(0:07:14) Codey: Al, what have you been playing?
(0:07:16) Al: I have been playing, obviously, a lot of Pokemon TCG Pocket, I've talked about that in a few
(0:07:24) Codey: Oh, okay. I mean, so I have been, because of conference and general malaise, I have
(0:07:25) Al: previous episodes, but it sounds like you have questions.
(0:07:33) Codey: not been up on the pod. I also have not really been listening to ISE very much. So what is
(0:07:41) Codey: pocket? Is it good if you have, do you scan in real life cards that you have and that's
(0:07:47) Codey: how you get cards or...
(0:07:49) Al: No, no, it's entirely digital. It is so it is based on the TCG, but it's some of the cards are
(0:08:05) Al: digital equivalents of the real cards. Quite a lot of them are almost the same as physical cards,
(0:08:11) Al: but like their attacks are slightly different or their retreat number is slightly different.
(0:08:15) Al: And then there's a few that are exclusive to the app.
(0:08:19) Al: And basically, the idea is it's a daily "you can open two packs of cards a day".
(0:08:20) Codey: Okay. Is it possible to literally just collect cards or do you have to fight people?
(0:08:30) Al: Yeah, no, no, you can completely ignore the battles if you want to.
(0:08:36) Al: You do get things for the battles,
(0:08:36) Codey: BRB downloading this game right now.
(0:08:40) Al: but you can just ignore that if you want, which is what I did to start with,
(0:08:43) Al: and then I actually accidentally got into the battles.
(0:08:46) Codey: It just happened out of nowhere, does it?
(0:08:47) Al: oopsie
(0:08:50) Al: I know well what they did is they've done three events right and uh two of them are event
(0:08:56) Al: sorry battle-based events and so I was like well I need to try the battles for these events and
(0:09:02) Al: get these exclusive items or whatever and then I enjoyed it and yeah I don't know if i'll be
(0:09:09) Al: doing it outside of the events uh i've nearly finished the second event but um yeah it's good
(0:09:11) Codey: Okay, I'm downloading it.
(0:09:18) Al: Fun! I really like it.
(0:09:19) Al: And I reopened the other TCG app, the TCG Live, and I was like reminded of just
(0:09:26) Al: how bad an app it is, is just so the interface just feels gooey, right?
(0:09:33) Al: It doesn't feel like anything does what you want it to do.
(0:09:36) Al: And it's overly complicated, whereas like you open up Pocket and you see the packs
(0:09:43) Al: and you click on it and you open a pack, right?
(0:09:46) Al: And if you want to go do other things,
(0:09:47) Al: then sure you have to go down other levels but like you open
(0:09:49) Al: the gap and the packs are there right in front of you. It's
(0:09:53) Al: really nicely designed in that aspect of things. And it's like
(0:09:57) Al: there's five tabs along the bottom. And then that's pretty
(0:10:00) Al: much it. Whereas live is just like levels and levels of menus
(0:10:06) Al: and it like opens up in this menu where you're not really
(0:10:08) Al: sure what anything is unless you use it regularly. Yeah, I don't
(0:10:12) Al: like him. So yeah, I've been enjoying that. I guess not much
(0:10:17) Al: changed since I last talked about it it's just yeah
(0:10:19) Al: been going through the events that I talked about last week and i've hit the point where
(0:10:26) Al: I because I played it during the beta period i'm at the point now where I am close to having
(0:10:33) Al: finished the collection but that means that I almost never like I maybe get a new card
(0:10:37) Al: every three days or something but I think they've said that they're bringing out new
(0:10:44) Al: cards in december so that'll be fun but yeah it's
(0:10:48) Codey: Okay, I am opening it
(0:10:49) Al: it's nice I like it enjoy don't get distracted on the podcast never i've been playing marvel
(0:10:54) Codey: No, of course not
(0:10:57) Codey: It's not gonna happen
(0:11:00) Al: snap as well although a little bit less this week because I was doing the battling in pocket but i'm
(0:11:05) Al: sure i'll get back into snap next week once i've finished the battles in pocket and i've started
(0:11:09) Al: playing finally fields of mystery uh um it I have thoughts on the game but i'm gonna save them for
(0:11:12) Codey: Whoo
(0:11:19) Al: future episode um but it's yeah I i don't I definitely don't hate it and it definitely has
(0:11:28) Al: interesting ideas and it'll be interesting to share my thoughts fully on the podcast
(0:11:34) Al: but yeah I have started playing that so we'll see how that goes I mean the good thing is i've
(0:11:39) Al: actually been playing it right like sometimes when I play games for the podcast it's really
(0:11:43) Al: hard to get into them um so i've gotten over the initial hump and i'm actually like properly
(0:11:49) Al: now uh every day so we'll see how that continues on my steam deck
(0:11:51) Codey: Mm-hmm, that's good. How are you playing it?
(0:11:56) Codey: Okay, I also have questions we can talk about this band about a steam deck because I was asked if I want and for Christmas
(0:12:04) Al: This is the Steam Deck section. Talk to me.
(0:12:09) Codey: So listen listeners if you're also wondering if you should get a steam deck this section is for you. Hey Al
(0:12:17) Codey: Why get a steam deck?
(0:12:18) Al: because play games on portable console that aren't on the Switch.
(0:12:24) Al: I mean, realistically, right, like that's that's it.
(0:12:27) Al: It is also more powerful than the Switch.
(0:12:29) Al: Right. So some games will run better on it.
(0:12:32) Al: But I mean, the the main reason that you would be doing it is because there's lots
(0:12:36) Al: of games that aren't on the Switch yet or won't come to the Switch or, you know,
(0:12:41) Al: they are only coming to the Switch a couple of years after their Steam version.
(0:12:45) Al: like Steam is still the default for most games.
(0:12:46) Codey: Mm hmm. So is it can you play anything that's PC or Mac on it?
(0:12:56) Al: So it is the Steam Deck is Linux based but Valve have put a lot of effort into building
(0:13:07) Al: a runtime engine that allows you to run the Windows versions of the games. So if it supports
(0:13:14) Al: Linux or if it supports Windows, I don't think anything just supports Mac, right?
(0:13:18) Codey: Mm-hmm, okay.
(0:13:20) Al: So I have not come across a game that you just flat out can't play. There are a few games that
(0:13:26) Al: controllers very well and in those cases it's not great but it's becoming a lot better now like
(0:13:35) Al: most games will either launch with controller support or they will you know add it on if it's
(0:13:42) Al: an early access or whatever. Like Lens Island was one that didn't have controller support to start
(0:13:45) Al: with but it came out like right at the beginning of the Steam Deck so it wasn't really popular at
(0:13:51) Al: that point and they've obviously since added controller support. So I think most games have
(0:13:55) Al: have controller support.
(0:13:56) Codey: Okay, and then my other question is can you play it either like so is it like a switch where you can dock it and
(0:14:02) Codey: Play it on your screen or carry it with you
(0:14:04) Al: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so you can you can just connect it to a normal it's just USB-C, right?
(0:14:06) Codey: Mmm
(0:14:10) Al: So you can just plug in a USB-C dock which you can get ones for like, you know
(0:14:14) Al: 10 quid on Amazon or whatever and plug it into a monitor or a TV
(0:14:16) Codey: - Mm-hmm, okay.
(0:14:21) Codey: Well, to be determined, I probably will get one.
(0:14:24) Al: I mean, if someone is offering to buy you one, I would definitely go on that, right?
(0:14:30) Al: Like unless you have something else that you would want instead, it's obviously the big
(0:14:35) Al: thing for most people is it's a lot of money, so you know, you probably wouldn't be spending
(0:14:38) Codey: Yeah. No, I was literally, it's someone, correct. I would not buy one myself, but someone literally
(0:14:41) Al: that money on it yourself.
(0:14:45) Al: Yeah, the answer is probably yes.
(0:14:45) Codey: saying, "Would you like one?" I'm like, "Wow." Yeah.
(0:14:51) Al: unless there's like negative things that come from this.
(0:14:54) Al: You know, you will owe this person something. But if it's a friend or a family member who wants
(0:14:58) Codey: No. Yeah. No, it's my part. It's my partner. So.
(0:14:58) Al: to give you a gift, you know, and you don't feel bad about it, then I would say yeah, absolutely.
(0:15:03) Al: It's great. It's a bit bigger and chunkier. OK, it's bigger and chunkier than the Switch,
(0:15:09) Al: but personally, for me that actually makes it better. It's better to hold. The ergonomics
(0:15:16) Al: are better, so it less hurts my hands. So there's that as well. But yeah, no, I really like it.
(0:15:21) Codey: Okay. Yeah, I, I almost never play my switch in handheld mode. It's almost always on the
(0:15:27) Al: Interesting.
(0:15:28) Codey: on my computer or not my computer, my TV. So, but I could then play that on handheld
(0:15:34) Codey: and watch him play Factorio. Cause he's been playing the Factorio like space age expansion,
(0:15:40) Al: Yeah, I think the thing is that, you know, if you have like a gaming PC, gaming PC is
(0:15:41) Codey: or maybe I could play the space age expansion on that. I don't know. We'll see.
(0:15:51) Al: still going to be better, right? Because it's still portable. But, well, that's the thing,
(0:15:53) Codey: Yeah, I would have to come all the way over here.
(0:15:56) Al: right? The portable aspect of things is a massive, massive aspect. And yeah, it's not
(0:16:00) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:16:01) Al: as powerful, but it runs things just fine, right? Like most games will run on it in some
(0:16:07) Al: way and because it's like the bassline
(0:16:10) Al: it's like that's what games are aiming for like if you can run on the steam deck then you're fine
(0:16:14) Codey: Okay. Final question. If you play something on your Steam Deck, so say I'm like playing
(0:16:21) Codey: Lens Island on my Steam Deck, but I'm like, man, I want to play this on my desktop. Can
(0:16:25) Codey: I just literally go to my desktop and it's the same save? Okay. Okay. There. I told my
(0:16:28) Al: Assuming that they support Steam and Cloud Save, yes.
(0:16:31) Al: Games have to explicitly support that, but most games will.
(0:16:38) Codey: partner after talking to Al, I wouldn't say no to a Steam Deck. And that's what we've
(0:16:42) Al: And that's the Steam Deck section. We're gonna now talk about some game news. So, interestingly,
(0:16:44) Codey: got to do. Whoo. Whoo.
(0:16:56) Al: I can't see any delays this week, which is rare for a November episode, but there we
(0:17:01) Al: are. There's still a lot of delays to come though, because I still see about 25 games
(0:17:06) Al: saying 2024. Although some of them are special.
(0:17:12) Al: They were like, "Oh, we're in early access and we're going to be in early access for
(0:17:17) Al: a year." And that means they'll come out this year and then they've just not said anything
(0:17:20) Al: because they never explicitly said they were coming out in 2024, but come on. So, it's
(0:17:24) Codey: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(0:17:28) Al: going to take some time going through that list and double checking if anybody said anything
(0:17:31) Al: that I've missed. Anyway, Botany Manor have announced that they're coming out on PlayStation.
(0:17:33) Codey: - Yep.
(0:17:38) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(0:17:38) Al: So I think they're already out on...
(0:17:42) Al: PC and Switch?
(0:17:43) Codey: - I played it on Xbox Game Pass.
(0:17:48) Al: Oh, yes.
(0:17:52) Al: I probably should have double checked this.
(0:17:53) Al: So they're definitely on Steam.
(0:17:55) Al: Yeah, they're on Xbox,
(0:17:57) Al: including Game Pass.
(0:17:59) Al: They are also on Switch.
(0:18:01) Al: So yeah, this is...
(0:18:02) Codey: I was gonna say I think that Aislinn had played it on
(0:18:04) Al: Yeah, so this is completing the standard list
(0:18:08) Al: coming to PlayStation.
(0:18:09) Al: they are releasing on the 17th.
(0:18:12) Al: And that's for both PS4 and PS5.
(0:18:13) Codey: Woo.
(0:18:14) Codey: Woo!
(0:18:19) Al: Speaking of releases,
(0:18:21) Al: Grimoire Groves is coming out.
(0:18:26) Al: They have announced that their release date is the 6th of March next year.
(0:18:32) Al: That feels like the length of time that I feel like is suspicious, right?
(0:18:40) Al: Like when something says, oh, we're going to.
(0:18:42) Al: To come out on this date in two years, you know, it's never going to happen.
(0:18:45) Al: If they say we're coming out on this date in a month, you're like, okay,
(0:18:47) Al: the game is ready and they're just like making sure that they're ready for
(0:18:50) Al: release and, you know, getting all the release plans out.
(0:18:53) Al: Like they're not working on the game.
(0:18:54) Al: Now they're just ready to go.
(0:18:56) Codey: Okay.
(0:18:56) Al: But when they say four months away, I'm suspicious because that makes me sound
(0:19:02) Al: feel like the game is not finished yet and they're wanting to finish it.
(0:19:05) Al: And they're like, this is the point that we think we can get it done by, but
(0:19:09) Al: something will probably go wrong.
(0:19:12) Codey: Okay, are you making a prediction then?
(0:19:12) Al: No, never, never make a prediction.
(0:19:17) Codey: Okay, okay
(0:19:18) Al: Never say you're going to come out on a date.
(0:19:22) Al: Do you see what I mean?
(0:19:22) Al: No, it's like, it's a suspicious time frame.
(0:19:24) Codey: Yeah, no I get it though, there's also
(0:19:26) Al: Like I'm not saying they don't want to come out then, but I'm saying
(0:19:29) Al: there's a high probability that it gets delayed by a month.
(0:19:33) Codey: Yeah, that's fair. I detect no lies
(0:19:38) Al: Good.
(0:19:40) Al: I'm glad.
(0:19:42) Al: Um, yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll see.
(0:19:45) Al: Will this be one of my 2025 games?
(0:19:45) Codey: Correct.
(0:19:48) Al: Maybe you don't want to play this one.
(0:19:49) Codey: It's all you.
(0:19:52) Codey: Um, I like how it looks, but I am over the witch aesthetic, personally.
(0:19:57) Al: Oh, interesting.
(0:19:58) Codey: So.
(0:19:59) Al: I feel like we haven't had many which games actually come out though.
(0:20:01) Codey: No, I guess I just don't I've never liked.
(0:20:06) Al: Fair, fair.
(0:20:07) Codey: So, yep.
(0:20:10) Al: Uh, next we have Sunday.
(0:20:12) Al: A release date for Switch.
(0:20:16) Al: In the Americas.
(0:20:18) Al: And only the Americas.
(0:20:18) Codey: Bum. Bum. Bum. It is curious why it's only the Americas. I know that they're trying to do it
(0:20:26) Codey: worldwide and they said that they're encountering some "issues" or whatever with doing it. I mean,
(0:20:33) Codey: it's difficult, but I'm not entirely sure why because it's not just the US. They have a bunch
(0:20:38) Codey: in South America as well that it is coming out for. Correct, correct.
(0:20:40) Al: Yes, yes. I did say Americas, to be fair. So it's specifically coming to United States,
(0:20:47) Al: Canada, Mexico. It sounds like the beginning. No, no, no. No, no, it's not. It's not. United
(0:20:49) Codey: Panama, Haiti, Jamaica, Peru, Republic Dominican.
(0:20:55) Al: States, Canada, big pause, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. So I'm
(0:21:05) Al: I'm guessing that it's just that those are the only countries in the Americas that...
(0:21:10) Al: the switch eShop is available in, and it's not that they're specifically saying you're not allowed in Venezuela.
(0:21:17) Codey: I am all four countries coming out in the order of that song.
(0:21:23) Codey: And not just because the United States is the first one.
(0:21:25) Al: Well, so my reason why I'm saying that I think it's just those are the only...
(0:21:29) Al: Because I don't think you can do it on a country by country basis.
(0:21:33) Al: I think you can only do it on a region by region basis.
(0:21:36) Al: And there's the Americas region.
(0:21:38) Al: There's--
(0:21:40) Al: Europe and Africa, I think, and then there's Japan, and then--
(0:21:46) Al: Oh, sorry, Europe, Africa, and Australia are the same one, and then there's Japan, and I don't know what else there is.
(0:21:50) Codey: interesting. Other countries. But yeah, so that's coming out. And I really yeah, and they were really
(0:21:58) Al: Oh yeah, we didn't say the date, 29th of November.
(0:22:02) Codey: wanting to try and make sure that the switch release did not was not like a version behind
(0:22:08) Codey: or whatever. So it's going to be released at the same version that it is, wherever else it's
(0:22:15) Codey: it's released, except no multiplayer yet.
(0:22:20) Al: Yes, that is the weird. It's very not weird. It's not weird.
(0:22:24) Al: It makes sense. Multiple is difficult.
(0:22:27) Al: But it is interesting that there earlier on in the announcement, they say
(0:22:33) Al: essentially, and then in bold, zero content differences between the two platforms.
(0:22:38) Al: So the thing you read because it's like
(0:22:40) Codey: Yep.
(0:22:40) Al: in bold is zero content differences between the two platforms.
(0:22:43) Al: But there is a word before which is essentially very sneaky.
(0:22:46) Codey: Gotta look for that modifier.
(0:22:48) Codey: Yep.
(0:22:50) Al: And yeah, so no multiplayer.
(0:22:52) Codey: Yep. Eventually.
(0:22:52) Al: Yeah, I find it interesting why they're doing because someone on I think it was
(0:22:58) Al: the Kickstarter suggested it could be an issue with
(0:23:04) Al: you know, some some law that something specific in the game isn't
(0:23:09) Al: covering, but it's out on Steam world worldwide.
(0:23:14) Al: So I don't think that can be the case.
(0:23:16) Codey: Hmm
(0:23:18) Al: I suspect...
(0:23:20) Al: This is a big theory, here's my theory, my hypothesis.
(0:23:25) Al: They didn't know there were multiple eShop regions initially.
(0:23:29) Al: And they went on, they set it all up, and then they realized, oh wait, this is just
(0:23:34) Al: coming out in the Americas, and of course it takes a long time to get this stuff done
(0:23:36) Codey: Yep.
(0:23:36) Codey: Yeah.
(0:23:38) Al: by Nintendo.
(0:23:40) Al: Because who was it?
(0:23:41) Al: There was another game that had a similar thing where they only gave eShop codes to people
(0:23:46) Al: in the Americas. And they were like, Oh, we can't we're not these
(0:23:50) Al: are the only codes we're able to get. And everyone was like, but every game gets codes
(0:23:53) Al: for the other regions. Why are you, why are you specifically not able to get ones for
(0:23:57) Al: Europe and Japan, et cetera? And then yeah, then suddenly two weeks later, Oh, look, we
(0:24:00) Codey: And then it's 'cause they had only applied for it.
(0:24:05) Al: have the Europe codes now. It's like, Hmm, funny that. So very suspicious. Maybe I'm
(0:24:08) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:24:11) Al: being a bit unfair, but that is my theory. And we'll probably never find out why. But
(0:24:18) Al: I think if it's like.
(0:24:20) Al: A month later, or, you know, if it's before the end of the year, I think that's all it
(0:24:23) Al: is.
(0:24:24) Al: Because I don't know what they could have been doing that was, I don't know what else
(0:24:27) Al: would have gotten their way because there's no technical differences between the games,
(0:24:32) Al: between the consoles.
(0:24:33) Al: Right.
(0:24:34) Al: Like I can, I can, I can create, and I have an American account on my switch as well.
(0:24:38) Al: And I have a Japanese account.
(0:24:39) Al: You can just download the games.
(0:24:40) Al: There's no content locking.
(0:24:41) Al: The only content locking is the shop itself, which is based on your account, not your console.
(0:24:47) Al: So I can't imagine there would be a technical issue there.
(0:24:50) Al: Only thinking is that it's because they didn't realise that there were multiple console, multiple
(0:24:53) Codey: I mean, to be fair, that is weird.
(0:24:53) Al: regions.
(0:24:54) Al: What, that there's multiple regions?
(0:24:57) Codey: Like, yeah, like you would think that it wouldn't be that there's different shops,
(0:24:59) Al: Ah, yeah.
(0:25:04) Codey: just that there's, it's like, instead of Switch making, excuse me, all of these different shops,
(0:25:11) Codey: different regions, they're just, you just have one shop and then they would just choose what region
(0:25:16) Codey: within the shop to sell it to. But that, but that makes too much sense. So they wouldn't do that.
(0:25:18) Al: I mean, it's essentially the same thing, right? Like, it's just a different way of doing it
(0:25:23) Codey: Yeah.
(0:25:25) Al: technically, right? Like, it doesn't make any difference to users, right? It's the same thing
(0:25:30) Al: to them. But yeah, I don't know. That's my theory. Who knows? We'll probably never know, but hey,
(0:25:38) Codey: Yep.
(0:25:38) Al: there we are. Sugardew Island. They've announced that they're coming to Xbox and PS4. They were
(0:25:46) Al: we're already coming to PS5.
(0:25:48) Al: Uh, this is, I don't think I talked about this.
(0:25:52) Al: They had posted this on Kickstarter like a month ago, and they were like,
(0:25:55) Al: "We're going to publicly talk about this later this month."
(0:25:58) Al: And I was like, "That's really weird."
(0:26:00) Al: So I now have this information.
(0:26:01) Al: I need to decide whether I'm sharing it or not.
(0:26:03) Al: Cause they haven't explicitly said, "Don't share it."
(0:26:03) Codey: hmm okay oh is it up
(0:26:05) Al: And I haven't agreed to not share it, but also it's like only pop-
(0:26:09) Al: No, this one's fine.
(0:26:10) Al: It was the pre, like it's now on Steam.
(0:26:12) Al: Like they publicly said it now, but I was like, "Do I not share it?"
(0:26:16) Al: because they've said we're not
(0:26:18) Al: there's no like public version of it.
(0:26:20) Codey: Yeah.
(0:26:21) Al: Like I can't cite my source because my source is a backer only Kickstarter post.
(0:26:26) Codey: Yeah.
(0:26:27) Al: I may as well say this now, the other reason they said this is one of the reasons on the
(0:26:31) Al: Kickstarter, they said this is one of the reasons they put the delay in,
(0:26:35) Al: because they got a grant to Xbox as well.
(0:26:41) Al: But the other reason that they haven't said publicly yet, but I've decided just to say it,
(0:26:46) Al: is that they're adding romance to the game.
(0:26:48) Al: Um, which I'm not a huge fan of them delaying to add romance, but whatever.
(0:26:50) Codey: Was. Yeah. Yeah.
(0:26:55) Al: It is what it is.
(0:26:56) Al: They haven't said that publicly, so, um, I can't prove it, but you'll see
(0:27:02) Al: in a couple of weeks, they'll announce that they're, they're bringing romance
(0:27:05) Al: to the game, um, lucky.
(0:27:08) Codey: I also was laughing as I was looking at it that they titled themselves as the coziest
(0:27:14) Al: which is a lot of a lot of technicalities there
(0:27:15) Codey: farm shop game ever.
(0:27:19) Codey: Yeah, like the coziest of not that many.
(0:27:26) Codey: They also have a new trailer in it and I'm not, I watched the new trailer, but I'm not
(0:27:29) Codey: really sure what in the trailer is new.
(0:27:33) Codey: I did like, so they, they showed you like managing your shop.
(0:27:38) Codey: And there was a point where like someone came up and they were
(0:27:40) Codey: like, Oh, I only wanted this many, or I, I wanted this different.
(0:27:45) Codey: I don't know.
(0:27:46) Codey: Someone was complaining.
(0:27:48) Codey: And one of the things you could do is like offer a discount.
(0:27:51) Codey: Um, so I don't know.
(0:27:55) Codey: I would never offer a discount.
(0:27:56) Codey: I've worked retail before people can, people can follow the rules.
(0:27:57) Al: They can they can buy it or they can not yeah
(0:28:02) Codey: Yeah.
(0:28:03) Codey: I'm not holding a gun to your head and saying you have to buy it or not.
(0:28:06) Codey: like this.
(0:28:08) Codey: Get out of here if you're unhappy with the price.
(0:28:12) Al: Yeah yeah I've said it before but I'll say it again I don't I just don't think
(0:28:12) Codey: But yeah, and this is still coming out in early 2025.
(0:28:22) Al: that shops are fun gameplay experience and maybe this one will be the game
(0:28:27) Al: that makes it happen but I highly doubt it based on what we've seen in the
(0:28:30) Al: trailer it looks like every other game that has a shop ever which is where you
(0:28:34) Al: put things out and then you have to stand there while people come and buy
(0:28:38) Al: from you. And it's like, this is not fun. Why would I? Why would I?
(0:28:38) Codey: I mean, you could also do, uh, so Sims did it, they had a shop like where you could buy
(0:28:42) Al: I don't care about this, right?
(0:28:43) Al: Um.
(0:28:49) Codey: a business by a shop and then you have to run it, but you could hire people to like
(0:28:54) Codey: greet or to run the register or to like schmooze with people. Um, but then you had to do whatever
(0:29:04) Al: Yeah, and then it's a management sim, and it's like, that's fine, those are games that
(0:29:05) Codey: or else it is.
(0:29:10) Al: people enjoy, but that is not what I want, and that is not, in my opinion, Cottagecore.
(0:29:14) Codey: Yeah. Well, that's the Sims for you. But yeah. So yeah, I don't know. I mean, it reminds
(0:29:14) Al: That is much more stressful.
(0:29:16) Al: Well, exactly.
(0:29:18) Al: There's a reason I don't play The Sims anymore.
(0:29:28) Codey: me a little bit. We played, gosh, what is that? Galaxy Paws, Galactic Paws, something
(0:29:34) Codey: Paws, Garden Paws, Garden Paws. There's a store in that. Yeah. There's a store in that.
(0:29:37) Al: Garden Paws, there we go.
(0:29:40) Al: Just put two generic words together, you've probably got a game.
(0:29:45) Codey: That was really fun.
(0:29:47) Al: Okay, I will correct myself.
(0:29:49) Al: There was one game where running a shop was fun, and that was, of course,
(0:29:52) Al: Meneko's Night Market.
(0:29:54) Al: But that was fun because of how very specifically curated it was.
(0:30:00) Al: It was like one scene every in-game week, and you could still, you know,
(0:30:05) Al: get money other ways at this
(0:30:07) Al: was just the best way to get money, right? You got the most money if you sold things this way.
(0:30:12) Al: So it, that one was fun, but these games where it's just like every day you go to the shop,
(0:30:16) Al: you put stuff up and you have to stand there.
(0:30:20) Codey: Yeah. Garden Paws, you could just open your store and then walk away, but then if something like ran out or whatever.
(0:30:28) Al: Well, this is the thing, they're all just more annoying ways of doing the thing that
(0:30:34) Al: in farming games we've had forever, which is you throw everything in a box and you get
(0:30:38) Al: the money, right? Why would I want more complications to that? That's not what I'm here for. I'm
(0:30:45) Al: here for the farming, and for the living, and for the people sometimes. I doubt I'll
(0:30:51) Al: be here for the people in this game. I might be wrong, and I will admit when I'm wrong
(0:30:55) Al: if it changes, but I suspect the-
(0:30:56) Codey: if you're wrong. Yeah.
(0:30:58) Al: people will have no personalities.
(0:31:01) Al: It's going to be Faith Arm all over again,
(0:31:03) Al: where there's some nice stuff about the game,
(0:31:05) Al: but overall the people are just boring.
(0:31:08) Codey: Okay, you heard it here, heard it here first. Boring.
(0:31:11) Al: Well, I mean, to be fair, I think I've said it multiple times.
(0:31:16) Al: I will play this game, right?
(0:31:17) Al: I need to play this game because it is getting so much buzz.
(0:31:21) Al: Like people seem to really like the idea of this game,
(0:31:24) Al: even though I don't understand why.
(0:31:26) Codey: Because it starts with an "S" and ends with "Dew Island".
(0:31:28) Al: >> Oh man. I cry. I cry. What have we got next? We have OVA Magica. They've announced
(0:31:29) Codey: And it starts with an "S" and ends with an "E" and ends with an "S" and ends with an "E".
(0:31:40) Al: that their first major update is out now. Yeah. I mean, to be honest, like, this is the sort of
(0:31:44) Codey: - Yep.
(0:31:45) Codey: It just...
(0:31:49) Al: thing where it's like, if you're playing this game, you'll be really excited about the updates
(0:31:52) Al: in this. And if you're not, you probably don't care that there are new blobs, new blob worlds,
(0:31:57) Codey: Yeah, but there's new cosmetic.
(0:31:58) Al: new events. It's the wrong one. It's in early access. I don't think they've announced when...
(0:32:00) Codey: Oh, nope, this is the wrong game.
(0:32:02) Codey: Just kidding.
(0:32:04) Codey: Yeah, that's it.
(0:32:05) Codey: When is this coming out?
(0:32:09) Codey: No, this podcast.
(0:32:11) Al: Oh, this episode.
(0:32:13) Codey: If you are listening to this on release day,
(0:32:17) Codey: if you are one of the cool kids,
(0:32:19) Codey: you can get this game for 20% off right now on Steam.
(0:32:24) Codey: But only for people, 20 on 20,
(0:32:27) Codey: if you're on the 21st, no 20.
(0:32:30) Codey: No 20 for you.
(0:32:31) Al: This is an example of one that will definitely not hit its time frame that it said in the Early Access. They said "Over Magic has currently planned to be in Early Access for roughly eight to 10 months with regular content updates leaving up to the 1.0 full release."
(0:32:31) Codey: That's it, that's all I have.
(0:32:46) Al: The first version of this came out in July, and this is their first content update. So that's what? Is that four months?
(0:32:52) Codey: Yep. July is seven. This is, yeah, this, yes, four months.
(0:33:02) Al: Which is fine, I'm not saying they have to rush it out, but they always underestimate it.
(0:33:07) Codey: What if they're not doing it regular? What if it's like, here's one update, and then here's another one, here's another one, here's another one, and it's released.
(0:33:15) Al: Well, I mean, they did say regular, they did the best, but they use that word regular.
(0:33:18) Codey: Oh, fair. They did.
(0:33:22) Codey: Nevermind.
(0:33:24) Al: You're like, what if they don't you mean this word that they used in the sentence?
(0:33:27) Codey: That they literally say.
(0:33:30) Codey: I tried, I tried to give them some grace. It did not work.
(0:33:34) Codey: work.
(0:33:35) Al: We're not here for grace, we're here for content.
(0:33:38) Codey: Content, bam, bam, bam, bam.
(0:33:41) Al: No, I actually, this is the problem with covering indie games.
(0:33:45) Al: I actually really liked the developer of Emajica. She seems like a really nice person,
(0:33:48) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:33:50) Al: and I don't want to be too harsh. So.
(0:33:52) Codey: Yeah.
(0:33:54) Codey: Well, and it's all in good fun.
(0:33:55) Codey: I mean, like I basically,
(0:33:57) Codey: we joked about this at the conference that I was just at
(0:33:59) Codey: that this is the third year in a row
(0:34:01) Codey: that we've wanted to have a symposium about neurodiversions,
(0:34:04) Codey: but all of the people who are trying to make the symposium
(0:34:08) Codey: have ADHD.
(0:34:11) Codey: And so it never happens because we all have ADHD.
(0:34:15) Codey: And I'm at the point now where I'm like,
(0:34:18) Codey: I'm not going to accept symposia ideas
(0:34:21) Codey: or whatever until like March,
(0:34:22) Codey: but I kind of want to start it right now
(0:34:25) Codey: and just have it done
(0:34:27) Codey: because I really want this to happen.
(0:34:28) Al: Yeah, yeah, it's why, yeah, I was talking to someone, a friend who's been diagnosed
(0:34:35) Al: with ADHD recently, and I was just asking, you know, what to expect if I end up looking
(0:34:41) Al: for a diagnosis. And I was like, it's really ironic that the way to start an ADHD diagnosis
(0:34:46) Codey: Yeah, I saw this recently, it was like, people who have a thing that cripples their ability
(0:34:47) Al: is to make an appointment. It's like, what do you expect here?
(0:35:01) Codey: to do small menial tasks and make appointments have to have three phone calls and make two
(0:35:07) Codey: appointments and like all this stuff.
(0:35:11) Codey: But that means that if you get through it all, you must really care.
(0:35:14) Al: Well this is the thing is because she actually got the diagnosis because she, like someone
(0:35:16) Codey: You don't care enough.
(0:35:25) Al: was noticing while she was postpartum, she'd just had a baby, and so they were like "I
(0:35:29) Codey: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(0:35:31) Al: think we need to do this" and she was like "Great" so she didn't even need to do that
(0:35:35) Al: first step, like that's the best way to get diagnosis when someone notices and does something
(0:35:39) Al: about it, but most people don't get that.
(0:35:40) Codey: Yep. That's pretty I had been going to doctors for a long
(0:35:45) Codey: time. And then finally, one of them was like, oh my gosh, you've
(0:35:48) Codey: been coming here for so long. Why don't I just send you to
(0:35:50) Codey: this other place? And the first person that saw me at that other
(0:35:53) Codey: place was like, Oh, yeah, you have it. Like she didn't even
(0:35:56) Codey: have to take me through the test. But yeah, all of that to
(0:36:01) Codey: say, our chiding is gentle, we please over magica human take
(0:36:07) Codey: your time. We can't do things.
(0:36:08) Al: I mean, she probably doesn't listen to the podcast anyway, you know.
(0:36:10) Codey: Please, Claudia. We can't do things on a timeline either, but if she does, you take
(0:36:19) Codey: your time. We're still here. We still are excited about your game. They're cute. I want
(0:36:23) Al: Your blobs are cute.
(0:36:24) Al: I want your, I was just about to say I want your blobs, but that sounds really bad.
(0:36:29) Codey: your blobs. One of the ones in the new trailer was a fox. That's pretty cute. Yeah. I think
(0:36:34) Al: Blob. You can, I'm pretty sure you can crossbreed the blobs as well. So could you make a Fox
(0:36:41) Codey: it was a fox. I was thinking more fox B, but okay.
(0:36:42) Al: cow blob? Ooh, Fox bee. Would that be like black and orange straighten? That's too similar
(0:36:51) Al: to be orange and yellow stripes.
(0:36:54) Codey: I would yeah I would think it's an orange and white striped bee that has a fox tail.
(0:37:02) Codey: And maybe with like uh little fox ears too little white tipped ears could be cute.
(0:37:08) Al: Interesting. Speaking of first major content update after an early access release.
(0:37:16) Al: We have fields of mystery have also announced their first major content update, and that is out now as you're listening comes out in the 18th of November, which is in the past now listeners.
(0:37:32) Al: Similarly to the previous update, you probably don't care about most of this stuff if you don't play the game.
(0:37:38) Al: It adds a bunch of stuff that will probably be really interesting to you.
(0:37:42) Codey: This is the one that adds cosmetic things.
(0:37:42) Al: So it does add cosmetic.
(0:37:46) Codey: You can change how you look.
(0:37:47) Codey: You can change how your pets look.
(0:37:49) Codey: You can get new drops from the monsters in the dungeons
(0:37:52) Codey: because surprise, there are new monsters in the dungeon.
(0:37:54) Codey: Mines, it's mines.
(0:37:56) Codey: I said dungeon, I meant mines.
(0:37:58) Codey: New heart events, new skill perks, a new festival, mounts.
(0:38:02) Codey: I'm excited about the mounts.
(0:38:02) Al: I don't know, never say never. You know the fun thing about one thing I really like about
(0:38:05) Codey: I'm never gonna play this game,
(0:38:06) Codey: but I was excited about that.
(0:38:13) Al: Fields of Mystery, just seeing as how we're talking about it. I'll talk more about this
(0:38:15) Al: in the main episode that we talk about it in. But you can change everything about yourself
(0:38:21) Al: after the initial thing, except your birthday. And that includes your pronouns, your name,
(0:38:28) Codey: That's cool
(0:38:30) Al: your look, et cetera.
(0:38:31) Codey: That's cool
(0:38:33) Al: Yeah, the number of times I've heard my trans friends say that they started a game
(0:38:38) Al: pre-transition, and then they're like, don't want to play the game now because I'm pre-transitioning
(0:38:43) Al: the game. Well, there you go in Fields of Mystery, you can just change. If only it was as simple as
(0:38:46) Codey: In the real world, womp, womp, it is becoming more obvious, I guess.
(0:38:48) Al: that. [LAUGHTER]
(0:38:57) Codey: I've had a couple people, I don't know if I've said this on the pod or not, but I have
(0:39:01) Codey: decided to expand my pronouns to she/they, so anything she/her or they/them are acceptable.
(0:39:10) Codey: This happened because I'm pretty sure my tattoo artist thought I was non-binary and they called
(0:39:14) Codey: me think, for a really long time.
(0:39:16) Codey: And I was like, you know what, that doesn't sound wrong.
(0:39:20) Codey: That does not sound wrong, but he does.
(0:39:24) Codey: I do not identify as he/him.
(0:39:26) Codey: So I am...
(0:39:28) Al: Either you're going to say "I do not identify as a he" or a him, a he or a him, either of
(0:39:28) Codey: Yeah, or as... No, I don't.
(0:39:33) Codey: So yeah, I'm she/they.
(0:39:35) Codey: Or him. Or his. None of those things.
(0:39:36) Al: them. Or a his. Well, I don't know. Well, I mean, it depends how traditionally possessive
(0:39:39) Codey: So yeah.
(0:39:46) Al: about relationships you want to go, because I presume your partner, does your partner
(0:39:50) Al: go by he/him. Okay, but you could arguably say you are his.
(0:39:51) Codey: Um, I think he's also he they, but he Ooh, you, you're right.
(0:39:58) Al: But then I know that, you know, obviously there are negative connotations to the patriarchal
(0:40:05) Al: view of relationships like that. Well, yes. Yeah, OK. Of course. Of course. I'm just saying
(0:40:08) Codey: I mean, but he's mine, so it's not a one-way thing.
(0:40:13) Al: that the idea of being owned by a man is obviously historically... What's the word I'm looking
(0:40:16) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:20) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:21) Al: for... "ablimatic" is the word, but yeah, it works.
(0:40:22) Codey: Ick?
(0:40:25) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:26) Codey: No, so all of this is to say like,
(0:40:28) Codey: that is something that I have,
(0:40:30) Codey: that's recently occurred in my life,
(0:40:31) Codey: but it's kind of been like under the radar.
(0:40:33) Codey: I didn't have like a big, hey, this is happening now.
(0:40:36) Codey: And I've had at least three humans
(0:40:38) Codey: week reach out to me independently and say,
(0:40:41) Codey: hey, may I ask what your pronouns are?
(0:40:44) Codey: 'Cause I think they've changed.
(0:40:46) Codey: And I was like, wow, they have, thank you.
(0:40:47) Codey: Thank you for confirming.
(0:40:51) Codey: So it is, though, again,
(0:40:53) Codey: I'm in a very liberal, progressive life.
(0:40:57) Codey: But people are becoming more accepting of it.
(0:41:01) Codey: I feel like in the general.
(0:41:03) Al: the people you want to spend time with anyway.
(0:41:05) Al: >> [LAUGH]
(0:41:06) Codey: Yeah.
(0:41:07) Codey: Well, and it's funny because
(0:41:08) Codey: because of things in life right now, uh, there are those who are in hide
(0:41:13) Codey: mode who are trying to protect themselves, which is 100% valid.
(0:41:14) Al: Mm-hmm
(0:41:17) Codey: Um, I'm in fight mode.
(0:41:19) Codey: So both in my institution, uh, but also in my politics, I am not going to go
(0:41:27) Codey: quietly into that good night.
(0:41:28) Codey: I'm, I'm ready to fight.
(0:41:30) Codey: Um, and I've told all of my friends that if they need someone to fight for them,
(0:41:33) Codey: hit me up because I'm in fight mode right now, not flight.
(0:41:38) Al: Fair enough. It's fine, I'll cut it. It doesn't need to go in. Yeah, so a bunch of stuff.
(0:41:39) Codey: Uh, that was a weird aside.
(0:41:40) Codey: Anyway, we have a couple new games.
(0:41:45) Codey: You don't have to cut it.
(0:41:46) Codey: It's fine.
(0:41:50) Codey: Mm hmm.
(0:41:51) Codey: Woo!
(0:41:54) Al: That's all of the game news, but we also have new games. Two new games to talk about.
(0:42:00) Al: The first is Whimsied, a creature collection game that sits at the bottom of your screen
(0:42:07) Al: and fits easily into your...
(0:42:08) Al: routine. Whether you're working, studying, or relaxing, Whimsight is always ready to offer you cozy
(0:42:15) Al: pauses, capture creatures, create new species, and decorate your whimsical space in this soothing
(0:42:20) Al: adventure. So we're finishing the trilogy of, we're going to call them rusty retirement likes.
(0:42:28) Codey: Yeah, that was a I said, Oh, no, what did Rusty's retirement do?
(0:42:34) Codey: Because they really opened up a a worm of cans.
(0:42:38) Al: this feels like the most dangerous one to me
(0:42:39) Codey: But yeah, I think it's.
(0:42:43) Codey: Yeah, yeah, because it's it's creature collection.
(0:42:47) Codey: It's also you breed things together and you create new things.
(0:42:50) Codey: I also really like that the little creatures are 2D, like,
(0:42:54) Codey: and when they turn themselves, they just turn they're like a little plane of paper
(0:42:58) Al: Like, yeah, people are mad at you, ask.
(0:43:00) Codey: I don't know. Yeah, very paper Mario esque and that was really cute.
(0:43:05) Codey: Yeah. Oh, heck, I am.
(0:43:09) Codey: My all my dollar bucks are going to go away for this.
(0:43:12) Al: Oh, they call them winlings.
(0:43:13) Codey: So, yeah. Yeah, they're windlings.
(0:43:20) Codey: Yep, it looks really cute.
(0:43:21) Codey: The release date is currently to be determined, but you can
(0:43:25) Codey: support the person, I think, on some way.
(0:43:28) Codey: That I saw pre pre down.
(0:43:32) Codey: I don't know. You can do something to support them that one.
(0:43:34) Al: Go add it to your wishlist.
(0:43:37) Al: That's always the best thing before games are out,
(0:43:41) Al: because it pushes them up the charts when they do come out.
(0:43:44) Codey: Oh, I didn't know that.
(0:43:46) Codey: The more you know.
(0:43:48) Codey: Um, yeah, very cute. Are you are you are you going to get that one.
(0:43:54) Codey: Or is that going to be a me and john.
(0:43:56) Al: So the problem is, I do like the concept of it,
(0:43:59) Al: but the problem is the time I spend on a computer is work.
(0:44:04) Codey: Yeah.
(0:44:04) Al: And I work on a machine owned by the client I work for.
(0:44:07) Al: So I can't just install things on there.
(0:44:08) Codey: Yeah.
(0:44:11) Al: And so I just don't think there would be time
(0:44:13) Al: that I would be sitting in front of a computer
(0:44:15) Al: that I would be able to have it on.
(0:44:18) Al: If I like, you know, worked on my own machine doing work,
(0:44:22) Al: then I would absolutely be playing games
(0:44:24) Al: like this in Rusty's retirement.
(0:44:25) Al: I just don't see the time I could.
(0:44:28) Codey: Yeah. I foresee, uh, much time in which I could play this game because, uh, in the next year,
(0:44:35) Codey: probably in the latter half of the next year, I will be writing, um, and running code. In which
(0:44:42) Codey: case I need much distraction. So, uh, bring it on. Quim side. I also love how you pronounce it
(0:44:49) Codey: because the H comes first. Say it. Feel like there's an H in there. A couple of times when
(0:44:56) Codey: When you said it, you said quin-
(0:44:58) Codey: I know, I like it.
(0:44:58) Al: Oh yeah, well that was just, yeah, it was just over. It's a Family Guy reference.
(0:45:06) Al: Anyway, apologies for the Family Guy reference, people. I'm not one of those people.
(0:45:13) Al: You know, there's a couple of TV shows that I enjoy watching, but I do not want to be
(0:45:17) Al: considered a fan of it, because fans of them are terrible people. That's one of them.
(0:45:20) Codey: Yeah, yeah.
(0:45:22) Al: The other one is Rick and Marty. It's like, I enjoy them, and I find them amusing,
(0:45:28) Al: someone saying, "Oh, they're so funny." I start to go, "Do you like them for a good reason,
(0:45:34) Al: or for a bad reason?" It's like, specifically with Rick and Marty, it's like,
(0:45:37) Codey: Yeah.
(0:45:40) Al: "Do you think of Rick as a role model?" Because that's a problem.
(0:45:45) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:45:49) Al: Anyway, good fun.
(0:45:51) Codey: There's a lot of people when I meet them
(0:45:53) Codey: and they're like, "Man, I love Rick and Morty."
(0:45:54) Codey: And I'm like, "Ooh."
(0:45:58) Al: That is at least a number flag, right?
(0:45:58) Codey: That's not as good of a thing as you think it is.
(0:46:06) Al: Like that is, we gotta figure out what the reason you like it is, but also the fact that
(0:46:07) Codey: An amber flick.
(0:46:14) Al: you're so enthusiastic about it initially, you know, it's fine to like it, but you gotta
(0:46:18) Al: feel a little bit bad about it, right?
(0:46:20) Codey: Yeah.
(0:46:22) Al: It's like, I like it, but please do not bundle me in with those people.
(0:46:25) Codey: Yep, it's people like me who I like it
(0:46:28) Codey: because it takes existing like jokes and stuff
(0:46:32) Codey: and like puts dark humor to it, which I like.
(0:46:34) Al: Yeah.
(0:46:37) Codey: But yeah, okay.
(0:46:41) Codey: You have made this new section so long.
(0:46:44) Codey: You did that on purpose.
(0:46:46) Codey: We still have another game.
(0:46:47) Codey: Come on, let's go.
(0:46:49) Codey: You did this on purpose, because I--
(0:46:50) Codey: that it wasn't going to be that long.
(0:46:51) Al: I think you'll find it just was long.
(0:46:53) Al: The final new game is Honeygrove.
(0:46:54) Codey: You did this on purpose, because it wasn't going to be that long.
(0:47:00) Al: I was just very confused, because apparently the Twitter account is called
(0:47:03) Al: Beatrice, honey.
(0:47:04) Codey: - Yeah, her name is.
(0:47:05) Al: And I'm like, what's the - oh, is that the main - is that the character Beatrice?
(0:47:08) Codey: Yeah, the main character is, yeah, she's Beatrice.
(0:47:11) Al: Beeee Beatrice.
(0:47:12) Codey: No, it's spelled just Beatrice.
(0:47:14) Al: No, I know, but Beatrice.
(0:47:15) Codey: There's no two, I'm aware.
(0:47:23) Al: Oh, I die.
(0:47:26) Al: And this just calls itself a cosy story driven gardening sim.
(0:47:31) Codey: Oh, there was more to it.
(0:47:32) Codey: Here, let me find it again.
(0:47:32) Al: Well, that was all that was on the web.
(0:47:35) Al: There's almost nothing on the website and the website doesn't even really work.
(0:47:39) Al: So you have to go to the app stores because it's on iOS and Android.
(0:47:44) Al: But yeah, do you want to, do you want to take it away?
(0:47:49) Codey: Uh, I did, and I also had it up, but then I had to find it again because I got, I ducked
(0:47:54) Codey: out of it to download Pokemon pocket. Honey Grove is the cozy gardening and farming game
(0:48:00) Codey: you've always wanted to play. Bold. Design and nurture your garden of wildflowers where
(0:48:02) Al: I've always wanted to play.
(0:48:07) Codey: every bloom and harvest will help you revive Honey Grove. So there are the following features.
(0:48:14) Codey: Meaning, uh, you unlock plants over time, you harvest scrap. Sweet. Adore!
(0:48:19) Codey: Trouble bee narrative. Meet a delightful array of bees. That's for me to decide. Uh, each
(0:48:24) Codey: with their own personalities and talents. From green-found gardeners to intrepid explorers
(0:48:28) Codey: and skilled crafters. Weow. Save the town. Send your adventurous explorer bees to uncover
(0:48:31) Al: Weeee!
(0:48:36) Codey: new locations. Weow. Crafting. Gather resources, merge, and craft these into equipment essential
(0:48:43) Codey: for Honey Grove's rebuild. Explore rebuilt parts of the town, including the garden shop,
(0:48:47) Codey: community cafe and decoration shop.
(0:48:50) Codey: I think it's only been out for a couple days.
(0:48:51) Codey: It's got a rating of 4.9, which is nice.
(0:48:53) Codey: Uh, it's free, but it says that there are internet purchases, uh, on the.
(0:48:56) Codey: Comment or not comments reviews.
(0:48:58) Codey: Someone said there are no ads.
(0:48:59) Codey: Which is pretty awesome.
(0:49:00) Codey: And despite the app saying that it is available worldwide.
(0:49:02) Codey: Um, there are a bunch of, um,
(0:49:04) Codey: I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:05) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:06) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:07) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:08) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:09) Codey: I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:10) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:11) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:12) Codey: Um, I don't know if you guys can hear me.
(0:49:19) Codey: one star or small star reviews from one person saying well why does it say it's
(0:49:25) Codey: regional when I can't play in some country and then there's another one
(0:49:30) Codey: that's definitely Russian and they're saying something and so I'm assuming they
(0:49:34) Codey: also can't play so there it's not a hundred percent worldwide yet so
(0:49:38) Al: But it's available for you and it's available for me and that's all that matters.
(0:49:42) Codey: yeah yeah so possibly stay tuned for the future
(0:49:48) Al: No promises! We never promise anything! I'm not writing it down. I'm not writing it down in
(0:49:50) Codey: Al is promising it. Al is promising it.
(0:49:54) Al: the episodes list right now. I am not promising it. Alrighty, that's the news!
(0:49:58) Codey: Wooo!
(0:50:04) Al: Right now, Cody's gonna tell me about bees in Minecraft. I thought Minecraft already had bees.
(0:50:10) Codey: It does. So glad you asked, Al.
(0:50:14) Al: I didn't ask, I just stated.
(0:50:17) Codey: Feed the Bees is an add-on created by Feed the Beast, which is the creator. It only cost 600.
(0:50:23) Al: is that not a game feed the beast
(0:50:25) Codey: I think it was going to be, I think that was a beast game. I think that was going to be
(0:50:31) Codey: a game that Al created, but they ended up changing the name.
(0:50:36) Al: Oh yes, because there was another game called Feed the Beast.
(0:50:39) Codey: Sure.
(0:50:40) Al: No, there is. I can see one. It's called Feed the Beast. It's on Steam.
(0:50:42) Codey: Okay.
(0:50:42) Codey: Okay.
(0:50:43) Al: Make the Beast eat all the other players. That's not El's one, though.
(0:50:44) Codey: But L's.
(0:50:46) Codey: No.
(0:50:46) Codey: L's got a new, it's a new name.
(0:50:48) Al: Yeah, it's one based on Factorio. I can't remember what it is, but they asked if Factorio-
(0:50:56) Codey: remember that. But I want to know what it is. Tea Engineers, Mudborne, Apico, Snack Torrio
(0:51:05) Al: There we go.
(0:51:06) Codey: is their game. But not all of this to say, Feed the Bees is created by Feed the Beast.
(0:51:13) Codey: It is 660 Minecraft coins, which is £3.29. Did I say that right? $4.50 USD. Really,
(0:51:19) Al: Yeah, sure.
(0:51:24) Codey: really not a lot of money.
(0:51:26) Codey: Um, it adds a few, uh, NPCs that sell bee related things.
(0:51:30) Codey: Plus most importantly, it adds 128 bees from different resources.
(0:51:35) Codey: So there it is.
(0:51:36) Codey: So there's a lot of bees that are already in the game.
(0:51:38) Codey: Like there are bees that are already in the game and they create these
(0:51:41) Codey: like natural bee nests on trees.
(0:51:44) Codey: And then you can.
(0:51:46) Codey: Sheer the honey out of those nests.
(0:51:50) Codey: I think you can also smoke them, like put like a little fire below them.
(0:51:54) Codey: And then they're not grumpy with you.
(0:51:57) Codey: Um, and you can use them.
(0:51:59) Codey: No one wants grumpy bees and you can use them to like, uh, improve your farming.
(0:52:07) Codey: Um, and so that's something that already exists in the game, but this
(0:52:12) Codey: adds those 128 bees, add a whole bunch of other stuff too.
(0:52:16) Codey: Um, and it's really cool.
(0:52:19) Codey: Uh, confirming, so there for the forestry mod, it was the original
(0:52:24) Codey: Like adding of.
(0:52:27) Codey: Be stuff into Minecraft.
(0:52:30) Codey: And I believe that was also by feed the beast.
(0:52:35) Codey: Um, so it might just be a reskinning of something that they've already done before.
(0:52:40) Codey: But it is a completely different thing.
(0:52:42) Codey: So that used to have like different types of bees that you could make.
(0:52:46) Codey: And there were different farms and harvesters, harvesters, um, added beekeeping.
(0:52:51) Codey: There were all these different things, but this, uh, creates specifically
(0:52:57) Codey: source based bees.
(0:52:58) Codey: So there is a coal bee and a granite bee and a gravel bee, like all of that kind of stuff.
(0:53:05) Codey: When you first start up the game, after downloading the mod, you're given a guide.
(0:53:08) Codey: Um, plus like a box that has some starter bees.
(0:53:11) Codey: It's usually very simple, like dirt and water, um, basic ones.
(0:53:15) Codey: Um, did you ever play?
(0:53:16) Al: Just your, just your basic Bs.
(0:53:18) Codey: Yeah, your basic simple ones.
(0:53:19) Codey: Um, did you ever play alchemy or a game like that?
(0:53:22) Codey: where you like. So it's a game where you're literally just melding.
(0:53:26) Codey: Things together, like you're smashing different things together and it creates new things.
(0:53:32) Al: Is that like the the the one the grid based games and you've got like the thing
(0:53:39) Codey: No, I mean, alchemy just had like, you had different resources and then you throw them
(0:53:45) Codey: together and then it creates sometimes creates new things. Um, this isn't creating bigger
(0:53:49) Codey: things. It's just like, like, for example, if you want a Moss B, you mix a water B and
(0:53:56) Codey: a grass B and then they have a baby Moss B. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
(0:54:00) Al: So how does that work gameplay-wise?
(0:54:04) Al: Because obviously, are you crafting like you would in Minecraft, or are you doing something
(0:54:10) Codey: So yeah, it's like what you would do when you're breeding anything in Minecraft where you have two adults of whatever thing.
(0:54:17) Codey: Like, for example, with cows, you have two cows, you feed them each a wheat and then they have hearts around them and they hug.
(0:54:27) Codey: And then they pop out a baby cow, a special hug.
(0:54:29) Al: A special hug.
(0:54:31) Codey: And it's basically that.
(0:54:32) Codey: So the bees can be in glass jars and then you drop them.
(0:54:39) Codey: Break the jar on the ground and it uses up the jar and then the bee is in the world.
(0:54:44) Codey: And then you do that with the other bee that you want to breed.
(0:54:47) Codey: And then you give them both any flower and then they do the special hug and then a baby comes out.
(0:54:56) Codey: There are bees that are resources.
(0:54:58) Codey: There are bees that are things that are already created like barrels and chests.
(0:55:05) Codey: So, it's a little bee that looks like a barrel or a little bee that looks like a chest.
(0:55:09) Codey: And that is how you breed them. My favorite is the Skeleton Bee.
(0:55:17) Codey: Literally just looks like a floating bee skeleton. Skeleton bees don't have skeletons.
(0:55:24) Codey: They have exoskeletons made out of chitin, but it looks like a little floating skeleton,
(0:55:30) Codey: and it's really cute. Yeah, they're really cute. It is really hard to find stuff online
(0:55:37) Codey: about this mod pack.
(0:55:39) Codey: If you want to get this mod pack and you want an excel file where you can keep track
(0:56:00) Codey: of what you have, how you can get it, etc.
(0:56:04) Codey: I have that already and I can share that with anyone.
(0:56:07) Codey: Um, yeah, so there are these.
(0:56:09) Codey: 128 bees to collect and you can collect them in a variety of ways.
(0:56:13) Codey: Uh, the first one is some of them you can find in the world.
(0:56:16) Codey: It's some of the really basic ones.
(0:56:18) Codey: Um, you can just find them, uh, as they're flying around in whatever
(0:56:25) Codey: biome they're supposed to be a part of.
(0:56:27) Codey: So for example, there's birch bees, which you will find by birch trees.
(0:56:33) Codey: They're a, yeah, they're a really light color.
(0:56:37) Codey: like they look like little little
(0:56:39) Codey: birch logs. Um and they're just
(0:56:43) Codey: flying around and I think they
(0:56:45) Codey: have most of the ones that are
(0:56:47) Codey: affiliated with a jungle or a
(0:56:49) Codey: woody area have green, green
(0:56:51) Codey: wings, just really cute. Um so
(0:56:55) Codey: you just find it and you catch
(0:56:57) Codey: it in the jar. Um and that's
(0:57:00) Codey: that's like the main way to
(0:57:02) Codey: acquire, I would say like the
(0:57:04) Codey: bottom tier or basic ones that
(0:57:06) Codey: are that you can then use to
(0:57:10) Codey: again, we already mentioned
(0:57:11) Codey: breeding. So if you already have
(0:57:13) Codey: the two prerequisite bees and
(0:57:15) Codey: you just breed them together,
(0:57:16) Codey: you can create um the one that
(0:57:19) Codey: you want. There's also a guy I
(0:57:21) Codey: think he's called like the
(0:57:22) Codey: wandering beekeeper. He you can
(0:57:25) Codey: just buy yeah you can just buy
(0:57:28) Codey: stuff from him. So it's so funny
(0:57:30) Codey: because he you know how there's
(0:57:31) Codey: that guy that has like wolves on
(0:57:32) Codey: a leash and there's the guy that
(0:57:34) Codey: has the two llamas on a leash on
(0:57:38) Codey: leads.
(0:57:40) Codey: So there's a wandering trader that just has like two llamas on
(0:57:43) Codey: a leash, and then you can like trade with him and he just has
(0:57:46) Codey: random stuff. This guy just has two bees on a lead on like two
(0:57:51) Codey: different leads. And I remember going to like a meadow area
(0:57:55) Codey: because I was trying to find a specific type of bee that shows
(0:57:58) Codey: up in the meadow. And I just looked over and I saw two bees
(0:58:00) Codey: flying around and I was like, Oh my gosh, there they are. And
(0:58:03) Codey: then I ran over and it was this frickin guy. And so I killed
(0:58:07) Codey: him because I was mad.
(0:58:09) Codey: Um, but you, you can buy using, you can't acquire the bees that he has.
(0:58:15) Codey: If you kill him, he doesn't drop them as loot, which is very sad, but you can buy
(0:58:19) Codey: them from him with emerald.
(0:58:21) Codey: You can get some really niche ones.
(0:58:23) Codey: Like some of them are require pretty deep, pretty in-depth, like breeding
(0:58:28) Codey: stuff to get them, like, like 10 process, 10 breed, breedings down the line, you
(0:58:35) Codey: know, um, but he'll just sell them.
(0:58:38) Codey: So he had like the crying.
(0:58:39) Codey: one, which is pretty cool.
(0:58:44) Al: I'm very confused, because there seems to be a bee breeding mod from Feed the Beast.
(0:58:49) Al: It doesn't look like what I was expecting, and like all the YouTube videos on it are from 2017.
(0:58:55) Codey: Mm-hmm. So that was his old one, their old one. I don't know their pronouns.
(0:58:59) Codey: This is their new one. I don't know if they, so they basically repurposed whatever it was that
(0:59:03) Codey: they had, I believe, because it seems pretty similar, but this is with resources. It's called
(0:59:10) Codey: Feed the Bees. Correct.
(0:59:12) Al: It's called Feed the Bees.
(0:59:14) Al: Right, I'm Googling wrong.
(0:59:17) Al: Feed the bees.
(0:59:19) Al: There we go.
(0:59:20) Al: Perfect.
(0:59:20) Codey: Yeah. There's really not a lot about it though, because it only came out a couple months ago, I think.
(0:59:21) Al: Bound it.
(0:59:24) Al: Yes, but that's much easier to Google for than bees.
(0:59:26) Codey: Yeah. Yeah. So you can purchase some from the guy and then you can also smelt or craft some
(0:59:27) Al: Minecraft breeding.
(0:59:35) Codey: of them. So if you have like some of them require that you literally just throw a certain type of
(0:59:41) Codey: bee, I think like the charcoal bee, you have to put any wood bee into the smelter and then it pops
(0:59:46) Al: Oh no, that's very cute but also a bit horrifying.
(0:59:47) Codey: out a charcoal pea, stuff like that.
(0:59:50) Codey: I think you can also do-- so like the water bee,
(0:59:53) Codey: if you're having a hard time finding it, you can use--
(0:59:55) Codey: you can put just a regular bee and then put water around it,
(1:00:00) Codey: and then it creates a water bee for you.
(1:00:02) Al: Okay, yeah, so I'm seeing a video of this. This looks much more like what I was expecting.
(1:00:06) Codey: Yeah.
(1:00:07) Al: You can put the bees in jars. No, that's okay. And then you create your A period.
(1:00:09) Codey: Yeah, you catch them in jars.
(1:00:10) Codey: Sorry, I should have said that.
(1:00:13) Codey: That's how you catch them when you see them in the world, is you--
(1:00:20) Codey: Yeah, so you start out, so I guess like other than just collecting all of these random bees,
(1:00:24) Codey: like why should you care? Correct. But you can create hives, which you can then make into bee
(1:00:27) Al: Well, but what's silly, why, why should you?
(1:00:29) Al: Because you're collecting bees.
(1:00:31) Al: Why collect anything?
(1:00:37) Codey: boxes. And then when you put a bee, say you put a diamond bee in a bee box, it then creates
(1:00:48) Codey: Diamond Honeycomb.
(1:00:50) Codey: And you can use the apiarists table to convert that into actual diamonds.
(1:00:58) Codey: So it's basically creating a renewable resource for diamonds.
(1:01:03) Codey: Or for whatever it is that you want.
(1:01:06) Codey: So I have like emeralds are really important because you use them to buy a lot of crap with all these like traders and stuff.
(1:01:12) Codey: So really looking forward to finally getting our emerald hive going.
(1:01:17) Codey: Emerald Beehive because then it just.
(1:01:20) Codey: Emerald Honeycomb, and it just continues to do this, even when you're not playing a game, which is wild or like when you're not around, because I went back after doing some Fox stuff in my game, I went back to the B area because we have a thing called the B Dome.
(1:01:37) Codey: And there was just like the hives were full because they act like storage containers.
(1:01:45) Codey: They were completely full of honeycomb,
(1:01:47) Codey: but then there was honeycomb like on top of the hives.
(1:01:50) Codey: floating there because they're just like,
(1:01:52) Codey: they're like, I don't care that I'm full.
(1:01:53) Codey: I'm just going to keep producing.
(1:01:54) Codey: So there's a ton of honeycomb that's just like spawned
(1:01:57) Codey: in the world above them.
(1:01:58) Codey: So yeah, it basically makes you,
(1:02:00) Codey: gives you the ability to free farm all of these resources.
(1:02:03) Codey: So I don't have to ever look for comb coal again,
(1:02:07) Codey: because I just have my coal bees just pumping it out.
(1:02:13) Codey: I never have to look for emerald.
(1:02:15) Codey: I never have to look for like any of this stuff,
(1:02:18) Codey: which is pretty awesome.
(1:02:20) Codey: Some final things that I have written down
(1:02:24) Codey: is that if you hit them,
(1:02:25) Codey: they will all chase you like the chickens and Zelda do.
(1:02:28) Al: Yeah, even the ones that you're, you're, that you've like captured.
(1:02:30) Codey: Like if you hit one around a bunch of them,
(1:02:32) Codey: they'll all come after you.
(1:02:34) Codey: So, oh, they're, yeah, they're all your, yeah.
(1:02:38) Codey: Yeah, it doesn't matter.
(1:02:39) Codey: But if you're, this gives you different armors.
(1:02:42) Codey: And if you're, if you have the beekeeper armor on,
(1:02:45) Codey: they do not come after you.
(1:02:48) Codey: Yeah, there's also--
(1:02:50) Codey: giant flowers, so you can plant these flowers,
(1:02:54) Codey: and then you put fertilizer down on the flower itself,
(1:02:57) Codey: and then they can become huge.
(1:03:00) Codey: It's crazy.
(1:03:02) Codey: It increases their size by--
(1:03:05) Codey: they're almost tree-sized, but they're
(1:03:07) Codey: just the little flowers that you see in the world.
(1:03:11) Codey: There's the bee armor, the hive armor, and the beekeeper armor.
(1:03:16) Codey: The bee armor is the cutest.
(1:03:17) Codey: They can all be enchanted.
(1:03:18) Codey: Really cute.
(1:03:20) Codey: New decorative blocks so you can create like honeycomb buildings and stuff.
(1:03:24) Codey: Um, to me, it just looks like sandstone, so I don't super care, but I'm here for the, for the resources and the breeding and the collecting, to be honest.
(1:03:36) Codey: And yeah, for that, I've already created an Excel file.
(1:03:36) Al: Yeah. I mean, you never have to convince me that something is worth doing if it's collecting,
(1:03:45) Al: because that is my thing. And the bees look, the models look really nice. They're in keeping with
(1:03:46) Codey: - Mm-hmm, yep, yeah, it's really fun.
(1:03:55) Al: the original bee and just, you know, Minecraft stuff in general, which is nice. Yeah.
(1:03:57) Codey: Yeah, it's like a new skin, basically.
(1:04:02) Codey: It's just a new skin that goes over it.
(1:04:04) Codey: And they all have unique appearances.
(1:04:08) Codey: And they're really cool.
(1:04:10) Codey: I lost my mind when I saw the skeleton one in the nether
(1:04:13) Codey: for the first time.
(1:04:14) Codey: I was trying to find soul sand bees.
(1:04:17) Codey: But I came upon a skeleton bee, and I was freaking out
(1:04:21) Codey: because it was so cute.
(1:04:27) Codey: That's my tangent about bee breeding
(1:04:32) Codey: and how I'm doing this.
(1:04:33) Al: Nice.
(1:04:34) Al: I don't think I have any questions other than what I've talked about, because it's pretty
(1:04:37) Al: self-explanatory.
(1:04:38) Al: Right?
(1:04:38) Codey: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty self-explanatory.
(1:04:39) Al: Yeah.
(1:04:40) Al: There's nothing that I can think of that I would want in this that you haven't.
(1:04:41) Codey: It's-- yeah, I think it's really useful--
(1:04:48) Codey: first of all, it's fun to collect.
(1:04:49) Codey: Then it's useful if you're finding in your Minecraft
(1:04:53) Codey: world, you're having a hard time finding certain resources
(1:04:55) Codey: because you've just stripped.
(1:04:56) Al: - Yeah, yeah, no, that's really nice.
(1:04:57) Codey: Strip-minded area clean where you are, um, this is kind of fun because you can just go find the bee wherever it is. Like I, they need to go find like a snow be because although you do it, goodness, all the snow bees are really all the snowy areas are pretty far away from my where we're set up my farm, not my farm base, my base.
(1:05:22) Al: Is there a ghost bee? The bee?
(1:05:25) Codey: No, there's--
(1:05:27) Codey: There's not a booby.
(1:05:30) Al: I'm so funny
(1:05:33) Codey: I will say the reason I didn't laugh at your Beatrice joke earlier was because we had--
(1:05:37) Codey: When I had my field seasons between 2019 and--
(1:05:41) Codey: No, 2018 and 2019, we called our field vehicle Beatrice.
(1:05:45) Al: I mean, I don't think you need to have a reason for not laughing at my jokes,
(1:05:48) Al: other than just "they're not funny".
(1:05:51) Codey: They are funny. It's just that I've heard them before.
(1:05:54) Al: I mean, they're not, but OK.
(1:05:55) Codey: But some people might not.
(1:05:57) Codey: I have heard them before. It's not kind of me to just like dead face.
(1:06:02) Al: I mean, don't worry, Cody, I am used
(1:06:03) Codey: Okay, but yeah, that's that.
(1:06:08) Codey: That's that listeners if you have any questions about it reach out to me.
(1:06:12) Codey: Or if you want that Excel file let me know I can make a template version right now we're using it.
(1:06:17) Codey: My best friend Devin and I are using it to keep track of what all we have.
(1:06:22) Codey: But yeah, and he's making a Dewey Decimal System for us to like, category.
(1:06:27) Codey: We're putting it in the B-dome. We're making it like a little museum, basically, and we're putting it in the B-dome, because he made me a B-dome, which is just like a huge dome that has a bunch of bees in it and a bunch of flowers.
(1:06:29) Al: - What a nerd.
(1:06:41) Codey: So we're putting it in there, and he wanted a way to figure out where they all were, and he was like, "Well, I'm going to make a Dewey Decimal System."
(1:06:50) Codey: figure out where they all were.
(1:06:53) Codey: He was like, well, I'm gonna make a dood.
(1:06:56) Al: Look, I know, I know you shouldn't, you know, those who live in glass houses should not
(1:07:00) Al: throw stones, but my word or a pair of nerds, that's all I'm going to say.
(1:07:00) Codey: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're trying to figure out exactly what because we thought we're
(1:07:10) Codey: almost done with the fox. Like I just have to finish one side of the fox and then it's done.
(1:07:15) Codey: I think we want to do something with the inside of the fox, but it's pretty huge.
(1:07:19) Codey: So we got to figure that out. Ooh, maybe I'll just make it a huge library.
(1:07:25) Codey: That would be horrifying. But yeah, we're trying to figure out what to do next.
(1:07:30) Codey: And this was the next thing that we found. So a bunch of, bunch of nerds with bees.
(1:07:34) Al: with bees you don't uh nobody messes with the nerds with bees
(1:07:41) Codey: They really don't.
(1:07:43) Al: mainly because they just stay away from me uh sorry well thank you for talking to me about
(1:07:50) Al: bees in minecraft uh maybe one day we'll get a third minecraft episode um i'm sure we will
(1:07:52) Codey: Yes, of course.
(1:07:56) Codey: Oh, I'm sure we will.
(1:07:57) Codey: Maybe I'll try and find a farming one that's like, that's more than just farming that we,
(1:07:58) Al: it's the never-ending game
(1:08:02) Codey: because we could do farming, we could do some pretty detailed farming on our farm as well to create bone meal.
(1:08:08) Codey: But maybe I'll find like a pretty intense farm mod.
(1:08:14) Codey: I don't know, we'll see what happens.
(1:08:15) Al: Yeah we did, because that's what we were talking about in the main, the first episode was the
(1:08:19) Al: farming in Minecraft, which I'm sure has changed since we talked about it, but I used to do quite
(1:08:20) Codey: Yep. Yeah.
(1:08:25) Al: a lot of, like have a bunch of mods for more automation stuff, and like make a big automated
(1:08:30) Codey: Yep. Yup. Mm hmm. I have officially deleted all of my tweets. So you can find me on blue sky for
(1:08:31) Al: farm. That was fun. Well yeah, anyway thank you for joining me Cody, where can people find you
(1:08:37) Al: on the internet? Whoo!
(1:08:45) Codey: professional content. It's just my name Cody Mathis and on Instagram. Hiking beagle be eagle
(1:08:52) Codey: for my fun content. That's going to be video games, memes, my dogs, things like that.
(1:08:58) Codey: Thank you so much for watching.
(1:09:00) Codey: Yeah, so and I will say I deleted my tweets, but I did not delete my Twitter because I don't want someone else to take my name and then pretend they're me.
(1:09:08) Codey: So I just deleted all of the content.
(1:09:12) Codey: And it's just sitting there now because I don't want my content scraped for AI.
(1:09:16) Codey: Whoo.
(1:09:18) Al: a woo! You can find me on most social networks now. I haven't figured out what I'm doing,
(1:09:18) Codey: How about you?
(1:09:26) Al: where I'm going to be, because everybody is different places, but I exist on most social
(1:09:31) Al: networks as the Scottbot. So find me. You can find the podcast on Tumblr at THSPod.
(1:09:40) Al: I'm probably going to join other social media for the podcast as well, because obviously,
(1:09:45) Al: Like, I mean, I don't post on social media myself very much.
(1:09:48) Al: Right. Like I don't do that anymore, but the podcast does.
(1:09:51) Al: So got to be on everything.
(1:09:54) Al: I've just not figured that one out.
(1:09:55) Al: I've literally spent today, like slowly migrating off of Twitter,
(1:10:01) Al: trying to find replacement for my farming games,
(1:10:05) Al: Twitter list, which had 150 accounts on it.
(1:10:10) Al: Not all of those are on other social media now, so that's fun.
(1:10:13) Codey: Yep. It's a fun time to be alive right now.
(1:10:18) Al: I will never forgive Elon Musk for this, because Twitter was the place to be,
(1:10:24) Al: it was where everything was, and you didn't have to worry about other places, and then he just
(1:10:28) Al: turned it into this right-wing propaganda tool for a fascist government, and I hate him.
(1:10:30) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah. I don't think that you're. Yeah. Yeah, they can't let any of us have nice things.
(1:10:37) Al: I mean, also the whole, you know, getting a fascist elected as well is obviously
(1:10:41) Al: worse, but it's particularly annoyed about him for ruining Twitter.
(1:10:49) Al: No, no, it's gotta be bad.

(1:11:30) Al: I will. Oh, I'm not allowed to.
(1:11:31) Codey: Not you, listeners.
(1:11:34) Codey: I mean, I guess you can.
(1:11:35) Al: Oh, thank you. I think that's everything.

(1:12:34) Codey: I mean, yeah, yeah, or BuzzBuzz.
(1:12:36) Al: No, did you not get that joke? Yeah. So it's like, instead of A-D-H-D, it's B-D-H-D.
(1:12:43) Al: So it's like the second one, or it's like, buzz buzz.
(1:12:50) Al: See, I think this is why I'm not a comedian, is because like, I have like,
(1:12:54) Al: the first initial thought about a joke, but never actually take it to the conclusion
(1:12:58) Al: where it would actually be funny, other than just like, "Hey, this thing sounds like this other thing."
