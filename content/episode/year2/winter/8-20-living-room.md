# Transcript

(0:00:31) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Al,
(0:00:36) Kev: My name is Kevin, one of us is in the US, the other is not.
(0:00:41) Al: and we're here today to talk about Cottagecore Games!
(0:00:45) Kev: Woohoo! Yes!
(0:00:49) Al: I feel like we can't start the episode without kind of referencing what has happened. We are recording on the 10th of November, five days after a certain election in America.
(0:00:59) Al: I'm going to go ahead and close the poll.
(0:01:01) Al: I don't want...
(0:01:01) Kev: I didn't get my birthday wish, rather rude of them.
(0:01:02) Al: Yeah, I learned that you have the same birthday as my younger son.
(0:01:10) Al: Isn't that weird?
(0:01:10) Kev: yeah happy birthday Craig right that's Craig yeah
(0:01:13) Al: How's it taking...
(0:01:14) Al: How's it taking...
(0:01:15) Al: Yeah, Craig.
(0:01:16) Al: How's it taking six years for us to notice this?
(0:01:17) Kev: ah I don't know man like well I mean okay I try to keep mine on the down-low because I'm torn about it cuz you know obviously it's nice for people to notice but I also feel like narcissists love you know coming out with the little air horn so I know I'm torn in minutes so I generally don't bring
(0:01:19) Al: Weird.
(0:01:38) Al: I don't think it's narcissistic to have a birthday and celebrate it.
(0:01:40) Kev: too much attention to it
(0:01:45) Kev: you're right no you're absolutely right I'm I am aware I am the issue and I mean oh boy is it so I I was actually so okay I do therapy and I do it on Tuesdays which happened to be my birthday but I was sick that day so I didn't do therapy either so you
(0:01:53) Al: This feels like something to unpack in therapy, just a thought.
(0:02:07) Al: Oh no, oh no, yeah, I was going to say this week's going to have a lot to talk about.
(0:02:10) Kev: know there'll be plenty to unpack this this there this Tuesday Oh boy.
(0:02:20) Al: So yeah, I don't want this to become a politics podcast, we're not going to spend time talking about the election and I seriously considered it, but we'll see, we'll see if you can convince me after this recording.
(0:02:26) Kev: That's what the green house is for!
(0:02:37) Al: I thought it was important to at least, you know, reference it so that it's not like - I always feel weird when there's something major that happens and we don't at least reference it because it feels like the entire podcast is just a place that doesn't exist. So I kind of - I want the podcast to be escapism, so we're not going to be like talking about it a lot, but I just wanted to mention and remind people that this is a safe place for you. We are inclusive of everyone that [chuckling]
(0:03:07) Al: - The upcoming president is not inclusive of.
(0:03:12) Al: Yeah, and if you are anti-LGBTQ
(0:03:18) Al: or if you are anti any races,
(0:03:23) Al: if you are a terrible person of that persuasion,
(0:03:28) Al: I don't care if you listen to the podcast,
(0:03:31) Al: you can go away.
(0:03:32) Al: Thank you very much.
(0:03:33) Al: Only good people here.
(0:03:37) Kev: - Okay, so I'll sign off then.
(0:03:39) Kev: Bye everyone.
(0:03:41) Al: So that's all I wanted to talk about.
(0:03:44) Al: We're now gonna go into the escapism and talk about other things, including this episode,
(0:03:50) Al: we're gonna talk about Living Room,
(0:03:53) Al: which is an augmented reality game that I have been playing.
(0:03:59) Al: And hopefully we can get a good discussion out of that
(0:04:02) Kev: All right all right.
(0:04:03) Al: because obviously no one else on the team has played it.
(0:04:08) Kev: Yeah, well, I mean, OK, I'm jumping the gun here, but like AR games, I think are great, like are they are so much more feasible, plausible than, you know, true VR and I think there's, there's a lot you can do with it, so you know I'm down for that.
(0:04:20) Al: I agree with that.
(0:04:25) Kev: I am very much a proponent of AR, like VR will maybe get there one day, but it's.
(0:04:32) Kev: It's going to be a minute still till, you know, we're really, really there. There's still a lot to figure out, but yeah, we'll get there.
(0:04:36) Al: Yeah definitely. Hopefully we'll have some good chat about that later on. I think it's our first AR game that we're going to talk about so we'll see about that. Before that obviously we have some news but first of all Kevin what have you been up to?
(0:04:58) Kev: Alright, um, so I haven't talked, it's been a minute since I've been on here, um, you know, sorry Vincent, you know this, you, you heard on Triple R, but I've been playing Bellatro.
(0:05:08) Kev: I bit the bullet, I'm in there deep. I have clear a run with every one of the base decks, I would call it, um, the, the color decks, if you will, um, there's all sorts of other decks that unlock later, and you know, there's difficulty, so there's still plenty for me to do.
(0:05:26) Kev: for me to do, but that just shows.
(0:05:28) Kev: How much time I put in and how much I enjoy it, you know.
(0:05:32) Al: I mean, to be fair, you completed a run on your first day playing, didn't you?
(0:05:38) Kev: But yeah I mean it is I I've said it before like.
(0:05:44) Kev: You know for people who don't know I tutor in math so I am so I'm an engineer so I'm something of a math guy so a name a game centered around numbers and probabilities and and of course strategy I love strategy games like Fire Emblem and such so you know all that is kind of in my wheelhouse so yeah I hit the ground running with that one.
(0:06:04) Kev: Yeah, and there's obviously a lot to unpack. There's much more so than this.
(0:06:08) Kev: There's a lot to unpack. There's much more to unpack. There's much more so than this.
(0:06:14) Kev: There's much more to unpack. There's much more so than this.
(0:06:18) Kev: Other than that, Sonic Frontiers I have been... I am approaching the end of that game.
(0:06:26) Kev: I've been going back and kind of... Not 100%ing, but at least...
(0:06:31) Kev: So, in Sonic Frontiers you have much like, you know, Breath of the Wild or other open world games.
(0:06:38) Kev: You unlock parts of the map, right? You find a quote-unquote "tower".
(0:06:42) Kev: In Sonic Frontiers it's just like a little objective. And you unlock part of the map, make it visible and see.
(0:06:48) Kev: Alright, so I'm going back and at least 100%ing the maps, right?
(0:06:52) Kev: There's a lot, so many different like challenges and stuff like that. I will not be 100%ing that game, actually.
(0:07:00) Kev: But I'm going back through that and then I'll be hitting... I'll be finishing that up soon.
(0:07:04) Kev: Um, still, I don't know, I just, I really like that game, even just-
(0:07:08) Kev: They're running around and using the different grind rails and bumpers and stuff to just fly around, it's very-
(0:07:16) Kev: Almost zen for me, I enjoy it a lot.
(0:07:18) Kev: Um, and of course, appropriately, they, uh, gosh, was it last year? I think it's been a year already.
(0:07:24) Kev: Um, they did the Sonic's birthday update, where you can just deck out the whole island in birthday celebration stuff, so of course I switched that on this week.
(0:07:33) Al: Oh yeah. Was that last, was that last
(0:07:33) Kev: Um, I think so, it's been a minute.
(0:07:39) Kev: One feature that I don't think I've talked about that, um, I think is a feature I want in every single game,
(0:07:44) Kev: Uh, it has a jukebox system, where you can go around, you can find little soundtracks, and then you can just play them whenever you want.
(0:07:54) Kev: Of course, certain things like certain battles and, uh, cutscenes or whatever will, you know, obviously won't play whatever music you want, but-
(0:08:00) Kev: I, like, if it's a game I'm gonna be spending a lot of time in, I like to have different music available, and you know,
(0:08:08) Kev: Play something that fits the mood, or just something I want at that moment.
(0:08:12) Kev: Uh, Sonic the Hedgehog, of course, has a legacy of fantastic soundtracks, so there's a lot of good stuff, but-
(0:08:18) Kev: Um, just in general, like, I wish I had, uh, that feature was available in more games, looking at you, Pokemon, especially.
(0:08:26) Kev: Um, you know, going through how many thousands of hours of Pokemon battles and having to listen to the same sound- song every time.
(0:08:34) Kev: But yeah that's that's good stuff so prop 2.
(0:08:38) Kev: And then aside from that, here's my plug for Rainbow Road Radio, the Mario podcast I do their mutual friend Alex.
(0:08:48) Kev: Next week we are doing an episode on Bowser's Inside Story, the third Mario and Luigi game, which I have been playing.
(0:08:56) Kev: And obviously you hear the full story on that episode, but boy that is a good game.
(0:09:02) Kev: Of course as people might see from my handle Koopaprez, I am a big fan of Bowser.
(0:09:08) Kev: And a game focused on him. Obviously I am biased, but I think they just did everything fantastic about Bowser.
(0:09:16) Kev: Along with a lot of the usual polishes and benefits of the Mario and Luigi game. Like, you know, funny writing in the battle system and all that.
(0:09:26) Kev: But yeah, so that's like I said, tune in next week for more thoughts on that in depth.
(0:09:34) Kev: But other than that, yeah I think that's roughly what I've been up to. What about you Alex?
(0:09:38) Al: Yeah, um, I have been also playing bilateral.
(0:09:44) Al: Not as much as you.
(0:09:46) Al: I'm done.
(0:09:47) Al: I finished it.
(0:09:48) Al: I completed a run.
(0:09:49) Al: And that's enough for me.
(0:09:50) Kev: Okay, what deck did you use herself?
(0:09:50) Al: A yellow, no, not yellow.
(0:09:55) Kev: Okay, all right, you'll
(0:09:56) Al: The one, the one that gives you money, the one not yellow, not yellow.
(0:09:59) Al: It was the one.
(0:10:00) Al: I can't remember which one it was, but it was the one that gives you money for the hands and discards you have left.
(0:10:05) Kev: Okay that's green I believe yellow give you like 10 bucks ...
(0:10:06) Al: Green, right.
(0:10:09) Kev: green gives you like more per hand and discard stuff okay ...
(0:10:09) Al: It does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It gives you, I find, I find that gives you lots of money really early on.
(0:10:12) Kev: yeah that's a good one obviously.
(0:10:18) Kev: Oh gosh it is.
(0:10:20) Kev: Alright good stuff good on you did you go past it or did you ...
(0:10:23) Kev: just like shut the app after you hit the clear screen.
(0:10:26) Al: I kept going until I died but that was like one blind later.
(0:10:30) Kev: Yeah it gets wild how much it's scale after like they are brutal.
(0:10:35) Kev: They say endless mode but no they want to end you fast.
(0:10:39) Al: yeah yeah yeah um so yeah uh i'm sure we'll talk more about that in the future but yeah I i
(0:10:48) Al: I played it and i'm done
(0:10:50) Kev: Free, free at last, free at last.
(0:10:53) Al: um i've also been continuing on snap um the new season started um I did buy the season pass again because um I feel you don't actually need a humongous amount of time into the game to get get this season pass done.
(0:11:10) Al: So I feel like it's worth it.
(0:11:10) Kev: yeah no yeah it is right it's wild to think like you know I've paid I think almost every single pass that's ten bucks a month which you know when you tally it all up is sizable for a game like one single game maybe but because it's broken up so far in only ten bucks a month like it doesn't feel bad and I get my enjoyments
(0:11:13) Al: And it's a good amount of stuff you get.
(0:11:38) Al: Well, and the advantages that you're paying as long as you're playing it, right? Like,
(0:11:42) Kev: That's true, that's very true.
(0:11:42) Al: as soon as you stop playing it, you no longer give them any money. So yeah, I'm enjoying that.
(0:11:50) Al: I'm in the 70s again, struggling in the 70s last season. I think when I talked last episode,
(0:11:52) Kev: God it it really is yeah
(0:11:56) Al: when I talked last episode, I was almost 80. I ended up finishing at 93, I think so.
(0:12:00) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:12:04) Al: I've mentioned this to you, Kevin, but I don't think I said on the podcast.
(0:12:07) Al: I finally got up to 80. It took me four and a half weeks to get to 80, and then it took me exactly 18 hours to get to 90.
(0:12:17) Kev: oh yeah that sounds correct I don't know what it is I actually have a similar um I hit a certain a similar wall when i'm in the 70s I don't know what it is it is a like I don't know if that's
(0:12:17) Al: Which is just so stupid!
(0:12:31) Kev: where the largest concentration of players are or you know ones who play regularly because it's pretty easy to get up there but it's it's just so I don't know what it is it's hard to
(0:12:45) Kev: like two steps back
(0:12:47) Kev: we're two steps forward and two steps back in the 70s, it's wild
(0:12:50) Al: Oh yeah yeah yeah constantly like I'm I've been playing you know a good half an hour to an hour every day since it's since the season started and I'm at 73 so I'm literally exactly the same place as you are when you hit 70 so so yeah I don't know hopefully I'll get there eventually but yeah it's it's really funny I part of it is my own fault right like I'm snapping when I'm not convinced I'm going to win.
(0:13:20) Al: But also, I just feel like in the 70s is when everybody has Shang-Chi,
(0:13:25) Al: which is the killer for my deck, right? Like if they have a Shang-Chi, it's killed.
(0:13:31) Al: And no, I'm running the Black Panther symbiote.
(0:13:36) Kev: right right right okay oh yeah that's that's rough well time to gosh and you you do the obviously you want to do the Arnim Zola strat so you can't run Cosmo or or armor
(0:13:40) Al: It's, yeah.
(0:13:46) Al: Yeah, no, it's what I have, what I have been doing.
(0:13:51) Al: I've not been leaning into it as much because it doesn't give you as much power,
(0:13:55) Al: but I've been doing a sentinel, sentinel symbiote and the advantage of that is they can't Shang-Chi you
(0:14:06) Al: and you get, because it gives you a 13,
(0:14:10) Al: 13 power and then you, Arnim's all of that and you get four of them, so you get two things of 26.
(0:14:17) Kev: Nimrod, you mean Nimrod, I mean he is a sentinel, but yes, nerd talk over here, yes, yes, yes, oh god, Nimrod, yeah yeah yeah, it's the one that, what is it, 2 cost 3 power, it sends 2 sentinels into the opponent's hand, or no, sends, no, add, no, yeah, it adds 1 into your hand, mastermhold, yes, yes, that's the one, yes, backwards, um, yeah
(0:14:20) Al: Nimrod, not sentinel. Why did I think sentinel? Yeah, yeah, that's probably where I got confused.
(0:14:26) Al: That's probably where I got confused. Yeah, Nimrod. Is there a card called sentinel?
(0:14:40) Al: Yeah, no, no, it sends one into your hand. Master mold sends two into the opponent's hand. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, Nimrod. Sorry. So you get 13 power, and then you quadruple that basically. So you get to two locations to get 26. It is good. It's not as foolproof. Like if you get it off, you can still lose. Whereas if you manage to get the Black Panther symbiote one, you win almost 100. Yeah, you get almost 100%.
(0:15:02) Kev: Yeah, 'cause the numbers don't get insane.
(0:15:07) Al: Like there's like maybe two, two cases.
(0:15:10) Al: But yeah, so it's it's good. But yeah, I need to lean into that more, I think, because then obviously they can't chung chi it and if they do, you just get more of it and then exactly, exactly.
(0:15:11) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's.
(0:15:24) Kev: - Yeah, it just benefits you, that's great.
(0:15:26) Al: But the the one thing they can do, which has killed me a couple of times, is cosmo it. And then it's really annoying.
(0:15:36) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yep always a threat that little Russian pupper
(0:15:38) Al: really annoying.
(0:15:40) Al: So yeah, they don't interestingly very few people running armor so that doesn't tend to be an issue but yeah.
(0:15:50) Al: So anyway yeah, still in the 70s or back to the 70s I guess and we'll see how that goes but yeah I'm still enjoying it enough to keep playing it every day but what I've added and this is weird because I normally don't add to my daily games.
(0:16:06) Al: This is not a thing that happens.
(0:16:10) Al: I've been playing pokemon TCG pocket as well and initially I was just doing the card collecting part of it right.
(0:16:19) Al: What I really like is you know going into it, opening up my packs and being done with it but for those who aren't aware they've added a bunch of events that are battle focused and I have actually been kind of enjoying them.
(0:16:34) Al: So there's the solo battle event.
(0:16:35) Al: This is what's really good so they're running three simultaneous events in the game.
(0:16:40) Al: There is a wonder pick event which is just where you're doing the wonder picks.
(0:16:45) Al: Do you know what the wonder pick feature is in pocket?
(0:16:46) Kev: No.
(0:16:48) Al: No.
(0:16:49) Al: So the idea behind this is the game shows you a number of packs that people, other people have opened.
(0:16:57) Al: Some of you which are your friends, some of which are random people in the app and it shows you the five cards and you can pay a certain currency which like the packs regenerates it's over time.
(0:17:10) Al: And you so you use that and you get you get one of the cards in the pack picked at random.
(0:17:17) Al: So it's a nice way to get extra ones and you can focus on like oh that pack has two cards that I don't have yet let me use that one and I've you know I might get one of them. It's quite nice.
(0:17:25) Al: So they've they're running a wonder pick event where they had some promo cards that showed up in extra wonder picks. So there's a chance the enemy house and you would get some that would be like one one of the cards and for
(0:17:40) Al: items that are like shop items that allow you to unlock other things. And then sometimes you'd get one that was like four chances and one Meowth. Sometimes you get four Meowths and one chance or whatever. So you're trying to get the promo cards and also get the other currency to then get other things as well, like accessories and stuff like that. So that was fun. But I mean, I got that done pretty quickly. I've got everything in that. That took a couple of days of doing very little,
(0:18:07) Kev: Okay, okay
(0:18:07) Al: but it was good fun to have an extra thing to do in the game.
(0:18:10) Al: And then they're running a solo battle event which is where there are solo battles in the game where you play against the AI against different decks and so it's by default in the game I think there's like I think it's six different decks that you can do at different levels and do different challenges against them you can just beat them and then there's like a challenge to to beat it without without the opponent getting a point stuff like that but they're running a limited time one
(0:18:40) Al: Lapras EX event and so you're it's the same sort of thing you're you're battling against it and trying to beat specific challenges and that was fun and I completed all that after maybe like three days or something that was yeah exactly really really fun and then they added a third event which is the PvP battle event and what I really like about this so in the last episode when I was talking to Johnny about this he was like I really hope they don't do a ladder and we were we were talking about how I.
(0:19:10) Al: think they're probably going to do a different kind of of battle PVP challenge thing and this I feel like is probably it.
(0:19:21) Al: Basically you get a trophy depending on how many wins you get. It's not based on a win loss ratio. There's no like climbing the ranks. It's literally just if you get 45 wins you get this trophy. Which is really nice. I think it's really fun.
(0:19:34) Kev: Okay, okay. Yeah
(0:19:37) Al: Like, 45 is obviously a lot of wins, but the...
(0:19:40) Al: like three weeks long I think uh it's the two yeah three weeks long
(0:19:42) Kev: Okay, sure and these are these are short games they're not your 20-minute standard
(0:19:47) Al: yeah
(0:19:49) Kev: PTCG. Okay. So yeah, that's that's within reason
(0:19:50) Al: yeah technically technically there is like it's each player has a timer and
(0:19:58) Al: each timer is 20 minutes so theoretically it could take 40 minutes but i've never had a battle take longer than five so um so I feel like the timer is pretty pointless
(0:20:03) Kev: Ah.
(0:20:06) Kev: Okay.
(0:20:07) Kev: Yeah.
(0:20:10) Al: I think if they're going to have the timer it needs to be a lot shorter than it is because it
(0:20:14) Al: like honestly if you were taking that long someone would have just given up by that point it would not be fun at all so yeah no that's that's been really fun as well i've been doing i've been trying to do five wins a day so that I at least keep it going but I don't feel you know completely fed up of it.
(0:20:22) Kev: Hey, and that's a strat, you know?
(0:20:24) Kev: Just... just let the timer run!
(0:20:27) Kev: Yeah
(0:20:40) Al: And it means I can still do some snap as well. So that's been really fun. I'm really liking it. I hope this sort of stuff continues having the different events and having a collection event and a solo battle event and a pvp battle event all running at the same time means that people who want to do everything have a lot they can do and those who are just focused on one thing still have an event right so just just running a battle event means that people who don't want to battle only just want to collect, we'd have nothing to do. So I think this is a really fun...
(0:21:02) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:08) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:11) Kev: Yeah, I I get yeah that seems like a good idea because obviously we have
(0:21:17) Kev: It is very
(0:21:20) Kev: Collection focused clearly, but
(0:21:23) Kev: You know the game itself is still a big factor. So yeah, that makes sense to have different
(0:21:29) Kev: Events going on for the different sides of it. That's cool
(0:21:32) Al: Yeah, it's good fun
(0:21:33) Kev: um yeah, I I
(0:21:36) Kev: still have not felt the siren call of pocket like I
(0:21:42) Kev: I've been trying to think why that is because it's not like there's anything I have against it per se. It seems fine
(0:21:49) Kev: It's probably because I like the base or you know the standard version and it's not like I mean part like the time thing I'm sure pocket that's very enjoyable But I don't know like if I want to play it
(0:22:02) Kev: the card game I'll probably just fire up live and play the actual card game like I don't know how else to describe it it's just not call it to me like and you know like you're saying right pocket well actually I mean live is the same way but I have a lot on my plate already with my dailies and whatnot I can't afford in there I don't want another one all right now
(0:22:22) Al: I think I'm not gonna I'm not gonna try and convince you to do it but what I would say is that just opening the the game for five minutes to do your cards is super easy and super satisfying especially at the beginning like you get cards really quickly to start with and that in and of itself is fun I think and yeah so
(0:22:46) Kev: Might you know, maybe I'll do it just to see what on earth it's the it feels like we'll see but
(0:22:54) Al: Yeah, well think about it when you unlock a new variant in in Marvel Snap, that's really fun
(0:23:00) Al: Just imagine doing that but it's a pack of five every day
(0:23:00) Kev: yeah yeah yeah I get that you know like yeah yeah that's that's good um we'll see they might add something later that because you have those immersive cards that is cool I do kind of want to see those you know they'll part maybe they'll lean
(0:23:04) Al: Or two packs of five every day
(0:23:25) Al: Yeah, fun times. Well, that's what we've been up to. We're going to talk about some news.
(0:23:32) Al: It's a good thing that what we've been up to is so long because there's not a lot of news. But the news that we do have is chunky. So first of all, we have Disney Dreamlight Valley have they had a new, what do they call it? Are they calling it showcase I think about upcoming stuff first of all the
(0:23:55) Al: yeah I think I think they're calling it showcase let me double check what they call it I thought it would be quick and easy to figure out what it was called yes showcase they're calling it the dreamlight valley showcase so this has two things first of all is the uh free update uh they are continuing to do these free updates uh the new one comes out on the 4th of december and that includes sally from the nightmare before christmas which was very clearly hinted that uh a while ago once we figured out.
(0:24:22) Kev: Right.
(0:24:25) Al: What we were looking at.
(0:24:28) Al: But also they have a new feature of floating islands which allows you to expand your valley.
(0:24:33) Al: It says large areas accessible through the fast travel menu once they've been unlocked with Dreamlight. So this obviously people have been asking for a way to expand the valley quite for quite a while because it gets quite quite yeah.
(0:24:45) Kev: Yeah, that seems inevitable with you know them keep adding more then Disney has a lot to add. So yeah
(0:24:52) Al: yeah.
(0:24:56) Al: >> Yeah, yeah, so they decided to go with their floating islands.
(0:25:00) Al: So you can unlock them and then fast travel to them.
(0:25:04) Al: And it seems like a fun way to be able to add more space while not just making it feel like the village is like smooshed together.
(0:25:15) Al: So these obviously will feel a little bit tacked on in so much as it's just like, here is this biome, but now in the sky as well.
(0:25:23) Al: Um, but, but I.
(0:25:25) Al: I feel like it's hard to, like, shove it into the existing map, so it feels like an acceptable kind of compromise there.
(0:25:40) Al: They also announced their new expansion pass called The Storybook Vale, so as expected this is a new purchase, the previous expansion pass is done.
(0:25:52) Al: This is a brand new expansion pass of two parts.
(0:25:56) Al: The first part comes out on the 20th of November and introduces Merida from Brave, Flynn Rider from Tangled, and Hades from Hercules, obviously.
(0:26:09) Kev: And that's a real eclectic, you know, group.
(0:26:10) Al: Yeah, so I'm just going to read some of their own wording for this description because I feel like there's a lot to not quite, not quite to note.
(0:26:28) Al: It's a bit, I'm going to read.
(0:26:32) Al: "Bewist our way to the Vale and embark on an enchanting adventure with a cast of new new characters, including the Lorekeeper, a magical boo-
(0:26:40) Al: like holding this fantastical land together. However, a happily ever after is a ways off as you discover the discordance between two iconic Disney villains, Maleficent from Disney's Sleeping Beauty and Hades from Disney's Hercules, has torn this land apart, causing a mysterious phenomenon across the Vale's three biomes, The Bind, Ever After and Mythopia. Their conflict has yielded ink seeping out of the very ground and sent the pages of the Lorekeeper near
(0:27:11) Al: as enchanted page pieces called snippets. So I think the idea is that it's a book full of stories that has burst open and you have to go find it to put it back together. And it says you'll gain the advantage of a new tool, the Royal Net, that will enable you to capture the various snippets that have escaped the Lorekeeper's pages. So presumably you're getting story as you collect the page pieces, I'm assuming.
(0:27:40) Kev: okay that um huh that this is interesting um yeah and like lore keeper is a very
(0:27:48) Kev: maybe not ominous sounding name but uh you know it's it sounds significant let's say that right um so i'm curious to see you know what they're uh how far they're gonna lean into that what what is the lore keeper gonna look like or who's it going to be I don't know um is it gonna be oh it's a book sorry oh I'm
(0:27:53) Al: Hmm.
(0:28:06) Al: Well it says it's a book. A magical book.
(0:28:10) Kev: Oh, it's just a book okay, huh?
(0:28:13) Kev: uh
(0:28:14) Al: But the pages seem to be, if you have a look on the link, the first link, the pages seem to be like origami creatures?
(0:28:23) Kev: Oh, I see all those are actually cute. I like those. Those are nice designs. Oh, that's cute
(0:28:29) Kev: Huh, okay
(0:28:30) Al: So you've got like a little green, green and yellow bird, and a little blue, well purple and purple fox, I guess?
(0:28:33) Kev: Yeah
(0:28:38) Kev: Yeah, fox dragon thing, I don't know it's a
(0:28:39) Al: Something like that?
(0:28:41) Kev: I Like looks like a dragon, you know, you don't see the mouth like then it's thick and I don't know It's looks dragon eat him. It's you know, it's the color and the it could it kind of looks
(0:28:42) Al: Dragon? What?
(0:28:53) Kev: Scales the texture of the page. That's what it is. I see it now Um
(0:28:56) Al: I see what you mean about this, yeah. And there's a little kind of purple frog with a flower growing out the top of it.
(0:29:03) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I see that. Okay. See I didn't look at these pictures at all. But yeah when you said snippets I thought it was like actually just pages. Okay, that's much more interesting. Okay, that's cute. I like that that. Um, huh.
(0:29:15) Al: so yeah I guess we'll see this that's most of the information we have they've announced that the part two of this expansion pass will come out in summer 2025 and that's the one that will introduce
(0:29:27) Al: Maleficent and they've also announced their upcoming free content roadmap in early 2025 right this is where we try and figure out what these are is that what's the what's the the one the princess and the frog oh no no no no I tell you what it is
(0:29:42) Kev: No, that's Aladdin. That's Aladdin's hat and Jasmine.
(0:29:45) Al: that's I was just about to say that's Aladdin and what's her name isn't it
(0:29:49) Al: um Jasmine yeah yeah I just I thought it looked like um the princess and the frogs Tiana is that her name I had that in my head but I didn't want to say it uh I thought that looked like her tiara but no you're right that's the wrong color of green and different shape yeah you're right it's I saw the fez I saw the fez and was like wait no that's Aladdin isn't it
(0:29:50) Kev: Tiana.
(0:30:05) Kev: no that's it says explore a new world so that that's what the yeah yeah yeah yep yep who could that be yeah
(0:30:14) Al: So Ali2025.
(0:30:15) Al: Explore a new world and revel on a magical adventure. Obviously Aladdin. Spring 2025 we've got the Cheshire Cat in his in a ghosty form. Step into a land of wonder and meet new friends along the way. Yeah that's the most obvious one right? And summer 2025. Solve an ancient mystery and discover who's waiting inside Skull Rock. And we have an orange feather and wait oh is that the shadow of
(0:30:42) Kev: Uh, let's...
(0:30:45) Al: Is that gargoyle?
(0:30:46) Kev: Oh, it looks like a winged creature of some sort.
(0:30:50) Kev: I'm very confused. Isn't Skull Rock supposed to be like, Peter Pan?
(0:30:53) Al: Yeah, but they mix these things up quite a lot.
(0:30:55) Kev: Yeah... I-I don't- I'm...
(0:30:57) Al: Like the Cheshire Cat isn't in a forest, for example, you know, like, so yeah, they like to mix these things up.
(0:31:00) Kev: Sure.
(0:31:03) Kev: Wha- I mean-
(0:31:04) Kev: Uh... huh.
(0:31:07) Kev: Oh, solvent- it's an ancient mystery!
(0:31:12) Kev: It has orange feather, I-I don't have to-
(0:31:15) Kev: Uh, I'm at a loss here, some sort of...
(0:31:17) Kev: ...winged creature? I have no idea, I'm at a lost home.
(0:31:20) Al: go have a look on the disney dreamlight valley reddit because that's where I found the sally
(0:31:24) Kev: What are- what are the conspiracy theorists saying?
(0:31:27) Kev: Heh heh!
(0:31:28) Kev: You know, I- just- just as an aside, when are they gonna bring in Cherubog?
(0:31:31) Kev: When are you gonna help Cherubog out?
(0:31:33) Kev: Heh heh heh heh!
(0:31:34) Al: You're gonna have to tell me what that is, I don't know.
(0:31:36) Kev: Oh, you don't know Cherubog?
(0:31:38) Kev: Okay, do you know Fantasia?
(0:31:39) Al: No? Uh, yes.
(0:31:41) Kev: OK, Cherubov--
(0:31:42) Kev: --is the big winged demon guy in that segment.
(0:31:46) Kev: You know, like, I think it's the final segment, yeah.
(0:31:48) Kev: He's the-- one of the spookiest guys.
(0:31:52) Kev: He's basically just like a demon guy.
(0:31:56) Al: Fair enough
(0:31:58) Al: Right. I'm just scrolling through. I'm not I can't find anything about
(0:32:03) Al: I've obviously come to the Reddit too late to see people to see the
(0:32:08) Kev: I'll be doing detective work in the background if you want.
(0:32:09) Al: The
(0:32:15) Al: Give me give me one minute before I give up. Yeah, there are too many people on this subreddit
(0:32:22) Kev: Ancient mystery.
(0:32:24) Kev: What are-- it's not going to be dinosaur.
(0:32:26) Kev: It's not going to be 20-whatever, 2,000-whatever dinosaur.
(0:32:30) Kev: It's not Aladon.
(0:32:30) Al: No, no.
(0:32:33) Al: So what I'm thinking, and I have no idea about the feather, but the shadow looks like a winged gargoyle, I think.
(0:32:40) Al: And so I wonder if it could be something to do with Quasimodo.
(0:32:44) Kev: Guessing or ah
(0:32:45) Al: But I don't know.
(0:32:46) Al: That is just a wild guess.
(0:32:47) Kev: Here's the twist it's live-action
(0:32:49) Kev: Maleficent oh
(0:32:51) Kev: You know I don't know I'm not comfortable with how well that would work out actually
(0:32:57) Kev: Yeah, because she has the wings in the movies, and I don't know if you saw the second one But she's basically becomes a Phoenix, so there's your orange bed. Oh, no. It's it's Angelina Jolie
(0:33:14) Al: yeah none of them have well actually does captain hook have a feather in his cap
(0:33:18) Kev: He does, yeah no it's a huge feather, yeah no this is like a little bird feather.
(0:33:20) Al: could it be that then no it's the wrong kind of feather it's not big enough yeah
(0:33:26) Al: I thought that before I actually have my aphantasia means I can't see in my head
(0:33:27) Kev: OH!
(0:33:28) Kev: There it is, Peter Pan has an orange feather in his hat, it's Peter, yeah he does, I just
(0:33:32) Al: oh does he
(0:33:36) Al: so he does people are probably screaming that at us uh all right cool so what's the the winged creature then.
(0:33:44) Kev: It might just be us looking at it and just multiple shadows next to each other maybe.
(0:33:44) Al: Could it be no could it could it be Tinkerbell doing a silly thing like she loved she liked to make weird shadows didn't she at one point.
(0:34:06) Kev: But it's definitely okay. So yeah, it's peter pan. I was right the first time cuz gold rock is from pipe
(0:34:12) Al: - Yeah, okay, I just like, just because that's.
(0:34:14) Al: The trauma originally doesn't mean it would be the case still, but anyway.
(0:34:19) Al: The final thing to talk about with Disney's Dreamland Valley is they've also announced new editions and early adopter bonuses.
(0:34:27) Al: Because they don't have enough versions of this game, so you still have the base, you can just buy the base game.
(0:34:37) Al: That is still a thing you can do. You can buy the enchanted edition which already I think existed and that gives you
(0:34:45) Al: both A Rift in Time, the first expansion, and the Storybook Vale, so presumably.
(0:34:51) Al: If they do other expansions, that will also give you that.
(0:34:54) Al: You can also buy individually just A Rift in Time or just the Storybook Vale.
(0:35:00) Al: Obviously you have to have the base game for them.
(0:35:03) Al: You can now also buy the Storybook Vale bundle, which is just the base game and the Storybook Vale, but not A Rift in Time.
(0:35:07) Kev: Heh!
(0:35:11) Kev: Oh my goodness!
(0:35:16) Al: Or you can buy, if you already have the base game, you can buy the Storybook Vale Magical Edition,
(0:35:23) Al: which gives you the new expansion and basically the pre-order bonuses.
(0:35:31) Al: It calls it early adopter bonuses, but it's basically a pre-order bonus, right?
(0:35:34) Al: It's like, because you got it early, I presume that will only be available for a limited period of time.
(0:35:39) Al: You get those if you also bought the Enchanted Edition, you get the early adopter bonuses.
(0:35:44) Al: They also have bonuses as well, which are an Autumn Manor house style, a dress and ensemble,
(0:35:52) Al: a baby pegasus companion and a Greek Hercules inspired house for baby pegasus, I presume that is.
(0:36:05) Al: And more moonstones.
(0:36:10) Kev: it was great until I scrolled down to this they are oh just confusing me just overwhelmingly
(0:36:18) Kev: with um it's a it's a bold strategy a masterful gambit i'll tell them that make money
(0:36:24) Al: It's wild, the number of different ways you can give them money.
(0:36:32) Kev: Heh heh heh.
(0:36:34) Al: I have to say though, the enchanted edition is looking a better and better deal as they add more stuff because that is $80 and the base game is $40 and then each expansion is $30 so if you were to buy them all individually, if you were to buy them all, yeah yeah.
(0:36:48) Kev: Geez Louise, it's...
(0:36:54) Al: If you were to buy them all individually that would be $100 so you're getting $20 off but you also get 18,000 moonstones and a bunch of pre-order stuff and presumably if they do any more expansions you'll get them as well because I don't think they're going to stop.
(0:37:12) Kev: Yeah no of course not.
(0:37:15) Kev: We don't have Pixar in here yet right no yeah we do what am I doing crazy yes we have Wally.
(0:37:18) Al: yeah yeah yeah yeah and brave because merida's merida's there now
(0:37:20) Kev: We don't have a lot of Pixar though.
(0:37:24) Kev: Oh yeah yeah I'm just thinking when do we get the radiator Springs when you get the cars universe.
(0:37:26) Al: um there's there's a bunch of stuff I think
(0:37:33) Al: let's have a look at the characters list and see who's in there
(0:37:36) Kev: You know just as an aside like every time they add.
(0:37:42) Kev: the Nightmare Before Christmas like of course they do because it's double holiday themed it's so obvious but it Nightmare Before Christmas always feels like the red-headed stepchild of Disney because you know it's it's him Burton and it's uh not a you know 2d or 3d animated or whatever I did so like they don't they don't really touch it aside from marketing or just selling things but you know I've never gotten a sequel a spin-off or whatever
(0:37:54) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah agreed
(0:38:12) Kev: I always find it fascinating how the kind of dance around
(0:38:19) Al: Yeah, yeah it's quite funny. So as you said you've got Wally and Eve, you have Remy from Ratatouille.
(0:38:29) Al: Anything else we've got? Frozen's just Disney isn't it, it's not Pixar.
(0:38:36) Kev: Yeah, it's just Disney.
(0:38:37) Al: Toy Story, Buzz and Woody are in it. They are. And Mike and Sully from Monsters Inc as well.
(0:38:40) Kev: Oh, are they in it? I couldn't remember. Oh, okay. Cool.
(0:38:43) Kev: Alright, Buzz and Woody in it. We're good, 'cause they're, you know, books.
(0:38:47) Kev: Oh, they're in it. Gosh, I have not been paying attention, clearly.
(0:38:49) Al: So it's a pretty decent number of Pixar stuff.
(0:38:50) Kev: You know...
(0:38:51) Kev: Alright, yeah, no, those are heavy hitters. Yeah, that's fine.
(0:38:56) Kev: Um...
(0:38:58) Kev: You know what? Here's the real question, right? Like, this is...
(0:39:01) Kev: This is a very, um...
(0:39:04) Kev: substantial amount of Disney.
(0:39:06) Kev: When do we get to the stinkers?
(0:39:10) Kev: When are they going to put in Home on the Range and Chicken Little and Bolt?
(0:39:18) Kev: When are we going to get those?
(0:39:20) Al: they have a lot of characters to go through before they get there
(0:39:22) Kev: I know, but I want to see them do it.
(0:39:25) Al: because like as we just as we just mentioned they've still got like a majority of the Pixar films even right [laughing]
(0:39:30) Kev: Oh, I know, but they're cowards.
(0:39:34) Kev: I wanna see them do it, I wanna see them lean
(0:39:36) Kev: into it. They won't, but...
(0:39:38) Al: I don't know, maybe sometime, but I suspect they'll just stop the game by the time they get to that point, right?
(0:39:46) Al: Alrighty, the next is Stardew Valley So, the never ending game is continuing to be never ending First of all...
(0:39:55) Kev: as announced this week by ConcernedApe.
(0:40:00) Al: Yeah well, we'll get to that, that's on my list to talk about start off with 1.6 is out on console on mobile so if you've been waiting for the
(0:40:08) Al: switch version which let's be honest if you were waiting it was probably for the switch version I guess maybe there are some people who play on mobile and are listening but I suspect most of you are waiting for the switch version it's out now go get it but they've also with that added a 1.6.9 patch which has been added to steam and was on all the console and mobile versions as well it doesn't it does have a bunch of fixes but it also has some features balance changes and
(0:40:39) Al: quality of life improvements so first of all there is a lost unique item shop so if you manage to lose one of the items that are just like a special one-off thing you can go and buy it back from the shop in the secret
(0:40:58) Al: Next we have you can finally put legendary fish in the ponds and get roe from them.
(0:41:02) Kev: Finally!
(0:41:04) Al: Finally, you're limited to one fish per pond, but there you go, if you wanted to do that.
(0:41:12) Al: A huge improvement, you can now put beds and sleep in those beds inside any constructed building that allows you to put furniture in.
(0:41:22) Kev: Alright, alright, alright
(0:41:22) Al: So, go sleep in your shed.
(0:41:26) Kev: Finally dreams now that you get in a fight with your spouse you can us
(0:41:28) Al: And the real feature though is the items dropped into water will float in the water for a short period of time so that you can pick them up.
(0:41:44) Al: The number of times I have like cut a tree down in the wrong direction and lost half the wood because it just goes into the water.
(0:41:52) Al: Whereas now it's just going to suck back up. Love it.
(0:41:54) Kev: All right, all right and dig it
(0:41:58) Al: There's a lot of other small things which I don't think we need to go into.
(0:42:04) Al: But I will link the changelog in the show notes if you want to go and have a look.
(0:42:10) Al: So, yeah, I just read one which is Clint now refills your watering can when upgrading it, which is such a weirdly tiny feature to give.
(0:42:12) Kev: Those are I like those those are all thoughtful
(0:42:24) Al: Um, but yeah, that's funny.
(0:42:26) Kev: I said thoughtful
(0:42:28) Al: Yeah, but this is the thing, it doesn't really fit with Clint, right?
(0:42:32) Al: Like, why would Clint do that?
(0:42:32) Kev: Well, oh, you know what you're right you're right
(0:42:34) Al: Don't make me like him.
(0:42:36) Kev: Okay, no, no. No, he does that but if you pursue Emily he stops doing it [Laughter]
(0:42:42) Al: And as Kevin hinted at, we got another interview from Concerned Ape and this is in Nintendo Life.
(0:42:56) Al: He says that he basically just can't stop working on it. He says "I feel like I could work on it for the rest of my life. I don't want to see it fizzle out." So confirmation, as we expected,
(0:43:07) Al: that we're probably going to get Stardew Valley updates until he dies.
(0:43:12) Kev: Okay, I'm... I don't... I have thoughts on this because, like, this really feels like, uh, how should I put this, almost concerning, um, just like, obviously, it makes a lot of sense, just from a pragmatic standpoint, right, because he's making money off of it, and he's done all the work on it, um, so, you know, I get it in that sense,
(0:43:43) Kev: but, like, clearly, I'm projecting here a little, like, how much of this is also just him, um, you know, not able to get away from it, sort of a prison of his own mind, if you will, um...
(0:43:57) Al: I do think that's a lot of it, so he says the exact wording is "I have so many ideas for Stardew, I feel like I could work on it for the rest of my life and just keep improving it, adding more stuff to it, more content, fleshing out the existing content".
(0:44:10) Al: That's the main thing I want to do is flesh out the existing content.
(0:44:13) Al: So like I don't, I wouldn't feel bad for him.
(0:44:19) Al: Like in a way I think it is kind of his brain not letting him let it go but also he will probably never make some
(0:44:24) Kev: - Right.
(0:44:24) Kev: you Bye.
(0:44:27) Al: If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to send them to me in the comments below.
(0:44:38) Kev: Sure, oh, yeah, of course not. Yeah. No, it's impossible possible.
(0:44:42) Al: And he just like I don't I think it's I totally understand when you do something that millions of people enjoy and you're a good person and you want to give people stuff right like he's not
(0:44:57) Al: he's not doing this he's not doing like obviously he's going to still continue to sell it when he makes updates but realistically he's not making the money he could be making on that but he knows that he's made enough money and therefore could continue to do this for the rest of his life and not worry about the money like that must feel really freeing in a way
(0:45:18) Kev: Sure there is a gosh I guess you're right right like I guess as long as he happy it's fine right the one that really concerns me the quote or the is how he says.
(0:45:35) Kev: He doesn't want to see it fizzle out right like cause that's that's that no longer feels like he wants to just keep keep keep it growing he's just worried.
(0:45:48) Kev: He's not worried about the impermanence or what like whatever it like he wants it to stay relevant that part feels a little concerning.
(0:45:57) Al: I mean, we're reading into this now, but I don't think he means as in I want to keep selling forever.
(0:45:57) Kev: Yeah.
(0:46:04) Al: I think it's more just like it's just something that he loves so much that he wants to keep it new and fresh all the time.
(0:46:12) Kev: I guess like I again like it's a we're reading into it this is a lot of deep psychological stuff under the surface like when I hear someone say that I think like they're just worried about.
(0:46:29) Kev: Because I think this would be fair to call it his master work right like his masterpiece you know just you know wanting to that to matter like I can see some people caring about.
(0:46:42) Kev: That yeah I don't know it's it's a lot to unpack like I guess the important thing is as long as he's genuinely happy right like if he's not doing this out of some sort of stress like.
(0:46:54) Kev: That he's it's not going to be relevant anymore that's that's the main thing but but at the very least he'll be making money out of it.
(0:47:07) Al: yeah yeah exactly um but I mean I think when he announced that 1.5 would be the last update I was like no way will this be the last update and then he announced 1.6 with the last update and I was like I don't think so uh so you know I i you know I think will we in 10 years still be getting updates maybe not are we gonna get a 1.7 I suspect we'll get a 1.7 um and remember The one the 1.6 update was meant to be a smaller
(0:47:17) Kev: Haha, yep, very true very true
(0:47:33) Kev: You know what?
(0:47:38) Al: It was not a small update.
(0:47:41) Kev: Oh gosh, you know what? There's also...
(0:47:45) Kev: Looking at it from the other side, like, I'm not saying fans are
(0:47:49) Kev: Asking for more from from Stardew or from Concerned Ape, but they're always willing to consume more, right? Like,
(0:47:58) Kev: There's something in this day and in the modern day and age about just the never-ending
(0:48:03) Kev: Quote-unquote franchise or game or whatever right like in 10 years. We're gonna have new Pokemon coming out. I promise you that [laughing]
(0:48:12) Al: However, I think there is a huge difference.
(0:48:15) Al: I suspect you'll agree with me on this.
(0:48:18) Al: I think there's a huge difference between that and this though, because the franchise of Pokemon or the franchise of Marvel, yes, there are people in there that they love what it is and they want to create more just for the sake of making more, but the franchise exists because it makes money.
(0:48:34) Al: And I still strongly don't think that he makes updates to make money.
(0:48:40) Al: makes updates because he has
(0:48:42) Al: these ideas and he can't get them out of his head and he just wants to put them in the game.
(0:48:46) Kev: Yeah, okay, you know what that's fair. Yeah, I'll agree with that. Yeah
(0:48:53) Al: and I don't think stardew could keep going could keep being the center of conversation year after year if the updates weren't good like if he released a bad update people would like sure they would keep playing the game and they'd try the new update but I don't think we would have got as much talk about 1.6 as we did this year it would not have been as big a conversation
(0:49:16) Kev: Yeah, you know what? You're right about that. I can't argue it at all.
(0:49:22) Al: All right well our last piece of news is a new game that has just come out apparently was a month ago I thought it was last week but no it's a month ago that was updated last week that's why I thought it was new but this is a game called web fishing sorry it's in all caps web fishing a multiplayer chat room focused fishing game relax and fish on the web.
(0:49:40) Kev: That's good, I like it.
(0:49:49) Kev: What that's okay, that's quite a pitch
(0:49:53) Kev: multi the multiplayer is what what throws me off here like
(0:49:57) Kev: Just hanging out and fish
(0:50:00) Al: "Web fishing is a multiplayer online casual fishing game where you relax, hang out, make friends, and catch fish."
(0:50:07) Al: "Nearly a hundred different creatures to catch."
(0:50:09) Al: "Become the ultimate fisherman. Upgrade your gear with new baits, lures."
(0:50:13) Al: So there's obviously a good amount of customization.
(0:50:15) Al: It looks very... the character models look very Animal Crossing-esque.
(0:50:20) Kev: Yup, yup. I see what you mean here.
(0:50:22) Al: For some reason there's a guitar minigame.
(0:50:25) Kev: Classic fishing.
(0:50:27) Al: This looks interesting.
(0:50:30) Al: It's pretty cheap. It's like four quid, I presume. Is it five dollars?
(0:50:34) Kev: Yeah that's what an interesting idea like who comes up with this that's what I want to think of but but they are so Animal Crossing just looking at it now like it's the shape.
(0:50:57) Kev: Oh yeah it is yeah five USD yeah you're right.
(0:50:59) Al: It's a very low poly
(0:51:02) Kev: Like think I'd say Wild World maybe on the DS level of animal crossing.
(0:51:09) Kev: That's how many polygons you can see on that head.
(0:51:10) Al: it kind of yeah it kind of reminds me of someone drawing in paint and posting on tumblr
(0:51:18) Kev: You know what? It does have a very Tumblr vibe to it, I will say that, absolutely.
(0:51:22) Al: do you not think
(0:51:29) Kev: One sec. Sorry, one sec, Al. My thing's dying, hold on.
(0:51:33) Kev: Okay, there we are. Um, okay, look, as, you know, as connoisseurs of, uh, fishing games,
(0:51:41) Kev: um, I do, like, is it just, it's probably just gonna be Animal Crossing style fishing, isn't it?
(0:51:47) Kev: it would be nice if they put...
(0:51:48) Kev: a little effort into the fishing game.
(0:51:50) Kev: Um, but uh, we'll see. For five bucks, it might be worth it, I guess?
(0:51:56) Kev: I don't know, like, um...
(0:51:58) Kev: Is this just a game that's just the fishing part of Animal Crossing?
(0:52:02) Kev: Maybe?
(0:52:04) Kev: Is that enough?
(0:52:05) Al: Bought multiplayer.
(0:52:06) Kev: Oh god, I already, there's an Among Us in the trailer, oh my goodness.
(0:52:12) Kev: Um, oh, uh...
(0:52:15) Kev: Multiplayer chatting, I don't know, okay.
(0:52:19) Kev: This really feels like somebody said, "Man, I have so much fun fishing with my friends in Animal Crossing."
(0:52:25) Kev: I'm just gonna make a whole game about that, which is okay, okay.
(0:52:28) Al: Yeah
(0:52:29) Kev: You know, Sonic Frontiers has great fi-
(0:52:32) Al: Moving on so that's all the news
(0:52:35) Al: We're gonna talk about
(0:52:37) Al: Living room, so I'll pitch this game. I'll explain to you what it is and then we can we can we can talk about it
(0:52:42) Kev: okay okay I have not seen the trailer yet I want you I purposely at this point I want you to pitch it to me before I watch the trailer tell me what is living room
(0:52:44) Al: so
(0:52:50) Al: Okay, okay. So, first of all, just to get this out of the way, it is a MetaQuest 3 exclusive.
(0:52:58) Kev: Oh, wow, okay. I didn't know that part Wow
(0:52:59) Al: So not only is it a MetaQuest exclusive, but you have to have the MetaQuest 3. And I'll explain why later on. Don't worry, there is a good reason for it.
(0:53:06) Kev: Oh, wow, okay
(0:53:12) Al: So this game is an augmented reality game. So as you've got your headset on, you are seeing your...
(0:53:20) Al: The room you are in, you're seeing the world as it is, but overlaid on that is a UI with different tools that you can use to create many islands filled with tiny animals.
(0:53:37) Al: So the idea being, I guess I'll kind of summarize how the interaction worked initially. So
(0:53:44) Al: this uses MetaQuest 3's new way of doing awareness so like...
(0:53:50) Al: From the Quest 2 you would basically just say "I'm in this space here" and it would warn you if you were going out of that space and that was basically it. Whereas the Quest 3 has a way that
(0:54:02) Al: maps the room you're in and maps the walls, the ceiling and also the furniture.
(0:54:10) Al: And then it uses this information to... The game uses like the furniture like tables and sofas.
(0:54:19) Kev: Yeah
(0:54:20) Al: And shelving and stuff like that. You turn those into little islands. So you've got like a paint.
(0:54:25) Kev: Okay, use your living room's topography, okay, I like that
(0:54:30) Al: Pretty much. So you've got like a little paint sprayer and you use that to spray on
(0:54:35) Al: the furniture and create an island. And then on that island you can buy animals and plants and populate your island. And you create, not only that, but you're creating a whole ecosystem.
(0:54:49) Al: So, you put pla-
(0:54:50) Al: You put plants down, and then you put down animals that eat those plants, and then you put down animals that eat those animals.
(0:54:57) Kev: Oh wow, wait, there's food chains here, okay!
(0:54:58) Al: So you're-
(0:55:02) Al: Oh yes, oh yes, and trust me, you have to do a lot of work in the main version of the game to make sure that your ecosystem is managed and regulated, otherwise you end up with everything being dead.
(0:55:14) Kev: Oh my goodness, this is this is sounding incredibly stressful now
(0:55:20) Al: What I will say is, it can be a little bit stressful, but it's actually not too bad.
(0:55:26) Al: So there's three modes to the game, there's the default mode where you have to kind of manage it.
(0:55:32) Al: But it's not ridiculously hard, like if you've got loads of islands going on, you're probably going to end up missing things and your animals will die.
(0:55:40) Al: But if you've only got a few islands, you just have to keep an eye on them and make sure, "Oh, I've run out of this plant."
(0:55:46) Al: with the plants do reproduce as well right so it's not like you have
(0:55:50) Al: to keep planting the plants but if you have the wrong number of animals and plants then they'll eat all so you're just like oh I'm running out of this plant let me throw a few more down and then you've created more of a balance right and then you start you put down its predator and then after a while you notice that either you're running out of the animal that the predator is eating because there's too many predators or you're noticing that the there's the predators end up dying because because there weren't enough of them to reproduce themselves.
(0:56:20) Al: So, like, you have breeding as well?
(0:56:22) Kev: my gosh, actual ecosystem management, that's wild.
(0:56:25) Al: It is, it really is, it really is and let me tell you,
(0:56:30) Al: when I say that I lost myself in this game, I am not joking, like, I...
(0:56:35) Kev: Does Cody know about this?
(0:56:38) Al: I don't know, actually, has she responded?
(0:56:41) Kev: Because this oh gosh, this sounds like right off her alley
(0:56:47) Kev: Okay, but yes you lost yourself in this I can I could see why Why?
(0:56:47) Al: I legitimately, the first time I played this, I put on the game and I was like "I'm expecting to play this for five minutes and then get back to work" and then it was like 40 minutes later before I realized what happened.
(0:57:06) Al: It's so immersive but also because it's augmented reality, I didn't feel closed off.
(0:57:15) Al: If someone had come into the room I would be
(0:57:17) Al: aware of that. So you're still connected to the world that way. You know like when I play Beat Saber it's completely closed off and I can only play it for a certain amount of time before I'm like no I need to go back to the world because I like I don't like not being aware of things.
(0:57:32) Al: Whereas here it's just you're just playing this game and you're just building out your ecosystems and you keep unlocking things. The tutorial system is fantastic in this game right. It starts out believing like, Oh, you, this is what this tool does.
(0:57:47) Al: And it, you know, you have a quest board, which by the way, it's so much fun the quest board,
(0:57:52) Al: you can move around your environment. It's just a thing that you can move around. So it's like,
(0:57:55) Kev: Yeah, oh wow you can move.
(0:57:57) Al: yeah, so like really stupid thing. I put it in front of the TV that's in this room. So it was just like the quest board is the TV in the room. It's such a silly thing. But it was like so fun to be able to do that. And the like, all of the menus are based on like physical items. And most Most of it is like book based.
(0:58:17) Al: So you've got like a book for your species, you've got a book for your decorations, you've got a book for settings and so you're like just you tap the book and the book opens and then you can like select stuff in the book.
(0:58:30) Al: It'll be interesting to see how much of this ends up in a few years feeling old and dated and how much of it continues but the idea of you know the skeuomorphism or however that word is of like this is a physical thing that I'm using to do this thing.
(0:58:47) Al: feels really natural.
(0:58:50) Kev: Yeah okay so I'm I'm looking at now I looked at the trailer now so like this it doesn't feel like it should be necessarily it wouldn't go it wouldn't feel irrelevant cuz.
(0:59:08) Kev: You have the it's how you just see your living like you are not in different space 1000% right so like.
(0:59:16) Al: Yeah. Correct.
(0:59:18) Kev: and it's very...
(0:59:20) Kev: grounded in that sense right so you know I don't think there's that much of danger of a lot of the other issues of virtual reality motion sickness so I mean maybe a little bit with how things some of the virtual elements move but um like
(0:59:33) Al: There is one one situation where motion sickness comes in which is just where because you're
(0:59:39) Al: looking at a headset that uses cameras very occasionally like I've had a couple of times over the last week where it just doesn't update quickly enough and so the camera
(0:59:50) Al: like the view stays the same when you move and that obviously that messes up your head.
(0:59:53) Kev: Ah, okay, okay.
(0:59:57) Al: So that's not great but that's that's still a pretty, that doesn't happen very often.
(1:00:02) Kev: okay okay um okay
(1:00:03) Al: But yeah that is the one situation most of the time it's pretty good and you're just seeing everything you're meant to be seeing and it's and it's and it's great.
(1:00:09) Kev: yeah okay okay um so the art style is very cute um uh the animals are very cute um
(1:00:20) Kev: and there is like how you described in looking at the trailer there's a lot to do in this game Holy moly, um, is this a full-price game?
(1:00:28) Al: yes that's a good question let me double check what this is because oh yes I should probably disclose this I got this code free as a review code and yeah I might need to add that into the description and beginning as well so yes this was a review code I got this code for free I did not agree to any particular things I didn't even agree to publish a review of it this is a this is a try and then decide.
(1:00:58) Al: If you want to review or not, but the moment I played this, I was like, I need to, um, I need to do this.
(1:01:02) Kev: yeah yeah it looks like it looks like a very robust game though all the systems like the I mean it so a lot of VR type games for lack of a better word look a little jank at times because of you know just the nature of the difficulty of developing in that this doesn't have it because again you have the actual living environment grounding
(1:01:32) Kev: it and it's a very stylized very cutesy art style so that that very much works in favor [muffled]
(1:01:40) Al: If it tried to look real, I think it would look worse. Way worse. Like the cutesy stylized aspect of it I think works really well. I double checked so this is $20 this game.
(1:01:41) Kev: Oh
(1:01:52) Kev: Okay okay oh wow this is like a well obviously there's the huge upfront cost of the.
(1:02:00) Al: Obviously. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(1:02:01) Kev: The meta but but what's your past that that seems like a fantastic price for.
(1:02:02) Al: 100%. If I didn't have this code, I would 100% be buying this game. It is so much fun.
(1:02:15) Kev: Um, this is wild. That's all I can say. It looks really well done. Um, like you...
(1:02:23) Kev: Gosh, there seems to be so much... There's breeding mechanics. You can turn them into a large life-sized ones.
(1:02:27) Al: yes there's so there's so many there are so many things so yeah you mentioned a few things that I did want to talk about so yeah you can breed so by default if they're on an island and they're healthy they're wet so like they have I think basically it's they're either well fed or they're not well fed and if they're not well fed they could die from hunger and if they're well fed then they'll survive until they do die of old age but that's the only thing.
(1:02:30) Kev: I saw a dinosaur in there. There is a lot going on.
(1:02:57) Al: And so if you have two of the same species they don't I don't think they're gendered
(1:03:03) Al: but so any of them I think can breed with any of them which is fair enough that that would just be really difficult to I think show in the UI right like so I think that's a totally fair thing to do so if you have two of the same species that are both well fed they will sometimes breed and create new ones you can specifically you can
(1:03:27) Al: create this other island that you bring two of them together to force them to breed.
(1:03:32) Al: That sounds really bad but you know what I mean they're animals.
(1:03:33) Kev: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's that's real life folks that happened
(1:03:39) Al: That is that is real life it just just the sentence "force them to breed" sounded really bad.
(1:03:47) Al: The really cool thing about the breeding is that they will have mutations and so you get like different colors of them. I think that's the only thing basically different colors I don't think the
(1:03:58) Al: change their shape but yeah you get different colors of one which is fun.
(1:04:02) Al: So and the longer you keep generations right the higher the number of generations the higher chance of getting different colors and let me tell you when I just like look over at my gorilla island I kind of I think it's I can't remember they've got different names for the biomes and I have one that has gorillas on it and I look over and I see a yellow gorilla and
(1:04:28) Al: that's really exciting like the the standard creature collecting thing right like of like a new creature that I didn't have before is really fun. The yeah so you can create you can take one of them and make it your pet and so you put it on this little machine you turn a handle and it makes it like a big version of it that walks around your room rather than being on one of the islands.
(1:04:47) Kev: Yeah, I thought you were grinding it up into candy like pogo, but no you're just turning into a big one.
(1:04:54) Al: And then this is this other the the photo
(1:04:57) Al: this is a really good example of how I think the schemorphism works really well and it was really intuitive and super fun
(1:05:04) Al: There's a camera in the game and what you do is you pick it up with your hand Just like you pick up anything else in the game You go over and you grab it you pick it up and then it shows you a little you've got a little screen and it Shows you what it's going to take a picture of and then you take a picture and it's like a Polaroid out comes a picture You shake it and then you can stick it to the wall and you've got a picture that you just stuck to the wall
(1:05:26) Kev: Oh, that's great. Oh, that's oh, that's fantastic. Oh, I love that so much. Oh
(1:05:33) Al: It's just like so funny and silly, but it makes perfect sense and it's exactly what you would expect from that, right?
(1:05:42) Al: Like nowhere in the game did it say shake the picture, right?
(1:05:46) Al: But I got it out and I was like, oh, it looks like it's starting to develop.
(1:05:50) Al: I wonder if I shake it if it will speed up and it does.
(1:05:53) Kev: Yeah, that's all that's fantastic
(1:05:56) Al: It was just and then it's just literally just go and put it and it sticks to the wall and So I have a wall of pictures of creatures that I've...
(1:06:04) Al: which is just super fun.
(1:06:05) Kev: That is great. Oh, man, that's
(1:06:08) Kev: This is so cool. What a cool. Okay, so
(1:06:12) Kev: When you log off does it just freeze time or does stuff continue?
(1:06:18) Al: So, yeah, it freezes time. It freezes time. I don't know if there's an option. I don't know if there's an option to change it or not. But I, I would know I would not turn that on. Because I it's like it's too, it's too intense. It's, it's not a game that you just let running by itself like you wouldn't want it like Animal Crossing.
(1:06:18) Kev: Outside okay, that's it. That's what I would imagine
(1:06:34) Kev: Yeah, I can imagine. I mean, ecosystem management, the second you hear that, you know you're in for a lot of work as a zoo... Let's build a zoo fan. I know how much work that is.
(1:06:38) Al: Exactly, exactly.
(1:06:49) Al: I will say it doesn't have as much stress as I get with normal management games, right?
(1:06:57) Al: It causes it of the scale, it feels much less stressful from that aspect of things, the ... Yeah, yeah, no, you're totally right.
(1:07:04) Kev: It's, it's, it's secretly progressive where it induces more stress onto the wealthy elites with the large living rooms.
(1:07:19) Al: There's a whole bunch of other things that I've not unlocked as well, right?
(1:07:23) Al: There's other types of islands you can build, there's obviously animals and stuff that I haven't done.
(1:07:30) Al: Oh, the modes.
(1:07:31) Al: I hadn't talked about the modes.
(1:07:32) Al: So there's the standard mode, which is what we described, but there's also a challenge mode which makes things harder, if you want to do that.
(1:07:42) Kev: Oh, how?
(1:07:43) Al: And then there's creative mode, which I think none of them die.
(1:07:49) Kev: I was sure, that's just...
(1:07:49) Al: In creative mode, I haven't looked into the exact details of that.
(1:07:51) Kev: Yeah...
(1:07:54) Kev: Yeah...
(1:07:54) Al: I do want to try out creative mode at some point, but yeah, that exists.
(1:07:57) Kev: Okay...
(1:07:58) Kev: That sounds... yeah, that sounds what I'd expect.
(1:08:04) Kev: Man, this is such a cool game, like, and...
(1:08:08) Kev: What a... okay, I get the name now, Living Room, right, but...
(1:08:15) Kev: They probably should have come up with a different name to advertise it a little better
(1:08:19) Kev: or something.
(1:08:20) Kev: Because it's so much like it has all the appeal of a zoo game right like.
(1:08:29) Kev: Like yeah zookeeper tycoon or or let's build the zoo and you know that's that's a big appeal for a lot of people on understandable so who doesn't like animals right like.
(1:08:41) Kev: Or or you know there are a lot of people who like taking care of animals that's why pets are popular let's say that.
(1:08:49) Kev: But it does the AR aspect of things so well like I'm just looking at it it all feels intuitive like you said it's not.
(1:09:02) Kev: Over well well okay it's a little over women there's a lot of elements on the screen but you still know you're in.
(1:09:06) Al: Yeah, I think it can be, but you build it up over time, right?
(1:09:11) Al: So you can, you can get, you know, you can keep it small if you want to.
(1:09:17) Al: If it's too much, you can go, okay, I'll tone it down and it's still fun.
(1:09:23) Kev: Okay, sure. Yeah, I can imagine. But it's stylish. It's stylistic. It's cute, right? It makes you smile.
(1:09:35) Kev: Um, and uh, just yeah, I don't know it looks real everything looks very competently made. Um, excuse me. Um, I like the the look of pretty much everything here. It's like I get it has to be
(1:09:53) Kev: on a VR headset because that's the whole appeal of turning your shelves into the little little biomes and whatnot, but it's kind of a shame that I won't be able to play it per se.
(1:10:02) Al: Absolutely. This is one of these games that is just sad that so many people aren't able to play this game because like, this is 100% you should play this game if you have the headset, but obviously you shouldn't be spending 400 quid to buy a headset just for this game.
(1:10:18) Al: Right? Like that is why you know, if you were the sort of person who was going to pay 400 quid to play this game, you probably already have the headset.
(1:10:28) Kev: Yeah yeah probably.
(1:10:31) Kev: Um yeah but um what a great game for that you know sub population that has the meta quest 3 specifically.
(1:10:41) Kev: Um... Um...
(1:10:42) Al: Yeah, I think it's because so the three has the mapping of the the furniture that two didn't have so
(1:10:49) Al: It's just it uses a feature that just doesn't exist
(1:10:53) Kev: I do hope these guys
(1:10:56) Kev: could uh could
(1:10:58) Kev: Maybe build a non VR version obviously it loses some of the appeal
(1:11:03) Kev: But you know make a virtual living
(1:11:12) Kev: just like a randomly generated room or something and work off that.
(1:11:17) Kev: Yeah I love the design so much they have such derpy eyes all the creatures.
(1:11:22) Kev: It's great I love it a lot.
(1:11:25) Kev: Yeah and you can have the big ones just walking around the floor.
(1:11:28) Kev: your little decorations.
(1:11:32) Al: They also, your pet, the large one that walks around your room, they'll spawn little dig points around the room that you can tell your pet to go and dig up and it'll give you some
(1:11:44) Kev: Yeah that's great man what a cool game.
(1:11:49) Kev: Living room like I get the cleverness behind the name but I wish it could have something a little easier to advertise or push right because.
(1:11:54) Al: It is dreadful to try and Google, so obviously I will have the link to the game and the trailer that Kevin.
(1:12:00) Kev: I can see.
(1:12:12) Kev: Yeah you got to look it up I I I Googled and I clicked on the ...
(1:12:15) Kev: wrong one first and I was very confused because it was just some guy.
(1:12:17) Al: Yeah.
(1:12:18) Al: Did you get the one on Steam?
(1:12:20) Kev: No not the one on steam though just it was just it was like a ...
(1:12:23) Kev: YouTube video cuz I don't know I just clicked and it was just ...
(1:12:27) Kev: some guy talking about turning his room because I typed in ...
(1:12:30) Kev: living room game and he is about some guy turning his ...
(1:12:33) Kev: living room into his gaming room.
(1:12:36) Al: Heh, fair enough.
(1:12:37) Kev: but but uh yeah good good stuff overall man what a what a cool
(1:12:42) Kev: game it's like garden galaxy but good [laughter]
(1:12:47) Al: Yeah, it's kind of one of those types of games. Yeah, no, you're right.
(1:12:52) Kev: When you pull back when you look at the whole living room it looks like you know it's kind of just decorating the room kind of like obviously there's still a lot of the appeal of managing the ecosystems and whatnot but it's it's just a very fun decorated room when you step back and look at everything I like that a lot.
(1:13:12) Kev: um oh man I love this a lot that's great oh I really hope they try to push it for some uh you know non-vr version of this um because
(1:13:23) Kev: I'm always down for ecosystem type
(1:13:26) Al: I'm not convinced if this was a non-AR version that it would be a great ecosystem management game.
(1:13:34) Al: I think the fun about this is the augmented reality part of it, but yeah, I don't know.
(1:13:42) Al: It's difficult to know for sure, and I'm not trying to gatekeep, it's just one of those
(1:13:44) Kev: you're right yeah you're right like yeah no I get what you're saying like I think there is a like I look at the art style and it's very cutesy I think there's a lot still going for in that sense but but you're I mean it's probably nothing crazy to write home about or anything like that so I can I can
(1:14:08) Al: Yeah, so I guess, reminder of the disclosure, the game was free, I got a code, but I 100%
(1:14:17) Al: would recommend this game.
(1:14:18) Al: If you have a meta quest three, you should be buying it the second it is so much fun.
(1:14:24) Al: And I will like, I don't always play games for long after I review them, right?
(1:14:29) Al: Because sometimes when I come to the review, I'm like, okay, good, now I can stop.
(1:14:34) Al: I'm not feeling that for this game like you know ask me in the next
(1:14:38) Al: episode but I suspect i'll still be playing it you know it's fun to to do it's you know I i keep thinking about oh let me go spend a little bit of time and you know tending to my gorillas or you know or I just unlocked puffins so i'm looking forward to to using them in something but
(1:14:51) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I totally, I totally get that.
(1:14:56) Kev: Ooh, that's nice. Um, yeah. Oh man. This, this...
(1:15:00) Al: and there's so much I still haven't unlocked i've put loads of time into this game and there's still at least I know I haven't I suspect that's a late late one
(1:15:04) Kev: Did you get dinosaurs yet?
(1:15:09) Al: but yeah no i've there's there's at least four biomes I haven't even unlocked and then there's things in the existing biomes
(1:15:16) Kev: Alright I don't want to say this game is looks great like ...
(1:15:21) Kev: is this nothing it's it's all good stuff.

(1:16:28) Kev: No, I'm throwing the line in the sand right now.
(1:16:32) Kev: It is the best Mario and Luigi game, I'm going to say it right now.
(1:16:36) Al: Well, you haven't played the new one yet.
(1:16:38) Kev: No, but there are things that have made me have pause.
(1:16:44) Kev: that I'm that just just
(1:16:47) Al: The IGN review, yes.
(1:16:47) Kev: Raising eyebrows is a hint of concern, but but we'll see
(1:16:55) Al: It will be, I don't think I've, I don't know, I think I've heard anyone who's actually played it that I know yet so it'll be interesting to see whether the IGN review is correct or
(1:17:00) Kev: We will get to it.
(1:17:06) Kev: Yeah you know we we we talked about that on the last ...
(1:17:06) Al: whether it's one of these things, who knows.
