# Transcript

(0:00:32) Al: Hello Divers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
(0:00:37) Al: Maybe I should call it the diving season again.
(0:00:39) Al: My name is Al.
(0:00:42) Spencer: And my name is Spencer.
(0:00:43) Al: And we are here today to talk about cottage core games, kind of.
(0:00:51) Al: Transcripts are available on the show notes and on the website, as always.
(0:00:55) Al: Today, I have the one and only Spencer on to talk about the Dave the Diver Godzilla
(0:01:02) Spencer: Thank you for having me.
(0:01:02) Al: from Spencer.
(0:01:04) Al: How are you doing today?
(0:01:04) Spencer: Good.
(0:01:05) Spencer: How are you?
(0:01:08) Al: I am a little bit tired.
(0:01:10) Al: We have that fun thing where Spencer and I are so far apart in time and both have
(0:01:14) Al: kids that the only time we can record is 6 a.m. my time.
(0:01:19) Al: And was it 10 p.m. your time?
(0:01:21) Spencer: yeah it's approaching 10 right now and like you mentioned kids and not wanting to go to sleep
(0:01:28) Spencer: and it's it's been rough
(0:01:30) Al: Yeah, yeah, well them not wanting to-
(0:01:32) Al: good to sleep. You wanting to go to sleep. So yeah, we're both tired, but for different
(0:01:38) Al: reasons. Well, one of the same reasons, which is kids, and the other a different reason,
(0:01:43) Al: which is because we've got different ends of the day. Aren't time zones fun?
(0:01:50) Al: Cool. So as this is Dave the Diver month, we will obviously have no news. So listeners,
(0:01:57) Al: you can tell me after you've listened to all these, if this was too many episodes about one game,
(0:02:02) Al: we'll see, but it will be too late. So yeah, so no news. But before we talk about the Dave
(0:02:05) Spencer: Just gotta suck it up.
(0:02:11) Al: the Diver Godzilla DLC, Spencer, what have you been up to?
(0:02:16) Spencer: Uh, not much. I mean, at the time of this recording, we're currently potty training our child, so I'm sure you have older children than we do, so I'm sure you know all about the fun that comes with that.
(0:02:22) Al: Oh, perfect. Yep. The end point of that is fantastic. The fact that you can just say
(0:02:33) Al: to your kid, "Yeah, we'll go to the toilet," and then they go and do it, and then they're
(0:02:36) Al: done, and they come back, and you're like, "Fantastic. I don't need to be involved in
(0:02:40) Al: that process anymore. I love it."
(0:02:42) Spencer: Yeah, but see the tough thing is, and this is part of what we're dealing with right now,
(0:02:46) Spencer: is now they learn in the middle of the night when all the lights are off.
(0:02:50) Spencer: If they yell, "I gotta go potty," then that's in a yep, so.
(0:02:52) Al: Yeah, well you get to a point where they finally learn that they can do everything themselves
(0:03:00) Al: and they don't even need you. So that's what we've got with our youngest finally, where
(0:03:06) Al: he just goes to the toilet in the middle of the night and we don't have to care about
(0:03:08) Spencer: Ah. The dream.
(0:03:10) Al: it. It's fantastic. If we're still awake, he will talk to us. And I'm like, "Craig,
(0:03:14) Al: you don't need to talk to us. Just go to the toilet and go back to bed." For a long time,
(0:03:19) Al: He used it as an excuse to be out of his room and talking to us.
(0:03:22) Al: Because he loves people, he loves talking, but I think we've finally got there where
(0:03:29) Al: he will now come out of his room, go to the toilet and go back to his room without talking
(0:03:35) Spencer: Yeah, so yeah, pretty much that and then just playing a few games
(0:03:40) Spencer: Metroid Prime remaster, I know there's the news about Metroid Prime 4 kind of got like sucked into it a little bit
(0:03:47) Spencer: I've already played Prime back on GameCube. So this kind of just revisiting for me
(0:03:52) Spencer: Super Monkey Ball been playing. This has actually been a lot of games
(0:03:55) Spencer: I've been playing like in the two years that we've had our daughter now
(0:04:00) Spencer: Probably the most I've been playing games in my free time
(0:04:05) Spencer: I've been playing Dave the Diver and stuff. So, Stellar Blade I put way too much time into Stellar Blade lately
(0:04:10) Spencer: so that game has been really fun stuff and
(0:04:14) Spencer: Even a mobile game that I've been playing has a Dave the Diver collaboration going on right now at the time of this recording
(0:04:20) Spencer: which is
(0:04:20) Al: Yeah, so were you playing this game before the collab was announced?
(0:04:24) Spencer: Yes, I was and the game will remain unnamed for different reasons
(0:04:31) Spencer: but
(0:04:32) Spencer: It does have a day the diver collab going on
(0:04:35) Spencer: and it was very interesting bouncing back and forth between the actual game and the collab
(0:04:41) Spencer: because they did a pretty good job, in my opinion, of translating it to mobile game.
(0:04:50) Al: Yeah, it's interesting because Kelly shared this news with me, because we were talking about the
(0:04:56) Al: Dave the Diver stuff. They've played Dave the Diver quite a bit, and they were like, "Oh,
(0:05:00) Al: there's a new DLC," and I'm like, "Oh, interesting." And I was like, "No, this isn't a DLC. This is
(0:05:07) Al: inside the Nikkei game." And watching the trailer, it does seem to just be the game
(0:05:14) Al: inside Nikkei, like it's just Dave the Diver inside Nikkei.
(0:05:18) Spencer: Yeah, it is very much just day of the day.
(0:05:19) Spencer: Well, it's just the fishing part,
(0:05:22) Spencer: which I know I'm sure we'll get into when we talk more
(0:05:24) Spencer: about the game itself.
(0:05:25) Spencer: But it's just the fishing part, just the serving sushi part.
(0:05:32) Al: Aha
(0:05:33) Spencer: I think they reduce the map size quite a bit.
(0:05:37) Spencer: But it works fairly well, actually, especially
(0:05:39) Spencer: because it's like smartphone touch controls.
(0:05:42) Spencer: So you kind of just drag your aimer, so to speak.
(0:05:48) Spencer: When you're shooting and stuff.
(0:05:51) Spencer: So yeah, it's actually a pretty good translation of the game,
(0:05:54) Spencer: to be honest, or at least for a mobile device.
(0:05:56) Al: I am not going to talk about what I've been playing because, as listeners know, this is
(0:06:01) Al: like a month. It's about a month. This is coming out after we record it. So I'm going
(0:06:08) Al: to talk about a TV show that I have almost finished that, as of recording, only came
(0:06:12) Al: out less than a week ago, and that is the Exploding Kittens Netflix show. Have you seen
(0:06:18) Al: any of this, Spencer?
(0:06:20) Spencer: I have not.
(0:06:21) Al: Have you played Exploding Kittens, the game?
(0:06:23) Spencer: I've seen it, but I've not played it myself.
(0:06:28) Al: So, I mean, this is all just hooks on hooks of things, right?
(0:06:33) Al: So Exploring Kittens is a card game
(0:06:35) Al: that is based on a tiny little cartoon
(0:06:39) Al: that the Oatmeal guy did once.
(0:06:43) Al: And he made a card game based on this, which is,
(0:06:46) Al: I mean, it's a fair, I enjoy the card game.
(0:06:48) Al: It's very fun, but it's only very tangentially related
(0:06:53) Al: to anything to do with the Oatmeal.
(0:06:55) Al: And it's more just like, you know, the Oatmeal's humor,
(0:06:58) Al: a card game.
(0:07:00) Al: And then, tangentially related to that,
(0:07:03) Al: he also now has made a show on Netflix,
(0:07:07) Al: which of course only Netflix would make
(0:07:09) Al: on Exploring Kittens show, right?
(0:07:11) Al: And I personally think it's very much the Oatmeal's humor
(0:07:14) Al: just in a TV show.
(0:07:17) Al: I mean, it's very stupid, right?
(0:07:19) Al: It's not highbrow humor, it is very, very stupid,
(0:07:22) Al: but I personally am enjoying it.
(0:07:24) Al: The premise is that God is turned into a cat.
(0:07:28) Al: He turned down to Earth and turned into a cat
(0:07:30) Al: to learn to be better.
(0:07:35) Al: And also the devil is sent up to Earth to be a cat as well,
(0:07:39) Al: to learn to be more evil.
(0:07:41) Al: And that is kind of the whole premise around it.
(0:07:46) Al: And I won't go into the details of it, obviously,
(0:07:48) Al: 'cause it's spoilers, but personally,
(0:07:50) Al: I've been enjoying it.
(0:07:51) Al: It's very stupid humor.
(0:07:52) Al: So if you don't like, I'm not stupid,
(0:07:55) Al: that's not the right word,
(0:07:56) Al: 'cause there's lots of different types of,
(0:07:59) Al: style and silly.
(0:08:01) Al: So if you don't like that sort of humor,
(0:08:02) Al: you definitely won't get it, won't enjoy it.
(0:08:05) Al: And that's fine,
(0:08:06) Al: but I have personally been enjoying it a lot.
(0:08:10) Spencer: off to look into it. Yeah, we haven't been watching too much stuff on TV or Netflix or anything. I'm
(0:08:15) Spencer: trying to think of the last thing we watched, but yeah, I can't think of anything that comes off
(0:08:20) Spencer: to the top of my head, so.
(0:08:22) Al: I can't stop watching stuff. I also watched, I talked in the last episode I was on as listeners
(0:08:31) Al: are listening about the Gotham Knights, which was that one off season CW show about Batman
(0:08:44) Al: being murdered and it's not good, right? I'm not going to say it's good, but it is interesting.
(0:08:52) Al: I think it was worth watching, but I think it's ties to DC make it worse than if it didn't do
(0:09:00) Al: that because it feels the need to hook into things that it definitely didn't need to do.
(0:09:08) Spencer: Interesting. I mean, not good, but entertaining is kind of like my genre of TV and movies, so...
(0:09:16) Al: It's very much a DC CW show. So if you've watched any of them, it's very much in the same.
(0:09:22) Al: So it's less funny, right? Like Flash and Supergirl. And I mean, I guess not Arrow. Arrow
(0:09:29) Al: wasn't ever really funny, but certainly those ones have been tried to at least be some level
(0:09:33) Al: of funny. This is probably, I guess more like Arrow in terms of its seriousness. But I always
(0:09:42) Al: liked in the crossovers between those shows, this juxtaposition between the seriousness of Arrow
(0:09:48) Al: and the humour of the other characters. This obviously doesn't...
(0:09:52) Al: have any crossover between them, and I have no idea if it's meant to be on the same Earth as
(0:09:56) Al: any of them. They got a bit confused at the end as to how many different Earths they actually had,
(0:09:58) Spencer: OK, so they don't establish this as part of the, what did they call it, the arrow verse?
(0:10:04) Al: but... No, they don't. Technically, there were actually multiple universes within the Arrowverse
(0:10:12) Al: because Supergirl was on a separate one until Crisis on Infinite Earths, and then it was on
(0:10:20) Al: on the same one.
(0:10:22) Al: But they also still had multiple others because like there was Stargirl,
(0:10:27) Al: which was never technically in the Arrowverse, but was tangentially related.
(0:10:32) Al: And After Crisis was shown to be on a different Earth still.
(0:10:36) Al: And there was also the Superman and Lois
(0:10:39) Al: show, which was shown to be on the same Earth as the rest of the Arrowverse was
(0:10:47) Al: crisis, but then they decided that the new what the series
(0:10:53) Al: different. And therefore there were a few things like Lex Luthor was just a
(0:10:57) Al: different person. And so it was obviously on a different Earth, but they never
(0:11:00) Al: actually explicitly said that. And they had explicitly said it was on the same
(0:11:03) Al: one. So you're like, "Oh, so is this now a different Superman and Lois we're
(0:11:07) Al: following on a different Earth that just happened to look the same?" It was all
(0:11:11) Al: very weird and confusing because they also, they went from, I mean, I do love
(0:11:17) Al: the silliness of these things, right? So after crisis, they went from having
(0:11:22) Al: one kid to having twins. And you're just like, "Okay, fine. Sure. I'll let that
(0:11:29) Al: happen. It's crisis. Weird things happen in crisis." But then there were like this
(0:11:33) Al: exact version of this family also happens to be in another universe as
(0:11:38) Al: well, which is almost identical, but not quite very weird. Yeah, exactly. And I
(0:11:42) Spencer: Just like one little little difference to make the plot devices work now
(0:11:47) Al: don't even I guess maybe it was just that because oh who was who was the what's the
(0:11:52) Al: guy that played Lex Luthor in the in their verse can you remember did you ever watch
(0:11:56) Al: any of them yeah I don't think yeah he was yeah Lex was only in Supergirl I think John
(0:11:57) Spencer: I did not I did watch arrow through quite a few and then yeah and then I was
(0:12:08) Al: Cryer that's his name you know who I mean he's a two and a half men guy what else is
(0:12:12) Spencer: Oh, okay, well, I don't think I ever watched Two and a Half Men, so...
(0:12:18) Al: the end. You probably recognize him.
(0:12:22) Al: He's pretty famous, but yeah. Apparently he was in Superman 4 as well. I missed that.
(0:12:31) Al: Who was he in Superman 4?
(0:12:32) Al: Lenny Luther. Who's Lenny Luther? Is that Lex's son? Oh my word. Oh my. That is so dated.
(0:12:43) Al: That's amazing. His hair is fantastic in that. He's the nephew of Lex Luther. Oh, I do remember
(0:12:50) Al: that scene actually, that's hilarious.
(0:12:52) Al: Anyway, yeah, so I'm presuming that John Cryer just didn't want to be Lex Luthor anymore,
(0:12:58) Al: which is fair enough, right? Like when you're going from, you know, a medium-sized show that
(0:13:07) Al: is Supergirl to a smaller show that is Superman and Lois, I see why you wouldn't want to continue
(0:13:15) Al: that rule. It's not exactly a huge
(0:13:18) Spencer: Yeah, not really a jump in pay, so to speak.
(0:13:23) Al: Exactly. And you can't even just go, "Oh well, after Crisis they had a different Lex" because
(0:13:28) Al: they showed in the show that after Crisis they had the same Lex Luthor, because that was a huge
(0:13:34) Al: part of the plot point with him anyway. Not important. Yeah, and I'm just about to start
(0:13:42) Al: watching the second series of Star Trek Prodigy. Have you seen?
(0:13:46) Spencer: I have not. I have very... I say this. I have very little background knowledge of Star Trek except for I did watch a couple seasons of the original at one point.
(0:13:57) Al: All right, fair enough, fair enough. Prodigy is, I think, best for two people. One is, obviously,
(0:14:05) Al: kids is very good for them, but I think it's also very good for, you know, Star Trek nerds who
(0:14:11) Al: particularly like, what's her name? Oh, my word, why am I so bad with names? Janeway, Captain Janeway
(0:14:20) Al: from Voyager, because there's tie-ins to Voyager and it's...
(0:14:27) Al: It's good fun. It definitely is a kids show, and I wouldn't say it's as good at being
(0:14:33) Al: a kids and an adult show as, say, Pixar films, but I think it does a good job of being interesting
(0:14:41) Al: for adults as well. It's not... It's like, have you ever seen the new Spidey and His Amazing Friend
(0:14:48) Al: show? Like, that is a kids show, and it's like, you're not really going to be interested in it,
(0:14:48) Spencer: Oh, that's constantly playing in our house.
(0:14:57) Al: other than just to say that you've watched it, right? Like, it doesn't really do anything
(0:15:02) Al: for adults. Same with the... Because you watched the Young Jedi Adventures as well, didn't you?
(0:15:03) Spencer: Yeah, we have, and yeah, again, that one's very like, you know, teaching kids lessons
(0:15:14) Al: yet. They're cute and they're fun, but they don't give anything to adults. And that's fine,
(0:15:14) Spencer: of, you know.
(0:15:20) Al: I don't think everything should have to be good for adults as well. And I have watched through
(0:15:24) Al: both of them because I want to have watched them. Not because I'm particularly enjoying them,
(0:15:30) Al: I want to have watched them and to have said that I have watched them. Whereas Star Trek Prodigy,
(0:15:35) Al: I'm actively enjoying, the story is interesting, and there's a few references to other Star Trek
(0:15:41) Al: stuff that isn't too heavy-handed.
(0:15:44) Al: But it still feels fun.
(0:15:46) Al: And so I think that if you don't have kids and you're not like,
(0:15:49) Al: "I need to watch everything," it's definitely worth a watch.
(0:15:52) Al: Whereas, you know, the two that we've mentioned, if you're not
(0:15:55) Al: obsessive about watching everything, don't bother.
(0:15:58) Spencer: Yeah, I mean that definitely it yeah, if you don't have kids, please don't watch the start Star Wars the Jedi my goodness
(0:16:05) Al: unless you are obsessive over it. I think there's one or two vaguely interesting things.
(0:16:09) Spencer: Yeah
(0:16:15) Al: I find there was an episode where they find their kyber crystals, which was vaguely interesting,
(0:16:26) Al: but there's maybe one other episode that you would... Other than that, it's the exact same
(0:16:30) Al: episode just with different things. It's like they don't listen to one of the teachers.
(0:16:35) Al: Exactly what the teacher told them not to do or don't do what they told them to do.
(0:16:39) Al: Something goes wrong. They have to solve it. And then they say sorry, but they've learned
(0:16:43) Al: to lesson. That's it. That's every episode in that scene series.
(0:16:46) Spencer: Yeah, it follows a pretty similar format for each.
(0:16:50) Spencer: It's definitely not meant for adults.
(0:16:53) Al: All right, cool. Well, that's what we've been up to. Definitely didn't drag that out because
(0:17:01) Al: we have no news. We're now going to talk about the Dave the Diver Godzilla DLC. Before we
(0:17:09) Al: get into the specifics of the DLC, I wanted to, I meant to share the episode with you
(0:17:13) Al: so you could hear what me and Kevin talked about, but I'm just wondering what your thoughts
(0:17:16) Al: about the game in general are before we talk about it.
(0:17:19) Spencer: Oh no, that's fine. Yeah, so...
(0:17:21) Spencer: I don't know...
(0:17:23) Spencer: Hmm...
(0:17:24) Spencer: Feel bad coming on your podcast and then saying this.
(0:17:27) Spencer: I don't know if I'd qualify this as a farming game.
(0:17:31) Spencer: It has farming. Let's be very clear.
(0:17:31) Al: Oh, it's not. It's not. It's absolutely not. I accept that. Yeah.
(0:17:34) Spencer: This has farming.
(0:17:36) Spencer: I don't even know if I'd qualify this as a fishing game, though, to be honest.
(0:17:39) Spencer: And hear me out.
(0:17:40) Al: No, no, I agree.
(0:17:41) Spencer: This game, in my opinion, is a parody
(0:17:45) Spencer: of every possible game they could shove into
(0:17:49) Spencer: out of whatever you want to call it.
(0:17:51) Spencer: Like, if you can think of a style of game,
(0:17:54) Spencer: this game probably has some kind of small section
(0:17:57) Spencer: in it that parodies that, right?
(0:18:00) Spencer: You start out fishing.
(0:18:00) Al: Interesting I hadn't I hadn't thought of it as parodying them but that does make
(0:18:02) Spencer: And there's the fishing thing.
(0:18:07) Al: things a bit that does make things a little bit more sense.
(0:18:10) Spencer: right you have your fishing you have your your little serving minigame ask game you even you
(0:18:18) Spencer: even have a stealth metal gear solid part right there's a part where i'm like wait why am I like
(0:18:24) Spencer: running around this little secret base and having to hide behind boxes and stuff you have
(0:18:30) Al: That secret base was so stupid, like the rolling, you walk up to boxes then you roll over the
(0:18:32) Spencer: I was
(0:18:37) Al: boxes.
(0:18:38) Spencer: you hide in the fridge
(0:18:39) Al: Yeah, OK.
(0:18:41) Spencer: And then there was a rhythm part, like that part came up, and I was like,
(0:18:45) Spencer: why is there a rhythm game in the middle of this game?
(0:18:49) Al: Yeah, that's a really interesting... I don't know why I didn't put this together, but that
(0:18:54) Al: explains why there are an infinite number of minigames in this game. Because they're
(0:19:00) Al: trying to parody everything. That makes so much sense. I had not thought about that.
(0:19:05) Spencer: So yeah, that's kind of that's kind of my thoughts on it. I enjoyed playing the core game very much some of the some of the different
(0:19:13) Spencer: mini games
(0:19:14) Spencer: Were so so but you really only played them maybe like once or twice and then you kind of like move on
(0:19:20) Spencer: So it's not that big of an issue in my opinion
(0:19:22) Spencer: Um, I really enjoyed the fishing the fishing parts fun. The sushi part gets a little hectic at times
(0:19:30) Al: the good thing about this issue part is that it doesn't take very long.
(0:19:32) Spencer: That's true and in all fairness to
(0:19:35) Spencer: you I was like refusing to hire staff for a long time and then once I hired
(0:19:38) Al: Oh really? Oh no, as soon as I had money, enough money to hire staff, I was hiring staff.
(0:19:39) Spencer: yeah like I finally hired someone
(0:19:45) Al: I'm like, "I don't want to be doing all this work."
(0:19:48) Spencer: Well, I hired one person to serve with me, and I think that might be someone that you
(0:19:52) Spencer: just have to hire through tutorials.
(0:19:55) Spencer: Yeah, and then finally, I hired another person to work in the back kitchen.
(0:20:01) Spencer: And then that greatly, I was like, "Oh, okay, wow, this actually helps a ton.
(0:20:06) Spencer: I should have done this a long time ago."
(0:20:08) Al: Yeah, no wonder you didn't have any money. I was like, I have almost all the upgrades
(0:20:11) Spencer: Yeah, Alan and I were talking about that, and I'm like, "Why am I always not have any
(0:20:14) Spencer: money to buy anything.
(0:20:18) Al: and I'm not finished the story yet. And you're like, I don't understand how you have money.
(0:20:22) Al: I didn't realise you hadn't hired staff. I hired every staff member as soon as I could.
(0:20:26) Al: So I think you end up with two, is it two of each? Or can you have three? I think you
(0:20:30) Spencer: I think you can have...
(0:20:31) Al: can end up having three waiters and two extra chefs. So you end up with basically three
(0:20:38) Al: each, and plus yourself serving as well. And you can train them up more as well to
(0:20:44) Al: make them more efficient. And eventually the servers will learn to do drinks as well, which
(0:20:53) Al: is the most annoying thing.
(0:20:54) Spencer: Yeah, that's kind of so I had like at the time the recording I have two servers and I have a
(0:21:03) Spencer: Like help in the the kitchen part like a chef I guess
(0:21:08) Spencer: And I've trained up at least one server to be able to do drinks
(0:21:12) Spencer: Which is helpful because like once you have at least two servers
(0:21:16) Spencer: Then you yourself are kind of like delegated to just doing drinks if they are
(0:21:21) Spencer: needed while the other two run around doing orders.
(0:21:25) Al: And also you need to do the Wasabi, um, yeah, no, that's interesting.
(0:21:32) Al: Uh, was there anything you, was there anything in particular you didn't like?
(0:21:33) Spencer: but yeah, that's it.
(0:21:37) Al: Other than maybe some of the many.
(0:21:39) Spencer: I don't know if I'd necessarily say it was like as
(0:21:43) Spencer: like an actual gameplay aspect of the game as much as like a lot of the mechanics they kind of just like
(0:21:49) Spencer: either throw at you really quickly and expect you to pick up
(0:21:53) Spencer: or
(0:21:54) Spencer: you're like
(0:21:56) Spencer: like we were talking
(0:21:57) Spencer: online about this like I'm already you know you got to get to chapter five to get to the Godzilla DLC.
(0:22:03) Spencer: But like in chapter five I'm still like getting game mechanics that are like pertinent to the game not just like random minigames.
(0:22:09) Spencer: It's like okay now you get like this and that and it's like whoa hold on like
(0:22:14) Spencer: This is way late in the game. Why am I still getting new game mechanics? So I that that part kind of threw me off.
(0:22:18) Al: Yeah I can see why you would think it was not a good thing I think it's both a good and a bad
(0:22:25) Al: thing I think the good thing about it is you're not I quite often feel overwhelmed by games when
(0:22:30) Al: they tell you everything really early on and yes it's a little bit weird getting game mechanics so
(0:22:36) Al: late on but it also means that you don't have you don't end up with that overwhelmed feeling at the
(0:22:42) Al: beginning and the tutorial can be really simple but yeah have you
(0:22:48) Al: unlocked the chickens yet okay that's the that is the final main farming thing there are other
(0:22:49) Spencer: I have unlocked the chickens.
(0:22:55) Al: a few small things but they're all just to make it more efficient that it's the last actual thing
(0:23:00) Spencer: Okay.
(0:23:02) Al: you get in the farming um but yeah yeah it was so ridiculous it's like I don't know if we would
(0:23:08) Al: have done this had I realized how late on you needed to get to get to the DLC um because the
(0:23:15) Al: drage DLC you need to have for now you
(0:23:18) Al: need to have unlocked the farm and then yeah the Godzilla one you need to be in chapter
(0:23:19) Spencer: Mm-hmm
(0:23:24) Al: five which is it is because by the time we got to I was like oh well I may as well finish
(0:23:25) Spencer: Which is basically almost the end of the game
(0:23:30) Al: the game now so I have finished I finished the main story I haven't like done a hundred
(0:23:31) Spencer: Yeah
(0:23:35) Al: percent of everything but I finished the main story now because you're just like well I
(0:23:40) Al: may as well now which I guess is a good thing but yeah I'm glad I gave us as much time as
(0:23:46) Al: we did because we've had like a month.
(0:23:48) Al: That's not my fault. That's not my fault. I gave you enough time to play the game.
(0:23:48) Spencer: Yeah, something like that. Though, to be honest, I got a little sidetracked with some other games that I was playing, and then I was like, "Oh, it'll be okay."
(0:23:56) Spencer: "It'll be okay."
(0:23:58) Spencer: I thought it would be okay, and then when we were like, "Oh, chapter five, whoa, hold on."
(0:23:59) Al: That's the important thing. I think I took about three weeks to get it finished. So it's
(0:24:09) Al: not a ridiculously long game. Yeah.
(0:24:10) Spencer: No, yeah, once I sat down and really put some time into it, it was pretty easy to get to
(0:24:18) Al: I'm at a total of about 40 hours. So I wasn't even playing that super hard over three weeks.
(0:24:23) Al: To give you a comparison, when Tears of the Kingdom came out, I spent three weeks playing
(0:24:27) Al: that and I put 150 hours into it. So it's a little bit different in terms of time there.
(0:24:31) Spencer: No, I mean, yeah, no, I mean, like I said, I think that this game is, you know, poking
(0:24:34) Al: All right, cool. Any other last thoughts on Dave the Diver before the DLC? Because obviously
(0:24:41) Al: I just spent a whole episode talking about it.
(0:24:48) Spencer: fun at a lot of games, to be honest, like, with all the different minigames, it has kind
(0:24:53) Spencer: of just parodying stuff.
(0:24:56) Spencer: But it's all in good fun, so.
(0:24:58) Al: Yeah, I think it's poking fun of them, but in a way that you definitely know it's like
(0:25:03) Al: a love letter to them. It's like the way you mock your loved ones, right? It's not the way you mock
(0:25:10) Al: someone you don't like. OK, cool. Well, so we're going to talk about the Godzilla DLC. Just to
(0:25:17) Al: warn, there is so little in this DLC that we will be talking about absolutely everything.
(0:25:22) Al: The story is not big and complicated, but we will be talking about the entire story of this thing.
(0:25:27) Al: So if you don't want to
(0:25:28) Al: hear that now is when you stop. There won't be anything else after this. We're just going
(0:25:34) Al: to talk about the DLC and basically just the story and the one mechanic that it adds.
(0:25:43) Al: Well, that's not true. I guess two. One mini game that it adds and one collectibles that it adds,
(0:25:50) Al: but we'll get to that when we get to it. So, yes. I guess to give a quick...
(0:25:58) Al: Funny. So you start off and it's like a stormy night. And then I can't remember who's the...
(0:26:07) Al: This person isn't in Godzilla lore, are you?
(0:26:11) Spencer: as far as I remember I don't think so there's plenty of human characters that
(0:26:15) Spencer: I just don't remember the G for their part of yeah I believe her name is like
(0:26:17) Al: Yeah. Well, that's fair. I think yeah, meet Miki. Yeah.
(0:26:21) Spencer: Miku or Miki yeah and she says she's part of the G force which is like a
(0:26:29) Spencer: thing in some movies just like a squad of like you know military people that
(0:26:34) Al: Oh, she is. She does exist in other Godzilla stuff, so I just had a quick Google. She's
(0:26:34) Spencer: are tasked with like tracking and fighting Godzilla so
(0:26:45) Al: from the Hacey Godzilla series. I don't know if that's something. I don't know what that
(0:26:49) Spencer: Okay
(0:26:52) Al: is.
(0:26:52) Al: Eh...
(0:26:53) Spencer: So yeah, so Godzilla is separated into different
(0:26:57) Spencer: Yes, would you call eras so to speak so the first era?
(0:27:00) Al: So this one started with The Return of Godzilla in 1984.
(0:27:03) Spencer: Yeah, so that's that's gonna be like the second era so to speak
(0:27:07) Spencer: Kind of from yeah that the 80s through the 90s and then it's so it's divided up with Showa
(0:27:07) Al: Okay.
(0:27:13) Spencer: Which is the original Godzilla up to that one and then he's he say I see
(0:27:19) Spencer: If you speak Japanese, please correct us
(0:27:23) Al: We're sorry in advance.
(0:27:24) Spencer: Yeah
(0:27:26) Spencer: That's separated
(0:27:27) Spencer: like you said the the return of Godzilla in the 80s up through the 90s and then the 90s is
(0:27:33) Spencer: the end of the 90s to
(0:27:36) Spencer: Somewhere in the 2000s is the millennium series and then more recently we finally have
(0:27:43) Spencer: after the millennium like I think it's designated as the shin series because it starts off with
(0:27:49) Spencer: Shin Godzilla, but I could be wrong either way
(0:27:52) Al: So, the Godzilla Wiki is saying "Riwa" series, but anyway, doesn't particularly matter the
(0:27:53) Spencer: Bye.
(0:27:54) Spencer: Mm-hmm.
(0:28:00) Al: names of them. So, yeah, she is, according to the Wiki, she is employed by the Japanese
(0:28:05) Al: government and then later G-Force. She uses her powers to communicate with, and in some
(0:28:10) Al: instances attempt to control Godzilla. She is the most frequently recurring human character
(0:28:15) Al: in the Godzilla series, having appeared in six consecutive films. So, there you go. She
(0:28:22) Al: has six different films. Isn't that interesting? But, I mean, none of that matters to this
(0:28:29) Al: DLC, right? I think she does say like she consents Godzilla, so that kind of ties in,
(0:28:35) Al: I guess, to her psychic abilities in the films, which is wild, but whatever. It's a series
(0:28:38) Spencer: Which to the uninitiated may seem weird, but there are quite a few things of like psychic abilities and stuff in Godzilla, so
(0:28:49) Al: never ends. It never stops.
(0:28:52) Al: So yeah, she appears and she's like, "Oh, I think Godzilla's here."
(0:28:57) Al: There was another, because one of the things in Dave is there's like earthquakes, and that's like, you have to figure out why there's earthquakes.
(0:29:03) Al: But this ties into Godzilla, and like, there's another earthquake, but this is a different earthquake. You're like, "Oh, this is different."
(0:29:09) Al: And then Miki comes along and tells you about Godzilla. So you need to go find Godzilla.
(0:29:16) Al: You dive down, you find a cave, you like, blow up the entrance to the cave.
(0:29:22) Al: And then you're like, "Oh, look, Godzilla's just there."
(0:29:24) Al: And I don't know about you, that was a pretty terrifying moment in a terrifying game full of horrors.
(0:29:30) Al: You just go into a cave and you just find Godzilla.
(0:29:33) Spencer: Yeah, I mean given the previous parts of this game, I was pretty expecting Godzilla to just like,
(0:29:39) Spencer: wake up and be like, "Okay, like a chase scene, like quick swim away."
(0:29:40) Al: Or time to fight! I hope you got a good gun!
(0:29:45) Spencer: Yeah.
(0:29:47) Spencer: So, oh, did you, now just as a side, did you try shooting Godzilla by chance?
(0:29:53) Al: I did not. I was not going to start that fight before it needed to start, if it was going
(0:29:54) Spencer: Oh.
(0:29:57) Al: to start.
(0:29:58) Spencer: Oh, I definitely may have fired off my harpoon once or twice.
(0:30:03) Spencer: And Miki interjects and asks if you were firing the harpoon and warns you against it.
(0:30:10) Al: I kind of want to see if you actually can initiate a fight or if Nikki will just interrupt
(0:30:10) Spencer: And once I got that warning, I was like, "Maybe I don't continue down this path."
(0:30:25) Al: each time. That would be funny if you'd like Otto died if it just like ate you. So yeah
(0:30:34) Al: miki says can you set up a camera I want to keep an eye on him and then you swim away and then
(0:30:40) Al: I think it's like the next day or something. I can't remember exactly how it happens but
(0:30:47) Al: is it Ibira? Is that how? Right so basically a massive lobster kaiju is coming and this is
(0:30:49) Spencer: Uh, Ibra, I believe it is.
(0:31:01) Al: a problem obviously. This is not ideal. So you then get into this another new game mechanic
(0:31:10) Al: which is piloting a submarine through obstacles and kind of like the chase scene that you were
(0:31:17) Al: talking about that you thought you were going to get with Godzilla but not with Godzilla with
(0:31:22) Al: Ibira and then you have do you I can't remember you have a little attack scene yourself with
(0:31:31) Al: Ebirah? Is that how it works before the main thing?
(0:31:32) Spencer: Yeah, so you get chased by any number of spaceship or submarine-style games where you're just
(0:31:43) Spencer: dodging things.
(0:31:44) Spencer: I believe it's an auto-scroll to a certain extent.
(0:31:46) Al: Yes, yes it is.
(0:31:47) Spencer: You need to at least keep a certain pace.
(0:31:50) Spencer: If you fall too far behind, then think you get killed?
(0:31:53) Al: Yeah, you do. I died a couple times in that scene.
(0:31:54) Spencer: Yeah.
(0:31:57) Spencer: And then once you reach the cave... you start off...
(0:32:03) Spencer: And once you reach the cave where Godzilla is resting, it turns into a boss battle.
(0:32:09) Al: I'm looking at the screenshots I'm remembering now. So yeah, you've got a machine gun and
(0:32:10) Spencer: Uh, where you're, yeah.
(0:32:15) Al: torpedoes that you use to attack Ebra. The interesting thing is it also has like, instead
(0:32:22) Al: of having, so you have the same kind of oxygen mechanic as you do, but it's like basically
(0:32:29) Al: for the submarine health instead of your health, right? And you can repair or you can get Miki
(0:32:36) Spencer: Oh my goodness, I was yeah so it felt like there was a little bit of like I don't know
(0:32:37) Al: to repair the sub, but I don't know about you.
(0:32:39) Al: It was very slow. It was basically pointless.
(0:32:49) Spencer: if I'd say delay or like moving also felt very funky in this part like you weren't moving
(0:32:56) Spencer: as fast as you wanted to and when you did move you kind of just slid a little bit like
(0:33:01) Spencer: you sometimes you go a little too far but then as soon as you start repairing you move
(0:33:07) Spencer: like just you might as well just not move if you're repairing
(0:33:10) Al: which would be fine if the repairing actually did anything, but it felt like it was 1% every
(0:33:14) Spencer: but that it yeah it was
(0:33:17) Al: like 10 seconds or something like that. It was so slow.
(0:33:17) Spencer: couple seconds yeah so when I when I was playing this part I basically resorted to like I would
(0:33:25) Spencer: stay perfectly still and just constantly hold down the repair button and then if I saw an attack
(0:33:30) Al: Interesting. Okay.
(0:33:33) Spencer: coming then I'd let go of the repair and
(0:33:36) Spencer: quickly try to dodge it and then just continue to repair.
(0:33:40) Al: That's interesting. So what I ended up doing was dying. And then I just got better at dodging,
(0:33:48) Spencer: Yeah.
(0:33:49) Al: so I was constantly moving all the time and aiming for the eyes, because the eyes were
(0:33:54) Al: the thing that you got the most damage on. But yeah, I didn't even... After the first
(0:34:00) Al: time and I pressed it and it didn't really work very well, and then I was like, "Well,
(0:34:04) Al: this is pointless." I was like, "Well, I'm just not gonna let it hit me then." And I
(0:34:11) Al: think I died a second time, but then the third time I basically didn't get hit that time.
(0:34:15) Al: So I found that much easier than trying to do the healing. It was basically pointless.
(0:34:20) Spencer: Yeah, the healing I mean, yeah, it was it saved me a couple times
(0:34:24) Spencer: But like I said, like I really had to focus on like not moving half the time and then like quickly moving when there is
(0:34:31) Spencer: an attack and then just not
(0:34:32) Al: So then you defeat Ebera, well defeat basically Ebera is like oh no I need to
(0:34:40) Al: get away and runs away and then you go back to the surface and this is when
(0:34:46) Al: Godzilla is like supercharged which I feel like is a pretty standard Godzilla
(0:34:51) Al: thing right like being powered up by something in this case it's been powered
(0:34:56) Al: up by resting in the the big blue hole and I like I really like the look of
(0:35:03) Al: this scene where he like glows red I mean obviously he's quite often gluing
(0:35:07) Al: different colors but from what I've from what I've seen he's typically glown blue
(0:35:13) Al: rather than red
(0:35:14) Spencer: Yeah, so so this particular version is referencing
(0:35:19) Spencer: Godzilla versus destroyer, which is one of the last movies in actually when we're looking at Mickey
(0:35:26) Al: I think it's the last one that she was in, yeah.
(0:35:28) Spencer: When that she's in yeah, and basically in this movie the plot revolves around Godzilla is
(0:35:36) Spencer: Is like overheating like?
(0:35:38) Al: Oh, interesting.
(0:35:39) Spencer: too much energy
(0:35:41) Spencer: And Godzilla kind of takes on this forum.
(0:35:44) Spencer: And actually Godzilla also has a like offspring in this movie.
(0:35:48) Spencer: And spoilers for anyone that wants us to watch this movie.
(0:35:52) Spencer: Godzilla does eventually melt down and overheat.
(0:35:54) Spencer: But Godzilla's offspring kind of absorbs that energy and becomes the new Godzilla.
(0:36:00) Al: Interesting. Does it explain in the film why Godzilla is overheating? Or is that just like
(0:36:06) Spencer: I I forget off the top of my head. I feel like it probably does explain. It's been so long since I've watched
(0:36:06) Al: a mystery? Because it would be very funny if it didn't explain it at all, and then this
(0:36:17) Al: is the explanation. This is like the canon explanation as to why that ends up happening.
(0:36:24) Al: Because it feels like this if they don't explain why, and it's just like one day Godzilla turns
(0:36:30) Al: overheating, right? That this is like then fits in perfectly just before the beginning
(0:36:38) Al: of that film. And that would be very funny to me.
(0:36:43) Spencer: Yeah, so I'm looking this up just because I want to double check.
(0:36:48) Spencer: It's saying that Godzilla's heart is basically melting down.
(0:36:52) Spencer: So I believe it's coming to the end of its life, essentially.
(0:36:52) Al: but why. But it doesn't explain how that happened, like what I'm reading in this plot,
(0:37:03) Al: this could absolutely fit in technically.
(0:37:06) Spencer: Oh yeah definitely could like as like some weird like oh it went off to the
(0:37:11) Spencer: island to the to the hole I guess in this game to like help recover for a
(0:37:15) Spencer: little bit
(0:37:16) Al: But then it kills it that makes this so much sadder, right
(0:37:20) Spencer: yeah well you know I mean Godzilla's not fully gone right little Godzilla takes
(0:37:26) Al: Sure, but like because the whole point of this this bit in the game you feel by the end of it is oh
(0:37:31) Al: I helped Godzilla recover, but actually if this is how this works actually you helped Godzilla kill itself
(0:37:40) Spencer: - True. - True, yeah.
(0:37:41) Al: Which just completely changes the feeling of the DLC
(0:37:44) Al: See ya.
(0:37:46) Spencer: But I do find it interesting that they chose--
(0:37:51) Spencer: this is actually quite an iconical look for Godzilla,
(0:37:54) Spencer: to be honest.
(0:37:55) Spencer: This is very much referenced all the time,
(0:37:57) Spencer: or very lots of figures come out with this look.
(0:38:03) Spencer: I mean, in the American Destroy All Monsters,
(0:38:07) Spencer: the one with Ghidorah and Rodan and Boston and everything,
(0:38:12) Spencer: they're kind of referencing this look with his meltdown.
(0:38:17) Spencer: So I can kind of see why they chose it.
(0:38:19) Spencer: This is a little funny that they chose this and Ivaro,
(0:38:22) Spencer: who hasn't made an appearance since, like, the '60s.
(0:38:25) Spencer: Well, meh.
(0:38:26) Al: and I'm like, "Are they doing the same thing that the Apple TV Plus series did where they're
(0:38:27) Spencer: I mean, one appearance in--
(0:38:37) Al: just inventing new kaiju or is this a..." and then I googled and I'm like, "Oh no, OK.
(0:38:43) Al: This is actually a classic kaiju."
(0:38:43) Spencer: Oh no, no, no, Ibra is a great character. Yeah, classic, like, you know, classic scene Godzilla playing volleyball with a giant rock against Ibra.
(0:38:50) Al: I mean, it's the perfect one to use for Dave the Diver, right? Like, it makes sense why
(0:38:56) Spencer: It definitely is. I think the only other one that probably would make sense in this scenario
(0:38:56) Al: they would choose a giant sea creature.
(0:39:04) Spencer: would be this one called "Manda" I believe is what how you pronounce it but it's like pretty
(0:39:10) Al: - Yep.
(0:39:11) Spencer: much just a dragon that lives underwater but it looks like a very like typical you know like
(0:39:13) Al: - Okay.
(0:39:17) Spencer: like Japanese or like, you know, dragon, long serpent.
(0:39:20) Al: Yeah, that would definitely work as well, but I think there's something very satisfying
(0:39:24) Al: about it being a giant lobster, you know? Like that I think is very enjoyable, because
(0:39:30) Al: then, once you've defeated - we'll get into the final gameplay for defeating it in a minute
(0:39:36) Al: - but once you've defeated him, you can then use his meat for cooking, you know, which
(0:39:42) Al: would be a little bit weirder if it was a dragon rather than a lobster, you know.
(0:39:46) Al: Okay, let's talk about this final battle, then.
(0:39:49) Al: - Okay.
(0:39:50) Al: Something which I definitely did not expect,
(0:39:53) Al: you are now controlling Godzilla
(0:39:57) Al: in your final battle against Ebirah,
(0:40:00) Al: which I guess makes sense.
(0:40:02) Al: You're not going to be able to fully defeat the kaiju.
(0:40:04) Al: You're just a person in the submarine,
(0:40:06) Al: but Godzilla definitely can.
(0:40:09) Al: And it's kind of, I referenced this as like a
(0:40:12) Al: rock, paper, scissors type game.
(0:40:14) Spencer: Yeah, so like when I was playing this I definitely didn't catch on to that at first.
(0:40:21) Spencer: So it was a mad dash at the end when it was like half half health left, haven't really
(0:40:26) Spencer: done much damage and they're like, okay, this is like, I have to methodically think about
(0:40:30) Spencer: each button I press each time.
(0:40:32) Al: Yeah. So Ebera will show a little animation when it's about to use a specific attack and then you
(0:40:38) Al: need to defend at that point. And then you have like three different attacks you can use, a really
(0:40:43) Al: fast one, a kind of medium one, and then a really slow one. The big disadvantage of using the really
(0:40:49) Al: slow one is that you can be interrupted by Ebera attacking you and get damaged without having
(0:40:55) Al: damaged Ebera. That's kind of like the big thing, but it gives a lot of damage, but...
(0:41:02) Al: I don't know. It's fun. I guess it's yet another gameplay element that we're talking about that
(0:41:10) Al: maybe this would be less weird if we'd finished the game and we were coming back to the game to
(0:41:15) Al: play this DLC. Maybe it makes it more interesting because it's different. I don't know.
(0:41:20) Spencer: yeah it actually played out very similar to
(0:41:23) Spencer: I don't know if you've ever talked about ultra kaiju monster rancher
(0:41:27) Al: I think only in passing, like just as someone mentioned it, it was something they were interested
(0:41:33) Al: in sort of thing.
(0:41:34) Al: I don't think we've ever talked about it in detail.
(0:41:36) Spencer: in that game I mean it kind of plays like
(0:41:39) Spencer: I guess that was actually my first monster rancher game but
(0:41:42) Spencer: you raise you know kaiju from
(0:41:44) Spencer: the ultra man series
(0:41:45) Spencer: and then you have them fight each other and they have a very similar combat
(0:41:49) Spencer: system where it's kind of more of a raw
(0:41:50) Spencer: paper scissors like okay you have like
(0:41:52) Spencer: your heavy attack or your medium attack
(0:41:54) Spencer: your light attack and that's going to go
(0:41:56) Spencer: against whatever the other characters
(0:41:58) Spencer: heavy medium or light that they choose
(0:42:00) Spencer: and like in a you know kind of a
(0:42:02) Spencer: triangle this beats that but that beats
(0:42:04) Spencer: this and so forth but yeah the I mean
(0:42:09) Spencer: it was definitely interesting it was
(0:42:11) Spencer: fun to take control of Godzilla for a
(0:42:12) Spencer: little bit even if it was for just like
(0:42:14) Spencer: a smidgen of time
(0:42:16) Al: Yeah, yeah. And then once you defeat Ebirah, that's pretty much it. You gather up Ebirah's
(0:42:26) Al: meat, Godzilla goes away, and it all seems like a happy end to the story, even if we
(0:42:32) Al: forget about the fact that Godzilla's about to go die. And then there's really only one
(0:42:41) Al: other part of the DLC, and that's there's collectibles. Did you end up... So when I
(0:42:46) Al: told you yesterday, or today for you, you didn't know about these collectibles. Did you
(0:42:49) Al: just like finish the DLC and then put the game down straight away? Because I'm pretty
(0:42:54) Spencer: A little bit, maybe.
(0:42:57) Al: sure it's like, maybe Miki calls you the next day? I can't remember. But basically Miki's
(0:43:04) Al: like, "Oh, there's these little figurines. Can you find them for me?" I think. And...
(0:43:09) Spencer: Mm-hmm
(0:43:11) Spencer: I think where I ended was right after Bancho like comes up with the yeah
(0:43:16) Al: Yes, you go to the sushi restaurant, you talk to Bancho, you check everything's okay
(0:43:25) Al: because you're like, we just had a massive kaiju fight. Is everything okay? Which is a
(0:43:28) Al: fair enough thing to question. And then Bancho was like, yeah, it's all fine. Here's some
(0:43:33) Al: new dishes for this kaiju meat you got.
(0:43:38) Spencer: So, yeah, after he comes up with those recipes, I believe that's when I put it down.
(0:43:43) Spencer: So then you messaged me, and I'm looking at these figures, and my goodness, I should have...
(0:43:46) Al: They're very cool. They're very cool. So you've got, you've got like right at the start, like
(0:43:47) Spencer: They got some good ones going here.
(0:43:54) Al: you've got ones from like in the sixties. Um, you've got some from the seventies, from
(0:43:59) Al: the eighties, the nineties. Um, I don't think there are any, there are none like really
(0:44:04) Al: new ones are there.
(0:44:06) Spencer: The newest one I'm seeing is Anguirus who's the 2000. Oh, no, wait. No, I take that back. There's
(0:44:12) Al: Oh, this 2016 Godzilla.
(0:44:13) Spencer: Shin Godzilla
(0:44:14) Spencer: Yeah, 2016 Shin Godzilla is there
(0:44:17) Al: Yeah, okay, cool.
(0:44:18) Spencer: And then Anguirus would probably be the next one from 2004 which would be the Final Wars Godzilla version
(0:44:24) Al: right yeah so it's quite I mean it's a really small extra piece and it's just another collectible
(0:44:31) Al: if you like collecting things which personally I do so I will probably go and finish collecting
(0:44:35) Al: these I haven't put any effort into them I've just picked them up as I found them because
(0:44:40) Al: like there were a few that were in like the the last areas like the glacial cave and stuff
(0:44:45) Al: like that but yeah it's a fun little thing and it's it shows that they actually kind
(0:44:53) Al: It's not... (sighs)
(0:44:54) Al: Like many things could just be like, "Oh, we have a tie-in. We don't really care. It's just a tie-in. Like, here's a little thing."
(0:45:03) Al: But like, not only did it have a whole new story and a new gameplay element, and you get to control Godzilla, but they've also then got 20 collectibles of different Godzillas and other kaiju from throughout decades.
(0:45:18) Spencer: Yeah, that's fun that they added that in there.
(0:45:21) Spencer: You know, Godzilla has been collaborating with a lot of stuff this year, to be honest.
(0:45:25) Spencer: Like it is its 70th anniversary this year, so yeah.
(0:45:29) Al: Oh, wow.
(0:45:32) Spencer: So a lot of interesting collaborations, including this one.
(0:45:37) Spencer: But you know, it's fun to see things that are more than just Godzilla thrown in, right?
(0:45:42) Spencer: Like it's fun to see the collectibles and see the different references to the different
(0:45:45) Spencer: movies and stuff.
(0:45:46) Spencer: A lot of 90s references, which may...
(0:45:48) Spencer: Makes sense now that Miki comes from all of those different 80s/90s movies.
(0:45:56) Al: Yeah, yeah, fun. I enjoyed that. It's not like, I'm glad this is a free DLC. I don't feel like
(0:46:04) Al: this would be really worth an extra payment on top, right? It's pretty small in what it is.
(0:46:10) Spencer: Yeah, I mean the reality is I probably would have paid like five ten dollars for this would I
(0:46:15) Al: Oh, don't get me wrong, I would have done it for the podcast, right? Don't get me wrong,
(0:46:18) Al: but I would have been like, "Was this really worth an extra payment sort of thing?"
(0:46:22) Spencer: Oh, I would have done it for myself but I would have not recommended anyone else do
(0:46:26) Spencer: it for themselves.
(0:46:27) Spencer: I'm like, "It's not worth five, ten dollars, it's absolutely worth being free."
(0:46:33) Al: Yeah.
(0:46:33) Spencer: But I do believe you probably, if you haven't downloaded it already, I think you probably
(0:46:37) Spencer: missed your opportunity to download it, correct?
(0:46:40) Al: I was already gone. I know that was a limited amount of time, but I wasn't sure when it was.
(0:46:45) Spencer: have to double check but yeah it is a limited time release so
(0:46:50) Al: Oh, no, you can get it through to November.
(0:46:52) Spencer: it's never okay yeah so if you haven't downloaded yet go ahead get it free you know
(0:46:57) Al: You have to own the game to download it.
(0:46:59) Al: Sadly, I thought you could add it to your library, but no, if you click it,
(0:47:02) Al: if you go to add it to your library, you don't own the game.
(0:47:06) Al: It says that you need to own the game.
(0:47:08) Al: So you need to have bought the game before
(0:47:10) Al: November the 23rd and then clicked on add to library on the Godzilla DLC.
(0:47:15) Al: But, yeah, I mean, the game in and of itself is fun.
(0:47:19) Al: I, I, like, probably.
(0:47:20) Al: One of the best games I've played in a couple of years, it's really good fun.
(0:47:24) Al: Um, but I mean, well, it was the reason that it was, you know, in a lot of people's game of the year.
(0:47:26) Spencer: Yeah. Yeah, it was definitely, you know, like I was mentioning earlier, it was fun, like
(0:47:37) Spencer: lots of interesting mini games and interesting, you know, takes on different little genres
(0:47:42) Spencer: really quickly, little jabs here and there, but overall, you know, fun game, fun DLC added
(0:47:48) Al: Yeah. Awesome. Well, thank you, Spencer, for joining me to talk about another kaiju related thing.
(0:47:55) Spencer: Thank you for having me
(0:47:56) Al: Where can people find you on the internet?
(0:47:58) Spencer: So they can follow me on
(0:48:01) Spencer: Instagram on my cooking Instagram, which
(0:48:04) Spencer: Hasn't been post. I haven't been posting much lately
(0:48:07) Al: is that the last two years by any chance okay fair enough
(0:48:08) Spencer: try
(0:48:10) Spencer: Recently health wise I've been trying to I
(0:48:13) Spencer: Did post one a few months ago. So in all fairness, there's a post in the last like month or two
(0:48:19) Spencer: Trying to cut out a lot of salt a lot of sodium out of my own personal diet for health reasons
(0:48:24) Spencer: And so, kind of.
(0:48:25) Spencer: Throws a wrench into like what I've been cooking lately, but working through that.
(0:48:30) Spencer: But anyways, that's Spencer cooks on Instagram or if you want to follow me on Twitter, my personal Twitter, which I don't ever post much on or Twitter X, whatever they're calling it now, I don't know.
(0:48:44) Spencer: Godzilla underscore 2000 still surprised I haven't gotten kicked off of that handle yet, but.
(0:48:50) Al: Twitter, even at the best of times, was not great at respecting trademarks on usernames,
(0:48:57) Al: so you're not the only person who's been on this podcast that has something else because
(0:49:02) Al: obviously Kevin has Koopa in his username.
(0:49:06) Spencer: Yeah, that's true

(0:49:37) Al: If Spencer still has time now,
(0:49:39) Al: we are hopefully about to record an episode on the Godzilla MonsterVerse
(0:49:47) Al: and maybe minus one depends how much time
(0:49:50) Al: we have, and whether we want to keep talking or not.
(0:49:53) Al: And if we don't end up doing that in two minutes, I'll just cut this out the podcast.
(0:49:58) Al: And we just released one where me and Kevin were talking about Spider-Man, the animated series,
(0:50:06) Al: as well. So come listen to that. I think that's everything. Thank you, Spencer, again, for joining
