# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
(0:00:35) Al: My name is Al.
(0:00:36) Aislinn: my name is Aislinn.
(0:00:38) Al: And we are here today to talk about frog games.
(0:00:40) Aislinn: Woooo!
(0:00:45) Al: Transcripts are available on the show notes and on the website, as always.
(0:00:49) Al: Welcome, Aislinn.
(0:00:50) Al: Welcome back, I should say.
(0:00:52) Al: Your second time on the pod.
(0:00:52) Aislinn: Yeah, thanks for having me back.
(0:00:56) Al: Good to have you.
(0:00:58) Al: I've brought Eslan on the pod to...
(0:01:01) Al: ...talk about Kamayru, is that how you say it?
(0:01:04) Aislinn: Yeah, Kameiru! Gosh, I, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna withhold. I'm gonna withhold. I have many opinions about this game.
(0:01:12) Al: Yeah, we'll get to that. We'll get to that. It's important. We need to get through the
(0:01:13) Aislinn: Yes, we know!
(0:01:15) Aislinn: I know, I know, I know!
(0:01:16) Al: process. So that's what we're going to talk about. I personally haven't played Camaro,
(0:01:18) Aislinn: Okay.
(0:01:22) Al: but Aislinn has. So we're going to talk about that later on. Before that, we obviously have
(0:01:32) Al: some news. Oh, I should note, this is the last episode that has news for the next three
(0:01:39) Al: episodes because this is the last one.
(0:01:42) Al: And before I go away for a wee while.
(0:01:45) Al: So the next three episodes won't have news.
(0:01:48) Al: They will be our special.
(0:01:49) Al: Do I announce? Yeah, let's announce it now.
(0:01:51) Al: The next week we will be starting off Dave the Diver month.
(0:01:56) Al: So that is a full month focusing on Dave the Diver.
(0:02:00) Al: So I'm very excited for people to hear what we've got cooked up.
(0:02:05) Al: I hope I'm not overdoing it and we're not completely.
(0:02:09) Al: over focusing on a game.
(0:02:12) Al: When I had this idea, I thought it was fantastic, so stay tuned for four episodes of Dave the
(0:02:17) Al: Diver starting next week.
(0:02:18) Aislinn: Honestly, that sounds wonderful.
(0:02:21) Aislinn: It sounds perfect.
(0:02:22) Al: Have you played that game?
(0:02:22) Aislinn: It sounds...
(0:02:23) Aislinn: I have not, but also it just sounds wonderful to have something like that just for holiday
(0:02:27) Aislinn: in general and just have something focused on one game.
(0:02:31) Aislinn: It sounds nice.
(0:02:32) Aislinn: It sounds like a nice change of pace.
(0:02:32) Al: Yeah, last year we did Fishing Month, so we had four episodes on fishing and various different
(0:02:34) Aislinn: Oooooooh!
(0:02:40) Al: things. There was a debate on the best fishing minigame, though I think we covered Dredge,
(0:02:46) Al: which is not our usual kind of game, and stuff like that. And yeah, this year is Dave the
(0:02:52) Al: Diver Month, so coming soon. But that's not what we're talking about just now. Before
(0:02:55) Aislinn: Soon.
(0:03:01) Al: we get into the news and
(0:03:02) Al: the news.
(0:03:04) Aislinn: um melting because it's just really it's genuinely I feel like it's been an endless just heat wave
(0:03:13) Aislinn: here in new york um it's just so hot all the time my cat is melting i'm melting everything
(0:03:21) Aislinn: is melting it's just hot 90 degrees what is that in celsius I don't know it's 90 degrees fahrenheit
(0:03:28) Aislinn: and it's humid and it's just hot that's yeah it's hot
(0:03:30) Al: That is 32.
(0:03:34) Al: Yeah, yeah.
(0:03:35) Aislinn: Sun blazing just melting but otherwise
(0:03:39) Aislinn: To talk about gaming wise what I've been up to not as much as I would like to
(0:03:45) Aislinn: Be up to with gaming just because life has been busy as well in general between work and just other
(0:03:52) Aislinn: Obligations in life in general, but when I am playing a game I have been now currently cycling through
(0:04:00) Aislinn: Magical delicacy, which just which just came out recently
(0:04:04) Aislinn: is a
(0:04:06) Aislinn: platformer game with witches and cooking and
(0:04:10) Aislinn: Actually, it might be a nice game to talk about on this podcast as well at some point
(0:04:15) Aislinn: Because it's also an accessibility game. So it's like kind of it's not necessary
(0:04:19) Aislinn: I don't know if I would consider it a cottagecore game, but there is cooking there is decorating
(0:04:23) Aislinn: they
(0:04:24) Al: Look, we sure are in all kinds of games.
(0:04:29) Aislinn: But it like just came out and I play like a couple hours of it so far and it's really cute
(0:04:35) Aislinn: But I've been playing a little bit of that I've been playing spider-man 2 which is a completely different game for magical delicacy
(0:04:41) Aislinn: I've been playing oh so good so far so good so far. I've also been playing
(0:04:42) Al: a good game though. Good game. I love how they did because like, did you play the other
(0:04:49) Aislinn: I did I did I'm so I'm playing the entire series all the way through back to back to back
(0:04:49) Al: two Spider-Man games? Nice. That's a lot to go through without a break. I played them
(0:04:56) Aislinn: It is but I'm having such a good time
(0:04:59) Aislinn: You
(0:05:00) Al: when they came out. So I played the Marvel Spider-Man and I really enjoyed it. It was
(0:05:05) Al: so much fun. And then when Miles Morales came out, I was like, this is so great.
(0:05:12) Al: It's better because you have the extra powers. And personally, I thought it was like a more
(0:05:17) Al: compact game. People were like, "Oh, it's too short." And I'm like, "No, it's not
(0:05:18) Aislinn: Yeah
(0:05:20) Al: too short. It's perfect. Perfect length." I mean, buy these things and sell them second
(0:05:21) Aislinn: Yeah, no, it was perfect it was honestly perfect
(0:05:23) Aislinn: Maybe it's a little bit short for its price
(0:05:26) Aislinn: But like as someone that didn't pay for it and had no frame of concept of what it costs. I had a great time
(0:05:32) Aislinn: time.
(0:05:33) Al: hand, right? That's what I do. I did that for all three Spider-Man games. I've bought
(0:05:38) Al: them and then sold them like three weeks later when I finished.
(0:05:42) Al: But what I found really interesting was I was wondering how they were going to make
(0:05:46) Aislinn: Yeah, that's true. That's very true.
(0:05:51) Al: Spider-Man 2 not just make you want to be Miles all the time, because Miles was, before
(0:05:56) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:05:58) Al: Spider-Man 2 objectively, the better Spider-Man to play as, because he has all of the powers
(0:06:01) Aislinn: Oh my god, yes.
(0:06:03) Al: and more.
(0:06:04) Al: And so I was like, "How are they going to make you want to be Peter Parker?"
(0:06:08) Al: And they figured it out with the Venom stuff.
(0:06:10) Aislinn: Woo, yeah, it's so cool. It's so cool.
(0:06:10) Al: And it was fantastic.
(0:06:12) Al: So good.
(0:06:14) Al: And also adding in the other, the gliding, and you can also surf on the water a little
(0:06:20) Aislinn: Yeah!
(0:06:25) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:06:25) Al: bit as well, stuff like that just made it so much more fun.
(0:06:28) Aislinn: Yeah, definitely. The only complaint I have about that game so far is, like, on the map itself,
(0:06:33) Aislinn: I wish, like, things were marked down. Like, all of the side quests and everything. I wish you
(0:06:37) Aislinn: didn't have-- I know they want you to explore everything, but I'm like, "Can you just mark it
(0:06:40) Aislinn: down anyway so I have things to go towards?" Because that's the thing that kind of gets me
(0:06:42) Al: Oh do you mean like how they build it up slowly because it's like it starts off with like oh
(0:06:44) Aislinn: from an open world game sometimes as I get lost?
(0:06:47) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:06:49) Al: you've you've got I get why they do that right because it's a lot it would be overwhelming I
(0:06:53) Al: think if you had too much all at once but yeah it does feel it does it does feel a little bit like
(0:06:54) Aislinn: I don't mind, but yeah, that's just me.
(0:06:59) Al: oh and now you know I'm 10 hours into the game and I'm just unlocking a whole new series of of
(0:07:06) Al: quests sort of thing. There.
(0:07:06) Aislinn: yeah yeah yeah yeah that that's my like only complaint but that's just a me thing more than
(0:07:10) Aislinn: anything yeah um but yeah otherwise in addition to spider-man 2 magical delicacy also surprisingly
(0:07:12) Al: I think that's hard to solve but I get I get I get the issue.
(0:07:22) Aislinn: playing weathering waves um which is that gacha game but I haven't spent any money so far which
(0:07:28) Aislinn: i'm very proud of myself because I know it's like the game that you spend money on but i'm such a
(0:07:33) Aislinn: slow gamer that it's been great.
(0:07:36) Aislinn: This isn't another casual combat game which I'm into, but then I've also obviously been
(0:07:42) Aislinn: playing Kamehiru and I've been replaying coffee talk as well as just a nice wind down game.
(0:07:49) Aislinn: It makes me very sleepy, which is perfect before bed.
(0:07:52) Al: I feel like you have a very specific look of games that you're other than Spider-Man
(0:07:57) Al: two very specific look of games that you're playing just now like well just when you look
(0:08:00) Aislinn: - In what way?
(0:08:03) Al: at magical delicacy and Kama Eru and coffee talk and even a lot of not not not so much
(0:08:10) Al: whether it's I guess it's just those three like just their their style their art styles
(0:08:15) Aislinn: Mm hmm. Yeah, I would definitely agree. I'm very I am. I didn't think I was for like the
(0:08:15) Al: and their their vibes all feel very similar.
(0:08:24) Aislinn: longest time. And then within the past like year, I've definitely realized that aesthetically and
(0:08:30) Aislinn: vibe wise, I am very picky about my games in that sense. And all three of those games fit that good
(0:08:37) Aislinn: soundtrack and nice aesthetic. Like if a game doesn't look good, I realized that I'm not like
(0:08:45) Aislinn: a huge fan. Like personally, even though I know, and this is this is hot water that I'm treading
(0:08:49) Aislinn: into, but I know a lot of people love Baldur's Gate. I don't think I'm ever going to play Baldur's
(0:08:54) Aislinn: Gate because I don't like how it looks. It's not my my favorite aesthetic. So hot take, but I
(0:09:01) Aislinn: unfortunately am a sucker for aesthetics. Yeah. Yeah.
(0:09:04) Al: I think anybody who says they don't care how their games look is lying to you. It's just
(0:09:10) Al: that people have different preferences, right? Because I care how my games look, right? There
(0:09:16) Al: are games that I've seen come out that have been like, you know, PS3 style graphics, like
(0:09:21) Al: they're trying to recreate that vibe. And I don't like how they look, you know? But
(0:09:27) Al: equally the, you know, the more 3D Pokemon games have generally people have generally
(0:09:34) Al: not liked the look of, and I've quite liked them. I mean, it's not like Scarlet and Violet
(0:09:34) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:09:38) Al: is the most good looking game, but I'm just not bothered by it. And specifically, I really
(0:09:39) Aislinn: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
(0:09:43) Al: like how Pokemon Legends look. I actively like how that game looks, even though some
(0:09:45) Aislinn: Yeah, me too.
(0:09:47) Al: people really dislike it. So yeah, I think it's a lie to say you don't care how games
(0:09:48) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:09:52) Al: look, but it's a way that people describe the fact that we have different preferences.
(0:09:58) Al: And so people will be like, "Oh, oh, I just, I don't care about graphics." And it's like,
(0:10:01) Al: You do, it's just what your preference is.
(0:10:04) Al: are different from other people. So when you see a game that you like and other people
(0:10:08) Al: call it bad, you're like, "Oh, clearly that means I don't care about graphics." It's like,
(0:10:11) Al: "No, you just like what other people don't and that's fine." You couldn't agree more.
(0:10:13) Aislinn: Yeah, I agree, I 1000% agree.
(0:10:19) Aislinn: I could not agree, I couldn't, I could agree more, I don't know what the phrase is, but I think you know what I mean.
(0:10:24) Aislinn: I couldn't agree more, thank you.
(0:10:26) Al: Yes. Cool. Well, I haven't been playing...
(0:10:27) Aislinn: English is hard.
(0:10:34) Al: I haven't been playing a lot because I've spent most of my time podcasting because I've
(0:10:37) Aislinn: It's been sporadic, though.
(0:10:45) Al: been recording six episodes in two and a half weeks to get ready to go away. Obviously,
(0:10:48) Aislinn: Oh my god.
(0:10:50) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:10:52) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:10:52) Al: I finished up Dave the Diver for the Dave the Diver episodes. I've managed to finish
(0:10:56) Al: that story, so tune in next week to find out my first thoughts on Dave the Diver.
(0:11:04) Al: I have picked up for a very short period of time so far. I haven't played much of it,
(0:11:08) Al: but I've just picked up Chicken Journey, which is a 2D chicken platforming RPG.
(0:11:15) Aislinn: actually I think this is on my wish list it looks so cute
(0:11:20) Al: Yeah, I was on sale in the... was it the summer sale? I don't know, I lose track. Whatever
(0:11:26) Aislinn: probably
(0:11:27) Al: the most recent sale was on Steam, and it's been on my list for a while, and I saw that
(0:11:33) Al: it's about 10 hours to complete, so I was like, "That feels like a good... Yeah, let's
(0:11:37) Al: go for that then." So that will probably be my holiday game. About half an hour. Really
(0:11:39) Aislinn: nice very nice how much of it how much I was gonna say how much of it have you played thus far
(0:11:47) Aislinn: okay all right so not much of a first first look got it
(0:11:51) Al: but I've played enough to know that I don't dislike the controls, which is always a good start.
(0:11:55) Aislinn: that's a huge plus honestly
(0:11:57) Al: And the game looks like what you expect based on the materials, so I'm not seeing any false
(0:12:03) Al: advertising. So we'll see how the platforming challenges are and what the story is. And yeah.
(0:12:12) Aislinn: Yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing more about it from you definitely, because it is,
(0:12:16) Aislinn: I did confirm it is on my wish list, so to get your take would be fantastic.
(0:12:21) Al: will mention it at some point, I'm sure. Well, that's what we've been playing.
(0:12:23) Aislinn: Awesome.
(0:12:28) Al: We're going to talk about some game news. There's not a lot, and mainly that's because we're
(0:12:33) Al: recording quite early. So if something happens in the last week when this comes out, that's because
(0:12:41) Al: we didn't mention it because we've already recorded SAWs. So the first news is that Far Lands have
(0:12:49) Al: have announced their early access is coming.
(0:12:51) Al: on the 24th of July for people who don't remember, because I talk about too many games.
(0:13:01) Al: This is a 2D pixel art farming game in space.
(0:13:09) Al: Yeah, I don't think there's a huge amount to say, they've announced their early access.
(0:13:16) Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I you know my take on pretty much all the game news is that I have never seen this game before
(0:13:24) Aislinn: But it looks I did I actually copied and pasted it
(0:13:24) Al: >> Island literally wrote that next to every single news.
(0:13:27) Al: I've first time seeing this game.
(0:13:29) Aislinn: And literally copied and pasted it. I was like, oh I haven't seen any of these games
(0:13:35) Aislinn: It looks like us. It looks like a space a space star do
(0:13:38) Al: pretty much. Yeah, I don't, it's not like I think this game looks bad. There's nothing
(0:13:39) Aislinn: Okay
(0:13:45) Al: about it that excites me in particular, but, you know, different people, etc. So if you
(0:13:52) Aislinn: Yeah, it fills that niche.
(0:13:54) Al: want to space stardew, this is one of the many options coming out in the next few months.
(0:13:59) Aislinn: And you know my take about another farming sim in my life, I don't have time!
(0:14:06) Aislinn: But I appreciate it for what it is.
(0:14:07) Aislinn: I do appreciate it for what it is, and if that was filling the niche for me, I would
(0:14:11) Aislinn: be stoked about it.
(0:14:12) Al: Yeah, yeah, fair enough.
(0:14:15) Al: GoGo Town have released more information about their roadmap, so listeners will know what
(0:14:23) Al: this game is because we covered it a couple weeks ago.
(0:14:27) Al: I played it.
(0:14:28) Al: It's an early access.
(0:14:30) Al: My summary, Aislinn, because you won't have listened to that episode, is it's an early
(0:14:34) Al: access but not one of the buggy early accesses.
(0:14:38) Al: One of the early accesses that just feels like it's missing a lot of content.
(0:14:42) Al: I think this will be really good to play once it's once it's further down the line.
(0:14:47) Al: But I feel like after kind of six or seven hours, was it 10, 10 hours, something like that,
(0:14:53) Al: I played of it.
(0:14:54) Aislinn: I mean, considering six or seven hours and you feel that way already, that's pretty good,
(0:14:54) Al: I feel like I've gotten everything I can out of it just now, but I have very much
(0:15:04) Aislinn: but that's unfortunate.
(0:15:05) Aislinn: It's like the early access is lack of content, but I much, much, much rather that than it
(0:15:10) Aislinn: being a buggy game for sure.
(0:15:12) Al: Yeah, that's always been my feeling because there's a few others that have played in that
(0:15:16) Al: similar vein like Ooblets and Coral Island. They were both similar where the game did
(0:15:22) Al: not feel buggy at all. It just felt unfinished and there was a lot of missing content. All
(0:15:29) Al: of them I've come back to at 1.0 and had a great time again. I never feel bad about them,
(0:15:35) Al: because I go into them knowing they're early access. I'd say, "Well, yeah, I would much
(0:15:38) Al: rather that, then here's a game where everything exists, but it's gonna crash.
(0:15:42) Al: Every five minutes. You know.
(0:15:42) Aislinn: Yeah, no, I much rather that.
(0:15:47) Aislinn: I agree.
(0:15:48) Aislinn: I wholeheartedly agree.
(0:15:50) Aislinn: But yeah, this is the go-go town game for what I, again, first time seeing the game.
(0:15:55) Aislinn: So all I know is what I've seen on the Steam page store for the most part, but it does
(0:16:00) Aislinn: look like a whole bunch of fun.
(0:16:02) Aislinn: So when it is fully fleshed out, it looks like there's a lot of things that like a lot
(0:16:06) Aislinn: of time that you could sink into the game.
(0:16:08) Al: Yeah, yeah, definitely. And you can write a unicorn tricycle. So, yeah, that's the important thing.
(0:16:12) Aislinn: You can high five a cow.
(0:16:14) Aislinn: [LAUGH] I saw that and I was like, whoa, I was like ready.
(0:16:20) Aislinn: I was ready, I was those hype.
(0:16:21) Aislinn: [LAUGH] It's so cute.
(0:16:22) Al: Yeah, so they've updated their roadmap a little bit. There's an update coming out pretty much
(0:16:32) Al: just when this comes out with some more updates to their worker AIs. A lot of this game, Aislinn,
(0:16:38) Al: is about kind of getting people to your town and telling them to, like you give them jobs to do.
(0:16:44) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:16:44) Al: And so they do the things that you were doing, they automate them and stuff like that. So
(0:16:48) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:16:48) Al: there's obviously some bugs within that because that's a very complicated thing to do.
(0:16:52) Al: So they've got a bunch of updates coming for fixing of that. And then they've announced that
(0:16:59) Al: their first major update is going to come mid-August. And that includes, it's mostly
(0:17:02) Aislinn: Nice. Soon.
(0:17:06) Al: kind of like quality of life improvements. And they had said, I think they're going to expand
(0:17:10) Al: the map and stuff like that, which was kind of one of the biggest things that I had noticed about
(0:17:13) Al: the game was it felt quite small, experience wise, which is good that they're focusing on.
(0:17:22) Al: What people are feeling are the things they would like to improve quickest.
(0:17:28) Aislinn: And that's the beauty of more indie games in general, is like you're able to have that
(0:17:32) Aislinn: community and have that communication, which is very nice, very refreshing.
(0:17:38) Al: Garden Witch Life have released a new trailer. I feel like the name tells you everything
(0:17:45) Al: about what this game is, right? Garden Witch Life. It's a life sim where you're a witch
(0:17:47) Aislinn: Yeah, I would agree.
(0:17:52) Al: and you're farming. Yeah. So yeah, they've released a new trailer with some kind of hints
(0:17:56) Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, yep, that's that's what I took away from looking at the game as well
(0:18:01) Aislinn: And that little little guy
(0:18:04) Al: towards the story and
(0:18:08) Al: yeah I i they've not got a release date yet but they are still saying that it's releasing this
(0:18:12) Al: year so if they're saying that in july i'm feeling reasonably confident a bit
(0:18:18) Aislinn: Yeah, well, well, I guess, yeah, I think I, I, I would agree.
(0:18:21) Aislinn: I would agree.
(0:18:22) Aislinn: I wish, I wish I could, I realized now that I was so excited about that little
(0:18:26) Aislinn: guy, but this is an audio only podcast.
(0:18:29) Aislinn: So that doesn't make any sense, but just know that there is on specifically the
(0:18:31) Al: There's a little guy.
(0:18:34) Aislinn: steam page, if you go to the steam page and you go to the decorate section on
(0:18:39) Aislinn: that little bed, there's a little guy right there.
(0:18:41) Aislinn: That's very cute.
(0:18:43) Aislinn: I mean, there's a bunch of little guys, but there's specifically a little guy
(0:18:43) Al: just a little guy. Yeah, he is. He's a little guy. And he's following the theme of frogs
(0:18:46) Aislinn: And he's real
(0:18:48) Aislinn: Good
(0:18:51) Aislinn: He's a little guy
(0:18:55) Aislinn: He is
(0:18:56) Al: this episode. So low frog guy.
(0:18:58) Aislinn: That's my take on garden witch life 10 out of 10 cuz a little guy
(0:19:01) Aislinn: Bye. (laughs)
(0:19:06) Al: We also have a small update about Lens Island, so I think we talked about the Game Modes
(0:19:11) Al: update last week. That is now out, and they've released the entire patch notes. I don't think
(0:19:18) Al: there was anything big that I saw in there that we hadn't already talked about. Basically,
(0:19:24) Al: Aislinn, this update is about adding new game modes, and changes in difficulty, but not
(0:19:30) Al: just our easy, hard, medium sort of thing, but they've got...
(0:19:36) Al: So many different options. You can turn on Permadeath, or turn it off. You can change
(0:19:43) Al: what happens to your bag when you die, whether it stays with you, whether it drops, or whether
(0:19:47) Al: it's destroyed. They've got 30 or 40 different updates in different settings for the difficulty,
(0:19:58) Aislinn: Whoo, that's nice. That's awesome. It's a game. That's also I think on my wish list
(0:20:02) Aislinn: But I just have not gotten around to playing it
(0:20:04) Aislinn: But good to know that there's going to be even more options one and if I am able to get around to it
(0:20:09) Al: Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to encourage you to play it right now because their 1.0 comes
(0:20:13) Al: out in like two months. So, very soon. I'm worse than you. It's not on my wish list.
(0:20:17) Aislinn: We'll revisit in two months then. [laughs]
(0:20:23) Al: I own the game and I haven't played it yet. That's not quite true. Well, part of the problem
(0:20:25) Aislinn: Awwwwww! [laughs]
(0:20:30) Al: is that I might have a problem in kick-starting games, and this was one of the ones I kick-started,
(0:20:37) Al: So obviously I got the code for then.
(0:20:39) Al: I have opened the game, but I opened the game on my Steam deck and I went to play it and realized they didn't have controller support when the first version came out and I went, "I'm not going to do this just now then."
(0:20:41) Aislinn: Okay.
(0:20:47) Aislinn: Awwww...
(0:20:50) Aislinn: Awwww...
(0:20:51) Al: It has now been, I think it has now, I think been two years since the added controller support, but I've still not played it yet.
(0:20:56) Aislinn: Okay.
(0:20:57) Aislinn: When- you know when you get to it is when you get to it. _laughs_
(0:21:01) Al: Exactly, exactly. So at this point, I'm waiting for 1.0 and then I'll be all in.
(0:21:06) Aislinn: Two months, two months.
(0:21:09) Al: Well, I'm in a way for the next month anyway, so.
(0:21:12) Aislinn: Mm-hmm. It's true. _laughs_
(0:21:15) Al: July has been a very busy with games.
(0:21:19) Al: There were so many games that released in July, it was a little bit stressful.
(0:21:24) Al: Gogotown being one of them. Thanks, guys.
(0:21:30) Al: That's the game news.
(0:21:31) Al: We also have a new game, Wind Story.
(0:21:36) Al: So this I'll just as I always do read a little blurb about this.
(0:21:39) Al: So I mean, it's a like a life farming life, right?
(0:21:59) Al: I'm just going to do it.
(0:22:00) Aislinn: Again, I don't have time, but the game looks really nice.
(0:22:05) Aislinn: I really like the colors and I am a sucker for the Octopath art style.
(0:22:10) Al: Yeah, so was it 2DHD? Is that what they're calling it? Where it's like your kind of pixel art,
(0:22:10) Aislinn: Art style-esque thing.
(0:22:12) Aislinn: Uhhh, good question.
(0:22:16) Aislinn: I, I, I, you know, even though I said I like the art style because it's Octopath, I've
(0:22:16) Al: I think that's what they call it? Let's see, or is that like a trademark or something?
(0:22:25) Aislinn: never played Octopath in my life, but I've seen friends play Octopath and I appreciate
(0:22:30) Aislinn: the art style, but I don't know anything about the game.
(0:22:31) Al: You can like how something looks. Yeah so Wikipedia says it's an HD 2D not 2D HD. Sorry,
(0:22:39) Aislinn: Ah, okay.
(0:22:40) Al: HD 2D. So yeah I have mixed feelings about that style of game. Like I know it's trying to do the...
(0:22:40) Aislinn: HG2D, okay.
(0:22:51) Al: it's trying to be like kind of 2D RPGs where in the past but try and make them more modern.
(0:23:01) Al: If you're trying to do that style of game you either do this or you do just standard 2D pixel art.
(0:23:10) Al: There's something about the characters on the background they never quite fit properly and I
(0:23:17) Al: just I'm not a huge fan of any of this style of graphics. I think that's a me thing. I just feel
(0:23:24) Al: like they stand out badly against the background.
(0:23:28) Aislinn: I mean, yeah, I've it's I feel like the octopath art style. I feel like it's very divisive. It's either you like it or you don't
(0:23:35) Aislinn: Like I've definitely heard your take of just not being super stoked about it
(0:23:40) Aislinn: But I've also heard people that will die on a hill and say it's amazing. So
(0:23:45) Aislinn: Again, like you were saying in the beginning the aesthetics it's a preference
(0:23:48) Al: Yeah. It's not even just like that, because I'm trying to figure out whether it's because,
(0:23:53) Al: obviously, the character models are like flat, kind of like Paper Mario, but the reason that
(0:23:58) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:23:59) Al: I prefer how Paper Mario looks is because like everything looks like that, whereas this is just
(0:24:04) Al: the character on an otherwise high-definition 3D world. And it just, there's something about that
(0:24:12) Al: that just doesn't, what's the opposite of tickling your brain? It like, stabbing my brain. I don't
(0:24:15) Aislinn: I feel like that's so aggressive smoosh smooshing. I don't know. I'm not sure
(0:24:19) Al: brain does not like it. Smooshing my brain. That sounds worse.
(0:24:26) Aislinn: That does sound worse, I don't know
(0:24:31) Al: Yeah. I don't know. I, yeah. Some people will love how this looks, and that's good.
(0:24:36) Aislinn: Fair no
(0:24:39) Al: But this game is coming soon, and that blurb that I gave you is most of what we know. There's some
(0:24:46) Al: more kind of description.
(0:24:48) Al: And there's a bunch of screenshots if you want to look on the Steam page,
(0:24:51) Al: but there's not a huge amount more and, yeah.
(0:24:56) Aislinn: Yeah, I've got nothing else to add with that.
(0:24:59) Aislinn: I think it looks okay, you think it looks eh?
(0:25:02) Aislinn: And that's just, that's just how it'd be.
(0:25:06) Al: That is how it would be.
(0:25:07) Al: However, a game that we both think looks great.
(0:25:10) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:25:11) Al: However, I haven't played it yet is Kamayru.
(0:25:13) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:25:15) Al: We are going to talk about Kamaeru, a frog refuge.
(0:25:18) Al: From someone who hasn't played this, I guess I would describe this as looking like Usagi
(0:25:24) Al: Shima, but frogs.
(0:25:26) Al: Would you say that's a fair description?
(0:25:28) Aislinn: I have to look up what you just said.
(0:25:29) Al: Oh, you've not played Usagi Shima?
(0:25:32) Aislinn: No.
(0:25:32) Al: Oh, no!
(0:25:33) Aislinn: Oh, yeah.
(0:25:33) Al: Where have you been?
(0:25:34) Aislinn: No, I do know this.
(0:25:35) Aislinn: I do notice.
(0:25:36) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:25:37) Aislinn: It's it is.
(0:25:38) Al: Bunny game.
(0:25:38) Aislinn: It is.
(0:25:39) Aislinn: Yep.
(0:25:40) Aislinn: No, I've heard of.
(0:25:41) Aislinn: You know, it is.
(0:25:42) Al: Ah.
(0:25:42) Aislinn: I never played it because I have a friend that I knew I knew would love this game.
(0:25:44) Aislinn: And I was like, I'm gonna let her have it and have her moment because I feel like this
(0:25:48) Aislinn: is a game suited for her because she is her whole branding is rabbit.
(0:25:51) Aislinn: So I'm like, I'm gonna let her have her moment.
(0:25:53) Aislinn: But I've seen this game very cute.
(0:25:55) Aislinn: And I think from what I know about this game, yes, it's very similar.
(0:25:58) Aislinn: It is, instead of it being a bunny collecting game, a frog.
(0:25:59) Al: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Cool. Well, yeah, I mean, I personally, when I've seen it, I've liked
(0:26:07) Al: the look of it. I've seen you stream it a little bit because if people don't know, Aislinn
(0:26:09) Aislinn: Mm-hmm
(0:26:12) Al: is a streamer, a very good streamer, a very fun streamer. Doing mostly cosy games would
(0:26:14) Aislinn: Hey, thank you
(0:26:18) Al: be a fair way to describe it. You don't discriminate on your cosy games, you just do whatever you're
(0:26:25) Aislinn: Yeah, pretty much. It's whatever. It happens to usually be cozy, but I'm open to anything
(0:26:32) Aislinn: as long as I'm having a good time at the end of the day.
(0:26:34) Al: Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. Cool. Well, I'll hand it off to you to start off with then.
(0:26:40) Al: Tell me about this game. You've gotten into it. What's it like?
(0:26:44) Aislinn: Well, first of all, buckle in, because it's time.
(0:26:50) Al: It's time for Essay!
(0:26:55) Aislinn: I love this game, just to preface it.
(0:26:58) Aislinn: So I am definitely very biased in the sense that I will give this game all of the praise
(0:27:02) Aislinn: in the world, because I love this game, I've met the developers, and everything from beginning
(0:27:11) Aislinn: to end has been a wonderful experience with this game.
(0:27:13) Aislinn: I'm very biased in the--
(0:27:14) Aislinn: I'm very biased in the positive end of this game, but what Kamaeru is from the website
(0:27:21) Aislinn: Kamaeru is a cozy farming sim game in which you breed and collect frogs, decorate your refuge, and restore wetlands in order to grow food and other resources
(0:27:29) Aislinn: There's also, like, from the Steam page as well, it mentions
(0:27:34) Aislinn: With the help of the game's cast of welcoming NPCs, you have photograph and breed frogs to increase your reputation, decorate your frog refuge, and plant native crops de--
(0:27:44) Aislinn: to help your amphibian abode thrive
(0:27:47) Aislinn: Um, and pretty much the gameplay loop of the game is collecting frogs, whether you are feeding them, you're breeding them, you are taking photos of them
(0:27:58) Aislinn: You can collect 500+ frogs, and add them to your frogadex
(0:28:02) Al: 500. Wow. So many frogs. I always find it funny when they say 500 plus. It's like how
(0:28:03) Aislinn: 500+! So many frogs! It's so good!
(0:28:09) Al: many more plus? Is- is-
(0:28:10) Aislinn: I think it's like, I think it's like, I'm not going to lie, I think it's like five.
(0:28:14) Aislinn: I have the the number 512 in my head, and I don't know if that's correct or not.
(0:28:18) Al: I just feel like just put the number, right? Like 500 plus, just put the number, right?
(0:28:21) Aislinn: Yeah, right? Yeah, I...
(0:28:25) Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, I agree, but you know, you gotta you gotta make it look enticing by saying plus.
(0:28:31) Al: But like, I feel like most people would probably look at that and go, "Oh, so like 501 then."
(0:28:39) Al: Whereas if it was like much more than that, you would put the number, right? Like if it
(0:28:41) Al: was 590, you wouldn't say 500 plus, you'd say nearly 600.
(0:28:46) Aislinn: True. It's like saying, it's like people when they say like, oh a few, a couple,
(0:28:50) Aislinn: that could mean multiple different things to different people, so.
(0:28:56) Aislinn: I think it's like five, twelve. I'm pretty sure it's less than five fifty though.
(0:29:00) Aislinn: So I'll say somewhere within that range. True.
(0:29:00) Al: I mean 500 is a lot, no matter how many exactly it is, 500 plus.
(0:29:07) Aislinn: And they're all adorable. All so cute. And I love that it's called the Frogadex. I think that is so
(0:29:13) Aislinn: adorable.
(0:29:14) Al: Hmm. Classic.
(0:29:16) Aislinn: Yeah, it's real. It's real good. You collect the frogs, 500 plus frogs, just so you know.
(0:29:21) Al: 500 plus.
(0:29:25) Aislinn: You restore the wetlands, which is one of my favorite things, I think, by far about
(0:29:29) Aislinn: this game is that there is a... it's not... it's definitely by no means. There's not a
(0:29:35) Aislinn: lot of... it's not super... it's not super in-depth in regards to, like, the
(0:29:40) Aislinn: restor... like, learning about the restoration process, but you do learn
(0:29:44) Aislinn: about what it's
(0:29:46) Aislinn: kind of like to restore a wetland or restore an
(0:29:48) Aislinn: environment and it there is a focus on this in this game of
(0:29:52) Aislinn: just conservation and everything, which makes me very
(0:29:56) Aislinn: happy. Like there's a it's not just a game about collecting
(0:30:00) Aislinn: frogs is also a message, especially with me melting over
(0:30:04) Aislinn: here because of global warming, I think it's wonderful. It's
(0:30:06) Aislinn: perfect timing. It's wonderful. So there's that. And then with
(0:30:12) Aislinn: that, there's also decorating your wetlands is decorating your
(0:30:16) Aislinn: there is froggy. There's a froggy chair. Confirm there is a
(0:30:20) Aislinn: froggy chair. There's froggy furniture in general. So if you
(0:30:23) Aislinn: like those little guys, this froggy everything. And it is
(0:30:30) Aislinn: available on Steam on the Xbox series and the Nintendo Switch.
(0:30:37) Aislinn: But if it were up to me, I would recommend playing it on
(0:30:41) Aislinn: thirsty with a mouse because it's a very clicky game.
(0:30:43) Al: It's a very clicky game, isn't it?
(0:30:46) Aislinn: I was given a key by Armor Games because that's the publisher, so they gave me a key for Steam but I bought the game on Switch because I loved the game so much that I wanted to also buy the game to support developers as well and I still enjoy it on the Switch but I definitely enjoy it way more on the PC personally.
(0:31:04) Al: Mm hmm.
(0:31:12) Al: Does the touch screen work on Switch?
(0:31:12) Aislinn: Actually, it's a good point.
(0:31:16) Al: You haven't tried.
(0:31:16) Aislinn: I realized... I don't think I tried.
(0:31:18) Al: I can't believe you haven't tried.
(0:31:19) Al: Like, I just I can't I can't imagine you would you would go and go, oh,
(0:31:23) Al: this is this is a game that seems to work much better when you can just click
(0:31:27) Al: on the things you want and you didn't go and you didn't go, well,
(0:31:28) Aislinn: Yeah, I think I did, I think I did, but also I don't remember, because the most recent
(0:31:30) Al: let me just try tapping on the things that I want.
(0:31:39) Aislinn: times that I've played Kameeru on the Switch, I had it all the time docked on a TV.
(0:31:44) Al: Yeah, that's fair. That's fair
(0:31:44) Aislinn: So that's why I'm like, um, I don't remember I don't because I just, I haven't played the
(0:31:49) Aislinn: Switch handheld in a while.
(0:31:51) Aislinn: So that's probably why I don't remember.
(0:31:53) Aislinn: I would guess so though, I would guess it can be touchscreen, but you're going to primarily
(0:31:58) Aislinn: be playing it with a controller, which is okay, but it's definitely built better for
(0:32:02) Aislinn: a mouse.
(0:32:04) Aislinn: And even when I was talking with the developers, when I met them at PAX East, they were like,
(0:32:08) Aislinn: yeah, this game is better on, on a, on a PC.
(0:32:10) Aislinn: So even they're just, even they're aware, but they have to, you got, you got to do what
(0:32:14) Al: It's hard, I think, when you've got a game that's very clicky to map that to a controller.
(0:32:20) Aislinn: - Yeah.
(0:32:20) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:32:23) Al: I did just search and it looks like it doesn't work with the touch screen on Switch, which
(0:32:27) Al: is a bit sad. That could have been a really nice way to do it. I actually think, you know,
(0:32:28) Aislinn: Aww. Yeah.
(0:32:31) Al: because Usagi Shima is like a mobile game, so it works really well with that, because
(0:32:36) Al: obviously you just got a touch screen. I feel like it could work really well on like an
(0:32:36) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:32:39) Al: iPad or something like that. But yeah, I get the complication with that.
(0:32:40) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:32:44) Al: It's difficult. And I think that, you know, even something like Stardew with a controller,
(0:32:53) Al: there's always a few things that you're just like, "That's not ideal," because it's a difficult
(0:32:56) Aislinn: - Yeah.
(0:32:56) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:32:57) Al: thing to do when you design it around mouse and keyboard. That's how you start off with
(0:33:02) Al: things and that makes specific decisions about how the game works, you know.
(0:33:07) Aislinn: Yeah, definitely, again, definitely built for the mouse and keyboard situation and everything,
(0:33:16) Aislinn: but yeah, just gotta be more marketable.
(0:33:20) Aislinn: Get it out to more.
(0:33:21) Aislinn: The more people you can get it out to, the better.
(0:33:23) Aislinn: And I want more people to see this game anyways.
(0:33:24) Aislinn: I love, love, love this game, just the conservation aspect, the everything is cute, the art style
(0:33:30) Aislinn: is adorable, the people behind, the people on the team of the game itself are also wonderful
(0:33:34) Aislinn: human beings. So like everything through and through.
(0:33:38) Aislinn: It's just it's just a wonderfully cozy brain turning off type of game and if
(0:33:44) Aislinn: you love frogs it's it's just it's a it's a good game.
(0:33:49) Al: So, in terms of actual gameplay, you're collecting the frogs. How do you collect the frogs? Where
(0:33:54) Aislinn: So you can collect the frogs by either taking a photo of them or you can feed them. How to get
(0:33:56) Al: do they come from?
(0:34:05) Aislinn: the frogs is by placing furniture either in your refuge or in any of the wetlands that you're
(0:34:11) Aislinn: restoring. And then also they'll appear in the ponds that you also plant or put down rather in
(0:34:19) Aislinn: the wetlands as well. So they appear in any of those scenarios and once they appear you'll see
(0:34:24) Aislinn: a little animation pop up if it's new and you can collect the frogs from there. If you're feeding
(0:34:32) Aislinn: the frogs to collect them you'll also have to essentially farm and get the bugs that you need.
(0:34:38) Aislinn: But what I like is that the game gives you the option to feed it like the bugs that you do have
(0:34:43) Aislinn: and then when you see the frog again if you have those bugs that you weren't able to feed it then
(0:34:47) Aislinn: you could feed them again and then you can collect those frogs. The distinction between taking a photo
(0:34:54) Aislinn: frogs is that if you take a photo it just gets added to the frogadex. If you collect it it not
(0:34:59) Aislinn: only gets added to the frogadex but it also can be used for the breeding of the frogs.
(0:35:05) Aislinn: So and then the breeding is also another way to collect frogs as well is that you can try and
(0:35:09) Aislinn: breed for the different patterns with the frogs as well.
(0:35:12) Al: Yeah, so I saw kind of like a bunch of them are just like it's a green frog with red arms
(0:35:18) Al: type thing. So do you get that by breeding like a green frog and a red frog? Is that
(0:35:18) Aislinn: Yeah, well yes and no, yes in the sense that that is ideally how you would do it, but no
(0:35:22) Al: the idea?
(0:35:23) Al: >> Thank you.
(0:35:27) Aislinn: in the sense that like the minigames, so this game also has minigames as well, the minigame
(0:35:32) Aislinn: that you play to do the breeding, it's essentially just tic-tac-toe with the computer essentially.
(0:35:41) Aislinn: So if you're lucky, you'll get what you want, but you have to kind of be strategic with
(0:35:47) Aislinn: your tic-tac-toe and hope for the best.
(0:35:49) Al: Okay, fair enough. So that's how... So when you're doing the breeding, do you select two of them,
(0:35:58) Al: and then you do this minigame, and if you win, you get something. Okay.
(0:36:02) Aislinn: Yeah, pretty much
(0:36:05) Aislinn: Yeah, you collect you choose to the frogs that you fed and then that allows you to
(0:36:11) Aislinn: do the mini game to try and get either a pattern that you a pattern and a color that you want or just a pattern depending
(0:36:18) Aislinn: On what you're what you're trying to breed for you can if you if you want like a specific color
(0:36:22) Aislinn: you could do two different patterns and
(0:36:25) Aislinn: do both pink of
(0:36:28) Aislinn: each frog or something so
(0:36:30) Aislinn: There's a lot of there's a lot of different
(0:36:33) Aislinn: Options between the patterns and the colors that are available to you to try and get what you want to fill up your frog adex
(0:36:40) Aislinn: with breeding like eventually I'll probably
(0:36:43) Aislinn: End up breeding towards the tail end of completing the frog adex to try and get fill in those gaps
(0:36:49) Al: When you have a very few specific ones that you've got to get yeah, yeah, so you're finding it's quicker just to catch them in the wild just now because of that.
(0:36:51) Aislinn: Yeah
(0:36:52) Aislinn: Exactly. That's probably
(0:36:56) Aislinn: Yeah, cuz it's just yeah cuz it's like RNG essentially with the with the breeding
(0:37:02) Aislinn: Which it's either you love it or hate it
(0:37:04) Aislinn: I guess like for me I don't particularly mind but I can see someone being like well
(0:37:08) Aislinn: I wish I could be more selective about it. So it
(0:37:12) Aislinn: Depends on your preference, but definitely I think towards the tail end of completing completing the frog adex
(0:37:18) Aislinn: It would be best to just do the breeding and try and hope for the best and you'll probably have enough money to do
(0:37:23) Aislinn: So it only costs I know in the screenshot. It says eight coins
(0:37:26) Aislinn: I'm pretty sure that's consistent throughout the entire gameplay loop that it's always eight coins
(0:37:31) Aislinn: which is not
(0:37:33) Al: Yeah, okay, fair enough. How are you getting coins then? Is that through tourism by having
(0:37:41) Al: the wetlands, or is it just having the - how do you get them?
(0:37:45) Aislinn: That is through the crafting aspect, which is like another minigame in itself. So in each wetland,
(0:37:52) Aislinn: I won't spoil all the wetlands because it is, I guess, a spoiler, technically, and it's kind
(0:37:58) Aislinn: of part of the story. But in each wetland that you are able to have access to, there are different
(0:38:04) Aislinn: stations with different NPCs that you interact with and learn about as well in their backstories.
(0:38:10) Aislinn: But there's different stations where you can cook and craft, like you can make.
(0:38:16) Aislinn: You can make jams, berry jams, and stuff like that. And then you take those materials that you get,
(0:38:24) Aislinn: and you're able to sell them in the shop back in your refuge to be able to get money, to then be
(0:38:29) Aislinn: able to buy more ponds, buy more plants for your wetlands, and buy furniture, breed, repaint your
(0:38:40) Aislinn: furniture, etc, etc. So that's another thing, too, is that you can change depending on most of the
(0:38:45) Aislinn: furniture, but most of the furniture, too, in the game. You can also repaint to any color that you
(0:38:49) Aislinn: want, but you have to understand color theory. I mean, I guess you could just mess around with it,
(0:38:53) Aislinn: but it would take, it would take, it would take, it would take, it would be a go quicker
(0:38:58) Aislinn: if you knew color theory. If you don't know color theory, you'll get there one way or another.
(0:39:02) Al: Instead of just choosing a color, you're essentially adding color which changes what the color is.
(0:39:08) Aislinn: Yeah, they...
(0:39:09) Al: If I have a red one and I add blue, it goes purple sort of thing.
(0:39:13) Aislinn: yeah pretty much yeah they
(0:39:16) Aislinn: to work with and then you kind of adjust the levels from there so you can try and get to the
(0:39:21) Aislinn: color that you're trying to get to. I will say the color palette is still even though there is
(0:39:25) Aislinn: like the color theory aspect I will say the color palette still feels slightly limited
(0:39:31) Aislinn: but it mostly gets the job done and there's still a lot of
(0:39:35) Al: Now I need to know, on the Steam page, they've got this frog standing on the top of a froggy
(0:39:41) Al: slide looking very powerful in his stance. Why is he so confident? Yeah. All right, fair
(0:39:42) Aislinn: Yeeeaaah!
(0:39:48) Aislinn: Why is he so confident? 'Cause he's confidently cute!
(0:39:53) Aislinn: He's confidently cute!
(0:39:55) Al: enough.
(0:39:56) Aislinn: Well, yeah, but like, you can- when you discover the frogs, like in your refuge,
(0:40:01) Aislinn: in your wetlands and everything, they can also be in different poses as well, which is very cute.
(0:40:05) Al: Yeah, yeah, fair enough. It seems it does seem very similar to sagashima in terms of
(0:40:10) Al: like, you know, you've got your furniture and they have specific things that they do
(0:40:14) Al: with the furniture and you'll just randomly find that all this one's on this thing now,
(0:40:20) Al: which is very cute. Like the one kind of reaching into a wheelbarrow is very cute.
(0:40:25) Aislinn: Oh that one when I saw that one for the first time I cried a little bit. It's so cute. It's so cute
(0:40:32) Aislinn: That's what I think gets me the most is just I literally I think through most of my gameplay
(0:40:37) Aislinn: When I was streaming at all the entire time. I was like, it's so cute. These little guys. They're so cute
(0:40:44) Al: How do you find the selection of furniture and poses? Are there enough that you don't
(0:40:49) Al: feel like it's just repeating very quickly?
(0:40:52) Aislinn: Um, I would say the the furniture I haven't unlocked all the furniture actually, I'm currently in the process
(0:40:58) Aislinn: so I finished the main game and
(0:41:00) Aislinn: I'm now currently in the process of trying to get
(0:41:03) Aislinn: all
(0:41:04) Aislinn: Not even all of the furniture, but a bunch of the furniture
(0:41:08) Aislinn: My priority more so is I want to complete the frog and eggs. That's my goal. How will I complete that?
(0:41:13) Aislinn: I don't know. When will I complete that? I don't know but
(0:41:15) Aislinn: With the furniture from the options that I've seen it's a pretty pretty decent variety
(0:41:20) Aislinn: and furniture.
(0:41:22) Aislinn: As for the frogs, I think I am getting to a point in my Steam game where frogs are
(0:41:42) Aislinn: definitely starting to repeat themselves and there is only like maybe like five or so poses
(0:41:48) Aislinn: that they cycle through I wanna say.
(0:41:50) Aislinn: not too many poses.
(0:41:52) Aislinn: It's just a very cute game to me, and I really love it.
(0:42:13) Aislinn: So I personally am not really getting tired of it, but I don't know when I complete the
(0:42:17) Aislinn: frog attacks or when I get all the furniture what else I can do with the
(0:42:22) Aislinn: I think once that's done, like the game is pretty much like done. There's nothing you can do at this point.
(0:42:28) Aislinn: Even when you complete the main story, depending on how much of completionist you are,
(0:42:31) Aislinn: it might be like a one and done so much so that like this is another kind of complaint that I have.
(0:42:38) Aislinn: But it's again also a me thing more than anything is that the game doesn't allow you to have multiple save files.
(0:42:44) Aislinn: So it's literally like one and done.
(0:42:47) Aislinn: So that could be
(0:42:49) Aislinn: that could be an issue. Personally, why I-
(0:42:52) Aislinn: I want multiple save files is because I want to be able to have my on stream copy of the game,
(0:42:59) Aislinn: and then my off stream copy of the game, because I like to play this game also in my personal time.
(0:43:04) Aislinn: But that's why I bought the Steam version, because that's my personal copy, or my second save file,
(0:43:09) Aislinn: you could say. But it's just the only thing that kind of is like "eh" is the fact that I have to
(0:43:14) Aislinn: use the controller for that one. So it would be nice to be able to play both versions on PC,
(0:43:20) Aislinn: or have both to safe.
(0:43:23) Al: Yeah, yeah, fair enough. OK, in terms of the designs of the frog, I've seen, like, you
(0:43:33) Al: know, obviously like the split colours and stuff like that. And I've seen some with spots.
(0:43:39) Al: Do they have things like, you know, the stripey ones and stuff like that? Is it like, because
(0:43:43) Al: obviously 500 is pretty easy to get to 500 when you've only got a few designs and a few
(0:43:48) Al: colours, right? Because, like, just numbers multiply massively. And obviously, you know,
(0:43:53) Al: obviously it is, I mean, they're even just saying the same thing with different colours
(0:43:58) Al: over and over again is very cute. You don't find any saminess to the design.
(0:44:05) Aislinn: um no not really there's a good there's a pretty I i want to say between the 500 plus frogs
(0:44:13) Aislinn: that exist um there is I think like seven or eight I believe different patterns that you can
(0:44:22) Aislinn: come across some being the stripes some being like the pattern on the arm the spotted one um
(0:44:29) Aislinn: there are some cute ones that you'll come across like acute patterns in my but there's one i'm very
(0:44:33) Aislinn: I've written one that I very, very much.
(0:44:35) Aislinn: so love because I love this specific type of pattern for like anything.
(0:44:39) Aislinn: It is also kind of associated with emoji that I use like all the time for everything.
(0:44:43) Aislinn: So I personally like the different patterns that they have for the frogs.
(0:44:51) Aislinn: And I have no issue with it.
(0:44:53) Aislinn: The only thing that gets kind of awkward is like, for example,
(0:44:56) Aislinn: or yeah, for all of the patterns is when you have the same colors,
(0:45:01) Aislinn: then it just becomes, instead of it being like, orange fro--
(0:45:05) Aislinn: with yellow stripes, it becomes orange frog with the same color orange stripes, so now it's just orange frog.
(0:45:10) Al: 7 different orange frogs are technically unique!
(0:45:15) Aislinn: So within each pattern group, yeah,
(0:45:20) Aislinn: seven different patterns, technically. So it's like, that is where it gets a little bit awkward,
(0:45:25) Aislinn: but I understand that having that option within each pattern group makes it easier for a breeding.
(0:45:32) Al: right okay yeah fair enough fair enough I guess it's it's one of those things
(0:45:34) Aislinn: So I think that's
(0:45:35) Aislinn: for like the breeding mechanic
(0:45:36) Al: where yeah so I guess it's just one of those things where if people's only
(0:45:39) Al: experience of collecting games is Pokemon it's not the same thing because
(0:45:42) Aislinn: Mm-hmm
(0:45:43) Al: obviously the thing about Pokemon is they're all so very different whereas
(0:45:47) Aislinn: Yeah
(0:45:48) Al: this is like varieties of the same thing and those can be quite different kind of
(0:45:51) Aislinn: Yeah
(0:45:54) Al: preferences if you will I did
(0:45:56) Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, I think I it's that definitely the variety in this game is not not there like it is in pokemon
(0:46:04) Al: Which is fine, there's different things. It's not a problem. I just, you know, just pointing
(0:46:10) Al: out to people in case they... I'm absolutely dying. I was looking through some of the reviews
(0:46:15) Al: and one person's review is just "Am I actually autistic?" I whispered to myself as I listened
(0:46:21) Al: to the Gummy Bear song on repeat while breeding 512 frogs for 10 hours.
(0:46:24) Aislinn: What? Where is this? Oh my goodness. Yeah, you know what? I didn't look at the... I actually
(0:46:34) Aislinn: didn't look at the reviews. That is... Oh, I just found it. Oh my god, I just found it.
(0:46:39) Aislinn: For 10 hours. That's really good. That's really good. That's honestly low key how I feel.
(0:46:46) Aislinn: I wonder how I love this game so much, but then I look at it and I'm like, it's just
(0:46:54) Aislinn: makes this something. I still cannot to this day pinpoint exactly what it is about this
(0:46:58) Aislinn: game. I think it's definitely a multiple, multiple factor aspect of it. But just the
(0:47:04) Aislinn: overall experience of this game just makes me so happy every time I play it. And it is
(0:47:09) Aislinn: so... I think one of my favorite things about this game is just how when I'm in the wetland
(0:47:14) Aislinn: specifically and collecting the ingredients to be able to craft the things to be able
(0:47:18) Aislinn: to sell it. And while simultaneously doing that, grab
(0:47:24) Aislinn: being the insects from the ponds, grabbing the different types of frogs, whether it's
(0:47:28) Aislinn: taking a photo, feeding them, etc, etc. That entire process is so just head empty. That
(0:47:35) Aislinn: there's something about that that I just really, really, really love. And as you... So there
(0:47:38) Al: Yeah, yeah.
(0:47:40) Aislinn: actually there's another thing that I didn't mention as well, which looking at like my
(0:47:44) Aislinn: screenshots, I probably should mention. So also within each wetland, there is a bioscore
(0:47:52) Aislinn: that you have to meet.
(0:47:54) Aislinn: Um, and also a reputation level as well.
(0:47:58) Aislinn: Overall, which is like, there's like the reputation level is like your overall
(0:48:02) Aislinn: level and that unlocks as you continue through the game, more of the game.
(0:48:06) Aislinn: And then if I remember correctly, it also unlocks more varieties and frogs as well.
(0:48:12) Aislinn: Um, but then also the bio score, the more you increase that also within that
(0:48:19) Aislinn: specific wetland allows you to get more different varieties of frogs as well.
(0:48:24) Aislinn: And the way that you do that, oh, the way that you increase the reputation
(0:48:28) Aislinn: level is you craft, or one way to do it is you craft the, um, different, like,
(0:48:36) Aislinn: let's say you need 10 cups, you can craft 10 cups for what's called your,
(0:48:40) Aislinn: like, you also have a fan club in this game, which took me by surprise.
(0:48:44) Aislinn: When I first came across it, I was like, there are fan clubs, but there's fan
(0:48:48) Aislinn: clubs that are people that are a fan of your organization, Kamaeru.
(0:48:52) Aislinn: So you craft like those specific items.
(0:48:54) Aislinn: And that boosts your reputation as well as level as well, which is kind of like a sort
(0:48:58) Aislinn: of a different type of currency, which I think is kind of cool. It was just, it's just having a
(0:49:04) Aislinn: when I heard that there was a fan club, I was like, this is kind of weird. This is like reminding me
(0:49:09) Aislinn: of like, kpop idol culture. And I'm like, I don't know how I feel about that with like, frogs and
(0:49:16) Aislinn: wetlands, considering like what I know about like kpop idol culture, and like fans in kpop.
(0:49:24) Aislinn: And how terrifying it can get in general. So I'm like, they're just frogs, but like,
(0:49:30) Al: I don't - I mean, I don't think - I feel like maybe you're a little bit too influenced
(0:49:35) Al: by K-pop culture, like fan clubs - fan clubs have been around for, you know, decades, and
(0:49:43) Al: they're a thing that have existed for so many different things, and it doesn't have to be
(0:49:48) Al: weird. And it can be weird, and it has been weird for lots of other things, right? You
(0:49:55) Al: don't even you can you can go back you know as far as like the Beatles and
(0:50:00) Al: like their fans were very weird in many cases right and very obsessive and that
(0:50:06) Al: sort of level of obsession that you're talking about is obviously not great for
(0:50:10) Al: people individually and also not great societally I don't think but I I mean I
(0:50:19) Al: guess maybe it's the the emphasis on fan right like the word fan literally is
(0:50:24) Al: shortened version of fanatic right and that's obviously quite are quite heavy
(0:50:30) Al: so maybe that's the problem but like you know people are fans of lots of things
(0:50:34) Al: and don't get weird about it and the idea of there being a fan club for frog refuge
(0:50:41) Al: doesn't sound like a weird thing I mean maybe that's just what they call supporters
(0:50:46) Aislinn: yeah no that's yeah yeah no that's definitely definitely a if i'm gonna have if if I were to
(0:50:46) Al: you know like there are supporters groups for things like that all the time
(0:50:54) Aislinn: be able to uh what am I trying where am I trying to go with this if i'm gonna be yeah if i'm gonna
(0:50:56) Al: You want to you want to be a fan of a frog refuge is that.
(0:51:02) Aislinn: be a fan event have a fan club for anything a frog refuge is is a good a good place to to have one
(0:51:11) Al: I mean, I am a fan of anybody who's trying to improve biodiversity, right? My sister bought
(0:51:16) Aislinn: exactly
(0:51:18) Al: a new house and I went over there and her next door neighbor had a wild garden and a sign that
(0:51:23) Al: said that this is a wild garden, don't complain about it sort of thing. And I'm like, "Well,
(0:51:26) Al: I'm a fan of that person. You don't have to do a huge amount."
(0:51:27) Aislinn: Yeah, let's start up the fan club.
(0:51:34) Al: I mean, just in general, this is one of the things that we've been harping on quite a lot,
(0:51:39) Al: is that one of the
(0:51:41) Al: problems with, in particular, farming games, is that they are generally pretty capitalist.
(0:51:50) Al: If you take Stardew Valley, what is your aim? Your aim is to make all the money and
(0:51:55) Al: to build an empire. And yes, it is on the surface an anti-capitalist game, because it's
(0:52:00) Al: against an evil corporation. But you take down the evil corporation and then you kind
(0:52:07) Al: of become it yourself.
(0:52:10) Aislinn: see actually and this is totally okay by me I didn't know that that was the case like I i have
(0:52:15) Aislinn: I may have maybe like 10 hours maybe 15 hours at most in stardew so I didn't know that that's
(0:52:20) Aislinn: how the story progresses and that's actually I don't I don't care it's fine but
(0:52:22) Al: Well, it's a branching story. You can either take down or you can join the Evo Corporation.
(0:52:28) Aislinn: oh that's pretty cool but like yeah no I i that's actually a very good point that I never thought
(0:52:38) Aislinn: I thought about before with like farming game.
(0:52:40) Aislinn: I think in games in general, it is kind of innately capitalist in a way, and in Stardew, especially like seeing, seeing like gameplay here and there of like people playing it later on in the game and whatnot.
(0:52:54) Al: There's massive machines of a farm, yeah.
(0:52:54) Aislinn: Yeah, no, I definitely it's yeah, it is, it is actually an empire and I'm like, that is not Kameharu at all in a way it is, but it's like the empire quote unquote is the refuge.
(0:53:10) Aislinn: It's not necessarily it's just having funding to be able to support the refuge and support the diversity that these people that the characters in the game are trying to create.
(0:53:22) Aislinn: And I can that message I love it.
(0:53:22) Al: Yeah, well, that's the thing. They have to deal with money because they have to deal
(0:53:26) Al: with money. They live in a society that requires money for things like another society I know
(0:53:26) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:53:30) Aislinn: Yeah, yep.
(0:53:32) Al: of, right? So they have to have money because they need to do that. And it's not ideal,
(0:53:38) Al: but their purpose is not to get money. Their purpose is to run the frog refuge and they
(0:53:44) Aislinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, exactly. And I think, I think that is another reason, again, why I like this
(0:53:49) Aislinn: game so much is that there really is a focus on, again, the biodiversity and the restoration,
(0:53:57) Aislinn: the conservation aspect, which is so different from what I'm used to with just living in a society,
(0:54:06) Aislinn: A, and B, coming across the farming game, other farming games that I come across. And that might
(0:54:11) Aislinn: be why I'm like so maybe not burned out
(0:54:14) Aislinn: is the right word to use because I feel like I haven't played enough farming sims to really
(0:54:18) Aislinn: say that I'm burned out but maybe not necessarily super into a lot of farming sims or have a hard
(0:54:25) Aislinn: time getting into a lot of farming sims because I'm like I don't want to live in a world where I
(0:54:34) Aislinn: am still in like a capitalist society essentially because I'm already living that right now that is
(0:54:38) Aislinn: the life I currently live so being able to dive into the world of Kamaeru
(0:54:44) Aislinn: and live in a world that I would like to live in is another reason why I like this game so much
(0:54:53) Aislinn: and I did not see this conversation going here I feel like I'm having an existential crisis right
(0:54:58) Aislinn: now at my desk just being like huh so this is my ideal world I mean I already kind of knew it but
(0:55:05) Aislinn: I'm like that really makes sense why I like this game so much and I don't like a lot of other
(0:55:08) Aislinn: farming sims because I don't want to just live another version of my life that I currently live
(0:55:14) Al: Yeah. No, I mean, this is what this podcast does, right? Like talks about silly game about frogs
(0:55:15) Aislinn: Yes, yeah! This is like a therapy session now.
(0:55:22) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:55:24) Al: and then makes you delve into your deepest darkest fears about society and your place within it.
(0:55:26) Aislinn: Existential crisis.
(0:55:34) Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah, no, like, this is, like, this, this game is the, the, the kamaeru is the life that I want to live.
(0:55:41) Aislinn: if I could just drop everything and either
(0:55:44) Aislinn: have like a homestead or work at like a animal or environmental conservatory etc etc I would
(0:55:53) Aislinn: because that is what like primarily drive that is what is that is a driving force me that is
(0:55:58) Aislinn: something I do want to do one day is like have my own not necessarily farm but like have my own
(0:56:04) Aislinn: um space where I can grow plants take care of plants as many plants as I want and take care
(0:56:15) Aislinn: or take care of animals and give them an environment that is better than the one that
(0:56:20) Aislinn: they were previously in because I don't have the opportunity to right now but i'm trying to work
(0:56:24) Aislinn: towards in this capitalist society to get enough money to be able to do that
(0:56:29) Al: Yeah, you just got to make lots of money and then go do something with Cody so
(0:56:34) Aislinn: literally me and cody gotta team up we both need to make a lot of money and do that and then her
(0:56:42) Aislinn: Her and I can have our own, uh...
(0:56:44) Aislinn: ...coffee shop too. 'Cause that's something else I want to do.
(0:56:46) Al: Why not? Why not? I mean, I'm not a huge fan of coffee, so I wouldn't run a coffee shop, but
(0:56:48) Aislinn: Why not, right?
(0:56:53) Aislinn: We'll have tea, we'll have boba, we'll have the boba that you don't have access to.
(0:56:55) Al: I don't like tea either.
(0:57:00) Al: I haven't gone back to see if that shop actually is still open or not.
(0:57:02) Aislinn: Aww...
(0:57:04) Aislinn: It looks super close.
(0:57:06) Aislinn: [laughs] I'm not gonna lie.
(0:57:06) Al: It really does, but it was early on a Sunday, so I don't know.
(0:57:14) Al: it's fine i'm going i'm going over to the isle of man soon and
(0:57:16) Al: if any place has fewer boba places than where I live it's it's there
(0:57:22) Aislinn: Wonderful!
(0:57:28) Al: not the most diverse of places shall we say
(0:57:32) Al: all right cool well do you have any any other thoughts on this before we wrap up
(0:57:36) Aislinn: Um...
(0:57:38) Aislinn: I'm looking at the screenshots
(0:57:40) Aislinn: just to get some additional thoughts
(0:57:42) Aislinn: but like, yeah, overall
(0:57:44) Aislinn: I guess just final thoughts
(0:57:46) Aislinn: in general. This is
(0:57:48) Aislinn: This is a personally, like, a game that, again...
(0:57:50) Aislinn: Clearly, I like very much so, um, in the sense that I've now realized that I can really relate to it in the sense that this is my, like, ideal world, and that's why I like it so much.
(0:58:02) Aislinn: So it really rings true to me, um, but even if you don't want to have, like, your own refuge farm or anything, I do think that this is a nice game to pick up and put down.
(0:58:17) Aislinn: If you want to play it for just a second, this would be good also as a mobile.
(0:58:20) Aislinn: To be able to just pick it up for a little bit, put it down for a little bit, pick it up for a little bit, put it down for a little bit, or if you want to sit for hours and just collect frogs, throw on a podcast.
(0:58:32) Aislinn: Although I do like the music in this game as well, some of the music in this game got stuck in my head for quite a while, so for me, the soundtrack is really, really nice, but if you want to pick up this game, throw on a podcast, throw on this podcast specifically.
(0:58:46) Al: Pause this podcast. Go buy the gate. Well, it's a bit late to pause it now because we've
(0:58:47) Aislinn: Um.
(0:58:52) Al: probably only got a minute left. Go back in time. You know, we don't have to repeat it,
(0:58:56) Aislinn: Well, in theory, pause this podcast and go buy the game.
(0:59:00) Aislinn: And then come back and listen to this podcast, and we'll repeat it all back for
(0:59:03) Aislinn: you so you can listen to it all again as you play this wonderful game.
(0:59:07) Aislinn: [LAUGH] But in all serious, but what's the fun in that, let's repeat it all.
(0:59:11) Al: that you can just rewind.
(0:59:15) Aislinn: [LAUGH] We've got all, now we've got all time in the world, sleep, who needs sleep?
(0:59:16) Al: No, I want to go to bed.
(0:59:20) Al: It's half nine.
(0:59:21) Aislinn: You only need frogs.
(0:59:22) Aislinn: You only need little guys, that's all you need.
(0:59:24) Aislinn: [LAUGH] You don't need to sleep.
(0:59:26) Al: I have little guys, that's the problem.
(0:59:28) Al: They're tiring, different kind of little guy.
(0:59:32) Aislinn: A different kind of, it's not the cute little guy.
(0:59:34) Aislinn: [LAUGH] I was gonna say still probably still cute though, but
(0:59:36) Al: Oh, I don't know, they're pretty cute.
(0:59:40) Aislinn: it's not a frog little guy.
(0:59:41) Al: Not green, not green, and they don't ribbit.
(0:59:42) Aislinn: It's like a, not cray.
(0:59:44) Al: They do, they do hop.
(0:59:46) Al: But they don't ribbit.
(0:59:47) Aislinn: Do they stand proudly on top of a slide?
(0:59:50) Al: Oh yes, all the time.
(0:59:51) Aislinn: [LAUGH] That's very cute.
(0:59:55) Aislinn: But no, wrapping up this game in general, if you like decorating, I think this is cute.
(1:00:03) Aislinn: I will say it's a little bit limited, it's no like, the variety of furniture is good.
(1:00:07) Aislinn: But it's like, in comparison to other decorating games,
(1:00:10) Aislinn: it's not as expansive because definitely the focus is on the frogs themselves.
(1:00:14) Aislinn: But if you like collecting, the Frogadex is really cute, the breeding is fine.
(1:00:20) Aislinn: I wouldn't say it's anything outstanding, it's fine.
(1:00:23) Aislinn: The minigames are fun, yeah, it's nice to have, it's cute.
(1:00:23) Al: It's nice to have.
(1:00:28) Aislinn: Overall the game is cute, and it's not, I wouldn't say it's a game that's going to
(1:00:34) Aislinn: floor you, because it's a Cozing Farming Sim.
(1:00:40) Aislinn: I don't know, I don't, is there any Cozing Farming Sim out there that
(1:00:44) Aislinn: absolutely floored someone?
(1:00:46) Aislinn: You would know better than me.
(1:00:48) Al: in terms of like wow this is amazing like what are you I don't I mean I mean I
(1:00:51) Aislinn: This is life changing, I am currently walking away from Spider-Man being like,
(1:00:56) Aislinn: this is life changing, this has impacted me.
(1:01:00) Al: would say that stardew was life-changing for me like my I mean this is gonna get
(1:01:06) Al: deep if we're if I keep talking about that
(1:01:08) Aislinn: I mean, I can see that. From what I know about Stardew, yeah, I could see that. I could definitely see that.
(1:01:17) Aislinn: And I don't think this game would necessarily impact you in the sense of how Stardew may for some folks,
(1:01:24) Aislinn: but I think the impact that it does leave with the message of restoration and just taking care of the environment around you,
(1:01:35) Aislinn: I think in that aspect, this
(1:01:38) Aislinn: definitely leaves a strong impact on me personally, but it's not like story-wise
(1:01:44) Aislinn: like absolutely like I'm crying because I'm so happy crying because, well no I'm
(1:01:48) Aislinn: crying because I'm happy, I'm crying because I'm sad or like something like
(1:01:53) Aislinn: that it's not it's not that type of game it's definitely like a very nice game to
(1:01:58) Aislinn: just sit down and relax too and kind of be in a different world for a little bit
(1:02:04) Aislinn: that's not the life that I currently live so that would be it's got a little
(1:02:06) Al: And it's got little guys.
(1:02:09) Aislinn: Is that gonna be the title of this this podcast? Just little guys, because they're all
(1:02:12) Al: Just, just a little guy.
(1:02:15) Aislinn: just little guys and all the frogs are just little guys you can pet the you could
(1:02:18) Aislinn: pet the frogs also you could pet the dog so that's also a fun little feature
(1:02:23) Aislinn: that I also love and then you could you could pet the little guys. Well guys
