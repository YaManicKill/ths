# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Al.
(0:00:37) Kev: My name is Kevin certified scuba diver and we're not calling them farmers anymore. We're
(0:00:43) Kev: I don't know. Well, there's a few different things sushi shots divers
(0:00:48) Al: Oh yes! Hello Divers! And welcome to another episode of The Diving Season. My name is Al.
(0:00:59) Kev: My name is Kevin, and we're-- more specifically,
(0:01:01) Al: And we're here today to talk about Diving Games. Depends on the level of his equipment.
(0:01:06) Kev: "Dave the Diver, can he fish it?
(0:01:10) Kev: Dave the Diver, yes, he can!"
(0:01:17) Kev: There it does.
(0:01:21) Kev: I still haven't caught one of those spider crabs.
(0:01:24) Kev: Hello, everyone.
(0:01:24) Al: Ah do you know how do you know how to do them?
(0:01:25) Kev: Welcome.
(0:01:27) Kev: I'm assuming it's the steel trap.
(0:01:29) Kev: You know, the little sensor traps or whatever, but--
(0:01:31) Al: It's not. You're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna
(0:01:32) Kev: Oh, well, don't tell me then.
(0:01:33) Kev: I'll figure it out.
(0:01:35) Al: kick yourself when you find out what it is.
(0:01:36) Kev: I bet it's a--
(0:01:38) Kev: it's going to be the baseball bat.
(0:01:40) Kev: What if it's the hammer?
(0:01:41) Kev: Oh, it's a squeaky hammer, isn't it?
(0:01:44) Kev: We'll see.
(0:01:44) Al: you know, yeah. Let me know how you feel once you figure out, because yeah, I was like,
(0:01:51) Kev: Okay.
(0:01:52) Al: I can't, I was like, I cannot believe I didn't think about this. This is, this is ridiculous
(0:01:56) Al: that it took me this long to figure out. So yes, first of all, before we get into it,
(0:02:01) Al: transcripts are available in the show notes and on the website. Welcome to the first episode
(0:02:06) Al: of Dave the Diver Month. This is the month every year where I go on holiday and I can't
(0:02:13) Al: bothered recording and editing while
(0:02:14) Al: I'm away. So, we pre-record a bunch of episodes. Last year was fishing month and this year
(0:02:23) Al: for some reason we decided to do Dave the Diver month. Wooo! So yeah, we're doing...
(0:02:26) Kev: we're going deeper it ties into its shark week you know month would have
(0:02:31) Kev: parked that net so I actually I don't I don't know is that you guys like I don't
(0:02:37) Al: I am aware of Shark Week. We don't get it, but it is referenced in enough American material
(0:02:37) Kev: okay okay yeah okay okay so so just a side note about that I always find
(0:02:43) Al: that I am awake.
(0:02:44) Al: I am here for what it is.
(0:02:51) Kev: amusing. So Shark Week is done by Discovery Channel which
(0:02:56) Kev: is, I don't know what network, but not Disney Network, and this is important.
(0:03:02) Al: They were independent, but they merged with Paramount, I think.
(0:03:10) Kev: Yeah, is it I don't know cuz they're on I
(0:03:12) Al: It's Paramount Discovery. Or is it CBS? It's one of the two of them.
(0:03:14) Kev: Can't I don't remember but either way the key thing is it's not Disney and I bring it up because couple years back
(0:03:22) Kev: Disney's saw all the shark week money they were making presumably or whatever and so they said we're gonna do our own version
(0:03:29) Kev: And we're gonna call it shark fest except it's gonna be a whole month and every year they try hyping up shark fest
(0:03:36) Kev: but it's it's just
(0:03:36) Al: I've just googled it. Of course, it's Warner Brothers. It's Warner Brothers, not Paramount
(0:03:37) Kev: It's clear what they're doing and it's just
(0:03:40) Kev: Laffable and impediable. Anyways, but welcome to our dive Dave fest. Hello areas
(0:03:52) Kev: Yeah, that's what I thought cuz I'm pretty sure is on max I see the max commercial
(0:03:52) Al: or it's Warner Brothers. I don't know why you didn't say that then. You're like, "Oh,
(0:03:56) Al: I thought it, but I didn't say it." Just assume I'm wrong.
(0:03:58) Kev: Because I can't remember who owns max isn't that is Warner Brothers, right? Yeah, cuz they do with the cartoon. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
(0:04:04) Kev: Okay. Well, there you go
(0:04:06) Al: The company is now called Warner Brothers Discovery. HBO is part of that as well.
(0:04:08) Kev: Now there you go
(0:04:11) Kev: Don't you love how everything's just merging into
(0:04:17) Kev: Conglomerate it's horrifying blob
(0:04:22) Al: So anyway, as I mentioned, this is Dave the Diver Month.
(0:04:26) Kev: So yeah, somehow we figured out a whole month.
(0:04:29) Al: We've gone back to our roots, gone back to our roots,
(0:04:32) Al: because I went I've been going back and like backfilling.
(0:04:36) Al: We changed our show notes to Notion a couple of years ago and I
(0:04:41) Al: I didn't backfill all the old episodes, so it was just like missing.
(0:04:45) Al: So you could go back to the the I think the end of 2022 was the first episode
(0:04:52) Al: in Notion, so I decided that I needed this list, right?
(0:04:57) Al: Because it's a nice list that I can easily like filter through and see what
(0:05:01) Al: episodes people have been on, see that Kevin has been on the second most
(0:05:04) Al: episodes of anyone, second only to me.
(0:05:06) Kev: here to defend my title.
(0:05:11) Al: But it meant that I went back and looked at every single title that we've done
(0:05:15) Al: because I had to type them all in.
(0:05:17) Al: And yeah, my word, the first, the first 10.
(0:05:22) Al: 10 episodes, we cover a total of three games.
(0:05:27) Kev: Why hopes to think about this in hindsight?
(0:05:29) Al: We have the I know we have the introduction
(0:05:32) Al: episode and then we have three Stardew episodes.
(0:05:35) Al: Granted, one of them is the challenge, which we haven't done in a while.
(0:05:37) Al: We should do a challenge episode again.
(0:05:40) Al: And then we did five episodes on trio of towns.
(0:05:46) Kev: Well, there's three towns. So, you know, the five have wow
(0:05:52) Al: Introduction to it, one about the story, one about the mechanics, one about the
(0:05:57) Al: calendar, we specifically talk, we specifically talked about the calendar
(0:06:02) Al: in its own episode, which I think was I think we're talking about like the
(0:06:06) Al: festivals and stuff like that, basically.
(0:06:10) Al: And then and then we had a challenge episode.
(0:06:12) Al: And in the middle of that, we had this
(0:06:14) Al: random episode on factory town because that was the the first time I managed to
(0:06:18) Al: get a free code for something and I was like, oh, we must do this now.
(0:06:18) Kev: Duh
(0:06:23) Al: So, yeah, there we go.
(0:06:25) Al: So we're going back to our roots and having a whole month on one game.
(0:06:30) Al: We'll we'll see how that goes.
(0:06:32) Al: This episode, we're going to talk about the game as a whole
(0:06:35) Al: pre the DLCs.
(0:06:37) Al: So the DLCs we will cover in a different
(0:06:40) Al: episode and we're not going to cover the story in too much detail.
(0:06:44) Al: We will touch on it in some amount, but like Kevin's only two chapters in.
(0:06:48) Al: I have finished the game, but yeah, we're gonna leave that to run out.
(0:06:52) Al: Another episode. So we're not going to talk about the two DLCs, the Dredge DLC, the Godzilla
(0:06:58) Al: DLC, or the kind of more details and the ending of the story. Yeah. Dave the Diver Month, whoo!
(0:07:08) Kev: All right well before that I guess well we're not we're not really doing news we don't do news right on these
(0:07:15) Al: We have no news. We have no news because we're recording this, what, three weeks in advance?
(0:07:20) Kev: Yeah
(0:07:22) Al: So there's no news. I mean, there's probably news, but you'll hear about it in another
(0:07:25) Al: three weeks' time. I think you know that's not going to happen.
(0:07:25) Kev: Which means haunted chocolatier will have the stealth drop when this episode drops
(0:07:37) Al: Concerned Ape doesn't do stealth drops. He knows the hype is good, which it's not coming
(0:07:43) Al: out this year, but even if it did...
(0:07:45) Al: like, he will announce it at least two months beforehand.
(0:07:48) Kev: Fair enough, um, a lot of gave the diver, to be honest, I really, really like this game.
(0:07:51) Al: But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:07:59) Kev: It's a great game, um, I guess as a side note, I think I said earlier, but I am actually
(0:08:08) Kev: a certified scuba diver, I haven't been in years, but my dad was a scuba diver and as
(0:08:10) Al: Oh, that's fun.
(0:08:14) Kev: I grew up by the ocean.
(0:08:21) Kev: myself, and so yeah, I appreciate this very much so. But yeah, David the Diver, well welcome
(0:08:29) Kev: to that. Aside from that, a lot of my usual Marvel Snap, the Deadpool season has started,
(0:08:36) Kev: I'm excited, there's going to be a ridiculous amount of good cards this season. And yeah,
(0:08:40) Al: Yes, the film will be out as well by the time there's episode-
(0:08:43) Kev: Yeah, yeah that is, I am.
(0:08:49) Al: I feel like this is the one that's going to drag a bunch of people back that haven't
(0:08:52) Al: been interested in Marvel films for a while.
(0:08:54) Kev: Yeah, I mean, we could do, maybe we will do a whole episode on this, but like with X-Men '97 and Deadpool and Wolverine, I feel like, you know, that this is going to be a jectary setter for Marvel.
(0:09:11) Kev: Anyways, yeah, I'm excited for that. So yeah, Marvel Snap is good. I don't know how it is for new players or returning players, but as someone who's kept up with it, I think it's in a really good place.
(0:09:23) Kev: Um, I sorry.
(0:09:24) Kev: Aside from that, uh, a lot of my usual- yeah there's a lot of my usuals Pokemon Unite.
(0:09:32) Kev: Um, and of course, uh, the Mario is life never ends, um, you know, by the time this episode drops, I'm sure other stuff will have been out, but, uh, at the time of recording, I tried Super Mario Kart, the- the OG, for the SNES.
(0:09:48) Kev: Uh, that was an interesting experience to see, um, it wasn't a bad game, like-
(0:09:56) Kev: Harvest Moon was SNES, wasn't it? Like the original Harvest Moon was SNES? Yeah, it was much better than the original Harvest Moon.
(0:09:58) Al: - Yeah, yeah it was.
(0:10:02) Kev: Um, but, uh, but yeah, that was fun, and, uh, and hey, most importantly over at Rainbow Road Radio, we have hit one year, yay!
(0:10:12) Al: So, if you haven't listened to that podcast yet, go listen to it. They did a good, they
(0:10:12) Kev: Uh, yo, it's a little-
(0:10:17) Al: did a good episode with Nadia on the, what's it called? Mario Kart. That one was called
(0:10:26) Al: Super Mario Kart, right? Or was it just Mario Kart? That was Super Mario Kart. Everything
(0:10:26) Kev: Yeah, that was called. It was a Super Mario Kart, yeah.
(0:10:30) Al: was super because it was on the SNES. The game by Advance, everything was advanced.
(0:10:32) Kev: Yeah, that's correct. Just like the DS had DS abbreviations or name.
(0:10:41) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's a good one.
(0:10:45) Kev: I need that back. Give us a good one for Switch 2.
(0:10:48) Kev: Oh, I didn't even know.
(0:10:48) Al: Well this is this is why I don't think they'll go for super or advanced like some people
(0:10:54) Al: are suggesting. I think they'll want to have a unique one so that you can clearly, you
(0:10:59) Al: know, make a differentiation between them. And I definitely do not think it's going to
(0:11:02) Kev: yeah
(0:11:04) Al: be two. I just that's I don't think it's going to be.
(0:11:07) Kev: well of course not they've the only one they ever used was 64 and that was
(0:11:11) Kev: because of the technical 64
(0:11:14) Al: Well, exactly. There's always a reason why they're doing them, and they always try and
(0:11:14) Kev: right
(0:11:17) Al: make it a unique thing, right? Like, there's not been one. No, but that was unique as well.
(0:11:18) Kev: yeah
(0:11:20) Kev: except we you
(0:11:24) Al: Right? Because, like, yes, sometimes they take, like, sometimes it's based on a previous
(0:11:30) Al: one, so they take the name and then they add something to it. But the thing they add to
(0:11:34) Al: it is always new. You've got the 3DS, you've got the DSi, you've got the Wii U, you've
(0:11:39) Al: got the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. They all add a different thing to it. They've
(0:11:40) Kev: OK. OK, yeah, you're right.
(0:11:44) Al: never duplicated that. Game Boy Advance. Oh yeah, I'm not saying the game's... I'm not
(0:11:48) Kev: I make I yeah, I make the jokes about the bad names, but
(0:11:53) Kev: hopefully it'll be better than new switch.
(0:11:56) Al: saying the games are good. The names are good, for the record. But they are unique. People
(0:11:57) Kev: Yes, yeah, but they are different.
(0:12:01) Kev: You're right, they don't reuse things
(0:12:04) Kev: as much as Nintendo loves to call back their games,
(0:12:06) Kev: I guess with their systems, they really don't call back, do they?
(0:12:08) Kev: - Nah.
(0:12:09) Kev: Um, no.
(0:12:10) Kev: Yeah, but, uh, yeah, so anyways, yeah, go check that it go ahead.
(0:12:14) Al: I think the only Nintendo thing that will be out between our recording and the episode coming out
(0:12:22) Al: is the World Championships game. That's the only thing coming out in July or August.
(0:12:26) Kev: I think I mentioned this on the cycle we chatted, but you remember like two years ago we talked
(0:12:36) Kev: about one of the directs and said it felt like one of the final directs for the switch.
(0:12:38) Al: I think it was two years ago that we said that classic
(0:12:43) Kev: We still got another year, at least, to ring out of this bad boy.
(0:12:49) Kev: Good times.
(0:12:50) Kev: So yeah, go check out Rainbow Road Radio.
(0:12:58) Al: Yeah, I mean, games-wise, I'm not going to really talk about it right, because it's all the same
(0:13:02) Al: stuff I've been talking for. Well, as I'm recording, I've said the same stuff for like three episodes
(0:13:08) Al: long, and I'm probably going to do another two episodes where I've not really played anything
(0:13:12) Al: new, because I've been playing the same three games for the podcast. I feel like I've been
(0:13:17) Al: playing Day of the Diver now for about a month, which is a good thing for the record. We'll get
(0:13:22) Kev: Yep, not forcibly not at gunpoint
(0:13:23) Al: to that. But spoiler alert, this is a good game. Absolutely not. I'm so glad.
(0:13:28) Al: This game was good because can you imagine us covering four episodes on a game that none of us
(0:13:33) Al: liked? Oh boy. But there is one thing that I just finished that probably this is the best episode to
(0:13:35) Kev: Hey, I mean Steve's managed to get how many years out of
(0:13:46) Al: talk on because I've got you Kevin and that is the Gotham Knights TV show. So I bet you haven't
(0:13:50) Kev: I am not but I'm aware how it was the show Batman show before Batman but then
(0:13:54) Al: watch this have you?
(0:13:58) Al: So let me say listeners, if you don't want spoilers for the Gotham Knights TV show,
(0:14:01) Kev: said okay but we're gonna add Batman though anyway
(0:14:12) Al: which was a CW/DC show that aired two years ago or something and cancelled after one season,
(0:14:20) Al: then skip to the main topic, because this will be all I'm talking about for the rest of this
(0:14:26) Al: section but I would.
(0:14:28) Al: I will probably spoil some things because I don't think you can truly have a conversation
(0:14:32) Al: about this without spoiling some ridiculous things about this show.
(0:14:36) Al: So the premise of this show is Batman is murdered and people there are.
(0:14:43) Kev: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Batman's Murder? Wait, what show is this? This isn't the pre-Batman show?
(0:14:49) Al: This is not pre Batman, no, this is post Batman.
(0:14:52) Kev: What, what's it called again? One more time?
(0:14:54) Al: Gotham Knights.
(0:14:55) Kev: Oh, Gotham Knights! I thought you said Gotham, 'cause there's a show called...
(0:14:58) Al: No, not Gotham. Gotham was, Gotham was good. Yeah, no, that was good. This was,
(0:15:01) Kev: Okay.
(0:15:02) Al: that was like four seasons long or something like that. Yeah, with a K. So the Knights have got that,
(0:15:04) Kev: Okay, wait, is this Gotham Knights with a K or an okay?
(0:15:09) Kev: Okay.
(0:15:12) Al: you know, like the, you're the classic, everybody knows who the Gotham Knights are,
(0:15:16) Al: and none of them are in this show. So, but yeah, so this is, well, do you want me not to talk about
(0:15:20) Kev: Okay, so Batman's murdered. Okay, I've missed this completely.
(0:15:24) Kev: Okay.
(0:15:27) Kev: No, no, I want to know. I don't know when I'll check it out.
(0:15:28) Al: it then? Are you, do you care about what? No, that's fine. So Batman is, Batman is murdered,
(0:15:30) Kev: I'm good for all the spoilers. To do tell.
(0:15:38) Al: and four teenagers are framed for his murder, and those teenagers include Batman's adopted son.
(0:15:47) Al: Now, this is an adopted son that doesn't exist in the comics.
(0:15:50) Kev: I'll say I'm looking at the Wikipedia and hit the sun's name is not blue which means there's no article
(0:15:58) Al: Yeah, yeah. So he doesn't, this is the only place that he exists in anything,
(0:16:04) Al: because basically they didn't have the rights to any existing Robin, so they decided not to do a
(0:16:10) Al: Robin. And I will say the interesting thing about that is that he is, he doesn't know that Bruce
(0:16:15) Al: Wayne is Batman, and he's never trained up as a Robin. So that is a little bit different and
(0:16:20) Al: interesting that they do, but just an actual son, he's adopted because, well, it turns out for,
(0:16:21) Kev: So just an actual son, not a child laborer.
(0:16:28) Al: spoilers here, it turns out that Batman killed his parents, so that's why he was adopted by him.
(0:16:32) Kev: Oh, what? What?
(0:16:34) Al: But another, another one of the teenagers that is framed for killing Batman is the daughter of the
(0:16:42) Al: Joker, except, except in the, in the last episode, we find out that she's not actually the daughter
(0:16:43) Kev: I feel like this should be a greenhouse, I have so many questions!
(0:16:56) Al: of the Joker.
(0:16:58) Al: She's actually the daughter of Harvey Dent, because Harvey Dent has a disassociative identity
(0:17:00) Kev: Okay.
(0:17:02) Kev: Help!
(0:17:02) Kev: _sadly_ HOOO!
(0:17:08) Al: disorder, and his other identity was the one that was in a relationship with Duella, his
(0:17:17) Al: character's mother, and so he didn't know that she existed because he obviously then
(0:17:22) Al: goes back to his other personality and has no idea that this has happened.
(0:17:28) Al: Due characters are random people, they're just kind of like low-level criminal brother
(0:17:35) Al: and sister, and then they're also randomly throwing a girl who happens to be a Robin,
(0:17:43) Al: and she's actually Batman sidekick, but she kind of forced her way into the role, like
(0:17:49) Al: he didn't want her sort of thing, so that is vaguely interesting, but yeah, this follows
(0:17:54) Al: the four of them and one of
(0:17:58) Al: Turner, whose Bruce Wayne's adopted son, find them trying to out the real killers, who is
(0:18:05) Al: the Court of Owls. For those who don't know, they're like a standard secretive society
(0:18:12) Al: that exists in the DC Comics. Exactly. And Harvey Dent is a district attorney. Is that
(0:18:12) Kev: Yup, you're Illuminati.
(0:18:23) Al: the term. Running to be mayor.
(0:18:28) Al: And this is like pre him being Two-Face, and he like becomes Two-Face in the last
(0:18:32) Kev: Okay.
(0:18:36) Al: five seconds of the show sort of thing. Right before, exactly right before they're cancelled.
(0:18:38) Kev: Of course, right before they're cancelled. Good times. Good times!
(0:18:44) Al: So this, I'm not gonna say this show is bad because like it's, I actually think that as a show,
(0:18:51) Al: it's not bad. I think it was actually vaguely enjoyable. Like if you have very limited time
(0:18:58) Al: to watch TV, there are probably plenty of things that are better that you would want to watch, but
(0:19:03) Al: I did enjoy it. I do not know why on earth this is a DC show. The only characters that exist are
(0:19:13) Al: Harvey Dent and well, Bruce Wayne, but he's dead, right? Like he only exists to create the story.
(0:19:14) Kev: Mm hmm. Yeah.
(0:19:22) Al: And basically everybody else is a made up character. They've got the court of owls,
(0:19:26) Kev: I'm I'm I'm so like dwella or dwella whatever her name is that she's
(0:19:26) Al: but like.
(0:19:28) Al: Oh, is she?
(0:19:31) Kev: apparently an existing character and and the Harper the bluebird she goes by
(0:19:37) Kev: bluebird in the comic and other apparently existing characters and
(0:19:40) Al: OK, it just like I don't.
(0:19:40) Kev: cullenra I don't know what obscure though they are very obscure I don't I
(0:19:44) Al: They're very obscure and it's not really like any of that affects the story, right?
(0:19:44) Kev: don't know them
(0:19:49) Al: They could do they could absolutely have and I think it actually would have been
(0:19:52) Al: a more enjoyable thing if it wasn't so tied into the DC universe and it was just like
(0:19:58) Al: like as a teen a teen mystery kind of crime show, I think it would actually be quite enjoyable,
(0:20:00) Kev: The mystery show mm-hmm
(0:20:06) Kev: Sure
(0:20:09) Al: but then it then oh look it's Batman, you know, and it's like just feels a bit weird,
(0:20:15) Al: but yeah, it was it was it was fine. Yeah.
(0:20:15) Kev: Okay
(0:20:21) Kev: Okay, that's that this is fascinating that's a shame it got canceled because this is this is a wild description everything you said
(0:20:30) Al: Yeah, I'm very intrigued as to where they were planning on taking it. There's a whole
(0:20:34) Al: but the standard like here are 10 things that happen in the last episode that are all setting
(0:20:40) Al: up the second series. And yeah, I'm intrigued as to where they were going with that.
(0:20:46) Kev: Yeah, I mean yeah, there's there's a lot to unpack there. Um, well
(0:20:51) Al: I also feel like it would have been better fully self-contained like if they hadn't shoved
(0:20:55) Al: all that stuff in at the end, like they didn't have Harvey Dent turning into Two-Face.
(0:21:00) Al: And they didn't have Turner Hayes being kidnapped and everybody thinking he was murdered and taken
(0:21:06) Al: to, I think it was Raj Al Ghul at the end, or maybe it was someone else. He said that he
(0:21:13) Al: trained Batman, so I'm assuming he's meant to be Raj Al Ghul, but they don't actually say for certain,
(0:21:18) Al: so I'm not sure. But it's all there.
(0:21:21) Kev: Oh, good times, good times (laughs)
(0:21:28) Al: So, yeah, it was it was a thing. And that was what so I've now almost caught up with
(0:21:33) Al: the DC shows. I have season three of Stargirl to watch. And then I think that's the live
(0:21:38) Al: action that is. Obviously, I've got a lot of animated stuff still to go. But that'll
(0:21:42) Al: be me caught up with the live action DC shows. I have plumbed every, every possible corner
(0:21:50) Al: of the shows to figure out what is good and what is not. And there we go. And I'm not
(0:21:58) Al: with that information.
(0:22:00) Kev: Oh, you're- you're- you're- I think you're a stronger man than me to going through all this. This is wild. Wild stuff.
(0:22:06) Al: This is this is not the worst DC show I've seen by far, like.
(0:22:10) Kev: Oh, I'm sure. Yeah, no, it-
(0:22:12) Kev: No, I'm just- I'm just saying, this- you're going to all the corners, like, that's- that's a lot. But yeah, no, I'm sure there's much, much worse, um, I can't think of any, but I know. _laughs_
(0:22:22) Al: So now I get to, now I get to treat myself by going back and watching the good animated
(0:22:26) Kev: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, dang, that's- that's fascinating.
(0:22:27) Al: shows now, so. There is that. Have you been watching the new Superman one?
(0:22:32) Kev: Uh, no, but I watch- well, okay, I've not watched a show, but I've watched a lot of it, uh, through- where? Let's say that. _laughs_
(0:22:33) Al: Oh
(0:22:42) Kev: Um, it's- it- it's- it's fascinating. They- like, I mean, first of all, they're updating all the characters to give 'em a little more flavor, like, you know, everyone's not white anymore.
(0:22:44) Al: It's really good, I'm really enjoying it.
(0:22:52) Al: Yeah
(0:22:54) Kev: Um. _laughs_
(0:22:57) Al: What
(0:22:59) Al: They did that in they did that in the the arrow verse as well like
(0:23:03) Al: Jimmy Jimmy was was instead of like a small white
(0:23:08) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:23:08) Al: Wimpy guy. He was a big black buff dude
(0:23:12) Kev: Yeah, that's awesome, that's dope
(0:23:14) Al: Yeah, I like how different you know just completely different
(0:23:17) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I like that. Um, yeah
(0:23:20) Al: He was he was not a traditional narrative you just
(0:23:22) Al: big guy who liked taking photos they turn it they turn him into a superhero as well by the end of it
(0:23:24) Kev: Yeah, oh that's that's great I love that cuz
(0:23:29) Kev: Of course because yeah
(0:23:31) Al: not with powers but like he's he's literally just uh he he puts on a suit and he goes and beats
(0:23:36) Al: people up with a shield yeah yeah this is what I love the most about comic book stories right
(0:23:38) Kev: I mean, hey, Batman, right, like...
(0:23:41) Kev: Um...
(0:23:42) Kev: But yeah, no, like, Jimmy Olsen's the most nothing ever, so you can turn him into whatever, and it's fine.
(0:23:53) Al: what you can do is you can you you have like a basis to build on and then you can do different
(0:23:59) Al: things with them and like I really love without spoilers I really love what they're doing with
(0:24:03) Al: like kara um in this in this season it's it's really different and yeah so I i just I love when
(0:24:11) Al: they take existing characters and say but what if we do it differently
(0:24:14) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I like I like her a lot from the the new show. I've seen her lots lots of cool moments and her character and arc and stuffs
(0:24:25) Kev: Yeah, and boy do they like their anime cuz there's a lot anime references abound in that one
(0:24:32) Kev: Yeah, good stuff
(0:24:34) Kev: Yeah, yeah, um
(0:24:36) Al: And we got the new Batman one coming as well
(0:24:38) Kev: There's another Batman oh my gosh, I haven't kept up with this I'm looking
(0:24:42) Al: No, but this is this this one looks good this one looks good is being touted as the spiritual successor to the Batman the animated series
(0:24:49) Kev: Ohh, don't sell yourself like that!
(0:24:52) Kev: Umm, that's... that's our... that's just setting yourself up to fail.
(0:24:57) Kev: Um, that's... here's the thing though, like, a lot of the...
(0:25:01) Kev: Batman shows I think are pretty good, or the cart to animated ones.
(0:25:04) Kev: Regardless of what they look like, or what they are.
(0:25:08) Kev: Um, but yeah, uh...
(0:25:11) Kev: Oh, shoot! Oh, it's Bruce Timm! Okay, maybe it is a bit better than...
(0:25:14) Kev: Bruce Timm's actually on it.
(0:25:16) Al: ...Caped Crusader, that sort of thing.
(0:25:16) Kev: Yeah. Oh, okay, maybe.
(0:25:19) Kev: Oh, I didn't know Bruce Jim was on it, nevermind. Maybe, maybe.
(0:25:22) Kev: We'll give it a shot.
(0:25:24) Al: And there's the new Cape Man series coming soon as well.
(0:25:26) Kev: Oh my gosh, I saw that.
(0:25:30) Kev: One thing I saw on Twitter is a tweet that said that how Kipeman got a series before Wonder Woman did.
(0:25:36) Al: I love I presume you've seen the Harley Quinn series.
(0:25:37) Kev: Good times.
(0:25:40) Kev: I've seen, again, bits and parts of it. Yeah.
(0:25:44) Al: I just it's really good and I love the idea of having a spinoff Kite Man series is just
(0:25:50) Al: perfectly in character for that whole show. Like of course, of course that's the first
(0:25:52) Kev: The tone yeah
(0:25:57) Al: spinoff they would do from that. Like why wouldn't they? Like it would just the most
(0:25:57) Kev: Yeah
(0:26:00) Al: ridiculous idea.
(0:26:01) Kev: Yeah, absolutely
(0:26:05) Kev: So the Aquaman do you see wasn't that
(0:26:06) Al: I am half expecting them to announce a third DLC for this game, you know just after we
(0:26:14) Kev: I abs- right?
(0:26:16) Al: finish the episodes.
(0:26:18) Kev: I mean, yeah, like, absolutely cuz
(0:26:22) Kev: Reg made sense
(0:26:25) Kev: Godzilla was a huge get, holy moly, um, and I- I expect
(0:26:34) Al: They did announce a new collaboration, but it's not in their game. It's their game in
(0:26:40) Al: something else. Let me find what it was. Because they announced it like three days ago as we're
(0:26:45) Al: recording, and Kelly was like, "Oh, there's a new DLC!" and we looked at it and went,
(0:26:49) Al: "No, wait, that's not a DLC in Dave the Diver. Nikkei? N-I-K-K-E? Goddess of victory?"
(0:26:51) Kev: Can we get...
(0:26:54) Kev: Nie-J! Wait, Jason's like, "What?! What?!"
(0:26:58) Al: Okay, so they have, and I'm not kidding, this is not a joke, they have recreated
(0:27:04) Al: the Dave the Diver game inside the Nikkei game.
(0:27:10) Kev: Is that how it works because I was very good. Okay. Oh my god. Okay. Are you for new kid at all?
(0:27:18) Kev: Okay, so I am somewhat familiar Nick gave the premise of I've never put I haven't played it myself but um
(0:27:24) Kev: So it is a gotcha shooter. I guess I'm like over-the-shoulder third-person like XCOM style shooter
(0:27:32) Kev: It's a mobile game. I believe I believe it's actually quite good for when I hear the gameplay is actually quite good. Um,
(0:27:38) Kev: but it
(0:27:40) Kev: It okay, so it's a gotcha game, and of course you're pulling your different shooters and whatnot, but
(0:27:47) Kev: Here's here's the kicker. Here's the sauce
(0:27:52) Kev: The characters are all anime girls, and you know what comes with that
(0:27:56) Al: Yeah, I can tell from the images that I'm seeing on the Dave the Diver collaboration.
(0:28:00) Kev: Yeah, yeah, so to hear Dave the diver go to that was wild
(0:28:09) Al: So what it seems to be is it's a minigame within Nikkei, but it's like it just looks
(0:28:14) Al: like the entire Dave the Diver game, right, like you see them, so some of the characters
(0:28:20) Al: from Nikkei get transported into Dave the Diver and they're like in like wetsuits and
(0:28:26) Al: got their harpoon guns and stuff. And then you actually see them like playing the game,
(0:28:33) Al: like going around and harpooning fish and picking up items and then they go to the sushi
(0:28:38) Al: bar and it looks like they've just recreated the game. Let me show you, let me send you
(0:28:41) Kev: I'm once looking at the pictures and
(0:28:43) Al: this link. You need to watch this video. It's just, it's wild. There's a video on the link
(0:28:47) Kev: AHHH! This is WAAH!
(0:28:52) Al: that I sent you, it literally just looks like the game. Which is why we initially
(0:28:56) Al: thought it was a DLC for a Day of the Diver because it looks so much like it.
(0:29:06) Kev: But oh my gosh, that's why I had no idea. I didn't hear this about this one at all. I love it though
(0:29:13) Kev: Um, and yeah, I love it there. Do you have your anime girls and there's dave? Um, just just david
(0:29:19) Kev: Oh dave. I love dave man
(0:29:23) Kev: Um
(0:29:24) Kev: I'm pulling out the video one second. Let's take a second
(0:29:27) Kev: um
(0:29:28) Kev: man that
(0:29:30) Kev: my guess
(0:29:31) Kev: before since nike which
(0:29:33) Kev: took me completely off by surprise I was going to
(0:29:36) Kev: say power wash simulator and have a david diver dlc and power washing the boat or the
(0:29:42) Al: Yeah!
(0:29:46) Kev: sushi bar or something, it could absolutely work, um, yeah that's my uh
(0:29:52) Al: That's fine, we'll get Cody to cover that one then, because they've completely finished the Powerwash simulation.
(0:29:58) Kev: I need to get into that Powerwash Swiss.
(0:30:01) Kev: Oh my god, I'm watching the video now.
(0:30:03) Kev: Oh, there he is!
(0:30:04) Kev: Oh my god!
(0:30:05) Kev: What did we want?
(0:30:07) Kev: There's Dave.
(0:30:08) Kev: Oh, there's, they're transforming.
(0:30:11) Kev: They got warped into the boat.
(0:30:12) Kev: Oh my god, wow, even the UI and stuff, it is just recreated!
(0:30:16) Al: Yeah, what did I tell you?
(0:30:18) Kev: Wow!
(0:30:20) Kev: That is just Dave the Diver in...
(0:30:22) Kev: Wow, man, that's a Mark of...
(0:30:26) Kev: Well the fish look this-
(0:30:29) Al: uh-huh they've even got like the different weapons as well
(0:30:30) Kev: They, uh...
(0:30:33) Kev: That's what it is
(0:30:36) Kev: Wait look like they have the Boncho scenes?
(0:30:39) Kev: They just have them in there. They just actually just put it in there. They're running the restaurant. Oh my
(0:30:45) Kev: Wow, Nikkei was rich enough to just add the entire game in there. Okay. Oh, there it is
(0:30:51) Kev: There is the Nikkei costumes I was looking for
(0:30:55) Kev: But that's wild it's just
(0:30:58) Al: Yeah, what's the thing? Can you imagine another game just adding a game into their game as
(0:31:04) Kev: I mean, I mean port night does it all the time, but like that's what I'm saying. You got to be
(0:31:04) Al: a minigame? Yeah, sure, but they're one of the biggest game of all time. This is a big
(0:31:10) Kev: Yeah, I know you got to be rich enough to do that and well, I guess Niki
(0:31:15) Kev: Shot you this might surprise you up, but Niki does one actually being a
(0:31:21) Kev: Being a shooter and gotcha game and anime here. So yeah. All right. They could probably
(0:31:23) Al: No.
(0:31:28) Al: People like the anime girls with big guns, really?
(0:31:33) Kev: Oh, okay.
(0:31:34) Al: OK, so Dave the Diver, half an hour in,
(0:31:35) Kev: Yes, let's-
(0:31:37) Kev: What is Dave the Diver? Our listener's pets.
(0:31:40) Al: and we're finally talking about the game.
(0:31:42) Al: Yes, so, I guess, quick intro to the game,
(0:31:44) Al: in case anybody doesn't know.
(0:31:46) Al: The idea is it is a diving fishing game.
(0:31:50) Al: So you dive into the water and you catch fish through a variety of means and you use those fish to then make sushi in the sushi restaurant that you don't own but you essentially run and therefore essentially get all the profits even though you don't own it and the owner is the chef.
(0:32:14) Al: It's all a bit weird. Confusing. But that's essentially...
(0:32:16) Kev: I thought the owner was Cobra. Not the owner's Cobra, isn't it?
(0:32:21) Kev: No, I'm pretty sure Bunch is just the head chef. Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure Cobra is the owner. So
(0:32:21) Al: Is Bancho not owned it?
(0:32:22) Al: It's been so long since I've...
(0:32:24) Al: Hmm.
(0:32:26) Kev: Here, let me take it back
(0:32:29) Kev: even further let me
(0:32:31) Al: It's financed by Cobra, financed by Cobra and run by Bancho.
(0:32:32) Kev: Is it okay, maybe. Well, he's making money off of it. There you go. Well poor Dave
(0:32:39) Al: But you seem to get all of the profit profits from it.
(0:32:41) Kev: Of course poor Dave needs to be assertive more assertive because uh
(0:32:46) Kev: He was literally on vacation when the guy Cobra calls him up and just tells him hey
(0:32:50) Kev: You're gonna go dive fishing now and run the restaurant and do everything else and he just always agrees
(0:32:51) Al: Yeah.
(0:33:00) Al: So, that's a quick intro to the game.
(0:33:03) Al: Give us your very quick what you feel about the game before we get into the details.
(0:33:08) Kev: Okay, um, the games excellently. What can I say right like the so it's it's pixel art and and it's fine pixel art
(0:33:17) Kev: the
(0:33:18) Al: It's very detailed pixel art.
(0:33:19) Kev: Yeah, it is. Um, it's
(0:33:23) Kev: the gameplay is fun in catching the fish and and whatnot the
(0:33:29) Kev: The upgrades are all satisfying and and and the progression feels natural and in goes well
(0:33:38) Kev: like
(0:33:40) Kev: You know all the mechanical stuff like it's great when the game knocks out of the park
(0:33:44) Kev: But I think always more important for me is the feel or the aesthetic the vibes whatever you want to call it
(0:33:50) Kev: And I think they do great. It's a very comical game
(0:33:53) Kev: The writing is is entertaining
(0:33:57) Kev: Again the character Dave I love him a lot and
(0:34:00) Kev: The other part that they get right is the underwater portion
(0:34:05) Kev: Fish are all accurately represented they're all
(0:34:08) Kev: well that's majority of them are real life fish
(0:34:12) Kev: and you can learn about them and then
(0:34:14) Al: Yeah. I wouldn't say vast majority, but you've not got to that point. But yeah,
(0:34:18) Al: majority. I'll go with majority.
(0:34:19) Kev: let's say the majority yes
(0:34:22) Kev: uh... and then you get to the you know you go the whole gamut of the sea the
(0:34:27) Kev: tropical fish down to
(0:34:30) Kev: horrifying deaths with the monstrosities the the real life monstrosities and the
(0:34:34) Kev: fake monstrosities down there
(0:34:38) Kev: all like just thumbs up everywhere like I don't have any
(0:34:41) Kev: big complaints I can't go about the top my head
(0:34:44) Kev: uh... what about you out what do you
(0:34:47) Al: Yeah, I'm mostly on the same page as you. It's super fun. The two main things being
(0:34:54) Al: the fishing and the sushi restaurant, they are good fun. You're absolutely right. It
(0:34:59) Al: doesn't take itself seriously because I'm literally catching fish by swimming through
(0:35:05) Al: and stabbing them. Sure, you've got your harpoon, and that's a standard way to fish, but you've
(0:35:12) Al: also got literally guns and a knife, and you can just walk up to a shark and...
(0:35:17) Al: You can swim up to a shark and hit it with a baseball bat. Or there's also if you encountered
(0:35:22) Kev: - Yep, or the toy hammer.
(0:35:27) Al: the baseball itself, you can get baseball. You can throw baseballs at sharks. They actually
(0:35:29) Kev: I haven't found the baseball.
(0:35:34) Al: do a lot of damage, but yeah. It definitely doesn't take it seriously, and it's really
(0:35:39) Al: fun, but it tries to do kind of vague realism with the fish, and it's...
(0:35:48) Al: It's not super easy. There is some challenge to it, especially later on in the game, and
(0:35:51) Kev: - Yeah, I can imagine.
(0:35:54) Kev: - Mm-hmm.
(0:35:54) Al: especially catching some of the fish with some of the boss battles and stuff like that.
(0:36:01) Al: But yeah, no, super fun, super silly. Definitely my humour. I really enjoyed it overall. I
(0:36:07) Al: do have a few complaints, but they're mostly around the fact that there are about 10 random
(0:36:15) Al: many games that exist in the game.
(0:36:17) Al: There's a point where you're like 'here's an ice pick' and you have to use the ice
(0:36:26) Kev: That's why...
(0:36:36) Al: pick to pick through a sheet of ice, and that happens once. Ever. And if you fail it, you
(0:36:40) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:36:43) Al: just try it again. Right? Like, a lot of these
(0:36:44) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:36:47) Al: minigames feel a bit like WarioWare to me, when it's like, right, you have 10 seconds
(0:36:49) Kev: Hmm
(0:36:52) Al: to figure out what you're doing, otherwise you've failed and you have to try again.
(0:36:56) Al: And it just feels like, what was the point in that? Like, these random, like, they aren't
(0:37:01) Al: part of the core, they're completely different type of gameplay to everything else in the
(0:37:05) Al: game. And I just, it's really weird. The other thing is, have you done any of the VIP, the
(0:37:14) Al: new items.
(0:37:18) Al: So like random people will turn up to your sushi restaurant and they'll say,
(0:37:21) Al: "Hey, I want this specific thing." And you have to go and gather the ingredients for
(0:37:22) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:37:26) Al: that specific thing, and then two days later you take them to the sushi restaurant,
(0:37:31) Al: Banjo will cook them sushi, and then you get success and you win some money.
(0:37:34) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you unlock things that way. A lot of things that way.
(0:37:39) Al: You do, but I did about five or six of them, and then randomly they started
(0:37:47) Al: extra minigames to make Banjo cook them the sushi. You start cooking it yourself.
(0:37:50) Kev: What?
(0:37:52) Kev: I haven't gotten there wha-
(0:37:53) Al: It's actually Banjo, but you're controlling Banjo to do that.
(0:37:57) Al: And I have no idea why, like the first five or six, it's just gather the ingredients,
(0:38:00) Al: you see a cut scene, the person eats it, they're like, "Wow, it's amazing."
(0:38:04) Al: And then you've unlocked a new menu item. What's the recipe? There's one I'm looking for.
(0:38:10) Al: Recipe is the word I'm looking for. You unlock a new recipe, you win some money,
(0:38:14) Al: you get some thumbs up on your cookstart app.
(0:38:17) Al: Great, fantastic. But then, like, I've done two. Two out of the seven I've done,
(0:38:23) Al: they make you do six different minigames to cook the sushi. And I'm like, one, why?
(0:38:30) Al: Right? Like, I just don't know why. Two, why is this a change? Why were they all not like this?
(0:38:37) Al: This is really random, the change up here.
(0:38:38) Kev: that is wild that is very random because I've been playing for a while and haven't encountered
(0:38:44) Kev: that yet and that comes out of nowhere six that's wild six out of seven right
(0:38:46) Al: I didn't get that till chapter six. I don't know why they do that. Yes. Yeah. I don't
(0:38:57) Al: know why. I've got another one due in two days, and I don't know whether that's going
(0:39:01) Al: to have minigames or not, but it just is really weird because I was like, oh, I was fully
(0:39:06) Al: just expecting the cutscene and the person to like, wow, that's amazing. And suddenly
(0:39:11) Al: it was showing me these random WarioWare minigames. It's so weird.
(0:39:15) Kev: That is that is wild
(0:39:16) Al: So that would that would be my biggest issue with the game. And it's not a huge issue,
(0:39:22) Kev: Soar yeah
(0:39:25) Al: right? Because it's not something that happens very often. None of them are really difficult.
(0:39:28) Al: And if you fail them, I think other than the VIP menu items, other than that, I think you
(0:39:33) Al: just retry them. But it just feels like this is not anything like the core gameplay. It's
(0:39:34) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:39:39) Kev: Yeah, it sounds jarring.
(0:39:40) Al: and it is very jarring. You're like, I'm, I'm, you know, swimming.
(0:39:46) Al: I'm going around killing some fish. I'm doing some puzzles. I'm getting round and then suddenly
(0:39:51) Al: it's like, oh, no, you need to do this Ace Pick minigame. Or no, you need to do this.
(0:39:56) Al: The drill, you did the drill one, I presume to get into the I think that's quite early
(0:39:58) Kev: Yeah, I forgot about the drill. Yeah
(0:40:01) Al: on in. That's the sort of thing I'm talking about.
(0:40:05) Kev: Well, yeah, you know what that's a good point like I yeah, yeah, I thought about the drill like
(0:40:11) Al: You use that drill, you use that drill twice.
(0:40:13) Kev: Yeah, you used to get in somewhere and it feels like you could use it somewhere else like
(0:40:15) Al: In the whole game, twice.
(0:40:19) Al: And never again, twice, ever.
(0:40:22) Kev: That is if I all right, here's my copium like if I were to try to make any sense out of this like they're playing
(0:40:29) Kev: Oh, obviously they're still working on the game, right? We're still getting updates and stuff. So, you know, maybe we'll get a big
(0:40:36) Kev: Postgame DLC even more of it. I don't know but you're right. Like
(0:40:40) Kev: It is wild to think about I don't think so either, but I'm just spitballing here
(0:40:41) Al: I'd be very surprised if they ever come back to any of these again. It's just this is what
(0:40:54) Al: it is and it felt like they just had an idea for these and decided to put them in but they
(0:40:58) Al: didn't really want to add them in very much. It's jarring. It's a bit odd. It conflicts
(0:41:09) Al: so much with the great gameplay that the brand-
(0:41:11) Al: rest of the game is. And every time I encountered when I was just like, "Oh, not again." I'd spend the one minute to do it, and then I'd be like, "Thank goodness that's over, and I know they'll never have to do that one again."
(0:41:15) Kev: Yeah.
(0:41:19) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:41:22) Kev: Mm.
(0:41:23) Al: Then you move on and you continue playing the game that you're actually enjoying.
(0:41:26) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I g- huh.
(0:41:29) Kev: That is so odd, like, I just wonder if they were trying to break up the, like, the pacing, or, or didn't want the game to feel too monotonous, because, like, how could I put this?
(0:41:42) Al: It doesn't stop that, though, because it's like 10 different things that only take 30
(0:41:44) Kev: Yeah.
(0:41:46) Kev: Yeah.
(0:41:47) Kev: Yeah, I don't know.
(0:41:47) Al: seconds each.
(0:41:49) Al: It doesn't really do that.
(0:41:49) Kev: I'm, I'm baffled.
(0:41:51) Kev: I'm just trying to figure it out, but I, I'm just as puzzled as you are.
(0:41:54) Al: Anyway, that's my main complaint.
(0:42:00) Al: It's not a huge one, and it's just like I'm now done with those so I don't have to worry
(0:42:04) Al: about them again.
(0:42:05) Al: You know, if I want to continue playing, I can finish doing all the collection and stuff
(0:42:09) Al: like that and finish all that which is always fun.
(0:42:12) Al: Yeah, it's just a bit weird. Should we talk about some of the actual mechanics then?
(0:42:16) Kev: All right, yeah, yeah, okay, so
(0:42:17) Al: Get into the good stuff. Talk to us about diving.
(0:42:19) Kev: Yes, let's start with that right cuz that's that's the name of the game and it would say it's the primary mechanic
(0:42:27) Kev: Okay, so
(0:42:29) Kev: the at the start of the game
(0:42:32) Kev: the game day is broken up into three phases morning afternoon and night and
(0:42:37) Kev: Here's your first two phases of morning and afternoon to go diving and hunt fish
(0:42:42) Kev: and it's pretty
(0:42:46) Kev: At least at the beginning. I think it's fairly it's
(0:42:48) Kev: Relatively simple or straightforward that the basic one is harpooning
(0:42:52) Kev: So you you move around with Dave you have a limited air supply because you're diving of course
(0:42:58) Kev: And the air supply is essentially your HP. There's no timer, but the the age the air is going down
(0:43:04) Al: Yep. There's a timer that you can reset, yeah.
(0:43:05) Kev: so there's a sort of
(0:43:07) Kev: inherent timer, but you can find
(0:43:10) Kev: Exactly. Yes, you can find
(0:43:13) Kev: supplies of oxygen throughout the map.
(0:43:16) Kev: And so you swim around you you have your harpoon gun which you what is it
(0:43:29) Kev: like there's ZR or a whatever and then a little targeting reticle shows up kind
(0:43:35) Kev: of like the angle you're supposed to fire the harpoon and you push the other
(0:43:39) Kev: button and it fires it and it hits the fish and that at the most basic level is
(0:43:46) Kev: is how you catch fish. Now of course that they add a lot more to that because
(0:43:53) Kev: early on in the very like surface level a lot of the fish are small and easy to
(0:43:58) Kev: catch but later on some fish will require actually multiple harpoonings to
(0:44:03) Kev: get because they have more quote-unquote HP or what have you. As Al said you are
(0:44:11) Kev: given a melee weapon you have a knife by default but you can find other ones
(0:44:14) Kev: throughout the map.
(0:44:16) Kev: The baseball bat, the sword, the hammer, things like that.
(0:44:20) Al: The sleepy hammer. It's so sick because it puts them to sleep. You're just like knocking them out.
(0:44:21) Kev: Yep, the squeaky hammer, that is a good one.
(0:44:23) Kev: Yep, yep, yep, yep.
(0:44:28) Kev: And you can use those, but they are a little riskier because some of the fish can damage you.
(0:44:33) Kev: There are aggressive fish, as the ocean is.
(0:44:38) Kev: And when they attack you, you lose oxygen, essentially.
(0:44:41) Kev: Again, that's your timer and your HP bar.
(0:44:43) Kev: Um, uh,
(0:44:46) Kev: Uh, later on you get guns, as Al said, um, which, uh, do not capture the fish as the harpoon does, but inflict a lot more damage. There's a, uh,
(0:44:57) Al: I think you know exactly what they do, they shit them. That's it.
(0:44:59) Kev: Yeah, there's a few different ones. There's like a long range, a close range. Uh, there's actually a net gun that can catch some of them live, but that's a, that's a bit trickier. But, but yeah. Um, and you need the guns because later on, uh, some of those, uh, like, for instance,
(0:45:16) Kev: imagine a shark will be a lot more HP heavy than a little fish and it will attack you. So just trying to harpoon it over and over, it will be a bit difficult. So use the gun to weaken the fish essentially. Um, some fish actually like the sharks cannot be actually harpooned. Uh, you just have to straight up kill them, um, uh, to get their meat and whatnot.
(0:45:38) Al: although although you can use the harpin to damage
(0:45:40) Kev: You can use the harpoon to damage on it. That is correct. Um, because the guns do have ammo and you,
(0:45:46) Kev: they're just, you know, ammo refills throughout the map. But if you run out of ammo, you have to switch to the harpoon to try to finish them off or whatnot. Um, yeah. And I, and of course that there's a wide variety of fish. And sometimes they, they have different attacks or patterns or whatnot. Right. Some fish will charge it. You some will like jellyfish will try to sting you or generate electricity. There's even a jellyfish that explodes, um,
(0:46:16) Kev: which is what you see here. Yes, I have.
(0:46:16) Al: Oh yeah. Have you managed to catch one of them yet? Yeah. That was really difficult because
(0:46:21) Al: I was looking through my decks and I was like, "Oh, I'm missing one from the depths." And
(0:46:25) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a kicker with that one. You have to act fast because even if it doesn't hurt you, it still blows up like, you know, like a vault's work or whatever. Um,
(0:46:28) Al: I saw it was, "Oh, it's that jellyfish, isn't it?" And I'm like, "Oh, I need to catch it
(0:46:32) Al: before it blows up."
(0:46:42) Al: - Yeah, and if it sets itself off and you shoot it,
(0:46:46) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:46:46) Al: then it will blow up, right?
(0:46:47) Al: So you need to either attack it without it seeing you
(0:46:50) Al: or you need to catch it or stun it or something like that.
(0:46:53) Al: There's like, you can't, you can't just,
(0:46:55) Al: 'cause like, so you spend most of the time just going,
(0:46:57) Al: oh, I'll just whittle down their HP, kill them,
(0:46:59) Al: and then catch them, but that doesn't work for that
(0:47:02) Al: 'cause it just blows up.
(0:47:02) Kev: Right right right right um
(0:47:05) Kev: Yeah, and at least from what I've encountered. I think that's kind of the general flow of how you go diving
(0:47:11) Kev: but
(0:47:12) Kev: Of course you can upgrade all you know a lot of equipment to upgrade you can upgrade your guns your harpoon
(0:47:20) Kev: You can upgrade your diving suit to go deeper. You can upgrade your oxygen tank to the last longer
(0:47:27) Kev: and there's probably a few other ones I can't remember right now, but
(0:47:31) Kev: But yeah, they are
(0:47:33) Kev: You catch all these fish and then you make money from the restaurant and then the rest that money can pay for your upgrade
(0:47:39) Kev: So it's a nice little loop and I think works pretty well
(0:47:43) Kev: And and you do feel the power of the upgrades like early on
(0:47:47) Kev: Some of the fish take you have to fight them a good bit and oh, oh some fish when you harpoon them like a tiny little micro
(0:47:55) Kev: Warrior where game where you have to match a a lot or wiggle this control stick in a certain way or whatnot will happen
(0:48:02) Kev: To capture the fish later on when you upgrade them
(0:48:06) Kev: You can just harpoon them normally without having to do that, which is nice to see
(0:48:11) Kev: Yeah, I'm trying to think
(0:48:13) Kev: There are oh, there are other items that can help you that you can find in treasure chests throughout the map
(0:48:21) Kev: There's like
(0:48:22) Al: Yeah, so this is the thing we should have done in the beginning, which is, surprise,
(0:48:28) Al: it's another roguelite. The place you're diving to is called the Deep Blue Hole, and this
(0:48:28) Kev: - No, yeah, yeah.
(0:48:37) Al: is like some mysterious area that changes every time you go in, and when you get things
(0:48:42) Al: from inside, like weapons, they will disappear when you come out and, "Oh, nobody understands
(0:48:47) Al: how it works. And I'm like, Oh, yeah, very clever, very clever. It's, I see what you're
(0:48:51) Al: doing there.
(0:48:52) Al: Things you get down there like fish and, you know, other resources will, you'll keep
(0:49:00) Al: them but weapons and harpoon tips and stuff like that, that they disappear when you come
(0:49:07) Al: up. But I think this is the interesting thing because this is only the second time I've
(0:49:11) Al: actually enjoyed playing a roguelite. And the other one, can you remember where the
(0:49:15) Al: other one was?
(0:49:16) Kev: Oh, oh, the other one, oh, uh, Cult of the Lamb.
(0:49:16) Al: Cult of the lamb, correct. Now these, what I figured out is the dinner.
(0:49:22) Al: The difference between these two and other ones is the roguelite bit of it isn't the
(0:49:27) Al: point. It is what you're doing to gather resources for the other part. So in Cult of the Lamb,
(0:49:34) Al: you're running your farm and you go out on your runs to get things to bring them back.
(0:49:40) Al: And here, you're running your sushi restaurant and you dive to get stuff for that and to
(0:49:44) Al: get upgrades and blah, blah, blah, blah. Whereas what I don't like is, say, for example, Hades,
(0:49:49) Al: the whole point is to get to the end of the run.
(0:49:52) Kev: well okay I'm sure as an aside like I will say I don't know about Culp and
(0:49:53) Al: Right? I don't like that. The point of this is not to get to the end of it in one piece,
(0:49:57) Al: it's to go and gather resources and come back.
(0:50:03) Kev: Lamb but in Day of the Diver sure yes I agree with that that the sushi restaurant
(0:50:08) Kev: is the the the premise or the the main impetus and and all the pretty much not
(0:50:15) Kev: all of it now there is a good amount because you counter the storyline down
(0:50:20) Kev: in the sea and you have to.
(0:50:22) Al: sure, sure. But if you go down and die, it's not like, "Oh, I died and I didn't get to
(0:50:22) Kev: - Mm-hmm.
(0:50:23) Kev: - Mm-hmm.
(0:50:28) Al: the end." It's like, "Oh, I died and now I go back and get more stuff." The aim is not
(0:50:35) Al: to get from the start to the end in one run, which is the point in so many roguelites.
(0:50:37) Kev: - Okay, cool, yeah.
(0:50:42) Al: There is an area that you go through and there are areas where you have to go for the story.
(0:50:49) Al: Obviously the story happens down here, but you do...
(0:50:52) Al: You just go slowly bit by bit. Every time you go down, you get more of that, and there
(0:50:57) Al: are checkpoints, right? So essentially you get a little mirror that you get on the boat,
(0:51:02) Al: which by the way, is so silly. Like here's a mirror that lets you get to the place with
(0:51:07) Al: the underwater people, the sea people, and you're just like, "Okay, cool. I'll just stick
(0:51:12) Al: it on my boat." Then you just go, "Okay, let's hope nobody uses the mirror without diving
(0:51:12) Kev: Yeah. (laughs)
(0:51:18) Kev: They say it only works for you.
(0:51:18) Al: equipment on because they're going to die very quickly.
(0:51:23) Al: Yeah, I'm sure that's true. No, I know they say it. I'm not saying I don't believe them.
(0:51:24) Kev: They do! (laughs)
(0:51:28) Kev: Duh. Well, they in.
(0:51:32) Al: And yeah, so you use these checkpoints to get to the different people,
(0:51:35) Al: and there's more checkpoints than you've encountered, Kevin. So it's like,
(0:51:40) Al: if you had to go from the boat to where the story is, through diving all the way down
(0:51:46) Al: and doing everything every day, I would hate that. And that's essentially what Hades is,
(0:51:51) Al: Right?
(0:51:52) Al: That's not fun doing everything that I've done before to get to the next new part.
(0:51:55) Al: That's not fun for me.
(0:51:57) Al: You know?
(0:51:58) Al: So just as an aside, I have finally, I think I've figured out what makes a rogue light
(0:51:59) Kev: Okay
(0:52:03) Al: I like as opposed to one I don't.
(0:52:04) Kev: Yeah, okay, well there you go
(0:52:07) Kev: That makes that makes sense. I get you and I will say Dave the diver is
(0:52:13) Kev: extra light on the road because
(0:52:16) Kev: while the the fish and the the chests and and
(0:52:20) Kev: Resources kind of regenerating shuffle locations a bit
(0:52:24) Kev: The actual terrain does not
(0:52:29) Kev: There's just one map it does
(0:52:30) Al: It does actually, it does actually. Yeah, so I've noticed that sometimes when I come like it's vaguely the same, but the actual specifics of there's this little cave here, like that might not be there the next time.
(0:52:44) Al: And there's like this route down the left hand side that might be not there the next time. So, and where exactly the current area is, and where the ways to get down to the depths are, they are all slightly changed.
(0:52:56) Al: changed. It's not drastic, right? It's not like you're
(0:53:00) Al: going to go down and suddenly there's a great white shark straight away, or you go down
(0:53:04) Al: and there's a whole new area you've never been to. If you programmed in to go to the
(0:53:11) Al: depths based on one route and you did it again, it would get stuck. It's not exactly the same.
(0:53:14) Kev: Really? Because I could swear that I take like the same route to get to the deaths every time.
(0:53:21) Al: It will feel very similar. You dive down at the left-hand side and then if you find the
(0:53:27) Al: the first hole you go down it and you keep going.
(0:53:30) Al: Going down you will get to the depths but where that hole is changes every time slightly.
(0:53:35) Kev: Oh, I had no idea.
(0:53:37) Kev: Oh, I'll have to look into that, because if that's true, it is so slight, I didn't notice.
(0:53:44) Al: Yeah, it took me a while to realise and there were only a few cases where I actually noticed
(0:53:49) Al: that there was a big difference but it's like yeah, the left hand side is where I mostly
(0:53:54) Al: noticed it because there is sometimes a cave that you have to go down and left and up to
(0:53:59) Al: get into and sometimes that doesn't exist. So, it's not drastic but it is slight changes.
(0:54:06) Kev: Okay, well either way that the point generally stands yeah that
(0:54:07) Al: I just need to point that out. But it's pretty similar.
(0:54:14) Al: I agree with your overall point.
(0:54:16) Kev: But yeah, so so
(0:54:18) Kev: So yeah, there you go that I think that roughly covers the diving portion
(0:54:22) Kev: Like it is a rogue like go down fair stand
(0:54:26) Kev: You know you're you're given plenty of objectives by people to go find certain fish or go explore certain areas or do this do that
(0:54:33) Kev: So, you know, a lot of it is
(0:54:36) Kev: guided and whatnot, but in general you're pretty free to explore the whole area as your equipment will allow you to.
(0:54:42) Kev: Um...
(0:54:44) Al: Yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty guided, but you can ignore it if you want. I really like the quest
(0:54:51) Al: system they give you, right? Because you've got main quests, which you can just kind of like focus
(0:54:55) Al: on and get through the story if you really want to. And you can do that pretty quickly, like you can
(0:55:00) Al: advance the story every single dive if you want to, which is really good. But there's lots of extra
(0:55:07) Al: side things that you can do as well. And of course, I did every single thing because I was like, "Oh,
(0:55:12) Al: Oh, that's a thing to do, I'll do that.
(0:55:14) Al: So, I haven't 100% the game yet, but everything up to this point I have pretty much done,
(0:55:20) Al: other than catching all the fish. But I've got a lot of them, there's like three areas I've got
(0:55:26) Al: 100% of the fish in, just there's four or five that I don't. But yeah, I like the quest system,
(0:55:36) Al: it's good, it allows you to, if you have a lot of quests, you can pin three of them to show on your
(0:55:41) Al: screen, which is
(0:55:44) Al: good. You can see the progress of them if it's like so some of them are like
(0:55:46) Al: collecting items, for example, that will show you how much you've got of that,
(0:55:49) Al: which is quite nice. Yeah, it's good fun.
(0:55:54) Kev: Yeah, I agree. And I guess that leads us to the restaurant portion because again, that's what it all kind of leads back to right getting stuff for your restaurant. So let's talk about that a bit.
(0:56:08) Kev: So, okay, so again, the premise was this, there's a sushi restaurant being open and you're providing all the ingredients for it, more or less.
(0:56:18) Al: and basically running it. You're hiring staff and you're taking orders and you're pouring beer.
(0:56:19) Kev: and basically running it.
(0:56:24) Kev: You're serving, you're pouring drink, yeah, decorating, yeah, you're running it.
(0:56:31) Al: You're doing everything except the cooking, you're doing everything else.
(0:56:35) Kev: Yep, yeah, pretty much, I don't know when Dave sleeps, poor guy.
(0:56:40) Kev: [LAUGH] Because the restaurant is only open at night,
(0:56:45) Kev: which again, there's the three phases and you use the night phase.
(0:56:52) Al: Oh, have you not encountered, just because we're talking about night, have you not encountered
(0:56:57) Al: a night dive yet? You have, right. So you can dive at night. You can only dive once
(0:56:58) Kev: Yes, I have, yes, good point.
(0:57:00) Kev: Yes, that does unlock it.
(0:57:06) Al: at night. If you dive at night, you lose a third of your restaurant time. So there are
(0:57:12) Al: specific things that can only happen at night, so there's a whole bunch of fish that only
(0:57:15) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:57:15) Al: exist at night. Fair enough. Which, by the way, it's terrifying because everything wants
(0:57:19) Kev: Yeah, I was about to say the big difference is
(0:57:20) Al: to attack you down there at night.
(0:57:21) Kev: Everything wants to kill you at night. I
(0:57:22) Al: And the spawn of them just like come and attack you. Yeah, it's horrifying. The electric
(0:57:24) Kev: Literally mean everything like you see the the first thing you see are like cute little red fishes and like oh
(0:57:29) Kev: You know like the ones in the day and then the swarm of ten of them
(0:57:34) Kev: Yeah, and you just get embodied
(0:57:38) Kev: Yeah
(0:57:40) Al: weapons are really good for that because if you hit one of them and it's near another
(0:57:44) Kev: - Uh-huh.
(0:57:46) Al: one, it'll electrocute that one as well. So if you hit a swarm of them, it'll just like
(0:57:46) Kev: - Ah.
(0:57:51) Al: spread through the entire swarm.
(0:57:51) Kev: - Hey, that's-- oh, that's good to know.
(0:57:53) Kev: I'll have to keep that in mind.
(0:57:54) Kev: I don't do too many Night Dies, because they're actually
(0:57:57) Kev: pretty hard, because everything is targeting you.
(0:57:59) Al: Yeah. So the reasons why you would want to do night dives, mainly because there's fish
(0:58:05) Al: there that you need to get for certain things, but also because there are
(0:58:06) Kev: - Yep.
(0:58:10) Al: side bosses that only happen at night. And yeah, that's it.
(0:58:12) Kev: - Of course.
(0:58:15) Kev: - Is it better than the horrifying deaths?
(0:58:16) Kev: The horrifying deaths at night.
(0:58:21) Al: Yeah. Okay, cool. So yeah, sushi, sushi restaurant. Yeah.
(0:58:22) Kev: Good times.
(0:58:25) Kev: But yeah, so, restaurant, yes.
(0:58:29) Kev: So yeah, so once you collect your ingredients,
(0:58:34) Kev: when you enter the sushi restaurant,
(0:58:36) Kev: you basically have to set it up.
(0:58:37) Kev: You select your menu, what items you're gonna serve,
(0:58:40) Kev: depending on what ingredients in your inventory.
(0:58:44) Kev: As I'll say, eventually you can log.
(0:58:45) Kev: Some stuff to help you out so you can set them up.
(0:58:48) Kev: Um, check your, yeah, just upgrade your ingredients and recipes and all that stuff.
(0:58:54) Kev: Um, and then you hit the, okay, time to open the restaurant.
(0:58:57) Kev: And that's when you start playing your little diner, dash, overcooked mini
(0:59:03) Kev: game sort of thing.
(0:59:04) Al: "Maehem"
(0:59:05) Kev: Yeah, because customers come in, uh, that I sit down and they ask for things.
(0:59:06) Al: Just "Maehem"
(0:59:10) Kev: Again, the cooking is done automatically, like Al said, but then you have to take
(0:59:14) Kev: the dish from the
(0:59:15) Kev: chef to the customers and at first you're doing it all by yourself. It's time management
(0:59:27) Kev: rushing to make sure everyone's happy that the order's going to take too long, but the
(0:59:31) Kev: killer are the drinks because some people ask for drinks and then you have to do, again,
(0:59:34) Kev: a little warriorware micro game where you have to pour a drink and it depends on the
(0:59:38) Kev: kind of drink how you pour it and that actually takes up time because all that's real time
(0:59:43) Kev: I'm eating up your time.
(0:59:45) Kev: It's pretty killer, so thank goodness that help staff comes in because they start serving.
(0:59:51) Al: this. Yeah, yeah, I now have, I think, two other waiters and two other chefs, which is
(1:00:01) Al: just so great. But the thing that kills me, if I'm ever going to fail something, it's
(1:00:06) Al: because I've not ground more wasabi, because if there's no wasabi, they cannot cook anything.
(1:00:08) Kev: yep
(1:00:12) Kev: yep
(1:00:14) Al: And so if you run out of wasabi, you need to go and grind some more wasabi. The problem
(1:00:16) Kev: yep
(1:00:18) Al: is the first time you don't do this. You're just like, "Why are they not cooking anything?"
(1:00:20) Kev: yep
(1:00:21) Al: I don't understand. People are needing their food and they're getting annoyed and you're
(1:00:24) Kev: yep
(1:00:25) Al: like, "Oh, I've not done the wasabi." You can easily forget about the wasabi and suddenly
(1:00:28) Kev: it's it's easy yep
(1:00:30) Al: you realise you need to go do it and then there's a massive backlog of meals they have to do.
(1:00:32) Kev: yep
(1:00:34) Kev: absolutely same thing happened to me like it and they tell you about it you the
(1:00:38) Kev: there's a bar on the side you see what it is but yeah and and the thing is
(1:00:40) Al: Oh yeah, but you forget about it.
(1:00:43) Kev: forget about it easily because early on the number of clients is so low you
(1:00:48) Kev: don't run out of a sobby it's only later on when there's a big rush that you run
(1:00:50) Al: yeah especially if there's one of the events like the um the shark event or the swordfish event
(1:00:52) Kev: out and you don't realize what's happening yep
(1:01:00) Kev: yeah yeah yeah yeah the key with a sobby is to fill it up before it runs out
(1:01:07) Kev: That's my tip for you.
(1:01:08) Kev: I like to eat jellyfish or tuna fish, so you're given 3 days to prep, so you can go into the ocean and hunt as many fish as you need and then you make a lot of money from the dishes.
(1:01:34) Kev: on fun times on but uh... but uh...
(1:01:38) Kev: I think that's roughly the gist of the restaurant portion and all the... and depending on what
(1:01:44) Kev: you sell right like rare fish or deep fish do sell for more or forks or whatever and
(1:01:49) Kev: so you get more money for your upgrades to either your restaurant or your equipment and
(1:01:53) Kev: whatnot um... and uh... that's roughly how the restaurant portion of it plays out um...
(1:02:01) Kev: but that's it that's still not everything because this game has so much uh... because
(1:02:07) Al: like the staff for example is like you can either put up like a newspaper ad or
(1:02:15) Al: you can do one online and it gives you different people that you can do and
(1:02:19) Al: then you have to hire them and then you have to train them up to make them
(1:02:22) Al: better and then of course that costs you money every night and then there's
(1:02:27) Al: obviously this research where you can unlock more more recipes you get them
(1:02:33) Al: based on your cook star rating, which
(1:02:37) Al: is an app that gives you thumbs up or fires for every person who's happy that comes to
(1:02:46) Al: your restaurant. It just keeps going and going. There's so much in this game, it's insane.
(1:02:50) Kev: Yeah, yeah, like there's a there is a whole cell phone filled with apps that you use right and they're all different things. You have books that which is their Instagram thing because I want to take a picture of their food you have the you manage your equipment there you can you have actual an actual cell phone part where you can call people for different things you have your your fish decks in there, which is given to you by a parody ash ketchum character.
(1:03:18) Al: It's so funny.
(1:03:18) Kev: He is very, he is very here.
(1:03:20) Kev: You're not allowed to say Pokemon, they almost did, but you're not allowed to say it.
(1:03:24) Al: They went as close as they could to the line without stepping over it.
(1:03:26) Kev: Yup.
(1:03:29) Al: I will say that, yeah, there's so much, and this might sound overwhelming to people, but
(1:03:33) Al: honestly, it is done so well that they bring things in gradually and you don't feel overwhelmed
(1:03:34) Kev: Yeah.
(1:03:36) Kev: Yep.
(1:03:40) Al: at any point except possibly when you're running the restaurant later on in the game.
(1:03:42) Kev: Yeah.
(1:03:44) Kev: Yeah.
(1:03:44) Al: But that's a very condensed two minutes that you're stressed for.
(1:03:49) Al: And the rest of the time, you're just like, "Oh, here's another thing," and they slowly
(1:03:52) Al: add things to you in a really natural way the tutorial for
(1:03:54) Al: this game is basically never ending but completely integrated into the game. Right? Like it's
(1:03:58) Kev: Absolutely.
(1:04:00) Al: constantly like, oh okay now here's a new thing, now that you've got used to everything
(1:04:04) Al: else here's another new thing and here's another new thing. Like you don't unlock farming until
(1:04:04) Kev: Here's your farming, because now you have farming.
(1:04:08) Kev: Yep.
(1:04:09) Al: chapter 2 I think and then even that I was talking to Kevin beforehand, there's four
(1:04:14) Al: different parts to the farming that you slowly unlock. So you get fish farm initially where
(1:04:20) Al: you can you can when you kill or you capture fish you can.
(1:04:24) Al: And then you can get raw from them and then put that into the fish farm and that will then they'll turn into fish and then if you get multiple of them they can they can mate and you can farm more fish which is a great way to get like really difficult fish like I have some tiger sharks that are that are breeding and giving me tiger shark every so often which gives you so much meat and they they're their meals are worth so much money and then after that you unlock the rice paddy farm and that's obviously for growing rice and that you can use for other recipes.
(1:04:39) Kev: - Yeah.
(1:04:53) Al: Interestingly, you don't need that for all.
(1:04:54) Al: The sushi recipes, even though sushi is a rice based dish, not important, it's a different
(1:05:02) Al: kind of rice.
(1:05:03) Al: It's not sushi rice.
(1:05:04) Al: It's a different rice.
(1:05:06) Al: And then you unlock crop farming, and that's where you can, honestly, so many crops.
(1:05:15) Al: There's carrots, there's eggplants, there's chili peppers, there's wheat, I can't even
(1:05:23) Al: Remember anymore, but there's like I maybe
(1:05:24) Al: like 10 or 12 crops that you can do and you use them for different recipes or you can just sell them.
(1:05:32) Al: And then you unlock chickens. You can get chickens and they give you eggs.
(1:05:35) Al: I can't even remember what the eggs are for, but there are eggs and you use them for something.
(1:05:39) Al: There's a recipe probably. I can't even remember. It doesn't matter. But the point is like there's
(1:05:45) Al: so many games inside this game but they build it up in such a way that you don't feel overwhelmed
(1:05:50) Al: at any point and it's just gradually built up
(1:05:54) Kev: Yeah, I totally agree. And even when you have all the stuff unlocked, it's all fairly small in
(1:06:02) Kev: terms of time and how much energy you have to put into it. It's a lot of things, so that's how I can
(1:06:06) Kev: feel a bit overwhelming. Except for the diving, which does demand your attention because you're
(1:06:12) Kev: actually doing real-time combat of sorts and whatnot. Everything else is just sort of management,
(1:06:19) Kev: just checking in on things and simple tasks.
(1:06:19) Al: Yeah, I really like how they did the time management in this game where nothing, I feel
(1:06:29) Al: like this game would be so much more stressful if time progressed in anything. So if you
(1:06:37) Al: woke up in the morning and you went to the farm to deal with stuff and time was going
(1:06:40) Al: on and you were losing time so you couldn't go dive, that would be annoying. And it's
(1:06:44) Al: like if you had a limited amount of time to dive, that would be annoying as well. My long
(1:06:49) Al: just dive by the way is up at 55 minutes now. So you can spend a lot of time down there,
(1:06:58) Kev: Yeah, you can oh, oh that reminds you there is one other limitation other than the time of the weight
(1:06:59) Al: you know.
(1:07:05) Kev: Yeah, I forgot to mention that so when you're diving you have a weight limit how much fish and other items you pick up
(1:07:11) Kev: you can carry and
(1:07:13) Kev: and
(1:07:14) Kev: like
(1:07:16) Kev: Honestly, I think most of the time that ends up being a bigger limit on my dives than than the actual oxygen
(1:07:22) Al: absolutely yeah once you've gotten the hang of it absolutely that is that is true especially
(1:07:24) Kev: so
(1:07:26) Kev: Yeah, yeah, because uh, yeah, you
(1:07:29) Al: because if you get further down like the sharks like there's some sharks that are like 20 kilograms
(1:07:34) Kev: Yeah something yeah 23 I'm only up to like 63 kilograms so yeah one shark can be like a third of what I carry.
(1:07:34) Al: and I think you start off with only 20 kilograms in your bag like
(1:07:41) Al: oh i'm I it it gets even better because you can get a drone later on where you can say take this
(1:07:49) Al: So if you kill a shark, you can just tell the drone to come and get it.
(1:07:52) Al: And you don't have to grab it yourself.
(1:07:52) Kev: Yep, yep, that is a pretty handy item that you get, um, expensive upgrade.
(1:08:00) Al: So I guess I should spend a little bit more time explaining the farming because we're
(1:08:04) Al: a farming game podcast. The mechanics are very simple. So the fish farm is the simplest
(1:08:12) Al: one, right? You automatically populate the fish farm as you're doing things. You don't
(1:08:16) Al: have to do anything to do that. As you capture fish, you get the row and they automatically
(1:08:20) Al: go into the fish farm. You go to the fish farm and you can say, "Hey, I want to sell
(1:08:25) Al: everything except two of each type.
(1:08:30) Al: So you make sure you've always got a breeding pair and it just does that automatically.
(1:08:34) Al: You don't even have to tell it to you just say sell or put and it will by default keep to the
(1:08:39) Al: two best ones you have or you can say actually no I want to sell all of this one and that's fine.
(1:08:45) Al: You can do that but the default is to keep to. So it's very simple and very easy to deal with and
(1:08:51) Al: it's just another way of getting money and getting ingredients.
(1:08:56) Kev: yeah yeah it is um I they even poke fun when you unlock the rice thing uh rice
(1:09:05) Kev: grows like in a year in real world but this is not that kind of game so it grows in just
(1:09:10) Kev: a few days and you just have to just check in on it pretty lightly um
(1:09:11) Al: Yeah, so the only thing you actively, the only two things you actively need to do regarding
(1:09:20) Al: the rice is you need to harvest it, obviously, and you need to weed the area around it. Because
(1:09:26) Al: if you don't weed it, some of it will get destroyed by the weeds. So the best thing
(1:09:31) Al: to do is just go there every morning and check if there's anything that needs to be done,
(1:09:35) Al: especially as you unlock the later stuff. But yeah, it's very simple, the guy who--
(1:09:41) Al: who has the farm, he automatically plants the rice and waters the rice. All you have
(1:09:47) Al: to do is weed it and then--
(1:09:50) Kev: Yep, yep, his name is Otto, O-T-T-O, and he Otto does everything for you, um, well, yeah.
(1:09:54) Al: Oh, I didn't get that, that's very clever.
(1:10:01) Al: Well, he doesn't do everything for you because you actually have to do the
(1:10:04) Al: crop farming, which is the next thing, which is the thing you've not unlocked,
(1:10:07) Al: Kevin, and so this is exactly what you would expect it to be. You buy seeds, you
(1:10:13) Al: plant them, you water them daily, and then you come and harvest them. That's it. I mean,
(1:10:19) Al: it's very simple. There's upgrading to the watering can, but the only upgrade to
(1:10:24) Al: gives you more water in the watering can. It doesn't do the thing like full-on farming sims
(1:10:29) Al: do, which is allow you to water bigger areas at a time. It's very simple. It does the job.
(1:10:37) Al: It's not particularly fun part of the game, but it is nice having a very small thing
(1:10:41) Al: that you do each day and it gets you more ingredients.
(1:10:44) Kev: Right, right and which is a big help because with all the exploring you do down there, you know, you can
(1:10:53) Kev: With all the farm stuff you can relax a little from actually hunting all the fish if you want to
(1:10:58) Kev: So you can spend more time just going after certain quests
(1:11:05) Al: And then, well, especially as some days you're going, "I just want to get through this story
(1:11:11) Al: now. I'm so intrigued by how this ends." So you're focusing on that and not focusing
(1:11:15) Al: on the fish. The chicken farming is even simpler than all of the other ones put together. If
(1:11:22) Al: you arrive at the farm and there's an egg, you get the egg. Done. There's nothing else
(1:11:27) Al: you need to do with chickens.
(1:11:30) Kev: easy peasy. No one I'm feeding them. No petting them. I'll rejoice.
(1:11:34) Al: nope nope nope you don't have to do that so if you're looking for a game that has accurate farming
(1:11:41) Al: this is not that game if you're looking for a game that has simple farming that adds to the
(1:11:47) Al: overall fun of the game as a whole then this is this is it
(1:11:52) Kev: There you go.
(1:11:54) Kev: I'm trying to think, what else?
(1:11:56) Kev: Like I mentioned, I guess we talked about the quests.
(1:11:59) Kev: But the quests are pretty simple.
(1:12:01) Kev: Just go collect certain resources or see certain areas
(1:12:05) Kev: and whatnot.
(1:12:06) Kev: There's even certain apps or quest space.
(1:12:09) Kev: There's one where you get extra money
(1:12:12) Kev: for fishing X number of fish or collecting X number of starfish
(1:12:16) Kev: and whatnot.
(1:12:17) Kev: I'm trying to think what else.
(1:12:19) Kev: You have to gather resources to upgrade your guns,
(1:12:22) Kev: or new ones, or better upgrades.
(1:12:26) Kev: I'm trying to think, is there anything else?
(1:12:28) Al: I don't think so, other than the DLCs and like, you know, is there anything you want
(1:12:33) Al: to talk about story-wise that we have?
(1:12:36) Kev: Uh, I mean, not, I mean, he's premise is pretty sweet board, at least from what I see.
(1:12:42) Kev: Like there's a civilization of C people, you're investigating them.
(1:12:46) Kev: Um, they all ask, uh,
(1:12:49) Al: That makes it sound like you're a cop investigating the sea people. What have they done wrong?
(1:12:57) Kev: but yeah.
(1:12:58) Al: There are earthquakes that are happening and you have to investigate why, and there's
(1:13:01) Al: also a historical group of sea people that you have to find more about. That's kind of
(1:13:08) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(1:13:10) Al: kind of it, and you know, much more than that would probably be kind of spoilers, but there's
(1:13:16) Al: There's a lot of characters and they have a lot of fun with the Kenisto.
(1:13:19) Al: There's a story in that similar to just the humor of the game as a whole, they do that
(1:13:20) Kev: Yup, yup, yeah
(1:13:26) Al: really well.
(1:13:28) Al: Every different mechanic that you have is a different person that teaches you about
(1:13:31) Kev: Basically
(1:13:32) Al: it.
(1:13:33) Al: Like the farming is a specific person, the weapons is another person, he's a big nerd.
(1:13:35) Kev: Oh my gosh, the one guy to kill Tako who can craft guts
(1:13:45) Al: And then there's like, you know, the, obviously you mentioned the, the Pokemon.
(1:13:49) Al: guy. There's the guy who wants you to investigate the sea people. There is a person who, there's
(1:13:59) Al: the woman who wants you to find out more about like this. How do I describe this? There's the,
(1:14:07) Al: there are specific quests that you can do to like, they're like environmental
(1:14:10) Kev: Yep, uh-huh. Yeah
(1:14:12) Al: protection type things. It's hard to explain, but like you do things and you collect things
(1:14:17) Al: or you investigate things and that gives you like
(1:14:19) Al: points, environmental points, research points.
(1:14:19) Kev: Research basically, she's a college grad and she's basically making do college research work
(1:14:23) Al: There we go, research.
(1:14:27) Kev: Or call it graduate student or whatever. Yeah. Um, yeah just a
(1:14:34) Al: And then there's the the people that arrive because they have like a specific
(1:14:38) Al: boss that they want you to go fight, and then there's obviously the deals.
(1:14:42) Al: There's a person for each DLC which will touch on on future episodes.
(1:14:44) Kev: Yeah, yeah, of course. Oh, there's a there's a photography guy
(1:14:47) Kev: You can take pictures of certain animals instead of hunting them to get them in your fish decks. You take pictures of them
(1:14:49) Al: The photography, of course, yes.
(1:14:53) Kev: with a little camera minigame where you have to focus and time it and whatnot, which is a fun way to
(1:15:00) Kev: Get some of these other critters that you'd feel bad about hunting or whatever or wouldn't be very appetizing
(1:15:04) Al: Look, I feel like there's a very thin line between that, right? Because very late on,
(1:15:15) Al: you can hunt narwhals. And I feel like, of all creatures, I would like to take pictures
(1:15:20) Al: of narwhals rather than hunt them. But, you know, they're very fierce, shall we say.
(1:15:24) Kev: Well, I'm sure they are very stabby.
(1:15:28) Al: Stabby, stabby.
(1:15:32) Kev: Yeah, yeah, there's two more things, just small things
(1:15:38) Kev: that I get a big kick out of.
(1:15:41) Kev: One, the animations.
(1:15:43) Kev: So basically, when you upgrade things,
(1:15:45) Kev: when you upgrade a gun or craft a gun or you upgrade recipes,
(1:15:51) Kev: the animations of the guys working on them,
(1:15:53) Kev: they're pretty interesting.
(1:15:55) Kev: The main one is Bancho the Chef.
(1:15:57) Kev: When you upgrade an ingredient or a recipe,
(1:16:00) Kev: you get a fun little animation of him preparing it.
(1:16:03) Kev: And there's different ones.
(1:16:05) Kev: There's some where he's just sharpening his sword
(1:16:07) Kev: and so sharply, just the petal slices it just by passing by it.
(1:16:13) Kev: There's a whole energy sort of thing, just a wild amount
(1:16:16) Kev: of fun animations.
(1:16:19) Kev: and the other one as.
(1:16:20) Kev: So we've kind of already said throughout that this game loves making references and parodying things and whatnot there was a whole Phoenix Wright segment, which it just killed me.
(1:16:31) Kev: So you remember the flashback with the Boncho story in the hotel and the lady and whatnot? Yeah, that was a whole that's a that's a Phoenix.
(1:16:39) Kev: That's a whole Phoenix Wright reference, because that's that's just how Phoenix Wright plays.
(1:16:44) Kev: Yeah, which was a fun little segment.
(1:16:44) Al: Okay, fair enough.
(1:16:48) Kev: - Gotcha.
(1:16:49) Kev: - Oh, right.
(1:16:50) Al: That was really weird, you're like, so different. It was just like,
(1:16:50) Kev: - Yeah, if you don't know, I bet it was really weird.
(1:16:54) Kev: It is.
(1:16:55) Al: it's now this game is a visual novel for some reason, like...
(1:16:57) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(1:17:03) Kev: It's just a couple of minutes long, but it's, yeah.
(1:17:05) Kev: I don't know why they just threw it.
(1:17:06) Kev: They want things right in there, so just throw it in there.
(1:17:12) Kev: - Times.
(1:17:13) Kev: - Jeff, I think that roughly covers the general review
(1:17:19) Al: Yeah, I think so. I think so. So, obviously, we've got three more episodes of this series
(1:17:25) Al: coming out in the next few weeks. The next episode, I think, is the Dredge DLC. So, yeah,
(1:17:34) Al: Kevin and Johnny will be talking about the Dredge DLC, because, of course, they talked
(1:17:37) Al: about the Dredge game. So, they've got to talk about the Dredge DLC. I did do a little
(1:17:41) Al: bit of the Dredge DLC, a very small amount, but not very much. So, I look forward to hearing
(1:17:47) Al: what you have to think about that. And then
(1:17:49) Al: we'll be covering the Godzilla DLC after that with a special guest. I'm sure nobody
(1:17:55) Al: will be able to guess who that special guest is. And then after that, we'll be covering
(1:18:00) Al: the actual story. So that'll be the big spoilers episode, because we'll go into the ending
(1:18:06) Al: of it as well. Because yeah, so thank you, Kevin, for joining me to talk about the mechanics
(1:18:13) Kev: you all for having me on and getting me to finally play this game because I'd heard it was good and
(1:18:17) Kev: boy is it really good!
