# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season.
(0:00:34) Al: My name is Al.
(0:00:36) Codey: and my name is Cody.
(0:00:37) Al: And we're here today to talk about Cottagecore games.
(0:00:41) Codey: Woo!
(0:00:44) Codey: It sure has, I went to Costa Rica and back.
(0:00:49) Codey: You guys almost lost me because I almost stepped
(0:00:52) Codey: on the most venomous snake in Costa Rica.
(0:00:55) Al: Oh no. Well, I mean, you know, a snake isn't an insect.
(0:01:01) Codey: It's not, but it's like in the very first day
(0:01:04) Codey: They were like, this is the ultimate--
(0:01:06) Codey: pit viper. If you get bit by one, you need to go to a hospital immediately, and you still might lose your limb.
(0:01:13) Codey: And they had all these things. And then literally the next day I'm walking on a trail, and I--
(0:01:18) Codey: I'm from Pennsylvania. We have-- or I'm not from Pennsylvania, but I'm in Pennsylvania.
(0:01:23) Codey: There's lots of rattlesnakes here, so I'm used to it. You're walking on a trail. You still look down.
(0:01:27) Codey: You don't look around you. You look down. And I almost set my foot down, and I was like, "Oh, that's a snake."
(0:01:33) Codey: She was very well camouflaged.
(0:01:36) Codey: It was Epen, she remained Epen, but I told people, I was like, "Hey, don't go that way. There's a Tertio Pelo or, gosh, what is the other, Fertilance?"
(0:01:44) Codey: And people, of course, were like, "Oh, I wanna see it!"
(0:01:48) Codey: And then I came over, so then I stood there and was basically like a bouncer for this snake.
(0:01:56) Al: I - this is why I don't travel very much. I just don't - we just - like Scotland, pretty
(0:02:05) Codey: Ah.
(0:02:06) Al: safe place. We don't really - technically we have one venomous snake, but it's like
(0:02:13) Al: the sort of venomous that you're gonna have an itchy leg for a while, like that's about
(0:02:18) Codey: Yeah. Yeah, I know this one. This one's not good. And we were pretty far away from a hospital.
(0:02:18) Al: it. Yeah, no, I'm all right. In fact, like I -
(0:02:25) Codey: It was fun, though.
(0:02:26) Al: I think I've only ever seen a snake in the wild like once ever because they're just - like
(0:02:32) Al: they exist here, but they don't really exist. So anyway, I'm glad you're not dead.
(0:02:37) Codey: Yeah, so I'm back. If anyone if anyone has any questions about Costa Rica, let me know in the slack.
(0:02:45) Codey: Gotta be a member of the Slack, gotta be a Patreon subscriber.
(0:02:48) Codey: Patreon.com/GHSpod.
(0:02:50) Codey: But we're not here to talk about that. What are we here to talk about today, y'all?
(0:02:52) Al: This episode we are kind of going to talk about the Coral Island 1.1 update
(0:03:00) Codey: Kind of.
(0:03:01) Al: They'll understand why soon
(0:03:04) Al: There's a whole thing
(0:03:06) Al: We're gonna talk about that before that we have some game news a decent chunk of game news
(0:03:11) Al: We've gotten it's gotten busy again, and it's not all game delays
(0:03:16) Al: But we have hit that period and we have had that time in the year where there's lots of games getting delayed till next year
(0:03:18) Codey: It is getting to be mostly game delays, but not all.
(0:03:24) Codey: Maybe like half game delays right now.
(0:03:24) Al: No, no, it wasn't, it's not...
(0:03:26) Codey: Next episode will be more.
(0:03:29) Al: This is not even half, it's not even half.
(0:03:31) Al: There's only three game delays this episode.
(0:03:33) Codey: Uh-huh, for now.
(0:03:35) Codey: But, but literally the second after we record this,
(0:03:39) Codey: you're going to hit, we're going to hit the boop
(0:03:39) Al: Oh yeah, oh, for sure.
(0:03:41) Codey: and then they're going to be two more, 100 percent.
(0:03:42) Al: For sure.
(0:03:44) Al: I mean, we currently still have...
(0:03:47) Al: Okay, like 20, like 30.
(0:03:48) Al: We still have 30 games that are meant to be coming out this year.
(0:03:51) Al: And it is halfway through.
(0:03:52) Al: So, um, there's going to be a lot more, a lot more delays.
(0:03:55) Codey: Here we go.
(0:03:58) Al: It's my favorite time of the year, uh, game delay season.
(0:04:00) Al: Uh, yeah, cool. So we've got some news, but first of all, Cody, what have you been up to?
(0:04:06) Al: Other than trying to die in Costa Rica.
(0:04:08) Codey: Uh, well, uh, unsuccessfully dying in Costa Rica.
(0:04:13) Codey: Uh, and then just a lot of research stuff.
(0:04:16) Codey: Um, and I was very, so I was in Costa Rica to do fly school, learn about flies,
(0:04:21) Codey: learn how to identify them.
(0:04:22) Codey: So I've been like super jazzed about getting through some of my
(0:04:24) Codey: specimens, which is great.
(0:04:26) Codey: Um, also did, uh, just did the great insect fair, which is Penn state's big,
(0:04:30) Codey: um, outreach event.
(0:04:31) Codey: We had about 3000 people from across the state come and visit, um,
(0:04:34) Codey: and learn about insects.
(0:04:36) Codey: And that was super cool.
(0:04:38) Codey: Uh, but when I wasn't, uh, crippled by stress about the great insects,
(0:04:43) Codey: great insect fair, uh, I was playing, uh, coral Island, of course,
(0:04:47) Codey: a dove back into this game with both feet.
(0:04:50) Codey: Um, not deep enough, but let, but we'll get to that.
(0:04:53) Codey: Uh, also a Disney dream light Valley.
(0:04:56) Codey: I still play it every day.
(0:04:57) Codey: Um, I'm trying to get all the critters and they, whether or not they show
(0:05:02) Codey: up each day as a, you know, tossup.
(0:05:05) Codey: Um, so I check.
(0:05:08) Codey: Log on every morning and I check and see like, Oh, are they here?
(0:05:10) Codey: I think I still have two of the crocodiles that I want and then one
(0:05:14) Codey: Fox, um, that I don't have, but I have befriended all of the other critters.
(0:05:19) Codey: I'm also just like 100%ing everything in that game.
(0:05:23) Codey: So I'm trying to get all the achievements.
(0:05:24) Codey: So I give it maybe like 20 to 30 minutes a day.
(0:05:28) Codey: Um, and then, uh, my best friend, Devin and I have moved on from
(0:05:33) Codey: Minecraft for now, we've just tabled it.
(0:05:36) Codey: and we're playing Call of the Wild.
(0:05:38) Codey: the angler so it's a very uh it is farmville fishing oh sorry not farmville um
(0:05:45) Codey: farming simulator fishing it's like that quality but fish where it's like really detailed about
(0:05:53) Codey: do you have a float set up do you have a spinner set up do you have a what kind of set up do you
(0:05:57) Codey: have what kind of rod do you have it's it's pretty intense but i'm enjoying it
(0:06:02) Al: That looks like a game I do not want to play
(0:06:06) Codey: it's nice because it's it's all
(0:06:08) Codey: open world. So there's like, a bunch of different maps that
(0:06:11) Codey: you can go to. And part of it, you just like explore the world.
(0:06:15) Codey: And you also find you tell the people like when you see the
(0:06:20) Codey: invasive bark beetle or the invasive purple loosestrife,
(0:06:26) Codey: which is an invasive plant that often takes over like around
(0:06:29) Codey: ponds. So you find these things. And it's really cool because a
(0:06:32) Codey: lot of it is legit. Like they told me about oxide daisy and
(0:06:38) Codey: be on the lookout for oxide daisy. And then I was like,
(0:06:40) Codey: this plant is glowing. And this is an oxide daisy. This looks
(0:06:42) Codey: like a loosestrife. And I was like, Oh my gosh, it is. So it's
(0:06:47) Codey: just another thing that I can turn on play for like, five
(0:06:51) Codey: minutes and then turn off if I don't want to play it anymore.
(0:06:54) Codey: The problem with Coral Island and games like it is I start a
(0:06:58) Codey: day and then I'm like committed to that day. And then after the
(0:07:02) Al: Yeah, but the games aren't very long
(0:07:02) Codey: day, you're like, Oh, I can make those days last man.
(0:07:08) Codey: I think I've also isn't this one of the games you can like make
(0:07:10) Codey: the days go slower? I think that's one of the one of the
(0:07:12) Al: Maybe I mean coral islanders are yes, we will do everything that you suggest type of game. So probably
(0:07:13) Codey: accessibility things that you can do.
(0:07:18) Codey: So I think I've done that because that was one of my
(0:07:20) Codey: issues with Stardew is I was like you blink in the days over.
(0:07:21) Al: Yeah, oh
(0:07:23) Codey: But
(0:07:23) Al: No, I like I like the shortness cuz then it's like bam done I can put it away
(0:07:28) Codey: no, I need, I need to be able to do everything.
(0:07:29) Al: We.
(0:07:32) Al: But you've got another day. See, this is how, this is how I'm four years into the game,
(0:07:36) Codey: And I'm not even, it's true.
(0:07:36) Al: and you're not even one year into the game.
(0:07:40) Codey: The FOMO is so hard.
(0:07:43) Codey: Like I, I finally did the thing where you like write down what you need to do for
(0:07:49) Codey: like the basically community center, but it's the Lake temple.
(0:07:53) Codey: Like I wrote it down in a notebook that I have in front of me at all times.
(0:07:57) Codey: And I wrote down like when you find all of the things.
(0:08:00) Codey: So I'm like, and I didn't do this until fall.
(0:08:03) Codey: So now I'm like, look at all these fish that are spring and summer that I didn't
(0:08:06) Codey: know that they were evening fish in the river forest.
(0:08:08) Al: Yeah. The fish is the thing I don't have the most, and oh my word. We'll get to that. We'll get to that. We'll get to that. We'll get to later in the episode.
(0:08:12) Codey: Or that, or that one.
(0:08:16) Codey: What have you been plucked to?
(0:08:18) Al: This, just before I do it, I was reading reviews on Call of the Wild, The Angler, because the reviews are, shall we say, mixed.
(0:08:21) Codey: Yep.
(0:08:27) Al: There are lots of people really like it, but here's a fantastic review.
(0:08:32) Al: 4.1 hours on record, not recommended, posted 4th of September. Somehow they managed to-
(0:08:38) Al: -capture the true essence of real-life fishing in this game. Boring as hell? Check. Managing gear is tedious as hell? Check. You can spend hours fishing and catch nothing? Check.
(0:08:47) Codey: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
(0:08:51) Al: The only thing they failed to capture was what a chura is to clean the fish/gear at the end of the day, but I shouldn't give the devs any ideas.
(0:08:58) Codey: Correct! So if you like fishing I'm sure you'd love this game because then you
(0:09:02) Codey: don't have to clean it either but yeah it is TDM it is the TDM of like
(0:09:06) Codey: having to pick like oh you're like oh you want a rainbow trout you have to
(0:09:11) Codey: make sure that you have the right bait the right gear you have to go to the
(0:09:15) Codey: right place you have to do all this stuff the right way and then yeah you still
(0:09:21) Al: I mean, I will agree, that sounds like not fun.
(0:09:24) Al: It does not sound like something that I would want to have anything to do with, but it's
(0:09:29) Al: a fishing sim.
(0:09:30) Codey: Yep. What did you expect?
(0:09:33) Al: If you don't like fishing, maybe don't play a fishing sim.
(0:09:37) Codey: Yep.
(0:09:37) Al: It's not like something like trying to be different and trying to be interesting.
(0:09:41) Al: It's trying to be realistic, right?
(0:09:45) Al: play a realistic fishing sim if you don't like fishing.
(0:09:48) Codey: Yep. It was funny because after playing it, and Jeff watched me play it a little bit,
(0:09:54) Codey: we ended up we were near a Bass Pro Shop, which is like a giant, it's like a Cabela's or a big
(0:10:02) Codey: like hunting store, but for fit, but mostly just for fit. Well, they I guess they had they had guns
(0:10:07) Codey: as well. And we went in there to just walk around. Yeah. And we went in and walked around and then
(0:10:09) Al: Of course it's America, of course you would.
(0:10:15) Codey: and then someone tried to sell us a vacation.
(0:10:18) Codey: We're like, Oh, we're done. It was a hunting trip.
(0:10:20) Al: I do enjoy how you mentioned like a fishing shop, which I was like "okay, a shop that
(0:10:25) Al: has everything you need to do fishing, fair enough" and then you try and explain it by saying
(0:10:29) Al: "it's like a hunting shop, but for fish" and I'm like "I don't think I've ever seen a hunting shop".
(0:10:36) Codey: Yep.
(0:10:38) Codey: Well, so I started explaining like,
(0:10:40) Codey: oh, it's like a Cabela's.
(0:10:41) Codey: And then I was like, I bet.
(0:10:42) Codey: Al does not know what a Cabela's is.
(0:10:43) Al: I don't know what that is either. Like I'm pretty sure shop that sells you fishing
(0:10:50) Al: pretty self-explanatory. I know what that would mean.
(0:10:54) Codey: but it does also have a hunting area and like you you can make bait bait traps
(0:11:00) Codey: for your deer to like bait deer into your property like scent for deer like
(0:11:04) Al: Oh. Classic fish. And also guns. What have I been up to? I have been playing Astrobot.
(0:11:06) Codey: all there's there's more than just that yeah America anyway what have you been
(0:11:21) Codey: You have to explain to me.
(0:11:22) Al: So are you not aware of what Astrobot is? So, and he's a little bit of background here.
(0:11:24) Codey: I am not aware.
(0:11:27) Codey: Okay.
(0:11:29) Al: So Astrobot is a PlayStation character and he
(0:11:34) Al: I think his first game was Astro's Playroom, which was a free game that came with the PS5
(0:11:45) Al: and was basically like a tech demo of like all the things that the new controller could do.
(0:11:51) Al: And it was super fun. And it's like he's this little cute robot. And the idea was you've got
(0:11:55) Al: these little levels where you're going around and you're basically rescuing old Sony PlayStation
(0:12:00) Al: stuff so you're like getting a playstation one and then
(0:12:04) Al: you're getting like accessories for it you're getting the original controller and then you get
(0:12:09) Al: a ps2 and you get accessories for and it's like that you end up building out this really nice
(0:12:12) Codey: Grabbing the--grabbing those memory cards that you had to grab.
(0:12:15) Al: yeah yeah exactly exactly loads of things like that and you're built basically building out this
(0:12:19) Al: museum and it was super fun um so they've built onto that and made a bigger game that they could
(0:12:26) Al: actually sell um called astrobot and so it's um I mean I basically it's like
(0:12:34) Al: way I would describe it is if sony decided to make a 3d mario game that's basically what it is
(0:12:42) Al: so it's super fun i'm not very far through it because it came out a week ago and i've
(0:12:46) Al: not had a huge amount of time so i've you know i'm through a few levels and um stuff but yeah i'm
(0:12:52) Al: i'm enjoying myself it has the same fun whimsy of astro's playroom it has the really nice controls
(0:13:00) Al: of a good mario game it has the
(0:13:04) Al: unique mechanics that mario wonder had um where lots of different levels have like one specific
(0:13:10) Al: thing that doesn't that level uh less kind of like trippy and more just like a mechanic type
(0:13:15) Al: thing like oh sometimes you have monkey arms and you use them for climbing and sometimes you know
(0:13:21) Al: the standard kind of mario stuff um so yeah it's super fun um and it's it's I don't know if it's
(0:13:28) Al: meant to be I don't know if it's going to be as nostalgic as the other one but it's it feels like
(0:13:34) Al: trying to do a similar sort of thing um in that your ship that you're trying to rebuild is a ps5
(0:13:42) Al: and there's a few things that i've kind of found that they're not hardware stuff they're like game
(0:13:47) Al: based stuff this time so like you're rescuing little robots like astrobot and there some of
(0:13:53) Al: them are in costumes so I found the crash bandicoot one and I found the spyro one and stuff like that
(0:13:55) Codey: oh my gosh
(0:13:58) Al: so I think it's more going for the nostalgia of the games this time which I mean makes sense
(0:14:03) Codey: nostalgia machine activate.
(0:14:05) Al: Um, I was wrong. They did have another Astro Bot game before Astro's Playroom,
(0:14:09) Al: and that was a PlayStation VR game for the PS4 in 2018 called...
(0:14:14) Codey: So still showing off new technology.
(0:14:16) Al: Yes, yeah, so I guess that's kind of the same thing. But yeah, it does really fun stuff with
(0:14:21) Al: the controller, and it's enjoyable to play. And, you know, it's a game for me to actually play on
(0:14:26) Al: my PS5. [LAUGHS] There's like 20 PS5-exclusive games, and half of them...
(0:14:28) Codey: to justify that expense.
(0:14:34) Al: And we're four years into this console.
(0:14:40) Codey: seems legit have you played a heavy rain have they remade that
(0:14:44) Al: I have not. I don't know. [LAUGHS]
(0:14:49) Al: Fair enough. I remember when it came out, and I remember being like, "Oh, it's great."
(0:14:56) Al: I've not made a remake. I'm not seeing anything about a remake.
(0:15:02) Al: What else? I've also been...
(0:15:04) Al: playing lots of Marvel Snap and this week, if people were listening last week, I was
(0:15:09) Al: sitting kind of like ranks 70 I think. I am now at rank 100, infinity rank, so I'm at
(0:15:15) Al: the top of the ladder. So wooo! Exciting. I know I'm not sure what to do. Well, yeah,
(0:15:17) Codey: Woo.
(0:15:20) Codey: Well, no, now that now the real game begins, right, max rank.
(0:15:26) Al: I don't really care. So the problem is, I don't really care about grinding that number
(0:15:31) Al: out because you don't really get any good rewards for it.
(0:15:33) Al: And so it's--
(0:15:35) Al: for the sake of playing, and I'm never gonna get up to the top. So I like goals that are realistic.
(0:15:40) Al: So I'm just playing conquest instead, which is like you have to play a-- you have to win a match
(0:15:46) Al: in a row to get the first ticket, and then you get two in a row to get the next ticket, and then three
(0:15:52) Al: in a row, and then you have to-- so you essentially have to win, I think it's like 10 battles in a row,
(0:15:57) Al: and then you win a bunch of another currency that you use to buy something. So that's what I'm
(0:16:02) Al: what I'm doing just now, but it's pretty hard.
(0:16:04) Al: And the problem is that any time you lose you have to go all the way down to the beginning again
(0:16:04) Codey: Yeah.
(0:16:08) Al: Win one to get the next ticket and then win two to get the next
(0:16:08) Codey: Of course you do.
(0:16:12) Codey: Could you pay a premium currency to not lose your space?
(0:16:16) Codey: Oh, that's a that's a missed opportunity from them. They
(0:16:21) Al: you can grind out the lower tickets. So that's what I'm doing just now, like grinding out
(0:16:25) Al: as many of the silver tickets as I can so that I don't have to keep going back down.
(0:16:30) Al: And I can just like then grind out as many of the gold ones as possible. And then when
(0:16:35) Al: I eventually win the gold one, then I can like try and grind that for the infinity one.
(0:16:40) Al: I can't remember. And I've been I've been getting back into reading comics. So as as
(0:16:49) Al: As happens every year, I resubscribed.
(0:16:51) Al: For a year of Marvel Unlimited when I should actually use this and went and read a bunch
(0:16:57) Al: of comics. So I'm reading through the Ms. Marvel comics just now because I really like Ms. Marvel.
(0:17:03) Al: She's one of my favorite characters. And yeah, it's been good. I've just finished the Inhumans
(0:17:10) Al: versus X-Men comics line, which was good. I enjoyed that. But what I find really funny is,
(0:17:17) Al: as you're following stories. You come across characters that you're not
(0:17:21) Al: actively following, but you know some about. But then, because you've not been actively
(0:17:26) Al: following them in the comics, their status is completely different from what you would expect
(0:17:30) Al: it to be, right? And so you're like, "I need to find out why, for example, why is Cyclops a child
(0:17:30) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:17:35) Al: just now?" And so you look into the reasons for why Cyclops is a child, and you find out that
(0:17:36) Codey: Yeah, see
(0:17:40) Al: actually Cyclops went evil and died. And this is Cyclops from the past, who's now having to deal
(0:17:46) Al: with the fact that he knows that he grows up to be evil and dies.
(0:17:52) Codey: Yup, this is classic Marvel to me, because like I mean, it
(0:17:53) Al: Yeah.
(0:17:58) Codey: requires it's no longer like standalone, like it requires
(0:18:02) Codey: that you have seen everything. I remember going and seeing one
(0:18:05) Codey: of the most recent movies, like the multiverse of madness or
(0:18:10) Codey: whatever. And I was like, wait, why is Scarlet Witch bad and
(0:18:13) Codey: wait visions dead? And like it was just like, wait, what?
(0:18:13) Al: think yeah I mean I'm not I think I think this is just one of these things
(0:18:19) Al: where you just have to kind of if you're not willing to do everything you just
(0:18:23) Al: kind of have to accept that sometimes you won't know the current state of
(0:18:26) Al: things and you know I would go into these things I mean obviously I watch
(0:18:30) Al: all of the Marvel stuff like all the shows and films because it's not really
(0:18:32) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:18:34) Al: on the level of reading all the comics like reading all the comics is basically
(0:18:37) Al: impossible watching all the shows and TV series the films and TV series it's not
(0:18:37) Codey: Right
(0:18:42) Al: that difficult, right?
(0:18:43) Al: You have any sort of, like, time that you can do on a weekly basis. You can keep up
(0:18:47) Al: to date reasonably easily, if you want to. But, well, like, this year, for example, so
(0:18:49) Codey: No.
(0:18:50) Codey: I'm going to do a little bit of a
(0:18:54) Al: far we have had one 10-episode series in one film, so far, this year, and we're in September.
(0:19:03) Al: So it's not... that's not an unreasonable amount to try and keep up to date if you care
(0:19:07) Al: about it. And the TV series was, like, an animation anyway. It was unrelated to the
(0:19:11) Al: current multiverse, you don't have to pay attention.
(0:19:12) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:19:14) Al: There's one film, that's all that's been so far this year.
(0:19:16) Codey: Yeah, no, it's good wait was the one film that the Deadpool okay, I did
(0:19:17) Al: So, yeah, so I also enjoyed it. But yeah, so I don't, I think it's just kind of one of these
(0:19:29) Al: things we just have to accept if you're not willing to keep up with it. But why I find fun
(0:19:33) Al: about it in the comics is it's like, oh, this is a really weird situation. I just stop reading the
(0:19:38) Al: comic, go find out why this person is in this situation, and then come back. Because there's
(0:19:43) Al: a lot of explanations for most things. And you learn more about other storylines that you're
(0:19:44) Codey: Yeah, no, my ADHD, I would be like, huh, I want to know why this is the way it is.
(0:19:48) Al: not going to go and read.
(0:19:56) Codey: And then I'd read that and then be like, Oh, because he went evil.
(0:19:59) Codey: And I'd be like, huh, why did he do that?
(0:20:01) Codey: And then I'd go down that rabbit hole.
(0:20:03) Al: Yeah, and that's one way to do it as well, you know, and it just like each their own and maybe
(0:20:03) Codey: And then, yeah, that's, yeah.
(0:20:07) Al: you decide that means that you don't read comics and that's fine, you know? Like, um, that is,
(0:20:11) Codey: Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it.
(0:20:13) Al: I am enjoying it. It's good fun. So, uh, yeah. That's what we've been up to.
(0:20:19) Al: All right, time for some game news. First of all, Tales of the Shire has been delayed till 2025.
(0:20:26) Al: Uh, uh, yeah, the, they've not really.
(0:20:33) Al: Said much about it other than I want to make the game better. Um, the standard. Fine. Uh, but
(0:20:41) Al: they announced that just after, it's interesting. They announced it just after the announcement for
(0:20:45) Al: the announcement. Uh, but yeah, they announced that they are having a showcase on Hobbit day,
(0:20:54) Al: which is apparently a thing apparently has been a thing for years. Hobbit day, the 22nd of sort
(0:20:58) Codey: Oh, I wonder why it's Hobbit.
(0:21:07) Codey: I thought it was because it was his birthday, but it's
(0:21:09) Codey: There we go.
(0:21:10) Al: It's the birthday of Bilbo and Frodo.
(0:21:13) Codey: Make sense.
(0:21:13) Al: Interesting, I didn't realize I had the same birthday.
(0:21:15) Al: That's funny.
(0:21:16) Codey: Yep.
(0:21:17) Codey: Delayed.
(0:21:18) Codey: Delayed.
(0:21:21) Al: But yeah, we'll have some more news about that.
(0:21:23) Al: Maybe in the next episode, it's the 22nd, which is the Sunday.
(0:21:27) Al: I don't know if I want to wait till after that's been done.
(0:21:29) Al: We'll see.
(0:21:30) Al: I'll decide later.
(0:21:30) Codey: Mm-hmm. It's fine. It's not going anywhere clearly
(0:21:31) Al: We'll, we'll see.
(0:21:32) Al: We'll see.
(0:21:36) Al: No, I know, but you know, this is our, you know, up to date.
(0:21:40) Al: News podcast.
(0:21:40) Codey: You know what we should totally do listeners let me know if you think this would be funny if ever there's anything like that
(0:21:45) Codey: We're like we record or some news comes out after we record you could have a section. That's like the
(0:21:52) Codey: Breaking news and then you just like input that into the podcast, but you record it after their podcast
(0:21:58) Al: So my my hesitation on that is that that involves like setting up another called
(0:22:05) Codey: No, I'm just thinking like you have either you do it or you're like, hey,
(0:22:08) Codey: Cody, do a boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, breaking news about this news.
(0:22:12) Al: But I but I think the fun thing about this podcast
(0:22:16) Codey: I mean, people listen to me ramble by myself.
(0:22:20) Codey: It happens.
(0:22:22) Codey: It's not unenjoyable, I guess.
(0:22:23) Al: "Shookajoo Island have announced that they are delayed until early 2025."
(0:22:24) Codey: [LAUGH] Delayed.
(0:22:29) Codey: Woo!
(0:22:30) Al: I'm shocked about this one. I definitely didn't predict this one at all.
(0:22:30) Codey: Nope.
(0:22:37) Al: So, I mean they're using the excuse of a grant.
(0:22:43) Al: Okay, fine. But presumably the grant means that you can do something for the game that
(0:22:48) Al: you wanted to do for the game and have it in the release. So it's something you always want.
(0:22:53) Al: I just feel like this team, they just keep expanding the scope of the game.
(0:22:58) Al: Because they added loads of stretch goals in the Kickstarter campaign and they were all
(0:23:03) Al: things that just push out the release date. So, I wonder if this game will ever actually come out.
(0:23:06) Codey: Yep, these are all things that
(0:23:09) Codey: These are all things that could come out after the relief
(0:23:13) Al: Yep.
(0:23:14) Codey: But it's I mean, I think it's cool that they got money from the state that they live in in Germany
(0:23:19) Codey: I think that's really cool. Like the government's getting involved. I don't know how that happened
(0:23:24) Al: Yeah, I don't know if this is a thing in America or not, but it's a reasonably common thing
(0:23:29) Al: over here, where most countries have arts funds that they give out as grants to people.
(0:23:35) Codey: Nah, no, it's sports funds over here.
(0:23:40) Al: Oh, funny. See, if I go on to Kickstarter, every time I go on to Kickstarter there's a little
(0:23:44) Al: banner up at the top that says, I'm just loading it up, of course the banner doesn't appear the
(0:23:51) Al: one time I actually talk about it. Literally every saying I've ever gone to
(0:23:55) Al: this banner appears and it basically says something about their being. You can apply for
(0:24:00) Al: Creative Scotland funding. So that's the one that's obviously in Scotland. So yeah they all have,
(0:24:06) Al: most countries in certainly in Western Europe that I know of have similar sort of ideas where
(0:24:12) Al: there's a certain amount of their budget that they'll put towards arts funding.
(0:24:16) Codey: yep nope nothing here though I think it's cool on the home page of kickstarter there have been
(0:24:21) Codey: eight billion dollars put towards creative works wild look at us
(0:24:24) Al: Nice.
(0:24:29) Al: Yep, and they've also confirmed that their Switch version is started.
(0:24:34) Codey: - Yep.
(0:24:35) Al: So they're started the porting.
(0:24:37) Codey: - It's happening.
(0:24:39) Codey: - I think we need another delay, Al.
(0:24:42) Al: Well, next we have two Pixellia, who've announced they're delayed till 2025.
(0:24:48) Codey: Oh, oh, so happy, thank you, I needed that.
(0:24:53) Al: they are currently
(0:24:55) Al: targeting March, April next year.
(0:25:00) Al: So we'll see.
(0:25:01) Al: I like the wording there, right?
(0:25:03) Al: It's like, it's not we're planning to release then.
(0:25:06) Al: It's that that's our target.
(0:25:08) Al: And I think people are, I think people understand that difference in wording to
(0:25:14) Al: make it like, oh, that's kind of a wibbly, wobbly.
(0:25:16) Codey: Mm-hmm a little bit of a hand wavy deadline. I did love
(0:25:21) Codey: One of some of the reasons that they wanted to do it is they want to create
(0:25:24) Codey: Quote customization options free from gender, which I like
(0:25:30) Codey: Totally like that. I also like that. They wanted to quote add more crime
(0:25:35) Codey: opportunities
(0:25:36) Al: "Be gay, do crime", that's what you're saying, right?
(0:25:37) Codey: Be gay do crime
(0:25:43) Al: Was that just a really long way of getting to that phrase?
(0:25:45) Codey: I actually had
(0:25:46) Codey: not even thought be gay do crime you said it and I was like oh my god but yeah yeah be gay do crime
(0:25:55) Al: Oh dear, am I going to be brave enough to put that as the title for this episode?
(0:25:59) Codey: please please i'm gonna add it in to mention it and everything
(0:26:07) Al: Oh dear.
(0:26:08) Codey: too pixelly I think I think i've had it with delays though so let's maybe
(0:26:12) Al: Well, have I got an exciting update for you.
(0:26:15) Al: Gogotown have announced that their build and bustle update is technically not out right now,
(0:26:21) Al: but it will be out by the time this episode comes out.
(0:26:24) Al: I think it's out in like three or four hours as we're recording.
(0:26:28) Codey: Oh sweet, okay.
(0:26:30) Al: Because it's Monday in Australia.
(0:26:30) Codey: Which...
(0:26:33) Codey: Oh yeah.
(0:26:34) Codey: If I remember correctly, some of the things they're adding
(0:26:37) Codey: are things that you thought they should add, right?
(0:26:40) Al: Yes, so they are, big things about this are that they, so it's called the build and bustle update.
(0:26:49) Al: They have the ability to buy more land to expand the town, which is good. And they are again saying
(0:26:55) Al: that you can customize the industry zones. We still don't have a huge amount of detail of that
(0:26:59) Al: as far as I can see. They do talk about, I've seen something on their Twitter about moving
(0:27:05) Al: the items within the zone, but not about, I've not seen anything about,
(0:27:10) Al: moving the industry zone, which is, I mean, it could be just the one thing that makes me think
(0:27:18) Al: that might not be what they're doing is because there are big things that are like part of the
(0:27:22) Al: ground, right? Like there's a cave, which is part of the, which is the industry zone for the mining.
(0:27:27) Al: And it's like, are they actually moving the cave? I guess we'll find out when it actually comes out.
(0:27:31) Codey: They discovered a new cave that looks exactly like the old cave.
(0:27:35) Al: And the first cave filled itself in.
(0:27:38) Codey: And there, yep, the old cave. We just didn't like it anymore. It collapsed.
(0:27:41) Al: It just collapsed.
(0:27:44) Al: So yeah, I don't know. I mean, maybe they're just going,
(0:27:47) Al: "It doesn't matter. Suspension of disbelief. The cave will move."
(0:27:50) Codey: Yeah
(0:27:51) Al: Which they can do. I just don't know if they're going to or not. We'll see.
(0:27:56) Al: Hopefully we'll get some details pretty quickly after it comes out.
(0:27:59) Al: And the other big thing is they've added a subway system.
(0:28:04) Al: So you can have up to four lines on your subway, which is cool.
(0:28:10) Al: That's cool. Allowing people to get around the town more efficiently.
(0:28:14) Al: Because this was a little bit of my worry. If you make it bigger, which it needs to be bigger,
(0:28:15) Codey: Yeah.
(0:28:17) Al: but if you make it bigger, do you have a problem where nobody gets to the outer bits?
(0:28:22) Al: But hopefully, this just means that some of them will go to the stuff in the middle,
(0:28:27) Al: and some of them will immediately jump on the subway and go to different parts of the town.
(0:28:28) Codey: I guess, is the subway system like do you see yourself riding it or do you just be like
(0:28:37) Codey: I want to go over here and then it just like fades to black and then you're like yay I'm
(0:28:42) Codey: over here now.
(0:28:43) Al: I haven't seen any video of it happening, but I have seen there are some screenshots
(0:28:52) Al: of inside the subway station. So I feel like you're at least kind of going into the subway
(0:28:59) Al: and I guess we'll see what that means.
(0:29:02) Codey: I hope it's authentic in that one of the subway systems is really really dirty and has a lot
(0:29:09) Codey: of graffiti and then the central one is like pristine and clearly is the one that's actually
(0:29:15) Al: Not everywhere is the same as America, Cody.
(0:29:16) Codey: because I hope it's America realistic. America being a new verb that I just made.
(0:29:24) Al: We have exactly one subway system in Scotland, and it is very nice.
(0:29:29) Codey: It's not real.
(0:29:30) Al: It's the third oldest subway in the world, fun fact.
(0:29:32) Codey: That is super cool.
(0:29:33) Al: Yeah.
(0:29:34) Al: Do you know what two subways are older than it?
(0:29:37) Codey: London Underground, maybe?
(0:29:39) Al: That's one of them.
(0:29:40) Codey: Something in India.
(0:29:41) Al: Nope.
(0:29:42) Codey: Okay, I don't know, I give up.
(0:29:42) Al: I'm not gonna guess anymore
(0:29:45) Al: you just guess guess no I'm pretty sure it was Bucharest but I'm just double
(0:29:46) Codey: I genuinely don't, I genuinely don't know what else there was.
(0:29:54) Al: checking no not Bucharest I was wrong failed Budapest Budapest so I was so
(0:30:01) Codey: Though oh, yeah, okay cool
(0:30:07) Al: close same thing Budapest Bucharest ah
(0:30:09) Codey: Well, I love how I
(0:30:12) Codey: Love how your guys is
(0:30:14) Codey: Like more the OG than ours, but when people think of subway they think of our subways
(0:30:22) Al: Do they now?
(0:30:22) Codey: I mean if you ever see someone use a subway in any movie, it looks like
(0:30:27) Al: In American movies?
(0:30:28) Codey: The underworld movies which I think they're supposed to be
(0:30:32) Codey: have
(0:30:32) Al: What's that? Sorry, Underworld. It's an American film.
(0:30:35) Codey: It's okay, it's an American film, but it's not supposed to be in
(0:30:38) Al: Uh-huh.
(0:30:40) Al: I'm sorry, American people make films that have American-looking things and is not a surprise.
(0:30:48) Al: Is it now?
(0:30:48) Codey: Wes Craven is rolling over in his grave right now. Actually I don't know if he's dead. Anyway!
(0:30:48) Al: - Mm-hmm.
(0:30:49) Al: Mm-hmm.
(0:30:52) Al: They also are adding car parks and vehicle racks for all of your vehicles that you use, which is cool.
(0:31:00) Al: Because I mean, I was just like leaving them in the middle of the street.
(0:31:02) Al: I don't know what to do with this. It just goes there. So that's nice.
(0:31:06) Al: And a bunch of new items.
(0:31:10) Al: Well, so you have cars that are vehicles that you use and you have bikes that are vehicles that you use.
(0:31:16) Al: So one presumably is like, yeah, a car park is like a parking lot, as you would call it, yeah.
(0:31:16) Codey: OK.
(0:31:18) Codey: Cool.
(0:31:22) Al: It's a park for your car and the vehicle racks will be for bikes and trikes and stuff like that.
(0:31:28) Al: So, yeah, we'll see what that's like once it's out.
(0:31:32) Codey: a 1.1, I guess it wouldn't be a 1.1, but a second harvest.
(0:31:36) Al: Yeah, they're just calling it the build and bustle update, which is the major update one.
(0:31:42) Al: I don't know if they've got a version numbering scheme or not. I haven't looked. We'll see, probably.
(0:31:48) Codey: Don't look it's probably disappointing
(0:31:50) Codey: Cool no no don't look numbering schemes are awful
(0:31:52) Al: I mean, you know that I'm looking, right?
(0:31:56) Al: I can't find it. You're lucky. You're saved this time.
(0:31:59) Codey: It's for the best
(0:32:02) Al: Yeah, it probably is. Steam seems to be really kind of unsure as to how it actually shows you version numbers.
(0:32:08) Codey: aren't we all version numbers are just a myth. Oh no he found it.
(0:32:10) Al: Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
(0:32:12) Al: So minor update five was version number. Are you ready for this? 0.4, 0.53.
(0:32:22) Al: 0.16416EA.
(0:32:25) Codey: Oh, 'cause it's early access, right, right.
(0:32:30) Al: So it's yeah, I don't know why. So presumably this will be 0.5 because all of the minor updates have been 0.4 point something.
(0:32:40) Al: So 0.5 point zero point. And then the last bit is, I think, a build number.
(0:32:46) Al: So it'll be 0.5.0 point something.
(0:32:52) Al: You don't need to put the build number in your version number that you publish, just
(0:32:55) Al: letting you know, but fine, you can do what you want.
(0:32:58) Al: I'm not in charge of you.
(0:33:02) Al: Next we have, for some reason, a new paid DLC for Havrest Moon Winds of Anthos.
(0:33:07) Codey: It'll bring people in.
(0:33:08) Al: The Great Outdoors.
(0:33:11) Al: The weird thing I guess is that like, they've just released a new game, and now they're
(0:33:15) Al: releasing DLC for their console game rather than their mobile game, and yeah, I don't know.
(0:33:22) Codey: I mean, I like the idea of this DLC.
(0:33:22) Al: Yeah, sure, so it's a camping one, basically.
(0:33:28) Al: You can go out and first of all, you can find treasure out and about, but you can also camp,
(0:33:34) Al: so you can have a tent and camp wherever you are, so you don't have to go home to sleep,
(0:33:38) Al: which is cool.
(0:33:38) Codey: I do like that a lot.
(0:33:39) Al: We're like this, yeah.
(0:33:40) Codey: These games where you have to run all the way back home
(0:33:42) Al: Yeah, yep.
(0:33:42) Codey: are really flipping annoying.
(0:33:45) Al: It doesn't make the game fun, but it does, it would be, in a game that actually is fun
(0:33:50) Al: come to play, this would be a nice addition.
(0:33:52) Al: Look, if they want to make a game fun to play I will say it's fun to play. You can
(0:33:53) Codey: - The shade.
(0:34:02) Al: also take... Oh yes, so apparently they're also adding a new robot that will take care
(0:34:08) Al: of your pets and animals while you're away, so that's cool. And then you can also take
(0:34:14) Al: animals with you on your adventures, and I see there's a screenshot of you with a bear,
(0:34:20) Al: like just sitting by a big breath.
(0:34:22) Al: Brown bear. I don't think that's safe.
(0:34:22) Codey: Yep. They said that it's not 100% do not condone sitting next to a bear ever, mostly because then if something happens and if the bear attacks you, then it becomes the bear's problem, which is not great.
(0:34:39) Codey: Yeah, I like the idea. They all it also mentions that like depending on which pet like each pet has a different boost or like benefit of coming with you.
(0:34:49) Codey: no idea about the details of that, but maybe like.
(0:34:52) Codey: It's like, oh, if you bring this dog, this dog with you, they might find something.
(0:34:56) Codey: Or I don't know, but I think that's cool.
(0:35:01) Codey: And I just like the idea of not having to like end it at your house.
(0:35:05) Codey: Cause like, what if you're in the mines and you just really want to be in the mines,
(0:35:10) Codey: but it's getting to that time of night and you can just like go back to the
(0:35:12) Codey: entrance of the mines and just camp.
(0:35:14) Codey: And then when you open, when you like start the day again, you're just at your camp.
(0:35:18) Al: Yeah, I agree. I agree. The robot seems to be one that you put in your barn, and it will
(0:35:25) Al: do all the kind of tasks that you want it to do, which is, I mean, good, but, you know,
(0:35:30) Al: Stardew has had that for six years. So yeah, cool. That is coming out on the 3rd of October,
(0:35:37) Al: and it is $10. Also, I hope the robot isn't required to have the paid DLC. That's bad.
(0:35:40) Codey: I don't know if I'd pay that, but...
(0:35:46) Al: add quality of life improvements.
(0:35:49) Al: Add content in DLC, bad boo, don't do that.
(0:35:54) Al: Next we have the Lens Island controllers and Steam Deck update.
(0:35:58) Al: Hey Cody, can you guess what update, what this brings?
(0:36:02) Codey: I think that it brings gay crime.
(0:36:07) Codey: No, that's super cool.
(0:36:08) Codey: You've been wanting a steam deck compatibility, right?
(0:36:12) Al: Yes.
(0:36:12) Codey: Is this-- are you going to start playing it now?
(0:36:14) Al: Well, no, at this point, I'm just going to wait for 1.0, which is meant to come out,
(0:36:15) Codey: Yeah, that's-- I'm the same.
(0:36:17) Codey: I'm-- yeah.
(0:36:18) Al: this year, so it's definitely, yeah, no, I'm waiting for 1.0 at this point.
(0:36:19) Codey: Yeah.
(0:36:22) Codey: They're still making progress.
(0:36:23) Codey: It's really cool.
(0:36:25) Codey: They also have said that now, if you put a bed in the dungeon,
(0:36:30) Codey: This is a very...
(0:36:32) Codey: similar to what we were just talking about.
(0:36:33) Codey: If you put a bed in the dungeon, and then you die in the dungeon,
(0:36:36) Codey: you actually respawn in the bed instead of, like, all the way back at your house.
(0:36:39) Codey: Which is pretty neat.
(0:36:40) Codey: Uh, and then they also said that they fixed, um,
(0:36:44) Codey: apparently some of the enemies were targeting your bed,
(0:36:46) Codey: and would damage your bed.
(0:36:48) Codey: And, like, break your bed.
(0:36:48) Al: Hahahahaha!
(0:36:49) Codey: Which, honestly, kind of funny.
(0:36:50) Al: Don't break my badge!
(0:36:50) Al: Hahaha!
(0:36:51) Al: Hahaha!
(0:36:53) Codey: Kind of wish that was still in there.
(0:36:55) Codey: Like, you put a bed down, and then you gotta protect your bed.
(0:36:56) Al: Hahaha!
(0:37:00) Codey: I mean because if I was an enemy and i
(0:37:02) Codey: saw someone lay a bed down i'm tagging that bed down like you don't get to
(0:37:06) Codey: respawn there again you gotta go walk your butt all the way back to the
(0:37:09) Codey: beginning of the dungeon no no bed in the beginning but yeah
(0:37:13) Codey: no so the enemies will no longer target your bed
(0:37:16) Codey: um you can respawn I they just keep they're really on
(0:37:20) Codey: on it with these uh updates for this game and just
(0:37:23) Codey: it has come so far and i'm so excited to play it when it's a 1.0
(0:37:28) Al: Yeah, maybe this should be my, like, December game. Maybe. We'll see. I mean, I already own it,
(0:37:32) Codey: yeah
(0:37:35) Codey: yep
(0:37:35) Al: right? So I just need the time. So I think that I couldn't find this when I tried to look for it,
(0:37:40) Codey: happy holidays to you
(0:37:48) Al: but I'm pretty sure I saw somewhere that this was their last update before the 1.0.
(0:37:54) Al: But I can't, I couldn't find it when I tried to look for it. So maybe it was on Twitter or
(0:37:59) Al: I dare not speak the name of. Well, it's not the name of it, is it?
(0:38:01) Codey: after speaking the name of.
(0:38:04) Codey: Oh, you're right, you're right.
(0:38:07) Al: OK, and finally, we also have Danchi Days. So we mentioned this in the last episode. This is the
(0:38:15) Al: kind of Game Boy inspired 2D summer, Japanese summer game. They
(0:38:26) Al: replied on YouTube to say that they
(0:38:28) Al: have just launched their Steam page. So we'll have that as a link in the show notes for you,
(0:38:34) Al: and there's a few more kind of screenshots and stuff like that. And the new information I get
(0:38:40) Al: from this is they say the aim of the game is to invite 151 people to a summer festival.
(0:38:47) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:38:49) Codey: For a lot of people who play Game Boy games
(0:38:52) Codey: and hear the number 151, I don't think so.
(0:38:54) Al: Yep. Coincidental number? I probably think not.
(0:38:59) Codey: But it is cool.
(0:38:59) Codey: You are basically-- you use the internet and the social media
(0:39:03) Codey: to try and understand what those 151 people like.
(0:39:08) Codey: They are actual people.
(0:39:10) Codey: I mean, some of them might not be people.
(0:39:11) Codey: You have a duck buddy.
(0:39:13) Codey: But, um, oh.
(0:39:14) Al: Docks are people, T.
(0:39:16) Codey: Awwww.
(0:39:17) Codey: I'll be darned um so uh you use like social media and kind of like learn try and find see what
(0:39:25) Codey: people like and make sure that they have it at the event and befriend them and invite them to
(0:39:30) Codey: the summer event um it's basically teaching people to be um advertisers
(0:39:36) Al: Yeah and each of the different, so you have different the people you want to
(0:39:40) Al: invite all have different websites because it's very much set in the 90s
(0:39:43) Al: right? So everyone has to have their own website and they all seem to have quite
(0:39:47) Al: a lot of personalities so like there's someone who's an entrepreneur and then
(0:39:51) Al: there's someone who likes water and then there's someone who's like rules are
(0:39:54) Al: meaningless do whatever you want and they just have three buttons that say do
(0:39:57) Al: not press and then you can press the buttons. So yeah it looks like they're
(0:40:02) Al: all kind of quite unique, which is fun. I suspect 150.
(0:40:06) Al: One of them won't be unique, but there's at least, you know, some personality there, which is cool.
(0:40:07) Codey: Right.
(0:40:10) Codey: I did, it did make me laugh like looking at it
(0:40:12) Codey: 'cause it says it's a Y2K inspired game.
(0:40:15) Codey: And that,
(0:40:16) Al: Oh, so it does. Yeah, so not 90s. Sorry. 2000. I was I was close.
(0:40:19) Codey: yeah, I mean, that's late 90s.
(0:40:23) Codey: But yeah, it made me laugh like to see that
(0:40:23) Al: Don't do this. Don't do
(0:40:28) Codey: press any button you want, like style thing.
(0:40:31) Codey: 'Cause that era was the era of like the impossible game
(0:40:37) Codey: online that you were supposed to do
(0:40:39) Codey: all these different things.
(0:40:40) Codey: And if you do one thing wrong,
(0:40:41) Codey: you're set back to the beginning.
(0:40:42) Codey: And it was just really silly things,
(0:40:46) Codey: like hit the smallest circle
(0:40:49) Codey: and it's the dot on the eye and stuff like that.
(0:40:51) Codey: Or another game that was really popular at that time
(0:40:53) Codey: was Don't Shoot the Puppy.
(0:40:55) Codey: And it was literally, if you move your,
(0:40:58) Codey: you start the game and if you move your mouse
(0:40:59) Codey: that all this giant machine gun shoots a puppy.
(0:41:02) Codey: So you literally just have to like click the button
(0:41:04) Codey: and then do nothing until...
(0:41:07) Codey: you can click the button again and classic Y2K game so it captures the vibe
(0:41:11) Al: classic. We had one that we played in my school where we were - it was literally just
(0:41:19) Al: a button that you press and it increases the number, kind of like the one in the thing.
(0:41:23) Codey: Yeah like cookie clicker.
(0:41:23) Al: And so we would like all be sitting - yeah, it was kind of like a clip but there was no like
(0:41:27) Al: expansion to it. It was literally just number, one number, one click. And so we would like
(0:41:33) Al: try and play it like in our computing classes without the teacher noticing and just see who
(0:41:36) Al: who could get the biggest number in one period.
(0:41:41) Al: It was...
(0:41:42) Codey: back in our day kids you just clicked a button as many times as you could and that was entertainment
(0:41:48) Al: Or in the case of "Don't Shoot the Puppy" didn't click a button!
(0:41:51) Codey: or didn't click a button and that was and you just watched this puppy and it went in one of
(0:41:56) Codey: them it was like one of the things that like brought up the button that was like start the
(0:42:01) Codey: level or whatever and then you're like oh I forgot to click it and then you move the thing
(0:42:05) Codey: and then it shoots the puppy and it's like ah I didn't forget to click it it just got me
(0:42:09) Codey: me.
(0:42:10) Al: And then there was the stuff with like Webull's stuff, the cartoon, the flash.
(0:42:12) Codey: No, weebles.
(0:42:14) Al: Yeah, classic.
(0:42:16) Codey: Uh.
(0:42:17) Al: Anyway, we're going to stop being nostalgic here.
(0:42:19) Codey: What?
(0:42:23) Al: That's all the news.
(0:42:24) Codey: Whoo!
(0:42:26) Al: We do have three new games as well to cover.
(0:42:28) Codey: Whoo.
(0:42:31) Al: Wow.
(0:42:32) Al: First of all, we have Sea Sniffers.
(0:42:34) Al: All right, here we go.
(0:42:36) Al: Sea Sniffers is a cosy diving game in
(0:42:40) Al: the ocean with your trusty sea companion encounter strange creatures and exotic
(0:42:44) Al: treasures and nearly nearly said a different word than exotic in sunken
(0:42:49) Al: ships or hidden caves discover the deep sea and all its secrets.
(0:42:54) Al: And I need to do my usual don't call your game cosy.
(0:42:56) Al: You don't get to decide that.
(0:42:57) Al: Yeah.
(0:42:58) Codey: Also, don't call your game cozy
(0:42:58) Al: You.
(0:42:59) Codey: when that seal is throwing hands.
(0:43:03) Codey: That seal, like to fight off people
(0:43:07) Codey: but also to like harvest things,
(0:43:10) Codey: it just seems to punch.
(0:43:12) Al: It is an interesting level of cosy, I will say, in the, you know, obviously a game doesn't
(0:43:12) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:43:12) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:43:14) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:43:15) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(0:43:18) Al: have to be like 100% relaxing to count as cosy because, you know, stardew, you have
(0:43:23) Al: the mines and stuff like that, but it's like a storm where people are like shooting machine
(0:43:28) Al: guns.
(0:43:28) Codey: Yep
(0:43:29) Al: I don't know, man, cosy.
(0:43:31) Codey: It's as cozy as committing tax evasion or robbing a bank
(0:43:33) Al: Wait, look, look, I have never tried to claim that this podcast is about cosy games, not
(0:43:42) Al: I hate the term, but just because it's not, it's about whatever I want to talk about.
(0:43:46) Codey: Yeah, that's basically it he said it he said it you guys
(0:43:49) Al: Yeah, it looks cool, I mean, it's basically Day of the Diver, right?
(0:43:58) Codey: yep sure yep well you have a seal companion
(0:44:00) Al: But you're a seal.
(0:44:03) Al: But you are like controlling the seal underwater.
(0:44:04) Codey: it does see yes it does seem like when you're under the water you you become
(0:44:08) Al: Yeah.
(0:44:08) Codey: the seal you embody the seal and you throw hands it does look really really
(0:44:12) Codey: derpy it looks cute not gonna play it cute game though
(0:44:18) Al: I'm not going to say I'm not going to play it, I'm going to add it to my wishlist and
(0:44:21) Al: probably never play it.
(0:44:24) Al: Next we have garden trills.
(0:44:27) Al: Explore floating gardens as Tomy, a tiny sparrow.
(0:44:30) Al: Grow magical plants, meet other birds and get your wings dirty together to cultivate beautiful
(0:44:37) Al: places for you to peacefully fly around and discover all their secrets.
(0:44:41) Codey: --to cultivate exotic places.
(0:44:44) Codey: I really like this game.
(0:44:46) Codey: I like how it looks.
(0:44:47) Codey: It looks really cute.
(0:44:47) Codey: It just looks-- it has full controller support already.
(0:44:50) Codey: It says on there with Xbox controllers.
(0:44:55) Codey: And I guess what I did not look at is if it is metal.
(0:44:58) Codey: It is not.
(0:44:59) Codey: Boo.
(0:45:01) Codey: That's fine.
(0:45:01) Codey: I can come down here and play it.
(0:45:03) Codey: It's very cute, though.
(0:45:06) Codey: You and your other bird buddies help collaboratively
(0:45:12) Codey: hold a watering can between you and water things.
(0:45:18) Codey: As the bird, you get to pick where you want to plant things.
(0:45:20) Codey: Throw tomatoes at bird boxes, assuming
(0:45:24) Codey: that you're feeding people.
(0:45:25) Codey: But maybe you're pranking someone.
(0:45:26) Codey: I don't know.
(0:45:27) Al: Yeah, it's cute. Here's a fun fact for you. Do you know why it's Xbox controllers that
(0:45:34) Al: they specifically support? No. It is because the Steam Deck uses the same layout as an
(0:45:43) Al: Xbox controller. Yeah, probably. It does mean that I then have like three controllers that
(0:45:44) Codey: Well, I'm sure Microsoft is happy about that.
(0:45:50) Al: I'm regularly using, because I use my Switch, which is different from my PlayStation, which
(0:45:53) Codey: Yup, dude I feel that.
(0:45:54) Al: which is different from a steamed egg.
(0:45:58) Codey: I also like going between games, like going between Disney, Dreamlight Valley, and Coral
(0:46:02) Codey: Island.
(0:46:03) Codey: They have different mechanics and I'm just like ahh.
(0:46:03) Al: Oh, yeah, every time.
(0:46:06) Al: This is why I can't do gaily games, right?
(0:46:08) Al: Because I just have to play a game until I'm done, because otherwise I just can't play
(0:46:12) Al: it.
(0:46:14) Codey: 'cause I'm like, why isn't my inventory sorting?
(0:46:17) Codey: Oh, it's 'cause I'm using the wrong button combination.
(0:46:20) Al: Oh yeah the number of times when I went back into Coral Island that I accidentally put
(0:46:25) Al: all of my bag into out's chest and then it's like no because now I have to get it all back
(0:46:28) Codey: Yup.
(0:46:31) Al: into my bag in the right order because it's never going to put it in the order that I want it in.
(0:46:33) Codey: Yup.
(0:46:36) Codey: It never puts the sword by the pickaxe, that's how I want it.
(0:46:39) Al: Exactly and I'm like so there were multiple times where I was like how long have I had
(0:46:45) Al: in this day. It's like 10 a.m that's fine I'm reset setting the day it's quicker to reset.
(0:46:50) Al: At the day than it is to reorganize my bag.
(0:46:54) Codey: Well, we have one more game to cover before we really dive into Coral Island.
(0:46:57) Al: Yes yes yes yes well so Garden Trails comes out in December this year. So the final new game is
(0:47:05) Al: Pixel Cross Rune Factory. So like the Pixel Cross Story of Seasons this is a Pycross style game
(0:47:14) Al: and it's in the theme of Rune Factory rather than Story of Seasons this time.
(0:47:18) Codey: yep
(0:47:20) Al: It looks like in the background of the Story of Seasons when you had a farm that kind of built
(0:47:26) Al: itself up in the background over the days as you played. It looks like it's battles in the
(0:47:32) Al: background this time because I'm just seeing like battles. So yeah it's cool I'm sure it'll be fun
(0:47:38) Codey: Yep
(0:47:40) Al: just like the other one. Are you not a Pycross person?
(0:47:41) Codey: Sure, I'm not gonna say that but I trust you
(0:47:46) Codey: I'm a picross person, but I am NOT a rune factory human. I also play picross on my phone not on a console
(0:47:54) Al: Fair. Fair. Phone is a good place to play it.
(0:47:57) Codey: Yep, yep
(0:47:57) Al: I accept that.
(0:48:00) Al: All right, so that's all the news.
(0:48:03) Al: So we're now going to talk about Coral Island.
(0:48:05) Al: One point one.
(0:48:06) Codey: Whoo
(0:48:07) Al: So.
(0:48:09) Al: When I say that, I say we're going to talk about it in theory,
(0:48:13) Al: but I will say the most most of what the update we haven't actually played.
(0:48:18) Al: Now, for Cody, that's because they are very far back in the game, right?
(0:48:24) Codey: yep. Uh, kind of I played it very, um, like I played, I think I was in summer. Um, and
(0:48:25) Al: Did you did you play it properly before you got into it for this update?
(0:48:39) Codey: there was just a lot, I think I hit the end of the diving and I hit the end of the, like,
(0:48:45) Codey: there wasn't anything else to do with the mermaids. And I was like, Oh, this game's
(0:48:48) Codey: not finished yet. Set it down. Like walk away. So
(0:48:54) Codey: Yeah. So when I picked it up this time, I didn't start over anything. I just started
(0:48:59) Codey: back from where I was. Um, and so I started in like the beginning slash mid middle part
(0:49:06) Codey: of, um, summer. And now I'm in the middle of winter, correct.
(0:49:12) Al: I... So that's why you've played almost none of the features. The reason I've played almost
(0:49:17) Al: none of the features is because most of the features require you to be town rank A and
(0:49:22) Codey: Yep.
(0:49:23) Al: somehow despite having a hundred hours in this game and being in year four, I am still
(0:49:29) Al: town rank C. I'm not even town rank B. I don't... I have millions of money. Millions. I can
(0:49:34) Codey: Get better, noob.
(0:49:42) Al: buy anything. I don't have to do anything on my farm. I have it completely automated.
(0:49:48) Al: At the beginning of a season, I just have to buy seeds, throw them into my seed things,
(0:49:53) Al: and then every so often I check to see what it is harvested, right? Like I do literally
(0:49:57) Al: nothing. I do not sow any seeds. I do not sow any fertilizer. I do not water anything.
(0:50:02) Al: I don't even harvest. Like I can literally do one day every season. That's all I need
(0:50:04) Codey: Yep.
(0:50:04) Codey: Yeah.
(0:50:08) Al: to do. Right? One day every season you buy the seeds, you put them
(0:50:12) Al: in the seed dispenser and you take the stuff out of the harvested dirt. But somehow I'm
(0:50:17) Codey: Yep. Yep.
(0:50:20) Al: still down rank C. And it turns out it's because there are a lot of fish in this game,
(0:50:26) Codey: >> Yeah. There's no automating it.
(0:50:28) Al: and I don't like the fishing in this game. There's no automating it yet. And it's not
(0:50:33) Al: because the actual fishing minigame is fine, I don't have an issue with the fishing minigame,
(0:50:38) Al: I just find it really difficult to find the right fit.
(0:50:42) Al: Like I spent an entire day yesterday fishing in a spot
(0:50:48) Al: where salmon is available all day long and I didn't get a single salmon.
(0:50:52) Codey: I fished up like five salmon the other day.
(0:50:55) Al: Can I have a salmon please? And it's just, it's so frustrating just the RNG on fishing and on top
(0:50:57) Codey: I would love to give you a salmon.
(0:51:02) Codey: Yeah.
(0:51:03) Al: of that I find the insects really frustrating because they're so hard to find because it's
(0:51:10) Al: it's like, oh, it only spawns in.
(0:51:12) Al: In this one area, at this time of the day, on this weather.
(0:51:16) Al: But the problem is, you go there, and it's not there.
(0:51:18) Al: There's a different one.
(0:51:19) Al: And you have to wait till the next in-game day to try and find it again.
(0:51:22) Codey: do you not if you if you catch what's there it'll respond something new
(0:51:24) Al: I haven't found that.
(0:51:28) Codey: oh well
(0:51:29) Al: Like I feel like every time I go back, that's it.
(0:51:34) Al: I don't know if I'm not going far enough away, or I need to go in a building or something,
(0:51:39) Al: But like, I never come back to seeing more.
(0:51:42) Codey: Yeah, no, I so I mean, it's definitely like a timed thing because I was trying to catch
(0:51:48) Codey: Atlas moths are so flipping hard, dude, they're so fast. And so I was doing rounds for Atlas
(0:51:55) Codey: moths in the forest. But I did finally get one. And but yeah, it just it's you just have
(0:52:03) Codey: to like kind of I think, like you said, go pretty far away or give it some time. And
(0:52:08) Codey: things will respond where they are. Another thing, are you putting out any of the any
(0:52:12) Al: Yeah, I just keep getting the same stuff
(0:52:12) Codey: items? Yep. That is a that is an issue. That is a yes. And then do you use fish bait? Okay,
(0:52:22) Al: I tell you what, I also found out recently, like literally yesterday, I found out that
(0:52:23) Codey: that would probably help you with the salmon. Okay. Yes. That would also help you. No. Yep.
(0:52:30) Al: you can upgrade the fishing rod, but I didn't know this because it's not at the same place
(0:52:37) Al: you upgrade the other tools. It's at a random restaurant on the beach. You go to a restaurant
(0:52:39) Codey: Yep.
(0:52:44) Al: on the beach to upgrade both your fishing rod and your catching net. Why are they upgrade?
(0:52:48) Codey: Yep
(0:52:50) Al: a restaurant.
(0:52:52) Al: Why are they upgrading my fishing rod and net?
(0:52:52) Codey: Well, so I I just realized that recently as well
(0:52:56) Codey: I don't know if they added this in 1.1 or if this was always there and I just didn't notice
(0:53:02) Codey: Cuz yeah
(0:53:08) Codey: Yeah, I agree I don't think that it
(0:53:11) Codey: Was there and so I always was just like oh these never get better
(0:53:15) Codey: But they do you can upgrade them you use kelp
(0:53:18) Codey: I have a lot of for me it's the money I still I'm not in the tycoon era that
(0:53:22) Al: which I have hundreds of, that is not a problem for me.
(0:53:30) Codey: that you are in so
(0:53:32) Al: March? I saw 2,000 seeds at a time. That's how much I have. It's so automated. I love it.
(0:53:37) Codey: nope yep
(0:53:43) Codey: yep so yeah I think the the catching is a big thing and this is
(0:53:49) Codey: of the 1.1 features they all have a threshold to access them that is a little difficult to
(0:53:57) Codey: achieve so one of them yeah there are attractions that are supposed to bring in more people to
(0:54:04) Codey: your town and maybe like increase your ink further or I'm not and they give you some
(0:54:10) Codey: interactions other events or something with the townies so you get to increase their levels
(0:54:18) Codey: by attracting tourists but yeah you have to reach rank a and I think I'm also at c
(0:54:28) Codey: I do a lot of nice
(0:54:28) Al: I'm nearly at B. I'm like 50 points away from B. I'm so close.
(0:54:33) Codey: I yeah so I like it's it's it's it's attainable but it's it is difficult you have to put a lot
(0:54:40) Codey: of time into it to be able to to become rank a and even if like you're saying even if you're
(0:54:46) Codey: the master of farming.
(0:54:48) Codey: Like, that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be a rank A.
(0:54:51) Codey: It's pretty evenly weighted.
(0:54:52) Al: Yeah, but it just it just feels weird as well, because like I have let me just double check
(0:54:58) Al: the exact number because I don't feel like obviously I still have a lot of stuff to do,
(0:55:02) Al: but it doesn't it feels like I should be further along with how much I have in the museum.
(0:55:06) Al: I have a lot in the museum. And just for the record, I have come like my my ocean rating
(0:55:14) Al: is is a right like before 1.1. I'd done everything you could possibly do in the ocean. Right.
(0:55:16) Codey: Yeah
(0:55:19) Codey: Yep, mine is also a
(0:55:22) Al: So I have 212 things in the museum. But I feel like that's that's it feels like a lot
(0:55:24) Codey: I have like 240
(0:55:29) Al: of things. Come on. I'm not saying there isn't. But like, if you look at my rocks, one is
(0:55:29) Codey: No, no
(0:55:33) Codey: There's definitely more I mean I'm always
(0:55:39) Al: almost complete. Right. I almost I think I'm missing three rocks or gems, whatever you
(0:55:44) Al: call them. Fossils. Yeah, I'm probably not amazing on the fossils. But then if I go to
(0:55:49) Al: like the artifacts bit. Again, I'm
(0:55:52) Al: only missing like three or something. So yeah, I think it is just like insects, fish,
(0:56:01) Al: and fossils. I do.
(0:56:01) Codey: >> Do you have the computer OK because that's another thing
(0:56:05) Codey: I'm trying to get right now.
(0:56:06) Codey: The computer has attachments to just has attachments
(0:56:09) Codey: that tell you where fish what fish are available
(0:56:12) Codey: and I think where. Yeah.
(0:56:14) Al: It's basically just an in-game wiki, which it's fine, but the problem is I actually find the
(0:56:20) Al: wiki more helpful because you can have it up at the same time as you're out fishing,
(0:56:22) Codey: OK. Yeah.
(0:56:26) Al: right? But you can't have the computer. You can only just view the computer and then you go away
(0:56:31) Al: from the computer, right? So you have to remember what you saw on it. So I don't find it particularly
(0:56:36) Al: helpful. And also, like, it predicts what insects are going to be aware, but half the time it's
(0:56:42) Al: wrong. So it's just like, I think it's just telling you
(0:56:44) Al: the possibilities. It like shows you one item, like one
(0:56:48) Al: insect to each place you can go and and half the time it's
(0:56:50) Codey: Yeah.
(0:56:51) Codey: Hmm.
(0:56:52) Al: wrong. So I think it's like, I'm just giving you one of the
(0:56:57) Al: possible options, but then it doesn't always end up being
(0:56:59) Al: that. Whereas the fish, the fish, it gives you more
(0:57:02) Al: information. It's right. It's like, oh, in the morning, these
(0:57:05) Al: four fish are available in the evening, these four fish are
(0:57:08) Al: available, whatever. I just went into my aquarium in the
(0:57:11) Al: Museum and it feels quite full, like I know it's not, but it is.
(0:57:14) Codey: Yeah they so I like in the first season like I had put maybe like ten things in there or whatever
(0:57:14) Al: It doesn't feel empty.
(0:57:23) Codey: like in like butterflies and whatever and it populates multiple of the same species
(0:57:29) Codey: so that it looks very full. You can look in your gosh what is it called your journal maybe
(0:57:36) Al: Yeah, I know. I can do that. Yeah.
(0:57:36) Codey: to see what you've caught and see how many like empties there are
(0:57:40) Al: I know I can do that. I know I can do that.
(0:57:42) Al: It's more just a case of, like, I just I guess I was just surprised
(0:57:47) Al: when I looked at how much I have in the museum and how the museum feels pretty
(0:57:51) Al: full, how I can then go to the town hall, look at my rank and be like,
(0:57:56) Al: that seems low.
(0:57:58) Al: Like, I've finished, like, I've, you know, done most.
(0:58:01) Al: I've done most of the ocean stuff.
(0:58:03) Al: I've done most of the, like, I got rid of the,
(0:58:06) Al: like, evil people, you know, I have most of the gems and most of the artifacts.
(0:58:12) Al: Yeah, sure. I've not got all the fish.
(0:58:14) Al: But, you know, it feels feels like a minor thing.
(0:58:18) Al: And I'm sitting at rank C.
(0:58:20) Al: Like, that feels feels harsh.
(0:58:22) Codey: Yeah. I get it. Yeah. So that's that's. Yeah. So. Yeah.
(0:58:24) Al: And it's like you get like five, you get like five points for a fish putting it
(0:58:28) Al: into the museum. It's just it feels frustratingly slow, I guess, is the point.
(0:58:34) Al: Right? Like whereas because things.
(0:58:36) Al: Things in Stardew are based on the amount of time you've been in the game, right? So
(0:58:42) Al: things unlock in year two, things unlock in year three, things unlock in year four, rather
(0:58:47) Al: than unlocking based on your progress. It feels like if you play the game a lot, even
(0:58:51) Al: if you're not playing the game perfectly, you unlock things much quicker. Whereas here
(0:58:55) Al: you have to like min max the game to
(0:58:58) Codey: Yeah, I feel that way for sure so that is why we have not done the attractions yet
(0:59:06) Codey: The next thing is the Savannah. Did you make it to the Savannah Al?
(0:59:10) Al: so I didn't make it to the savannah either either and can you guess why that
(0:59:14) Codey: Because in order to get to the Savannah you have to have completed 18 of the
(0:59:21) Codey: not donations, but the like
(0:59:24) Codey: Lake Temple
(0:59:25) Codey: Sac not sacrifice either, but you know what I mean
(0:59:28) Al: I think we are yeah, I I can't remember the word to use it doesn't matter
(0:59:29) Codey: You
(0:59:31) Codey: But yeah, you have to complete 18 of them each of them have six that you can do so there's a total of 24
(0:59:38) Codey: So you would only be able to be missing six, but a lot of them it's like rare cooking rare artisan rare fish
(0:59:44) Al: Yeah.
(0:59:45) Codey: like things like that and a lot of them are really difficult to find and really difficult to get there's also often not an
(0:59:51) Codey: explanation for the recipes for some of these things so
(0:59:55) Codey: You gotta Google it, or try and figure it out.
(0:59:56) Al: So I have all of the first six, so the farming ones, I have all of them, because I just did
(0:59:58) Codey: Mm-hmm, yep.
(1:00:04) Al: them in my first year, because I'm like, "Well, I'm used to this from Stardew, this is easy."
(1:00:08) Codey: Okay. Yeah, that's the ranching and, uh, ranching. Yeah.
(1:00:10) Al: And I've got all of the third one, the third, all six of the third one, they're all done.
(1:00:14) Al: The fourth one, yeah, yeah, and there's some reasonably difficult stuff to get in there,
(1:00:19) Al: but I've got it all because I'm in year four.
(1:00:23) Al: I've got most of the stuff that matters.
(1:00:25) Al: Um
(1:00:26) Al: The fourth one is like the really hard stuff. So I think I've maybe got like two of them or something
(1:00:28) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:00:32) Al: So what's six twelve thirteen four? Yeah that I think I've got two of them
(1:00:36) Al: But the other ones are like I'm missing one or two items
(1:00:38) Codey: Yep.
(1:00:39) Al: Which annoyingly are things that you can only get from town rank a
(1:00:45) Codey: I didn't know that.
(1:00:46) Codey: Oh my gosh, wild.
(1:00:47) Al: Yep
(1:00:49) Al: So that so that's why I haven't completed them. So then what's left Cody?
(1:00:52) Codey: The fishing and the insect one.
(1:00:54) Al: fishing
(1:00:57) Al: fishing I have one of the animals one of the fishing and like that's that's it I don't
(1:01:00) Codey: Yeah.
(1:01:04) Al: so I need so i'm at 15 I need three more and so i'm trying to grind out those fish again
(1:01:06) Codey: What?
(1:01:08) Codey: Yeah.
(1:01:10) Codey: And one of those fish ones.
(1:01:11) Codey: So I did the classic thing where, I don't remember if I said this on the pot or not,
(1:01:15) Codey: where I wrote down everything that you need, like on a notebook that I have in front of
(1:01:20) Codey: me at all times.
(1:01:21) Codey: And I'm like, okay, I need this fish.
(1:01:23) Codey: And this fish comes out during this weather, during this season, during this time, whatever.
(1:01:28) Codey: One of the fish only comes out for the first seven days of fall.
(1:01:32) Al: I also, I feel like, so offering, they call them offering, by the way, so I have, I've
(1:01:34) Codey: So you can't finish that unless you catch it in that time frame.
(1:01:38) Codey: Aha! There we go.
(1:01:45) Al: caught, looking at the journal, I've caught about a third of all the fish, right? So,
(1:01:49) Al: I mean, it's not a huge amount, but it's not nothing, right? But almost none of them are
(1:01:55) Al: ones that I can offer. So if I actually look through the ones that I've caught, three of
(1:02:00) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:02:02) Al: them are in offerings. I've caught a third of the fish, and only three of them are offerings
(1:02:08) Al: ones. And it's insects, I've caught more than half of them, got more than half of them,
(1:02:13) Al: and it's, I think, seven of them are offerings. So I just, I think that they feel, with Stardew,
(1:02:21) Al: the kind of, the bundles, I feel like you just kind of naturally get them as you do everything,
(1:02:27) Al: and it feels like you're kind of building them up, even the fish one, it feels like you're
(1:02:32) Al: when it's here, it feels like almost none of the fish actually matter, right? There's only
(1:02:37) Al: like 10 fish that matter, and they're the most annoying, difficult ones to get. And so I feel
(1:02:42) Al: like I'm constantly fishing, I'm constantly getting the same fish that I've already caught,
(1:02:47) Al: even though there are fish I know at this time, and in this place that I can be catching. Now sure,
(1:02:52) Al: maybe I should be using the bait. I don't, I don't, I don't care. I don't.
(1:02:56) Codey: the bait all the bait does is so there's different size bait and the bait just
(1:03:02) Codey: attracts fish of different size so if you have medium bait that means fish
(1:03:06) Codey: that are in the quote-unquote medium fish category are more likely to get
(1:03:08) Al: OK. So it can help you narrow down if you've got specific fish you're trying to catch.
(1:03:16) Codey: Yes.
(1:03:17) Al: Right. Fine. Great. Fantastic. It just feels like you spend days fishing and getting no
(1:03:21) Codey: Yep.
(1:03:23) Al: progress for it. Neither in the museum nor in the offerings.
(1:03:24) Codey: Yeah, I get that.
(1:03:27) Codey: Yeah, well behind door number one, the Savannah, there is another temple there.
(1:03:29) Al: Yes. Yes. Let's actually talk about it because, like, we haven't played it, but we...
(1:03:38) Al: We can talk about it. So, yeah, it's cool in a concept, right? So, yeah, do you want
(1:03:39) Codey: Yeah.
(1:03:41) Codey: Yeah.
(1:03:43) Codey: you
(1:03:46) Codey: So I don't know a ton about all of it.
(1:03:47) Al: to talk about the Cave of Memories then?
(1:03:50) Codey: All I really know is that there is another thing that you can donate.
(1:03:50) Al: OK.
(1:03:53) Al: That's what that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think.
(1:03:56) Codey: Is that in the Cave of Memories?
(1:03:57) Codey: Is that what that is?
(1:04:00) Codey: Got it, I'm looking at it now.
(1:04:01) Codey: Quote, Cave of Memories is a cavern light cave that is located in the northwestern
(1:04:05) Codey: part of the savannah.
(1:04:05) Codey: In the cave, the player will be tasked to collect Gort's memory fragments for
(1:04:09) Codey: the quest, The Final Giant.
(1:04:11) Codey: So this is how you finish the Giant's quest.
(1:04:12) Al: It is, yeah, yep
(1:04:15) Codey: You can also find geodes and coffers.
(1:04:15) Al: Yeah, so have you have you unlocked the other the other giant the other giants?
(1:04:16) Codey: You can donate artifacts to him.
(1:04:19) Codey: The fire one yeah, so I am on the final giant and it says go to the savannah and I'm like I would
(1:04:24) Al: OK, so you've already got that one right, fair enough.
(1:04:26) Codey: I would love to go to the savannah
(1:04:28) Al: Yeah, I'm trying. I'm really trying to get to the savannah. Thank you!
(1:04:31) Codey: Promise you i'm trying to go to the savannah. Yeah, and so there it looks like your um
(1:04:37) Codey: You will be tasked to collect gourd's memory fragments. I'm assuming that's what like the artifacts. So you can donate artifacts to him. Um
(1:04:46) Codey: now whenever I find an artifact some of them have this like
(1:04:50) Codey: offered like
(1:04:52) Codey: That's unbolded or whatever like it can be offered but it's not offered to the lake temple. It's offered
(1:04:59) Codey: And I found out it was in the savannah. Um, but yeah, I can't do it. So he's um, yeah, i'm not sure
(1:05:06) Al: Yeah, I mean, I think it's basically just the continuation of the story, the finishing
(1:05:10) Al: of the giant story, which I would love to know, and I'll get there eventually. But the
(1:05:16) Al: other thing that Fanna gives you is you've got two more animals, you've got the ostrich
(1:05:20) Al: and the buffalo. So yeah, cool.
(1:05:23) Codey: It also says that there's more fernish.
(1:05:27) Al: What do I look like, a furniture person? Cool, enjoy your furniture.
(1:05:31) Codey: Cool, oh yeah, okay, yep.
(1:05:34) Codey: So that's the Savannah.
(1:05:37) Al: >> Yep, sure wish we could have played it.
(1:05:37) Codey: So that is, that would have been cool.
(1:05:39) Al: >> [LAUGH]
(1:05:40) Codey: I mean, I will still make it.
(1:05:41) Codey: I will say, you know, I know we're not done
(1:05:43) Codey: with this section or not,
(1:05:44) Codey: but I'm going to continue playing this game,
(1:05:46) Codey: even though there is a big old question mark
(1:05:50) Codey: about like a big old like roadblock frustration
(1:05:53) Codey: of like having to do all these things.
(1:05:54) Codey: I am still enjoying it.
(1:05:57) Codey: Underwater farming, did you make it to that?
(1:05:59) Al: No, purely because, like, I've looked at it and realistically, it's just farming, right?
(1:06:08) Al: Like, it's not fundamentally different from farming.
(1:06:11) Al: Yeah, sure, instead of watering, you, like, use a little light stick and you light it,
(1:06:17) Al: but it's essentially the same thing, and, you know, it's different crops and stuff.
(1:06:21) Al: It's a cool idea, but, yeah, no, I've not...
(1:06:24) Al: I didn't want to focus on trying to get to that, because I know how that works, you know,
(1:06:29) Al: whereas I actually wanted to try and get to turn rank A, and I failed.
(1:06:35) Al: So I've had the thing...
(1:06:36) Al: I think you have to go on the Starlet cruise first, which I've been invited to, I've just
(1:06:42) Al: not done yet.
(1:06:43) Al: So, like, I completed everything pre-1.1, and after a few days of 1.1, I got this invitation
(1:06:48) Al: to go on a cruise with them underwater, and I believe that's how you unlock the other
(1:06:54) Codey: okay I have not made it there yet they now that I'm a friend of the mermaids or
(1:07:01) Codey: whatever they want me to give them five osmium kelp essences which I have I got
(1:07:08) Codey: them for you man I could give you 20 I can give you so many I have so many of
(1:07:12) Codey: those but what I don't have is five osmium crops from like the land I don't
(1:07:19) Codey: have my farming up that level yet and so I.
(1:07:24) Codey: don't have those to give and so I don't I have not unlocked that aspect of
(1:07:30) Codey: everything which is really sad because I wanted to do more stuff in the merc
(1:07:33) Codey: kingdom I want to see if I can get it can you get a tattoo from Risi Risi
(1:07:38) Codey: Harvey Cerny
(1:07:39) Al: I haven't seen... I mean you can get a mermaid tail, so that's something. Have you got to that point?
(1:07:42) Codey: yeah
(1:07:45) Codey: hopefully you move faster when you have that tail
(1:07:47) Al: Oh, you're super fast. It's fantastic. I love it. I love it, it's fantastic.
(1:07:48) Codey: no I haven't gotten there yet because they
(1:07:53) Al: I was actually wrong. There is one other thing I need to do to unlock the Wunderwort farm.
(1:07:54) Codey: you
(1:07:57) Al: Can you guess what it is? It's townrankey.
(1:07:58) Codey: probably fishing no okay yeah
(1:08:04) Al: It's always either fishing or townrankey.
(1:08:05) Codey: which which is indirectly fishing yeah I really I just want because so there's a
(1:08:10) Al: Exactly, exactly.
(1:08:13) Codey: lot of places in the mermaid kingdom like they're all like wow you're our
(1:08:16) Codey: friend thank you so much for like helping us with this and every time you
(1:08:19) Codey: talk to them they're like wow I'm so thankful thank you but they won't let me
(1:08:22) Codey: in their buildings.
(1:08:24) Codey: because and it's because I don't have five osmium crops yet so I'm trying to
(1:08:28) Codey: increase my fish my farming to get that but it's one of those things that like
(1:08:33) Codey: you only get experience like farming experience or whatever when you're
(1:08:37) Codey: either hoeing the ground or harvesting and it takes a hot minute for things to
(1:08:44) Codey: be harvested because they have to grow so waiting so I've not done that yet
(1:08:50) Codey: There are cool, there's also underwater ranching and there's
(1:08:54) Codey: are different organisms that you can ranch underwater and they give things
(1:08:59) Codey: like pearls so it's just a whole new class of organisms things to sell.
(1:09:07) Codey: Another thing that was added to 1.1 we have we've got two more you guys are
(1:09:11) Codey: almost done spouse interactions hugging and kissing and gifts do you have you
(1:09:15) Codey: experience this. Oh okay
(1:09:15) Al: So yes, I have, because I am married in-game. And let me tell you, it doesn't really change much.
(1:09:23) Al: So my spouse still feels like a husk of a human being. It just means that I can go up and I can
(1:09:28) Al: hug and kiss them once a day, and then occasionally they'll have like a little exclamation mark above
(1:09:33) Al: their head, and you can accept the gift. Like it's not really... Yeah, it doesn't... No.
(1:09:40) Al: They still just stand in next to the bed and do.
(1:09:42) Codey: Yeah
(1:09:44) Al: Nothing. It's not what I'm looking for. Is it an improvement? Technically, yes, but it doesn't
(1:09:46) Codey: Uh-huh
(1:09:52) Al: feel good. Still, you know, I still feel like I've stolen her.
(1:09:53) Codey: Yeah
(1:09:56) Codey: The pets I will say I had a similar feeling about the pet. Oh, I do not have a spouse yet
(1:10:00) Codey: So have not experienced this. I will say that the pets now go outside
(1:10:02) Al: Hmm
(1:10:06) Codey: They leave their beds. They go
(1:10:09) Codey: outside and walk around. They're very cute.
(1:10:12) Codey: You can also have more pets now, so you can get three regular pets and one mythical pet.
(1:10:16) Al: I remember that time I bought 10 pet beds and then found out I couldn't buy any more
(1:10:17) Codey: Not entirely sure.
(1:10:20) Codey: Yeah, I have three pet beds. I bought three pet beds for the house and then I bought one
(1:10:22) Al: beds.
(1:10:26) Codey: of the outdoor beds, but for some reason it won't let me buy another pet. And I only have
(1:10:32) Codey: the Aussie dog, which I named Stella, and then I got the bearded dragon, which I named
(1:10:38) Codey: addy because I have an Aussie and a bearded dragon.
(1:10:42) Codey: It could and I'm only at sea so that's a possibility but it is cool that they
(1:10:42) Al: Could it be a tone rank thing?
(1:10:52) Codey: go outside they kind of wander around your farm so you get to see them out and
(1:10:55) Codey: about which feels better than them just sitting in their beds all day. I sure
(1:10:59) Codey: hope your spouse gets to leave the house.
(1:11:02) Al: Maybe that's 1.2, who knows?
(1:11:04) Codey: The last thing that we're going to feature about 1.1 that we were going to
(1:11:09) Codey: talk about is the hangouts. Have you experienced the hangouts?
(1:11:12) Al: Yeah, so they're fine. So I did one with my spouse and I did one with like another friend
(1:11:20) Al: and stuff and yeah, they're cool. They're a little kind of like cutscenes, essentially,
(1:11:25) Al: where you go and do a specific - you've got like a list of things you can do and you say,
(1:11:29) Al: let's go do this one. They're cool. They add a little bit of kind of character to the person
(1:11:34) Al: and it actually got my spouse out of the house. So that's something. Yeah, they're fun. There's
(1:11:40) Al: There's not something that I'm going to do often.
(1:11:42) Codey: - Yeah.
(1:11:42) Al: I think they add on, they gain friendship with the person.
(1:11:49) Al: So, you know, they're useful, but at this point, like, I'm married in game.
(1:11:55) Al: I don't really care about progressing friendship with other people at this point.
(1:12:00) Al: Maybe I will do if I get to the point where I've nearly completed all the achievements,
(1:12:04) Al: and that's one of the few remaining, like I did with Stardew Valley.
(1:12:08) Al: who knows but yeah um yeah they're nice
(1:12:12) Al: they're fun a nice new way like I i would have used it much more
(1:12:16) Al: before I got married but I got married before 1.1 so
(1:12:21) Codey: Yeah, I'm using it. I'm currently wooing Scott, Raj, Kenny and Pablo. So I use it to go talk to each of them.
(1:12:22) Al: a bit late
(1:12:30) Al: is that not just all of the male cat oh Raj is um non-binary aren't they
(1:12:33) Codey: No. Yeah, Raj is non binary. And there are a few other ones that I'm not interested in. I
(1:12:36) Al: um but
(1:12:40) Al: It was just such a long list.
(1:12:42) Al: Of course.
(1:12:42) Codey: so I like Scott because he's the museum guy. Like I'm a scientist, he's a scientist, whatever. He also reminds me of my my human partner and in the real so
(1:12:52) Codey: inter interested in that. Raj is a non binary coffee owner, coffee shop owner. I work at a coffee shop, and I'm queer. So you got me.
(1:13:05) Codey: Pablo, I just kept seeing him and he kept being so sweet. And I think there was a cut scene because it says that he's a bit of a flirt. There was a cut
(1:13:13) Codey: scene where he flirted a little bit with me as I was just talking to him as ever as I went to the blacksmith. And I was like,
(1:13:21) Codey: And so he's joined the ranks of the potentials. Some of them have fallen. So I had one of the gosh out not Alice. Yes. So I also had Alice, I believe
(1:13:26) Al: The list... I'm sorry, the list was longer.
(1:13:37) Codey: whatever sister whatever twin has the purple hair and has a child that one she was she was on my list. But I tried to give her a bug and she was like
(1:13:51) Codey: No, thank you. And I was like, Well, you're, you're gone. Nevermind. I was gonna say I think it's Suki. But so I'm not she doesn't like bugs. So I'm not interested in her anymore.
(1:13:54) Al: Oh, it's not Alice, it's Suki Suki, is there?
(1:13:57) Al: Yeah.
(1:13:58) Al: She doesn't like bugs! Oh no! Disaster.
(1:14:02) Codey: And then Kenny, I just saw him one day, he was playing music for the animals. And I was like, This is so sweet. I want to give this guy some cheese. So I brought him some cheese. And then he was like, Oh, thank you. But I don't eat animal products. And I was like, Oh, my god, I love you. So now he's in the running.
(1:14:21) Codey: And he's not gonna win. It's gonna be 100%. It's gonna be between Scott and Raj. We'll see who wins. Yeah, I'm not entirely sure at this point. So yeah, I've been hanging out with all four of those people, you can do it, similar to giving them gifts, you can only do it twice a week. So it's nice, because I get to, you know, like, rotate them. You know, do one a day, and maybe one day do two. Just kind of play the field a little bit, you know, but yeah,
(1:14:51) Codey: I also have gained an appreciation of Eleanor, who is the older woman who works in the museum with Scott. She kept, I would just go talk to her anytime I want to go talk to Scott, like, well, she's right here, I'll talk to her too. And at one point, she said that she was she had discovered a new ant species. And I was like, Oh, my god, this is amazing. And so I brought her an insect. And she was like, How did you know I would love this? So now every time I see her, I give her an insect and she is, I connect with her.
(1:15:21) Codey: So I do. Yeah, no one, none of the ever got none of the guys. Yeah, no one no one likes insects other than other than Eleanor. Well, and that's the thing is I dropped Suki before I realized that no one likes insects. And then I was like, Oh, well, too bad. You're that bridge is burned. Even though she doesn't care. I could probably just go talk to her again. It doesn't matter.
(1:15:23) Al: I think she's the only person that likes the insects.
(1:15:47) Codey: So yeah, I try and give owner everything and I'm gonna try and increase my
(1:15:51) Codey: friendship with her and I'm so excited to get to hang out with her at the
(1:15:54) Codey: museum. Um, but I think you have to be at friend level three before you can start
(1:16:01) Codey: hanging out with people and you can hang out, I think with any one, or maybe it's
(1:16:06) Codey: only the dateable, but there are some parts, some like hangout options cause
(1:16:06) Al: Yeah. No, I don't think it's just the data.
(1:16:12) Codey: even it's like hang out at the cafe and there's like, or at the town. Yeah, but
(1:16:16) Al: Yeah, some of them are more romantic than others, I think.
(1:16:19) Codey: There's also some, like one of them's hanging out
(1:16:21) Codey: ranching area and it's like either go fishing or pet the animals or like
(1:16:26) Codey: there's different things you can do it's not just one thing and then there
(1:16:30) Codey: are some that are locked behind like oh this only works if you're at like seven
(1:16:35) Codey: hearts with a romanceable character
(1:16:38) Al: So, I just double checked. So, there's normal hangouts and there's date hangouts,
(1:16:40) Codey: there we go
(1:16:42) Al: and they're probably pretty obvious. Yeah, so, as far as I can see, it's just the
(1:16:49) Al: romanceable ones you can date, but I don't see any difference in the level of friendship
(1:16:50) Codey: Yeah.
(1:16:54) Al: between them. I think it's just, if they're high enough level, you can do either normal or both,
(1:16:59) Codey: The date ones.
(1:17:01) Codey: Yeah.
(1:17:02) Al: if they're a romanceable one.
(1:17:03) Codey: So I just I really like the hangouts feature because that is one thing that I think is missing has been missing is the ability to just like go hang out with a character and it usually it tells you how many hours of in game time it's going to take.
(1:17:18) Codey: And you just see you see you in that character walking around laughing and like you know looking in the museum looking at all the different exhibits being surprised by something you know it's just it's cool to think about instead.
(1:17:29) Codey: Instead of just coming up to these people and being like hi here's a gift goodbye you know you actually have a meaningful like.
(1:17:38) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I really like about it as well is, so first of all, the list of
(1:17:42) Al: non-date hangouts, the normal hangouts, is longer than the date hangout list. So it's
(1:17:46) Codey: Yeah, yep
(1:17:48) Al: not like, oh, it's a romance thing, but also, I guess, we should put some other ones in,
(1:17:54) Al: right? Like, there's a lot of friend-based ones, which is cool, because a lot of these
(1:18:00) Al: games are just like, oh, you know, it's all about the romance and we don't care about
(1:18:06) Al: anything else. So that's cool.
(1:18:09) Al: And the other things are that there's quite a selection of them, both in terms
(1:18:15) Al: of different things, but also in how much they cost, including a bunch that are free.
(1:18:20) Al: So I think that's cool, like quite a wide variety of diversity in hangouts.
(1:18:22) Codey: Well, I think that's the thing is like, like one of them is like, go play chess somewhere
(1:18:30) Codey: and it's free or go get a taco and it's 20 bucks because yeah, you're going to spend
(1:18:32) Al: yeah yeah yeah or you can do like 350 for the romantic dinner or the hot air
(1:18:36) Codey: money at the taco truck.
(1:18:38) Codey: Like, so yeah, yeah, like you're going to pay for things like that, but some of them
(1:18:44) Al: balloon ride stuff like that
(1:18:47) Codey: are just walk through the forest.
(1:18:52) Al: There's capybara feeding. I haven't done that yet. That's in the bamboo forest.
(1:18:52) Codey: Oh, I haven't gone there yet. How do you unlock it? Yeah, okay. Yeah, one day. Did
(1:18:58) Al: Unlock the bamboo forest. Ten things at the Lake Temple.
(1:19:04) Al: So you'll get there.
(1:19:08) Codey: you have anything else to talk about with 1.1?
(1:19:10) Al: I don't think so. I think I don't think so, and then continue to talk.
(1:19:14) Al: Nothing specific about the features. The other thing I do want to just talk about is
(1:19:20) Al: This is...
(1:19:22) Al: And Stardew has done the same thing, right? Where some of the updates are
(1:19:26) Al: end game stuff and some of the updates are things that happen throughout and that's fine.
(1:19:31) Al: Um, I think it just... I wish I'd kind of gotten further in the game before this. I wish I'd done
(1:19:37) Al: more fishing, you know, because it would have been nice to be able to do more of this stuff quicker
(1:19:42) Al: because I guess part of the problem is I put the game down because I was like,
(1:19:46) Al: I feel I've done everything in the game that I care about. Yes, you'd have not finished all
(1:19:50) Al: the fishing but that's what and for all
(1:19:52) Al: of these things to be locked behind Town Rank A just feels like I have to grind through
(1:19:57) Al: something I'm not enjoying to get to the other things that I might enjoy and that doesn't
(1:20:02) Al: feel great.
(1:20:03) Codey: I do remember that being a complaint that we had when the game first came out that like you can't just do one part like you can't just focus on the diving or whatever because there's part of the diving that to upgrade some of your stuff you have to get or so you have to go to the mines but then to to get to them like to survive the minds you have to have food and it's just like it make it kind of like forces you to do all of the components of the game which makes sense but I think that
(1:20:23) Al: - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
(1:20:33) Codey: one thing that would be cool is if it just wasn't if it wasn't rank a if it was just like just lower that threshold
(1:20:38) Al: Well, yeah, I think I get why they do this, but I really like in Stardew how you can go.
(1:20:44) Al: You know what?
(1:20:45) Al: I've done this style of game.
(1:20:47) Al: Let me do that.
(1:20:48) Al: I just have a lot of money and I spend money on to unlock everything.
(1:20:51) Al: Right.
(1:20:52) Al: And that's what you do.
(1:20:53) Al: If you run the Georgia route.
(1:20:54) Al: Now I know that people are like, well, it's a different way of playing and I don't think
(1:20:59) Al: it should be people's default, but it is fun to do.
(1:21:02) Al: And I would really love to have just gone, you know what?
(1:21:04) Al: Can I just buy my way to town, Ranky?
(1:21:08) Al: It's nice as an option.
(1:21:11) Al: Not the default, sure, but a way to be able to do like, you know, yeah, sure.
(1:21:16) Al: I might need to put fish in the museum, but why do I have to fish them up myself?
(1:21:20) Al: I have a lot of money, you know, like let's not pretend like this isn't a capitalist game.
(1:21:24) Al: It is a capitalist game.
(1:21:25) Al: And a lot of, you know, it's not it's it's about, you know, creating a nicer world within
(1:21:30) Al: the system that exists.
(1:21:32) Al: Right.
(1:21:33) Al: Like it's not it's not about necessarily just enriching yourself.
(1:21:36) Al: like let's not
(1:21:38) Al: pretend if I was in this town and I had ten million dollars I would not be
(1:21:44) Al: fishing I would be paying someone else to fish to put in the museum let's not
(1:21:49) Al: have any two ways about it I as a millionaire multimillionaire would not
(1:21:54) Al: be doing that so like you can be like oh well it's it's this way of playing
(1:21:58) Al: that's fine that's fine but it's the frustration is that you have to do that
(1:22:04) Al: way. Whereas, you know, in
(1:22:08) Al: Stardew Valley, there's ways to get around almost everything, which I like. So, if you're
(1:22:12) Codey: Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Well, I have a frustration to air if I may.
(1:22:15) Al: not a huge fan of this, you don't have to. So, that's my frustration.
(1:22:21) Al: Yes, go complain about it. Away you go.
(1:22:27) Codey: Xbox cloud gaming is the worst thing. So I legitimately was I
(1:22:36) Codey: was playing for like, one day, one one in game day the other
(1:22:40) Codey: other day and I got disconnected.
(1:22:42) Codey: And sometimes you get disconnected it's just like up you were disconnected and you just have to reconnect and so you hit the reconnect button and then it like starts up cloud gaming again and then it just comes back and it's like you paused the game totally fine but there are also times when
(1:23:03) Codey: it's like up you're disconnected and then you start the game back up and then it starts the like welcome screen. This happened during the game.
(1:23:12) Codey: During the harvest festival after I had completed all of the things and I was about to start the harvest festival and I did look it up that is a bug but it was apparently a bug that was supposed to be fixed so I don't know if it was that or if it was just that I lost service or what but cloud gaming sucks.
(1:23:29) Codey: The game is not available on just Xbox in general like I can't buy it to just play it because I was like screw this I'm just going to I'm just going to buy it. I'm literally just going to spend however like however much it is.
(1:23:42) Codey: I'm just going to buy it because I do enjoy the game. I do want to play it and continue to play it, but it is not available for purchase on Xbox. You literally have to play it through cloud gaming.
(1:23:53) Al: weird and you can't you can't even download it on the xbox
(1:23:54) Codey: Yes, have to play it through cloud gaming.
(1:23:59) Codey: Nope, I don't think so.
(1:24:01) Al: so what what xbox do you have
(1:24:02) Codey: I have an Xbox one.
(1:24:04) Al: ah that's what it is then you can you can purchase it and you can
(1:24:09) Al: download it with game pass on the series x or series s
(1:24:14) Al: but I don't think I think not I don't think all games
(1:24:17) Al: I think you can with some on game pass on the one you can confirm
(1:24:21) Al: If there's anything you've managed to download...
(1:24:23) Al: ...that way but yeah I don't think I think it's basically they don't have to support that console...
(1:24:29) Al: ...but if they don't support the console it works through cloud gaming which will be why so yeah if you wanted to buy it you'd have to get us.
(1:24:32) Codey: Yup.
(1:24:38) Codey: Yup.
(1:24:38) Codey: Yeah, someone said, I'm looking it up.
(1:24:41) Codey: It says, you know, can't download it and play it locally,
(1:24:45) Codey: but you can play it through Cloud Gaming.
(1:24:47) Codey: And I'm not-- why?
(1:24:48) Codey: If I can play it through Cloud Gaming, why can I not?
(1:24:52) Al: Well, do you want the reason? Do you want the technical reason or not?
(1:24:55) Codey: No, I'm just--
(1:24:56) Codey: I'm just mad.
(1:24:58) Codey: Uh--
(1:24:58) Al: Yeah. I see that's frustrating, but I mean, the alternative would either be...
(1:25:03) Al: It would never support the one, right? Because they're never going to put in the effort to make
(1:25:06) Al: it support the Xbox One. So the alternative would be you just couldn't play it because
(1:25:07) Codey: Right.
(1:25:11) Codey: Right.
(1:25:12) Al: it wouldn't be on cloud gaming. It's rubbish. I'm not trying to justify it.
(1:25:14) Codey: But it's also like, right.
(1:25:18) Codey: I also don't think, so say I do, I'm not gonna do this.
(1:25:22) Codey: Say I do buy an X or an S, I think I have to start it from scratch.
(1:25:27) Codey: I don't think the save would transfer.
(1:25:29) Codey: I don't think the save is gonna transfer to anything.
(1:25:33) Codey: I'm just gonna keep struggling, I guess.
(1:25:36) Al: I don't know, that's a good question.
(1:25:39) Codey: But yeah, don't like that.
(1:25:40) Codey: Don't like that, they have the compatibility to play on one, but not to have it beyond.
(1:25:48) Codey: So that was my rant.
(1:25:50) Codey: I guess the rant would be, if you have an Xbox One and you are thinking about playing
(1:25:54) Codey: this game and that is the only way that you are thinking about playing this game, don't.
(1:25:58) Al: Yeah, you have to have really good internet and be physically close to one of the cloud
(1:25:59) Codey: Wait until it comes out for Switch.
(1:26:08) Al: gaming servers for it to work really well. And even then, it's still not... I had a pretty
(1:26:10) Codey: - Yeah.
(1:26:15) Al: good experience with it playing Dreamlight Valley on my Steam Deck, but it's still not...
(1:26:21) Al: You can tell you're not playing it locally, and it's just a little bit... It's uncanny
(1:26:26) Al: Valley. You know, it's just very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
(1:26:29) Al: slightly slower than you would want it to be. But you're not noticing it being slow,
(1:26:34) Al: it's just your brain has a hard time with it.
(1:26:34) Codey: Yep, yep, I also play Dreamlight Valley on that but it disconnects a lot more rarely
(1:26:43) Codey: and so it I just
(1:26:49) Codey: Just
(1:26:51) Codey: So yeah, I wish that it was
(1:26:56) Codey: Not the way that it is, but if it comes to steam I will start over I will start the game over. Sorry, sweet.
(1:27:00) Al: A's on Steam. Oh, switch. Uh, yeah. I don't know. I don't know.
(1:27:05) Codey: >> [LAUGH] Yeah, it's a big old question mark because of all of the stuff.
(1:27:09) Codey: So we'll see what happens, but it's an amazing game, I love it.
(1:27:14) Codey: I don't play games on this computer that's down here anymore because it's
(1:27:18) Codey: out of sight, out of mind, maybe when this computer gets moved back up to upstairs.
(1:27:24) Al: Yeah, I mean, I still really like this game as well. I'm not trying to claim it's better
(1:27:28) Al: than Stardew now. But yeah, I mean, it's still one of the best, right? It's still really
(1:27:30) Codey: You've rolled that back.
(1:27:35) Al: good. And if you don't like Stardew's graphics, right, if you're not a huge pixel art fan,
(1:27:42) Al: which there are some people out there, you want some more modern graphics, that's fine.
(1:27:47) Al: This is a really good alternative. It is super fun. You know, they really do care about a
(1:27:54) Al: it's not perfect, but they're still working on it. And hopefully they'll improve some more things.
(1:27:59) Al: And yeah, I just just got to push past the face. Like do all of the things, right? I just kind of
(1:28:04) Al: ignored fishing for ages. Don't do that. Because then you'll end up in year four as town rank
(1:28:06) Codey: Yep. Yep. Yeah, for sure.
(1:28:09) Al: C with no fish. So fish as you go, fish as you go. Cool. Well, thank you, Cody, for joining me to
(1:28:19) Al: to talk about Coral Island 1.1.
(1:28:20) Codey: Yeah, maybe one day we will actually have played a lot of the stuff.
(1:28:24) Al: >> [LAUGH]
(1:28:26) Codey: Been been able to access all these things once we're past town rank A and
(1:28:30) Codey: done all the cool stuff so that we can actually talk about 1.1 from experience,
(1:28:35) Codey: But it was really fun.
(1:28:36) Codey: And I'm going to continue playing it and still curse out cloud gaming and curse its
(1:28:42) Codey: name to the skies.
(1:28:44) Codey: But yeah, thanks for having me.
