# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al,
(0:00:36) Codey: My name is Cody.
(0:00:37) Al: and we are here today to talk about title score games.
(0:00:41) Codey: Woo!
(0:00:43) Al: As usual, transcripts are available in the show notes and on the website.
(0:00:47) Al: I feel like I should just stop saying that because people know, right? Like they're there.
(0:00:50) Codey: but then the next episode is going to be the one where they're like,
(0:00:54) Codey: it would be really cool if you guys had transcripts.
(0:00:56) Al: Yeah, yeah, I just like it's there. It's right there. You can see.
(0:01:00) Codey: Maybe, maybe you could say it at the end.
(0:01:00) Al: It's right here. Anyway, I'm kind of pointless then, right?
(0:01:03) Codey: I don't know. Listeners, tell us, listeners, tell us what you want.
(0:01:07) Codey: Do you want us to say it?
(0:01:08) Codey: Do you want us to not say it? Do you want?
(0:01:10) Al: Listeners who are already listening. Not really, not really useful then.
(0:01:15) Al: Hi Cody, we're going to talk about Office Cat, which is some mobile game that Cody found and said,
(0:01:20) Al: let's do this one. And I went, yeah, sure, fine. I like cats and they're in suits. So let's do that.
(0:01:24) Codey: Yep, yeah, they're in little suits. Yeah, I love how you're blaming me for this.
(0:01:28) Al: So we're going to --
(0:01:30) Al: I'm absolutely blaming you for this.
(0:01:35) Al: So yeah, we're going to talk about that. Before that, we have some news,
(0:01:39) Al: a good selection of fun news. But first of all, Cody, what have you been up to?
(0:01:44) Codey: I am still PHD-ing, as always, but this last week- was it last- yeah, last week- time is an illusion.
(0:01:52) Al: - Well, well, when this comes out, it will be more, we can have it.
(0:01:54) Codey: Last weekend- two weekends ago, I was Pokemon Go Fest in New York City, so I got to go hang out with some lovely humans from the It's Super Effective crew and the GoCast crew as well.
(0:02:11) Codey: Um, and just got to just tromble.
(0:02:14) Codey: All over New York city, play some Pookie mains, tromped, we tromped.
(0:02:16) Al: Trump. That's an interesting word. Trump. Trump-a-Trump-a-Trump.
(0:02:21) Codey: Um, and in classic Cody fashion, I left the tote bag I was going to bring with my portable
(0:02:29) Codey: charger and right next to my hiking boots.
(0:02:32) Codey: So I wore Converse the whole weekend, which was not great for my feet.
(0:02:36) Codey: Uh, and then we also had to go buy a new portable shirt.
(0:02:41) Codey: Uh, but we... [laughs]
(0:02:41) Al: Woo! (laughs)
(0:02:45) Codey: I was like, "Oh, yeah, right."
(0:02:47) Codey: Um, and on Saturday, I forgot to take my meds.
(0:02:49) Codey: So it was a great time.
(0:02:50) Al: Woo! (laughs)
(0:02:51) Codey: Uh, whew!
(0:02:52) Codey: Done at its end.
(0:02:53) Codey: It was super worth it, but it was a time.
(0:02:56) Codey: Um, listeners, if you play that game,
(0:02:59) Codey: you probably have heard that it was warm.
(0:03:04) Codey: Uh, but other than that,
(0:03:06) Codey: I've been playing, of course, Office Cat.
(0:03:08) Codey: Um, I'm back into Disney Dreamlight Valley.
(0:03:11) Codey: They've... they got me again.
(0:03:11) Al: Ah, they got you.
(0:03:13) Codey: Well, because they added.
(0:03:13) Al: Mulan captured you.
(0:03:14) Codey: Mulan, yep. And all of the Mo so the Mulan star path, I think
(0:03:17) Codey: it's called like majesty and Mongolia, not Mongolia as wow,
(0:03:23) Codey: magnolias. I'm close, but no. It's all got really that star
(0:03:31) Codey: path has really good rewards. And since I've been playing my
(0:03:34) Codey: game since the beginning, I still have a heck ton of the
(0:03:37) Codey: moonstone from like that you just get for free from playing,
(0:03:41) Codey: but they would also just be like, oh, no, that event.
(0:03:44) Codey: It was a little buggy.
(0:03:45) Codey: Here's a thousand moonstone for no reason.
(0:03:48) Codey: So paying $2,500 or 2,500 moonstone for access to all of the rewards from that was worth it.
(0:03:57) Codey: So I've just been going through and trying to get all of that and trying to get
(0:04:00) Codey: Mulan and Mushu up to max.
(0:04:03) Codey: Also, Remy has started doing like daily cooking quests, which is great.
(0:04:11) Codey: I'm really trying 100% this game.
(0:04:14) Codey: Get the harvest 999 coconuts and harvest all of this.
(0:04:19) Codey: And I'm trying to get all of those achievements.
(0:04:21) Codey: I don't know why they just tickle my brain.
(0:04:25) Codey: I also, because I finished that one other game, Powerwash Simulator, but didn't, well,
(0:04:31) Codey: I haven't 100%ed that.
(0:04:32) Codey: That's also on my to-do list.
(0:04:34) Codey: But one of my friends was like, heavy-tried SnowRunner.
(0:04:37) Codey: So I'm playing SnowRunner now, which is where you are basically an ice road trucker in Alaska.
(0:04:44) Codey: And someone is like, oh, no, I'm stuck in the snow.
(0:04:48) Codey: And so you bring like a semi up to them and pull them out.
(0:04:53) Codey: Learning how to drive semi, it's not going to do it in real life, though.
(0:04:59) Codey: Yeah, that's that.
(0:05:00) Codey: What have you been up to, Al?
(0:05:01) Al: I, obviously, have been playing Office Cat as well. I have been playing Dave the Diver.
(0:05:08) Al: I feel like I've mentioned that many, many times in a row, but there we go. I played
(0:05:11) Al: Dave the Diver. I actually finished it. I finished the game yesterday as we're recording, which
(0:05:17) Al: listeners will, if they listen carefully in future episodes, will be able to figure out
(0:05:23) Al: when this was recorded related to another episode.
(0:05:26) Codey: Okay, so how many, how many bottles of beer on the wall are you?
(0:05:26) Al: - Good.
(0:05:27) Al: >> Okay.
(0:05:32) Al: I have obviously been continuing with farm RPG.
(0:05:40) Al: I'm at 98 now, so I'm one away, one away. It might take me a little bit while because I've
(0:05:40) Codey: - Thank you.
(0:05:41) Codey: Ooh!
(0:05:49) Al: still got, what is it, so let me, right, I think last time we talked I was still quite a long way
(0:05:55) Al: away from being anywhere near this point, but yeah, and like I wasn't even at like a quarter
(0:05:57) Codey: Think you're at like 85
(0:06:02) Al: of what you need to get to 99, like XP wise. Now the reason why I have expanded so much
(0:06:04) Codey: Okay.
(0:06:10) Al: is when you, I bought the next layer of farming farms, and when you buy farm plots, it gives you
(0:06:15) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:06:20) Al: the same amount of XP as you spent in money, and that one cost a billion. So with one button click,
(0:06:24) Codey: - Oh, that one costs a lot, yep, yep.
(0:06:29) Al: I got a billion XP added on to my 700,000, 700 million. So I went from 700 million to 1 billion,
(0:06:38) Al: 700 million and
(0:06:40) Al: to get to level 99 is 2 billion. So I'm now getting pretty close.
(0:06:48) Codey: Hmm, how's the rest of the game?
(0:06:48) Al: Getting pretty close. Oh no, I'm actually, I've increased quite a lot actually since then. I'm
(0:06:53) Al: at 1,900,000,000 now. So I just need. Yeah, so we're getting there. My fishing's at level 99,
(0:06:58) Codey: You only need 100 million.
(0:07:04) Al: my crafting's at level 99, my exploring is at level 84, and I have finally unlocked cooking.
(0:07:11) Al: Which I'm not really doing much with because it's kind of boring.
(0:07:15) Al: I'm not really enjoying the cooking.
(0:07:16) Codey: So what the real game starts when everything's at 99 though, right?
(0:07:21) Al: Yep, that's how it goes. Yep, yep, yep, yep.
(0:07:28) Al: Yeah, no, the one thing I'm quite enjoying is that now I'm at the point where my
(0:07:35) Al: Quests are not constantly expanding, so like, if I finish a quest...
(0:07:40) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:07:40) Al: it either just gives me another quest, or it finishes that line.
(0:07:44) Al: So I'm actually down to the point where I only have 11 quest lines active,
(0:07:44) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:07:49) Al: which at one point I had 40 active or something.
(0:07:49) Codey: Wow yep
(0:07:51) Al: And my requests completed in total is 500 now.
(0:07:57) Al: So yeah, I feel like I'm getting close to being able to go, "I can leave this now."
(0:08:07) Al: But yeah. Exploring's
(0:08:08) Codey: dot com syndrome. Just got to click a button.
(0:08:10) Al: going to take quite a while to get there, because yeah, but I'm not even at half a
(0:08:17) Al: million XP and there's nothing, sorry, not half a million, sorry. I'm not even at half
(0:08:22) Al: a billion and you need 2 billion to get to level 99. So yeah, I don't know. That's quite
(0:08:28) Al: a long way away. You can't know. There's no equivalent for exploring. I looked for that.
(0:08:29) Codey: Can you spend a billion money to unlock?
(0:08:36) Al: So that's just going to take a long, long time.
(0:08:40) Al: How long have I been playing this game for now?
(0:08:42) Al: Far too long.
(0:08:42) Codey: It's been like two months, maybe?
(0:08:44) Al: When did we do farm RPG?
(0:08:46) Al: End of May.
(0:08:49) Al: So not even two months, but yeah, like if I'm only a quarter of the way to level 99,
(0:08:58) Al: like it's going to be another six months before I get there.
(0:09:01) Al: I don't know if I can keep playing this game for six more months.
(0:09:05) Codey: - Not with that attitude, it's on cost values.
(0:09:05) Al: We'll see.
(0:09:09) Al: We shall see.
(0:09:10) Al: So yeah, I will try my hardest to get to level 99 in farming for you, just so I can get that questline done.
(0:09:18) Codey: Mm hmm. Thank you. I just want that guy to die of alcohol poisoning.
(0:09:21) Al: Yeah, I'm intrigued to see what happens. I can't believe I'm one away.
(0:09:29) Al: Yeah, I don't think they will. I don't think they will.
(0:09:30) Codey: If they come out with 99 bottles, 100, I'm going to scream.
(0:09:40) Al: The other thing I've just started playing today is Chicken Journey.
(0:09:46) Al: It is a chicken-based side-scrolling RPG. You're a chicken on a journey.
(0:09:52) Codey: What is it on?
(0:09:56) Al: I've got it on my Steam Deck, but it's also on Switch.
(0:09:58) Codey: Okay, interesting.
(0:10:00) Al: But yeah, I mentioned it at one point, but it's not really Cottagecore because it's an RPG.
(0:10:02) Codey: Have we ever talked about that on the pod?
(0:10:04) Codey: Okay.
(0:10:10) Codey: But it's a chicken.
(0:10:10) Al: Yeah, I know. That's why I mentioned it once. But I mentioned it when it came out, and then not again.
(0:10:18) Codey: Yeah, very cute though.
(0:10:21) Al: But yeah, I've literally spent like 10 minutes on it so far, so maybe I'll have more to say about it in the next episode.
(0:10:27) Al: Yes, I think that is what we've been up to. So next we have some news, game news.
(0:10:35) Al: The first thing is the critter crops have announced their new release date so for
(0:10:40) Al: they had announced a release date, and then like two weeks later, they changed their mind
(0:10:44) Al: on it. Now they have a new release date, which is the 22nd of July. It is very close. It's
(0:10:50) Codey: Whoo.
(0:10:50) Codey: Very close.
(0:10:52) Al: just over a week away. So, yeah. Natsuman, 20th century summer vacation. We talked about
(0:10:57) Codey: Yep.
(0:10:57) Codey: That's, that's coming out.
(0:11:06) Al: in the last episode that it looked like English was coming to the game.
(0:11:10) Al: We now have confirmation that English is coming,
(0:11:13) Al: and it's coming to both Steam and Switch on the sixth of August.
(0:11:14) Codey: Okay. Okay, this is the, you said this was related to Shinshan. Yes.
(0:11:25) Al: No, Shin-chan was the one that was touted as like a spiritual successor to Natsu-mon,
(0:11:30) Al: and then they came out with a new one. So it's not technically related, I think, but...
(0:11:30) Codey: Oh, got it, got it, got it, got it. OK. OK.
(0:11:38) Codey: Cool, that it's getting English.
(0:11:40) Al: Yes. Finally, we can play it and talk to Micah, because he likes the games.
(0:11:46) Codey: Also, a shout out to my neighbor, Micah, not a, well, I guess he is a pixel artist, actually.
(0:11:56) Codey: Yeah.
(0:11:57) Codey: Yeah.
(0:11:58) Codey: I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure uh, but yeah, no, he came up the other day and he was like,
(0:12:00) Al: I'm sorry, your neighbour is called Micah and is a pixel artist.
(0:12:06) Al: Are you sure it's not just Micah?
(0:12:16) Codey: you guys keep mentioning someone named Micah, who's a pixel artist.
(0:12:19) Al: He did the logo for the podcast, not the other Micah, not your neighbor.
(0:12:20) Codey: I was like, yeah, he is, yep, you did, yeah, not you, not you, the other one, you didn't
(0:12:34) Codey: do it in a fugue state.
(0:12:36) Codey: Who knows?
(0:12:37) Al: Maybe who knows?
(0:12:38) Codey: Yeah.
(0:12:39) Codey: So then we can, doing Natsuman, then we can have the brave Micah, though my, my, my neighbor
(0:12:46) Codey: Micah is not, not, not brave, no, no, uh, Micah the brave is his name, we're gonna have
(0:12:48) Al: Wow, wow, Cody harsh.
(0:12:57) Codey: that Micah on.
(0:12:58) Codey: I'm gonna find something to bring neighbor Micah onto and then we can have a dueling
(0:13:02) Codey: of the Micah's.
(0:13:03) Codey: No, I don't have to do that anyway.
(0:13:04) Al: Spirity. Spirity. Still never forgot how I wanted to say the name. They've announced
(0:13:11) Al: that they've got a physical release coming for Switch. So you can pre-order now but there's
(0:13:14) Codey: Whoo.
(0:13:17) Codey: Uh-huh.
(0:13:18) Al: no information on when it's coming out as far as I can see.
(0:13:21) Codey: Correct.
(0:13:23) Al: Woo!
(0:13:24) Codey: Whoo.
(0:13:25) Codey: I'm trying to think, like, would they wait?
(0:13:27) Codey: I don't think they'd wait until, like, holidays.
(0:13:29) Codey: It's, like, too early.
(0:13:30) Al: Yeah, I don't know.
(0:13:32) Codey: They would probably just be like, "Aaaand drop."
(0:13:36) Al: It's interesting, because if you look on the page, they have shipping times for a lot of games that you can pre-order.
(0:13:45) Al: Including Fableton and Sunnyside and Pixelshire, but not for this.
(0:13:56) Codey: We'll find out eventually, woo!
(0:13:58) Al: Google Town have announced more info on their roadmap so they have a another minor update
(0:14:09) Al: coming out now with some minor stuff and then they've got their first major update the player
(0:14:12) Codey: Yeah, it's out now. It was out on July 8th.
(0:14:19) Al: suggestion path.
(0:14:26) Al: It includes expanded player and town cosmetics, a new area of the map, a new tourist teleporter
(0:14:36) Al: that ensures tourists can reach your new building area, presumably that's because they take
(0:14:41) Al: a while to get places.
(0:14:45) Codey: I mean, you gotta, I don't know anything
(0:14:47) Codey: about walking a lot in a new city
(0:14:50) Codey: and how long it takes to get across cities,
(0:14:51) Al: I want them to do a metro system. That would be fun. A subway system. They've extended
(0:14:52) Codey: but I would assume a teleporter would be pretty nice.
(0:15:01) Codey: It's like heck, I don't know if I can curse, I don't know.
(0:15:07) Al: zones as well, and they might include zone customization. I don't know what that means.
(0:15:16) Codey: like maybe that I mean I would think that it would mean that you could like either you could choose where the different zones are so instead of.
(0:15:17) Al: changing which zone? No, that wouldn't make any sense.
(0:15:28) Al: See, the problem is that it's very tied to the map, like the mining area has like actual
(0:15:35) Al: caves that you go into that are very, like you wouldn't just be able to move them on the map.
(0:15:41) Codey: Well, why can't you just do that?
(0:15:46) Codey: No, I'm thinking like, what if they're just little
(0:15:49) Codey: square shapes and then you could just be like,
(0:15:51) Codey: I want my mining area over here actually.
(0:15:54) Al: So, I guess the thing is it would work fine for, for example, the farming and the forestry areas, those could easily just be like splopped up and plopped down right because one is just an area for farming and one is just an area with trees.
(0:15:54) Codey: I mean, sure that doesn't like make sense
(0:15:56) Codey: but neither does a teleporter.
(0:16:12) Al: But the fishing and the mining bits, it's not just like the cave just exists within the zone itself, like it is attached to other areas of the map. And so it would just be like a
(0:16:24) Al: entirely different map if you were to do that. And that's not what they're saying, they're not saying different maps, right, or maps with different layouts, they're saying you can choose what you want to do with that.
(0:16:34) Al: And I don't, I think that it would be technically very complex to be able to do that because of the way that it's set up.
(0:16:44) Codey: Could it be that like, oh, your trees are not pine trees anymore.
(0:16:47) Codey: They're maple trees or something like that.
(0:16:50) Al: I guess.
(0:16:51) Codey: Like that's like a aesthetic customization.
(0:16:54) Al: I guess, but I mean, is that exciting? I don't know.
(0:16:59) Al: Like, I'm just, I just, like, it doesn't say what it means, and I want to know what it means.
(0:17:00) Codey: So I guess this is player suggestion, so what about the zones do you think people wanted
(0:17:09) Codey: to customize?
(0:17:12) Codey: 'Cause my first thought was, place.
(0:17:16) Al: I look I'm not I'm not saying that that isn't something that people want I'm saying I don't
(0:17:20) Al: think they'll do that like I think that is way more complicated than it sounds it's in no
(0:17:21) Codey: Yeah. You just pick up, put down. I'm going to stop being a butt. It's true.
(0:17:27) Al: it's not how it works and you know that
(0:17:32) Codey: I'm just being a butt. Yeah, I don't know.
(0:17:35) Al: anyway and some fixes to their their worker ais and stuff like that so
(0:17:41) Codey: And they did say that next week, they will have another update. There might be an update by the
(0:17:47) Codey: the time this episode comes out that you can look at that will have more.
(0:17:51) Codey: Information about, uh, what the major updates going to look like, as well as
(0:17:56) Codey: the preview, um, server, which is like an opt-in server where they'll put like new
(0:18:06) Codey: fancy stuff that they really need checked out before it even goes on to the early
(0:18:11) Codey: access server, and they're going to have more information about that as well.
(0:18:16) Codey: So I like how communicate communicative they are good.
(0:18:21) Codey: Communication. I'm trying to think of what the other word I was trying to use is, but yeah, nope, it's good.
(0:18:26) Al: I agree lens island have announced that their new update game modes is coming on the 18th of July.
(0:18:37) Al: So this is a very big update, which not only allows you to have
(0:18:43) Al: hardcore permadeath mode, but also allow you to customize the difficulty to quite
(0:18:50) Al: an interesting degree, like I'm looking at their their set.
(0:18:52) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:18:56) Al: If you want a really hard experience you can do that and if you just want a chill experience
(0:19:23) Al: in that world, you can you can also do that, which is cool.
(0:19:26) Codey: Well, and it adds more customizability versus just having a, here's an easy mode and here's
(0:19:32) Codey: a hard mode.
(0:19:33) Al: Yeah, you get to choose which parts you want to do easy. For example,
(0:19:34) Codey: It like literally puts it, yeah.
(0:19:38) Al: maybe you want to do a harder mode, but you don't want permadeath. So there's options.
(0:19:44) Codey: Yeah, I want hard mode in the farming, but not in the dungeon.
(0:19:51) Al: What was hard? Oh, no.
(0:19:52) Codey: I want to have to watch my plants.
(0:19:56) Codey: I want to have to watch them grow or else it's like avocados.
(0:20:00) Codey: Once you take your eye off the avocado, it's like bad.
(0:20:03) Codey: I want that.
(0:20:05) Codey: No, I don't.
(0:20:07) Codey: Yeah, that was all really cool.
(0:20:08) Codey: They also have this game modes also has night raid defense.
(0:20:12) Codey: Looks like--
(0:20:14) Codey: You use Tesla coils to keep your base safe at night,
(0:20:21) Codey: just wild.
(0:20:24) Codey: And then new cave biomes, which looks awesome too.
(0:20:27) Codey: That was one thing that I really liked when I first
(0:20:30) Codey: played this game, was there's-- in the cave system
(0:20:32) Codey: that you go through, there was an area in the cave
(0:20:36) Codey: that just clearly was open to the sky.
(0:20:40) Codey: And there were, um, well, it was like a little forest.
(0:20:44) Codey: And I thought that was really cool.
(0:20:45) Codey: And this, uh, picture looks like it has more of that kind of thing.
(0:20:51) Codey: Um, but yeah, it's mushroom forests, underground strongholds, some really good
(0:20:56) Codey: loot, um, this lens Island every week, just trying to make me break my, I'm
(0:21:02) Al: It's not far away, or is it next quarter I think it's meant to be.
(0:21:03) Codey: going to wait for 1.0 promise.
(0:21:07) Codey: I know, I don't know.
(0:21:10) Codey: I'm not, I have Costa Rica coming up.
(0:21:12) Codey: but that's where my brain is.
(0:21:14) Codey: Like, yeah, so.
(0:21:20) Al: And the last main piece of news we have is the Outbound.
(0:21:25) Al: This is the caravan exploration game by the Above Snakes developers.
(0:21:30) Al: They've announced that their Kickstarter is launching on the 13th of August.
(0:21:36) Codey: Whoo!
(0:21:38) Codey: Yeah.
(0:21:40) Codey: Looks interesting.
(0:21:44) Codey: I'm always curious how you're going to be so off-grid when you have a vehicle.
(0:21:50) Codey: Or is it solar powered? I don't know.
(0:21:50) Al: Yeah, it's solar powered, I think, because they definitely show solar panels in the trailer.
(0:22:02) Al: Sorry, I just opened up the tab for the next game and just got completely
(0:22:06) Al: distracted by the insane graphics on this. Yes, yeah, we'll talk more about Outbound once
(0:22:07) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:22:15) Al: the Kickstarter's out. It's good timing because the third
(0:22:21) Al: is just a few days before the first episode after
(0:22:30) Al: the month where I'll be on holiday, so we'll actually be doing that news to you on time.
(0:22:36) Al: So.
(0:22:36) Codey: That's the day. I'm coming back from Costa Rica sounds I think it's you're going to be on your vacation when I'm kind of on mine half of mine. I'm in Costa Rica for two weeks, so.
(0:22:45) Al: Yeah. Well, I'm away for a month, so I think I overlap all that.
(0:22:50) Codey: Yeah.
(0:22:53) Codey: Well, let's talk about what distracted you.
(0:22:56) Codey: Uh...
(0:22:57) Al: Yeah, so we've got another new game. It's got a Kickstarter. It's called Trade Tales,
(0:23:03) Al: and their description is a cosy modern life farming game fused with entrepreneurial
(0:23:11) Al: adventures - manage a factory, open your own shop, live your
(0:23:15) Al: dream life. And the graphics are weird. So you write that cat is looking so realistic
(0:23:30) Al: compared to the rest of the game and you're right, it looks so distracting. It's just like this.
(0:23:31) Codey: Yeah.
(0:23:34) Codey: There's so much detail in this cat,
(0:23:38) Codey: but not in anything else.
(0:23:40) Al: It looks like clipart that they've just stuck on the front of the game.
(0:23:44) Al: like what is.
(0:23:45) Al: Is this cat and why and it looks like it wants to die?
(0:23:50) Codey: It says hello. I need your help. You need to kill me.
(0:23:55) Al: The other interesting thing is the image itself for the game looks bad, but when you
(0:24:01) Al: play the trailer the graphics look so much better.
(0:24:03) Al: Why is the image so bad and the actual trailer looks much better than the image?
(0:24:11) Codey: I also love you look at the image for you can't get over that cat.
(0:24:16) Codey: You look at the I'm going to cover the cat with my hand.
(0:24:19) Codey: You look at the image and then the first like minute
(0:24:22) Codey: and a half of the trailer, you would think you're playing
(0:24:24) Codey: a completely different game because it's all like you're in the city
(0:24:28) Codey: because it's the whole, you know, man, opening a shop, managing a factory, blah, blah, blah.
(0:24:32) Codey: But then you're harvesting stuff.
(0:24:39) Codey: Also, this woman's shirt looks thank you.
(0:24:41) Codey: I think it's supposed to be white in the picture, but just it's like nude colored and it's.
(0:24:43) Al: Oh, no, I just noticed they have very interesting boobiejeko physics.
(0:24:51) Al: Oh, that's so weird.
(0:24:51) Codey: Yeah. Oh my gosh. So that was my other comment was that.
(0:24:56) Codey: That was my other comment. I said, what is with the stiff torso and wild hips swaying
(0:25:03) Codey: in the female character models? Like there's other than the breasts, the torso just doesn't move.
(0:25:11) Codey: But the hips are like swaying back and forth like they're doing the Spongebob dance.
(0:25:16) Al: She is on a mission
(0:25:19) Codey: She is on a hot girl walk. She is. She's definitely CEO material, but gosh darn. I was like that is
(0:25:30) Codey: this is. Uh.
(0:25:32) Al: I feel like there's something here in this game and I'm intrigued by it so I'm gonna keep an eye on it.
(0:25:39) Codey: I was going to say, it's the last 20 days left and it's already hit its goal.
(0:25:39) Al: It is pierce to have a lot of backers already. It's got 400 backers for some reason.
(0:25:49) Codey: Uh, I guess the news of this game is that it's a new game on Kickstarter.
(0:25:52) Codey: So we'll have the link for it.
(0:25:54) Al: Yeah. Wild.
(0:25:54) Codey: Um, but yeah, there's a lot to this game that it just looks like a lot.
(0:26:02) Codey: Cause like, do you, do you go from being like farming to then go in the city and
(0:26:08) Al: Well that's yeah the factory definitely seems to be in the city right because they show her
(0:26:15) Al: looking at this vacant lot and then the implication is that that's what oh I like the mining did you
(0:26:23) Al: see the mining the mining it's so long it's gonna be longer than this whole section we're talking
(0:26:24) Codey: I did not make it that far, I'm not going to lie to you.
(0:26:27) Codey: The trailer on the Kickstarter is six minutes long, which is awesome, but.
(0:26:33) Al: about and no so you it's a really detailed mine and you like have to mine the
(0:26:38) Al: wall to get through to other parts of the mine no no no no no no not like it looks in character
(0:26:41) Codey: Okay, so you said detailed, do you mean like detailed cat, like cat level detail?
(0:26:50) Al: for the rest of the stuff uh unlike all of the animals which look like they look a little bit
(0:26:51) Codey: Okay.
(0:26:56) Al: this is okay they look like they've taken the nintendogs models and just slapped them in the game
(0:27:03) Codey: Yeah. I also love that the cat like you like you're right. It
(0:27:04) Al: that's what they look like to me
(0:27:09) Codey: just is like, please kill me because it doesn't. It just
(0:27:12) Codey: walks behind you. It just stands it stands behind you. Let's be
(0:27:17) Codey: real. It doesn't even move. Like your hips are doing all the
(0:27:19) Al: I don't think I want to play this game because it's very much focused on the shop and I
(0:27:20) Codey: work. Oh, found. No, I didn't see the mining. I saw that you
(0:27:27) Al: have you seen the mining?
(0:27:30) Codey: You can wear cat ears, I'm back in.
(0:27:33) Al: I have still never had a game with a shop that has actually been fun. Oh, they are walking right
(0:27:40) Al: up to the line of copyright infringement there. They've got a Starworks coffee.
(0:27:48) Al: See?
(0:27:49) Al: And they have... what else did they have? They had an Evelyn, which is the same logo
(0:28:01) Al: as 7/11. And they have... oh, it's 7 Evelyn. That's what they called it. Sorry, 7 Evelyn.
(0:28:07) Codey: oh my gosh
(0:28:09) Al: They've got... oh, Star Banks Coffee. Sorry, Star Banks Coffee. And they have a Wick Donalds,
(0:28:16) Codey: Okay. I saw the mining. It is nice.
(0:28:17) Al: The logo is just the upside down golden arrow.
(0:28:20) Al: And they've they've got Mallmart like they I just I feel like they're just asking to be sued.
(0:28:27) Al: They're like, I dare you try.
(0:28:30) Al: It's weird.
(0:28:31) Al: Oh, they have oh, they have automation.
(0:28:34) Al: I'm back in, I'm back in.
(0:28:36) Codey: I was going to say, have you got to the to the automation?
(0:28:37) Al: They've got oh, no, they've got Ritos.
(0:28:41) Al: They're making Ritos and Fanta.
(0:28:44) Codey: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
(0:28:46) Codey: I. I need to look at those bed and jerry's.
(0:28:47) Al: Oh my word, they're- they're- they're-
(0:28:49) Al: So much of this is- this is wild.
(0:28:52) Codey: Did you see the bed and jerry's?
(0:28:52) Al: Yeah, I did, I saw the Ben and Jerry's.
(0:28:54) Codey: OK, we've got Ray's classic 100 percent.
(0:28:56) Al: They've got Kraft's mac and cheese.
(0:28:58) Al: This is, oh, for goodness sake, day 400.
(0:29:00) Codey: Instead of Doritos, it's just a posture free ritos.
(0:29:02) Al: This is so stupid.
(0:29:06) Codey: >> Oh my God.
(0:29:07) Codey: Yeah, no, this the craft, the automation part of it looks very factorial to me.
(0:29:12) Al: Oh, that's an interesting outfit for the date.
(0:29:13) Codey: Instead of Fanta, it's just Fanna, Herb.
(0:29:18) Al: Oh, my.
(0:29:19) Codey: I'm trying to find the Ben and Jerry's because that was blatant.
(0:29:23) Codey: Bob and Jimmy's.
(0:29:25) Al: You need to skip forward to the date that they do.
(0:29:29) Codey: Okay, I'm gonna let it play.
(0:29:31) Codey: Oh, she's like K-pop dancing in the in the fact
(0:29:36) Al: Oh yeah. I know, I just... Who's making this game and what are they on?
(0:29:36) Codey: Day 420, blaze it day 420, do you stalk every single shelf?
(0:29:46) Codey: Finding love? No, we really do. I, we are just, yeah, I don't know.
(0:29:48) Al: Yeah, just you wait. What's she wearing?
(0:29:53) Codey: She was like, yep, go, going on a trip.
(0:29:54) Al: And then we go to the beach after this, which is also an interesting one.
(0:30:00) Al: They put the jiggle physics to work here.
(0:30:02) Codey: Oh, those are bikinis, y'all.
(0:30:02) Al: here.
(0:30:06) Al: Oh no, it was so shallow that she just smacked into the ground as well, that would be really painful.
(0:30:06) Codey: What is this game?
(0:30:10) Codey: Oh, they dropped her in the water.
(0:30:17) Codey: Oh, my gosh, the jiggle physics, they're dancing.
(0:30:22) Codey: Oh, now they're in an arcade.
(0:30:23) Codey: This this really is just watching this whole trailer.
(0:30:26) Al: That walk animation is wild, that camera level with that skirt was not great.
(0:30:34) Al: Um.
(0:30:34) Codey: build brand awareness, raise.
(0:30:37) Codey: Oh my gosh, they're going to get hit by so.
(0:30:41) Codey: Much copyright or alternatively, did Lay's pay them to have raise in the game.
(0:30:43) Al: I need to play this game, don't I?
(0:30:50) Al: think you know the answer to that. I need to play this game don't I? Oh my word that walking
(0:30:56) Al: animation every time it's so weird!
(0:31:00) Codey: What are we doing?
(0:31:00) Codey: Okay.
(0:31:02) Codey: What do we got?
(0:31:02) Codey: Stretch goals.
(0:31:04) Codey: Oh, we hit the museum.
(0:31:04) Codey: You got, oh wait.
(0:31:06) Codey: Did we hit the museum?
(0:31:06) Codey: We have not hit the museum.
(0:31:08) Codey: Advanced character creation.
(0:31:08) Codey: More vehicles, more part-time jobs, museum.
(0:31:10) Codey: creation, more vehicles, more part-time jobs, museum, constantly.
(0:31:16) Al: This game isn't coming out until 2026 and there I've got a Switch logo there. I feel like maybe
(0:31:23) Al: don't plan to release a game on Switch in 2026. Just a thought. This is quite the game. I don't
(0:31:40) Codey: But, uh, yep, nope, this that was y'all.
(0:31:42) Codey: You need to watch this trailer.
(0:31:43) Codey: This is probably.
(0:31:44) Al: Yeah, our explanation does not do it justice. You need to go to the link in the show notes
(0:31:49) Al: to the Kickstarter and watch this video and then come talk about it in the Slack. I just don't know
(0:31:55) Al: what to do. Weird cat models though. I would rather one of Coral Island's animals than an
(0:31:58) Codey: You can adopt up to 10 pets to live in your home.
(0:32:02) Codey: I'm in.
(0:32:03) Codey: They heard us complain about Coral Island.
(0:32:07) Codey: There were dogs, too.
(0:32:08) Codey: There were weird dogs.
(0:32:09) Codey: No.
(0:32:09) Codey: No, no, I won't.
(0:32:12) Al: infinite number of these animals.
(0:32:19) Al: So that's Trade Tales, the Kickstarter's out now.
(0:32:22) Al: So you've only got 20 days, well, less than that when you.
(0:32:27) Al: What, you've probably got about a week and a half by the time or two weeks
(0:32:31) Al: by the time this comes out, two weeks to decide whether you're back in this project.
(0:32:37) Codey: I'm going to play it, but I'm not going to back it personally.
(0:32:39) Al: Yeah, my worry about backing it is do I
(0:32:43) Al: actually believe that they won't be sued in the next two years before they release?
(0:32:47) Al: I can't be confident of-
(0:32:49) Al: That's the news. We're going to talk about office cat. This is a mobile game where you
(0:32:54) Codey: Whoo!
(0:33:04) Al: are a real estate owner for offices full of cats. That's it. Well, yes, obviously. Come on. A human
(0:33:14) Codey: And you are a cat yourself.
(0:33:17) Al: isn't going to rent offices.
(0:33:19) Al: to cats, are they?
(0:33:20) Codey: I would.
(0:33:23) Al: So, my first thoughts on this game, Cody, are that after you told me to play it, or
(0:33:25) Codey: And I would put them in little suits.
(0:33:28) Codey: Isn't that really so cute?
(0:33:37) Al: we agreed to play it, I guess, because I did say, "OK, fine, let's do that one."
(0:33:40) Codey: I also, okay, I am being severely misrepresented here.
(0:33:45) Codey: I threw like 10 game names at Al.
(0:33:48) Al: Yeah, and half and half of them we've already covered on the podcast Cody
(0:33:52) Codey: Correct.
(0:33:54) Codey: I was like, I don't remember, I don't remember.
(0:33:55) Codey: I was getting ready for Go Fest.
(0:33:57) Codey: I didn't know.
(0:33:58) Codey: So I just sent him a bunch of names.
(0:34:00) Codey: And then he was like, yeah, sure, let's do Office Cat.
(0:34:02) Codey: So this was just one of, it's not like I was like,
(0:34:04) Al: It looked cute!
(0:34:05) Codey: oh my gosh, this game, I wanna play this game specifically.
(0:34:10) Codey: I didn't play Office Cat, I didn't say that.
(0:34:12) Codey: It was just in the list.
(0:34:14) Codey: Anyway, and then we decided.
(0:34:15) Al: So I booted it up and I spent like 10 minutes playing it, and then the next day I spent
(0:34:19) Al: another 10 minutes playing it, and then I completely forgot it existed.
(0:34:25) Al: But I mean, so it's interesting in so much as like, this is possibly the most mobile
(0:34:32) Al: game.
(0:34:33) Codey: Give it the crown!
(0:34:34) Al: any mobile game has ever mobile gamed, right?
(0:34:38) Al: There is just like every thing that mobile games do, every single thing that they do,
(0:34:44) Al: this game does, right?
(0:34:46) Al: You know, from your like timers that you know, your real life timers, I mean, this, this
(0:34:51) Al: won't be built until 15 minutes time, okay, fine, whatever, sure, to the weirdest thing
(0:34:58) Al: I found.
(0:34:59) Al: So you, you, you build your offices, well, you've got the building, you don't build the
(0:35:04) Al: offices, realistic to real life, you're an estate owner, you're not doing any building,
(0:35:08) Al: you're not actually creating anything, you're just owning, you buy, you buy furniture, right?
(0:35:14) Al: You buy furniture and you put it in building, in rooms, and then you say, Oh, this, I'll
(0:35:17) Al: get this business to hire it, okay, sure, fine.
(0:35:21) Al: And it's like fixed term contracts.
(0:35:23) Al: And at the end of the contract, you can either go find another company to rent it or pay
(0:35:30) Al: Pay the company money to have them rent you to continue rent.
(0:35:34) Codey: Yeah.
(0:35:34) Al: What sort of business is this, that I'm paying them to continue their contract?
(0:35:40) Al: That's bizarre.
(0:35:42) Codey: You don't have to pay them. You could watch an ad.
(0:35:45) Al: Oh, the ads are everywhere.
(0:35:48) Codey: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I liked that they're, I'm trying to think of some positives about this game.
(0:35:59) Codey: I liked the cat themed naming systems. So things like Twitter became chatter
(0:36:04) Codey: or Shaw in French is cats. Walmart became Pawmart. They did have, uh, the Tesla one was funny. I got up.
(0:36:14) Codey: Oh, I already have the game open. I was like, I got a little of the game back up. Um, I didn't, uh,
(0:36:21) Codey: Tesla's me lawn mask.
(0:36:34) Codey: A million gates.
(0:36:36) Al: This game? Yeah, it's not for me.
(0:36:41) Codey: Posh, instead of porch capital. Anyway.
(0:36:44) Al: You know, the thing that annoyed me the most about the ads is every ad was the exact same
(0:36:48) Al: one ad. It was for this one game and I just constantly... White out survival.
(0:36:49) Codey: Oh, I got like four different ones. Which game was yours?
(0:36:55) Codey: Oh, see, I didn't get that. I mean, I got that one sometimes, but I also got solitaire clash,
(0:37:00) Codey: which you can make real money by playing solitaire.
(0:37:00) Al: No, no, Cody, not another scam game, don't do it.
(0:37:04) Codey: >> I'm not playing it.
(0:37:08) Codey: I did look at the reviews, I was like, is this legit?
(0:37:11) Codey: And everyone was like, don't do it, it's a scam.
(0:37:16) Codey: And I got a couple other like gambling ones, but I don't know, I'm not into that.
(0:37:24) Codey: I also, another positive, trying to have positives.
(0:37:29) Codey: Also, I think that it's cute that when the businesses come to rent your
(0:37:32) Codey: the space, um, so.
(0:37:34) Codey: I don't know, I don't know, I don't know if you guys are familiar with that.
(0:37:36) Codey: I don't know if you guys are familiar with that, but I think that's a good one.
(0:37:39) Codey: I would say you have like eight desks or whatever.
(0:37:42) Codey: So eight employees come to work and each of them have their own name and their own little
(0:37:48) Al: art style is very cute. I will definitely give you that. I mean, that's what Trax does to this game,
(0:37:52) Al: right? Like you suggested it presumably because it looked really cute and it was cats and I...
(0:37:56) Codey: And it was like a management same house like I haven't done this kind of thing before.
(0:38:01) Al: Yeah and I thought it was cute because it looked cute and the graphics were nice so it definitely
(0:38:06) Al: is good looking. That is the thing that is correct. So I mean, I think it mostly comes down to the fact
(0:38:06) Codey: No.
(0:38:08) Codey: No.
(0:38:10) Codey: End of positivity.
(0:38:12) Codey: Let's rip into this game.
(0:38:17) Al: that this is designed to.
(0:38:19) Al: And it's like, I get that you want to make money, but it's just doing every bad thing that every game that is bad does and there's no real there's no justification to that right like you can do half of the stuff without being as bad as it is like ads aren't a bad thing but the way that it does it literally every option and it's just doing every bad thing that every every game that is bad does and there's no real there's no justification to that right like you can do half of the stuff.
(0:38:42) Al: Without being as bad as it is like ads aren't a bad thing but the way that it does it literally every option and
(0:38:48) Al: it's like for example right you earn money without playing the game right like as you're away you get rent and then there's a maximum amount you can get which is like two hours worth of rent okay great.
(0:39:00) Codey: - Mm, it depends on the company.
(0:39:02) Al: It starts out it starts out as two hours and you can expand that I think but anyway that's not important specifics don't matter.
(0:39:10) Al: When you come back you can either get that or you can get eight times the value by watching an ad the ad is like a minute long.
(0:39:16) Codey: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:39:19) Al: It's not like a it's a one off thing it's not like a you do this and you get twice the amount of money for a while it's no no this is for this one thing and so it's just like constantly throwing ads in your face and you know you pointed out in the notes about like the constant list of oh here's a deal where you can get these gems and you can do this and so it's like yeah you can pay to get rid of ads or you can pay to get gems to do other things in the game faster and it just.
(0:39:49) Al: becomes a slog of and that and that example I was saying of like you pay the company to continue do it like that doesn't make any sense logically but is presumably only there just to get more money out of you and it's just like I don't it removes any sort of joy that I would have ever had from this game by just going this is just a money machine for us.
(0:40:10) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:12) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:14) Codey: And if you're not interested in putting money in, uh, then it's not worth it.
(0:40:18) Codey: Um,
(0:40:20) Codey: Uh, as I.
(0:40:20) Al: And the thing is that I would probably have paid a small amount of like maybe like 10, 15 quid,
(0:40:26) Al: I would have paid that to get rid of the ads and you know get some currency and stop
(0:40:31) Al: shoving all these things in my face. I would do that, absolutely. If I could pay that amount of
(0:40:35) Al: money and all of my like, oh you can skip this with an ad and you can double this with an ad
(0:40:41) Al: and if I got all those with that, I would absolutely do it. But it doesn't, it's so,
(0:40:46) Al: everything is expensive, so expensive.
(0:40:48) Codey: Yeah. Well, and so my no ads right now you get, uh, you skip the ads, uh, you get experience
(0:40:56) Codey: for free. Yeah. Everything becomes free, but it's usually $38 and it's currently $19, but
(0:41:02) Al: which is so much money.
(0:41:06) Codey: that's still so much money. And I bet I really feel as though they would be like, Oh, you
(0:41:13) Codey: have it for a month, none in a month pay more.
(0:41:16) Al: Yeah I don't, I don't, I don't, yeah, yeah I don't trust it to give you this like,
(0:41:18) Codey: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I have that. And then the gem booster thing, you have to pay like
(0:41:21) Al: oh, ads are gone forever. I do not trust that at all based on everything I want.
(0:41:31) Codey: $10. And then you get more, like any time you were in three gems, you were in 10 instead,
(0:41:36) Codey: but it's just like, there was just so many, like, give us money, give us money. Hey, you
(0:41:41) Codey: could make your situation more efficient if you gave us money.
(0:41:48) Codey: They have like the roulette games where you spin a wheel and you get resources, but you
(0:41:53) Codey: have to watch after the first time you have to watch an ad and the ad only happens. Like
(0:41:58) Codey: you can only do it like once every six hours. So you have to wait six hours to watch another
(0:42:02) Codey: ad, which, you know, that's also giving them money. Like you watch the ads. There was a
(0:42:10) Codey: kitty bank thing, which I saw that you have to pay it and you earn like resources for
(0:42:15) Codey: kitty bank and then it'll be like hey your kitty bank's full but i
(0:42:18) Codey: have to pay three dollars to even use it so no point um I was kind of into the clock out
(0:42:25) Codey: challenge thing which they give you like points towards resources and it was a cute little gimmick
(0:42:34) Codey: but after like four times of earning resources it's like oh you can earn these other resources
(0:42:40) Codey: but you have to accept all of your rewards in consequential order and or in the like order
(0:42:46) Codey: consecutive order and the one.
(0:42:48) Codey: It's just like, I'm not spending any money on this game.
(0:42:50) Codey: You guys, so I wish just that wasn't, none of that was fun, but.
(0:42:54) Codey: Well, I wish just that wasn't none of that was fun, but.
(0:42:58) Al: Yeah, and it's frustrating because it ruins what could be a fun game. I think it's a
(0:43:09) Al: little bit ironic, right? Because it's clearly meant to be mocking capitalism, right? Because
(0:43:18) Al: there's so many things in it that it's like, "Oh, you talk to your mum about your business
(0:43:24) Al: and like she talks about, you know, are you working hard or whatever and it's clear like.
(0:43:28) Al: Like the people who made the game don't think that, you know, landlords are, you know,
(0:43:33) Al: working hard because you're not you're not doing anything you just click a button and
(0:43:36) Al: you buy that like that's that that's the whole point. It's a mocking of capitalism, except
(0:43:41) Al: it then does the exact same things that it's complaining about.
(0:43:42) Codey: Yeah, well, and as so did you ever move on the map further?
(0:43:50) Codey: Because I guess you only played like 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there.
(0:43:51) Al: I didn't know I did. No, I take the 10 minutes was a bit of an exaggeration I did I got to us, and I got a second building up here.
(0:43:58) Codey: OK, so yeah, because when you get that building and you move on to the second
(0:44:01) Codey: space, suddenly it's like, oh, buy a house, get a car and like do these things.
(0:44:07) Codey: And I'm like, wow, capitalism, like buy these material things
(0:44:12) Codey: and it's like all really high.
(0:44:14) Codey: So it won't like cost.
(0:44:16) Codey: So the game you're basically the game is like, hey, like make make more money,
(0:44:21) Codey: make more money, and then all these like things in the game are like, oh, you
(0:44:24) Codey: want more stuff, just watch an ad, just watch an ad.
(0:44:26) Codey: And my experience was I played for maybe like 20, 30 minutes.
(0:44:30) Codey: And then the next day I played for like 20 minutes.
(0:44:32) Codey: And then I kept trying to go back to the game and I'd only be on the game
(0:44:35) Codey: for like five minutes before I'm like, I'm not doing like, no, I'm not wasting
(0:44:40) Codey: my time on this game that's asking me.
(0:44:42) Codey: So I would just like check it and be like, oh, wow, I didn't make that much money while I was gone because I hit that, you know, I'm only making rent for four hours thing or whatever.
(0:44:54) Codey: So it has potential.
(0:44:56) Codey: Thank you so much.
(0:44:56) Codey: Thank you.
(0:44:58) Codey: Thank you.
(0:44:58) Al: think I would say it had potential. I don't think like they're probably making a decent amount of
(0:44:58) Codey: Thank you.
(0:45:03) Al: money and therefore they're never going to go back on that right like. Yeah it's really hard to say
(0:45:12) Al: anything else about this game right because it's like so dominating. They are like this is the only
(0:45:18) Al: thing I can really think about like yeah sure it's cute, cute graphics, funny names, a scathing
(0:45:24) Al: critique on capitalism that it falls into itself.
(0:45:28) Codey: Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
(0:45:28) Al: Cool. Gameplay's fine, right? Like it's an idle game, you know what you're getting with an idle
(0:45:33) Al: game, but it's just like it's idle in so much as you spend more time looking at ads than anything
(0:45:39) Codey: Yep and you got your basics. There's a free currency. There's a like gem currency
(0:45:45) Codey: That's a more difficult currency to get but you could pay if you want to get more of it like kind of thing
(0:45:49) Codey: You basically just manage the building
(0:45:53) Codey: So you have offices
(0:45:56) Codey: And you can like you've mentioned you can purchase furniture to go in the offices
(0:46:00) Codey: You can then upgrade that furniture and that was always funny if you get a higher tier company
(0:46:05) Codey: And you put it in the office that you had like a lower tier company in they're like
(0:46:10) Codey: white desk
(0:46:10) Al: - Yeah, yeah. (laughs)
(0:46:13) Codey: What is this and then at one point they were like I can't believe this office doesn't have this
(0:46:19) Codey: picture frame of a cat that costs 50 gems
(0:46:20) Al: Yeah, it's very specific. Yeah. And you have some, you have like some that will not go
(0:46:27) Al: to the toilet in like cheap toilets, they just refuse to do it.
(0:46:30) Codey: Yeah, but and then they're like efficiency is lowered and you
(0:46:33) Codey: make less money because they're mad about the, the quote unquote quality
(0:46:39) Codey: of the, yeah, and no, and the upper tier ones cost more money too.
(0:46:44) Codey: So you're constantly trying to like spend money, any kind of money to
(0:46:50) Codey: get the in-game currency so you can upgrade your stuff so that you can
(0:46:54) Codey: get the better companies so that you can have more money, but then you
(0:46:57) Codey: need to get it's just like as a loop.
(0:47:00) Codey: And there was nothing redeeming.
(0:47:00) Al: Yeah, yeah
(0:47:03) Codey: Um, yes, you have, you have your offices, your bathrooms, your meeting room, a
(0:47:08) Codey: break room, a superintendent that is basically just tech support for the whole
(0:47:12) Codey: building, uh, and then an electric room because electricity is another currency.
(0:47:18) Codey: Like you, after a while, you can't upgrade anything anymore because you're
(0:47:21) Codey: drawing too much electricity.
(0:47:22) Al: Yeah, and for some reason there is no grid. You have generators and batteries.
(0:47:22) Codey: So you have to go like, yeah, it's just a generator room.
(0:47:26) Al: Why? Why is there no grid in this universe? Why? Why? We all individually generate. Like,
(0:47:33) Al: can you imagine that? All these generators in that room, that's a death trap.
(0:47:38) Codey: That's a hot room and they, and they put, you put the superintendents right next to
(0:47:42) Codey: it, they're, they're, they've got to be, they got to be so hot over there and
(0:47:43) Al: I remember an oxide. Come on! It's also not breathing.
(0:47:48) Codey: they're in their little, their little overalls and, and little hats.
(0:47:52) Al: Yeah, I think the humor is good in this game, and I think there was potential in how the
(0:47:54) Codey: Just, it's just not good working.
(0:48:01) Al: game works. It's just a chock full of in-app purchases and subscriptions and ads and everything.
(0:48:12) Codey: Uh-huh, I really think that that's all we have to say.
(0:48:16) Al: All right, well, it's a good thing. I feel like we maybe talked about
(0:48:21) Al: trade details for long
(0:48:22) Al: than we did about OfficeCat. Alright, well, yeah, I wouldn't suggest playing OfficeCat to people. That's it. Yeah, yeah. Or like literally any other mobile game, right? Like,
(0:48:26) Codey: Yeah.
(0:48:32) Codey: If you are really looking for somewhere to just throw money,
(0:48:37) Codey: maybe a charity is better than this.
(0:48:44) Codey: Literally anything else.
(0:48:48) Codey: Cute concept, great art.
(0:48:50) Codey: Use your power for good, office cat people,
(0:48:52) Codey: make a better
(0:48:54) Codey: life.
(0:48:56) Al: All right, cool. Well, thank you, Cody, for joining me to talk about
(0:49:02) Al: very little to do with OfficeCat.

(0:50:08) Al: One that has just come out, what will have just come out when this episode is out is me and Cody's episode on the Nintendo Direct.
(0:50:17) Al: That should be out already.
(0:50:19) Al: And there are more exciting ones coming out as well.
(0:50:22) Al: Me and Kevin have one coming out about the Spider-Man, the animated series.
(0:50:26) Al: So come listen to that.
(0:50:29) Codey: Maybe we should have a greenhouse
(0:50:31) Codey: that's just you talking about your vacation
(0:50:34) Codey: and me talking about my vacation.
(0:50:37) Codey: Listeners, let us know if you wanna hear that.
(0:50:40) Al: I've put it on the list.
(0:50:40) Codey: Because I feel as though when we get back from vacation,
(0:50:44) Codey: like to fully encompass our entire experiences,
(0:50:47) Codey: it's gonna be more than the like intro part of the show,
(0:50:49) Codey: right?
(0:50:50) Al: Sure. Yeah, we can see how things go.
(0:50:52) Codey: Yeah.
(0:50:53) Codey: Let people, let us know.
(0:50:56) Al: I think that's everything. Thank you, Cody, for joining me.
(0:51:01) Codey: Thank you for having me.
(0:51:02) Al: Thank you, listeners, for listening. And until next time, have a good harvest.
(0:51:06) Theme Tune: The harvest season is created by Al McKinley, with support from our patrons, including our
(0:51:17) Theme Tune: pro farmers, Kevin, Stuart and Alisa.

(0:51:25) Theme Tune: Feel free to visit our website, harvestseason.club, for show notes and links to things we discussed
(0:51:31) Theme Tune: in this episode.
(0:51:41) Codey: I have devastating news.
(0:51:44) Codey: When my mic did weird crap, uh, my local recording cropped out.
(0:51:49) Al: I see I thought about asking you to check that but I didn't that's fine. We've got the zoom recording
(0:51:52) Codey: Yeah.
(0:51:52) Codey: And it was about six minutes in.
(0:51:55) Codey: It was about six minutes in.
(0:51:56) Codey: And then I noticed that the, I noticed it when we started talking about office
(0:52:00) Codey: cat, so I restarted it.
(0:52:03) Al: I'll probably use the zoom recording anyway. It's fine. I'll deal with it.
