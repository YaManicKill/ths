# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Al and we
(0:00:38) Codey: And my name is Cody.
(0:00:40) Al: are here today to talk about cottagecore games. As always, transcripts are available in the
(0:00:44) Codey: Woooo!
(0:00:48) Al: show notes and on the website. Cody, how are you doing?
(0:00:52) Codey: I'm doing good uh celebrating America Day by staying at home um and not doing anything though
(0:01:03) Codey: honestly so I'm staying at my because I'm doing Pokemon Go Fest this upcoming weekend um like the
(0:01:08) Codey: next three days in New York City and so I met my partner's house and or his apartment in New Jersey
(0:01:15) Codey: so we could probably literally just walk like 10 minutes to the riverfront um and then see like
(0:01:21) Codey: like watch the fireworks that happen.
(0:01:22) Codey: been like possibly either over the river or like the ones happening in the
(0:01:28) Codey: city probably see them from here probably as well so I usually it's like
(0:01:30) Al: when do they happen? Right. Yeah, see that's why I always find funny about America, like
(0:01:33) Codey: Sun it's like after sundown so it'd be like a night nine or ten o'clock at
(0:01:37) Codey: night so I got
(0:01:42) Al: your big fireworks day is in July, and I'm like that just sounds so late at night for
(0:01:47) Codey: Yeah, it is.
(0:01:48) Al: fireworks because like our big one is November, so it's like it's getting dark here at like
(0:01:55) Al: four or five, five o'clock at that point, so like you're finished working.
(0:02:00) Al: You can go out and watch fireworks, like you don't have to wait long at all, it's great.
(0:02:04) Codey: well we have to celebrate that that day that we said heck you to the british monarchy so
(0:02:11) Al: I mean, I'm sure they could have chosen a different day if they wanted to. I mean, it's
(0:02:14) Al: probably too late now, but there were multiple days. Multiple days they could have chosen.
(0:02:16) Codey: yeah at this point it's in our dna
(0:02:21) Al: It's not like there's just one specific day. Anyway. Yeah, I'm good. I'm celebrating Independence
(0:02:24) Codey: Right, yeah so that's that's what I'm uh how are you?
(0:02:33) Al: Day in a different way with an election. So, yeah, still.
(0:02:38) Codey: Woo democracy!
(0:02:41) Al: For now. Well, we have more democracy than you just now, I think. Although we still have
(0:02:42) Codey: Yeah it's like wait is it still, are we still counting this as democracy?
(0:02:50) Codey: I... D-I.
(0:02:51) Al: an elected monarch. Not an elected monarch, an unelected monarch. You know, you have an
(0:02:54) Codey: Not, yeah, not elect.
(0:02:59) Al: elected monarch, we have an unelected monarch. Yeah, I know, I know. That's what I'm in.
(0:03:01) Codey: Well, they're trying to make it a monarch and we're not.
(0:03:07) Al: Yes.
(0:03:11) Al: So just paying attention to election, we're recording this two hours before that finishes,
(0:03:19) Al: so going to be a long night.
(0:03:22) Codey: do y'all have the ranked choice voting though? okay nevermind today's episode is
(0:03:30) Codey: about gogotown
(0:03:32) Al: So, today we're going to talk about Gogotown. This is going to be a Gogotown first impressions
(0:03:35) Codey: yep
(0:03:39) Al: because I didn't think we'd be able to get enough time to play this game properly to
(0:03:44) Al: do a full in-depth discussion of the game. And after playing the game, maybe that was
(0:03:51) Al: a good suggestion. So, we'll talk about that in the main section.
(0:03:56) Al: Before that, we have some news, some exciting news, some...
(0:04:00) Codey: I, as ever, am a Ph.D. student with two extra jobs, so busy busy.
(0:04:02) Al: ...news. First of all, Cody, what have you been up to?
(0:04:14) Codey: But when I'm not doing that, I'm still playing my cross stitch game.
(0:04:19) Codey: It's just basically a color by number game.
(0:04:21) Codey: I am running out of in-game money to buy patterns though, so I need to slow down on it and find
(0:04:30) Codey: the balance to do.
(0:04:31) Codey: Because I get a certain amount of currency each day, and when I complete them.
(0:04:37) Codey: So I just need to slow down and get caught up, find the balance again.
(0:04:42) Codey: I just had a bit where I'm trying to brain rot a little bit, so playing it quite a bit.
(0:04:51) Codey: Also I beat the career mode of Power Watch Simulator, so I'm now going through and trying
(0:04:57) Codey: to 100% all of the achievements.
(0:05:00) Codey: Which is... I mean, it's just stuff like on the...
(0:05:06) Codey: Like one achievement is called way of the blade and it was like on the helicopter finish the blades first
(0:05:14) Codey: So I did that. So I'm just like doing those kinds of things one of them is to like complete the carousel without ever
(0:05:20) Codey: turning the carousel off
(0:05:23) Codey: It's also gonna be wild. The carousel was a pain in the booty to do the first time. So trying to do it
(0:05:30) Al: I can see how it would be difficult if it was spinning.
(0:05:32) Codey: Yeah, yeah
(0:05:34) Codey: So it's that kind of stuff
(0:05:40) Codey: Sad for some humans cassette beasts I have kind of put aside for the moment
(0:05:46) Codey: I hit a point where
(0:05:48) Codey: There was an intriguing thing that happened in the story and then I was like, oh no, there's story
(0:05:55) Codey: And
(0:05:57) Al: I didn't sign up for story.
(0:06:01) Codey: I was like oh no I'm gonna care. Like I want to be able to like sit down with this and really pay
(0:06:08) Codey: attention. And that's not what I'm looking for in a game right now. I need to just turn my brain off
(0:06:16) Codey: which is not what I do when there's stories in games. So um yeah that that'll be on pause for
(0:06:21) Codey: a smidge. But Disney Dreamlight Valley added Mulan and Mushu. There's also now
(0:06:29) Codey: Bye!
(0:06:30) Codey: A daily request, um, thing through Remy's Diner restaurant.
(0:06:38) Codey: I don't remember what they call it.
(0:06:40) Codey: Um, yeah.
(0:06:41) Codey: So you have daily challenges now with, um, Daisy at her boutique, which you
(0:06:48) Codey: can get currency to then buy more stuff.
(0:06:50) Codey: So I've been doing that.
(0:06:52) Codey: Um, it's, it's real simple.
(0:06:55) Codey: You basically just go and she's like, I want an outfit that has this.
(0:06:58) Codey: And I'm like, okay, cool.
(0:07:00) Codey: That outfit, and then that's what you wear for a bit.
(0:07:02) Codey: Um, uh, but there's now something like that with Remy.
(0:07:08) Codey: He does this like delivery service where it starts little quests of like, uh,
(0:07:14) Codey: yesterday it was like the fairy godmother wants, has ordered a bunch of desserts.
(0:07:18) Codey: And then you bring it to the fairy godmother and she's like, thank you.
(0:07:21) Codey: Can you bring these to Ursula for me?
(0:07:22) Codey: And we're like, what the heck?
(0:07:24) Codey: Why are you what?
(0:07:25) Codey: Um, and then you get like a thousand, a thousand monies and you get some currency.
(0:07:30) Codey: But I really like the, I paid the in-game moonlight or moonstone currency or whatever.
(0:07:36) Codey: I have a bunch of it cause I've played since early access.
(0:07:39) Codey: So they gave, they were, they were like throwing that, that stuff at me.
(0:07:42) Codey: So I spent some of that on the star path for Mulan because pretty much everything
(0:07:50) Codey: is fire, like all of the outfits are really good.
(0:07:54) Codey: All of the furniture is really good.
(0:07:56) Codey: The outfits are really good, all of the furniture is really good.
(0:08:00) Codey: It's not cherries, it's magnolias, like these pink floating flower piles and stuff like that, but it's really really pretty.
(0:08:08) Codey: A lot of dresses or outfits that have that as part of the outfit, so yeah, definitely really like that.
(0:08:20) Codey: Still trying to get achievements in that game as well, so I've been playing that.
(0:08:26) Codey: That's pretty much it, what have you been up to?
(0:08:30) Al: I have been obviously playing Go Go Town.
(0:08:35) Al: I've been playing some more Day of the Diver.
(0:08:38) Al: I got really into that.
(0:08:39) Al: So
(0:08:41) Al: that's been going well and also farm RPG as usual.
(0:08:44) Codey: hmm how many bottles are we at now?
(0:08:45) Al: So.
(0:08:48) Al: Oh, 85, 85, it's taken a while.
(0:08:52) Al: It's taken a while. My I can't forget.
(0:08:54) Al: Is it the crafting, I think, that needs to be as well as the farming?
(0:08:59) Al: My farming level is 85.
(0:09:00) Al: So that's what's limiting me just now, but my crafting level is at 97.
(0:09:02) Codey: Mmm.
(0:09:04) Codey: Mmm.
(0:09:05) Al: So that kind of shows you the difference there.
(0:09:08) Al: Um, and it's like the, it's quite insane, the increases you need to get.
(0:09:12) Al: So I'm currently at 424 million XP for farming and to get to level 99, it's 2 billion.
(0:09:18) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:09:23) Al: So I'm not even a quarter of the way there, even though I'm at level 85.
(0:09:29) Al: So I think that.
(0:09:30) Al: That's going to take a while because it's quite limited in how much you can actually
(0:09:35) Al: farm obviously.
(0:09:37) Al: So I currently have 32 plots just now, eight lines, eight rows, yeah, eight rows of things,
(0:09:47) Al: and it's like a billion to get the next, the next row, a billion silver, which is going
(0:09:49) Codey: Yeah.
(0:09:52) Codey: Yeah.
(0:09:54) Al: to take me a long time to get to.
(0:09:55) Al: So, yeah, I'm just plugging away.
(0:09:56) Codey: I mean, it's good that you're still plugging away and going down that
(0:10:01) Codey: that storyline for curious listeners slash me.
(0:10:02) Al: Yes.
(0:10:02) Al: Yeah.
(0:10:08) Codey: Because I definitely wanted to hear the end of it, but did not have
(0:10:12) Codey: the ability to commit.
(0:10:17) Codey: But like, it's the sunk cost fallacy it's-
(0:10:20) Codey: you're like what you can't you're almost there
(0:10:24) Al: I know, I know, I know, I know...
(0:10:29) Codey: I'm sorry. I appreciate you appreciate your efforts
(0:10:34) Al: The good news is, today, as we're recording, I got my inventory to exactly one thing.
(0:10:40) Codey: Nice are you are you keeping it there are you gonna keep
(0:10:46) Al: of course I'm not keeping it there I need more inventory I know it's a good
(0:10:49) Codey: it's a good it's a it's a good like even number you know
(0:10:57) Codey: that's fair though
(0:10:58) Al: even number but like to get anywhere you need to get much higher got to keep
(0:11:02) Codey: I heard something the other day that five is the most even odd number and I
(0:11:11) Codey: yep it's true that's that is true it just is Cody's ADHD cast yeah news
(0:11:14) Al: Ah, so we're gonna talk about some news!
(0:11:22) Al: First up, first up we have, I feel like my headphones are on backwards.
(0:11:30) Al: They were on backwards, that's why. I was like, these feel uncomfortable and then I realized the
(0:11:34) Al: cable was on the wrong side, so that explains. That's why they were uncomfortable and not staying
(0:11:35) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:11:39) Al: on my head. Ever After Falls have announced that they're Steam Deck verified now.
(0:11:40) Codey: That's fair.
(0:11:44) Codey: Woo!
(0:11:45) Al: That's it. I don't think it's actually changed anything, this just means that they've
(0:11:46) Codey: That's it. That's the tweet.
(0:11:53) Al: had it approved that they were doing everything they were meant to do.
(0:11:57) Al: So they were doing everything they were meant to do and now they have proof.
(0:11:58) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:12:03) Codey: Whoo
(0:12:05) Al: Hotel Galactic have announced a timeline for their project. So their Kickstarter,
(0:12:10) Al: it'll be out by the time this episode out, I think comes out on Monday.

(0:12:15) Al: And they've it Monday. Monday, Monday, Monday.
(0:12:20) Al: The Kickstarter.
(0:12:23) Codey: Wednesday thing anyway
(0:12:25) Al: Not the, not the podcast episode. The Kickstarter for this game comes out on Monday.
(0:12:28) Codey: yes ye
(0:12:33) Al: How do you always confuse me? I don't, you're just...
(0:12:35) Codey: I'm just I confuse myself no so that's yeah
(0:12:39) Al: uh so the so the kickstart so the kickstarter will be out by the time you

(0:12:53) Codey: and uh sure looks like a good game i'm excited for it
(0:13:01) Codey: I don't know it uh I really like the little one of the characters named
(0:13:05) Codey: Sparn he looks real cute and it says that he trips over himself all the time and I was like dude same
(0:13:12) Codey: um so yeah a little cute dude and it's it it's like a i'm just gonna stop it looks good
(0:13:21) Codey: it's on my watch list.
(0:13:23) Codey: but it's really far away from time so who knows if the universe will still
(0:13:27) Codey: exist at that point.
(0:13:29) Al: Yeah, it's on my whistles as well, but so is everything basically
(0:13:34) Codey: are you gonna kick start it?
(0:13:38) Al: Probably
(0:13:39) Codey: okay are you saving
(0:13:40) Al: I just kick-started one. What did I just kick-start? Oh, yeah tiny garden the the the not a Polly Pocket game
(0:13:43) Codey: are you oh yep the polypocky came
(0:13:48) Al: The not a Polly Pocket game
(0:13:51) Al: That it's definitely not a Polly Pocket game
(0:13:54) Codey: Totally not. Uh, yeah. Cool.
(0:13:57) Al: But I feel like there's quite a few coming out.
(0:13:59) Al: Soon we've no kick starters.
(0:14:00) Codey: Polypocky games.
(0:14:08) Al: Because there's that one.
(0:14:12) Al: And then we've got farm folks and lose lagoon and superzoo
(0:14:15) Al: story and outbound and moon haven.
(0:14:20) Codey: yep I'm not gonna kickstart anything
(0:14:27) Codey: it looks really cute though it's on my eyes are on it my eyes are also on
(0:14:33) Codey: coral island
(0:14:34) Al: Nice, nice. They've given more information on their 1.1 update.
(0:14:38) Codey: did we know the name of the update
(0:14:42) Al: I don't know, but what I will say is that we did know everything that's in this title,
(0:14:48) Al: right? None of this is new information and it is a very boring title. Story finale, London Sea.
(0:14:56) Codey: I mean it's I think like at calling it story finale like points to the fact that they were like
(0:14:56) Al: Congrats, well done. What a great name.
(0:15:04) Codey: Stuff was not ready like stuff was not
(0:15:06) Al: They should have just called it. It's the 1.1 update called 1.0.
(0:15:08) Codey: It was not final
(0:15:15) Codey: Yeah
(0:15:16) Al: We've got the game now. Congrats.
(0:15:19) Codey: Yeah
(0:15:21) Al: So they've given some more information on things. Let's leave the most exciting thing
(0:15:27) Al: for last. So we'll talk about the fact that they've got some more of the merfolk townies.
(0:15:33) Al: Tony's this is for of
(0:15:36) Al: Galoon, Etna, Todi and Lannin
(0:15:41) Al: with a little bit of explanation for them. They've added a
(0:15:47) Al: gacha machine for recycling so you can put in rubbish and get things which is cool recycling stuff
(0:15:52) Codey: so did the recycling center ever work before? is it just something you have to turn on? okay this is
(0:15:56) Al: No, I don't think it did I think
(0:16:00) Codey: this is the first time okay because I was like I never got the recycling center to work so
(0:16:04) Al: Yeah, I think that might be why I think the recycling center was more of a theory than an actual thing
(0:16:05) Codey: is this so this is it i
(0:16:12) Codey: yeah I was surprised that this was that they're adding gacha a gacha mechanic um but yeah
(0:16:22) Al: I think it's cool the way they've done it. You can just call it recycling. You put in
(0:16:28) Al: rubbish, which you're not going to do anything else with. Once you've crafted five rubbish
(0:16:34) Al: chests, that's the only thing you're ever going to use it for, you throw it in this machine and you
(0:16:39) Al: get other stuff out of it. It's pointing towards the whole goal of this, which is the environment.
(0:16:46) Codey: they did also have the savannah which is there's a gacha machine in the savannah
(0:16:46) Al: So it's, you know, recycling. They show you getting a seedling, which is cool. I don't know.
(0:16:52) Al: We can turn rubbish into seedling, but I'm not going to complain.
(0:17:01) Al: Yes. Yeah, it's the same one, it's just in two different places.
(0:17:04) Codey: oh okay it's just another risk like okay got it
(0:17:10) Codey: which the savannah thing was wild because it showed
(0:17:15) Codey: that there's like a
(0:17:17) Codey: panther that you talk to and you end up racing the panther and you you could win an outfit that
(0:17:24) Al: I'm not 100% sure what the deal is with the Savannah, because I'm pretty sure it does
(0:17:27) Codey: is the panther
(0:17:33) Al: exist in the game currently, but I never ended up unlocking it. Because there were a few
(0:17:38) Al: items that I just didn't get to get to that point. So I know this Panther and the race
(0:17:44) Al: with the Panther is a new thing, but I'm pretty sure you could get to the Savannah.
(0:17:46) Codey: yeah um I i never was there uh but it but I just it's wild to me that there is this character
(0:17:56) Al: I think it's the only area I didn't get...
(0:18:02) Codey: and that the outfit that you can win from her is basically her like her skin um because I was
(0:18:08) Al: her skin basically right
(0:18:13) Codey: Yeah, I don't know how you would, I don't know.
(0:18:16) Codey: Yeah, it's, that's wild.
(0:18:19) Codey: She's really cool though and it's a cool idea to do like a racing thing, but yeah, that's that.
(0:18:26) Al: They've added new looks for sheds so you can change how they look, like the turnip and the
(0:18:34) Al: carrot and stuff like that which is pretty cool. I want my carrot shed. I want a carrot shed.
(0:18:36) Codey: Mm-hmm well you want a carrot shed I think I want I look
(0:18:43) Al: I actually want a pumpkin shed but it's not on the list but I want a pumpkin shed. Ooh good one.
(0:18:47) Codey: I want a potato like that would just that would be goober and I would like that
(0:18:54) Al: They've also added some new outfits. They've added a seller, which is exactly what you
(0:19:00) Al: expect it to be. Ages, wine. It does. Why is it so gross in there? That's weird. There's
(0:19:02) Codey: It looks like the sewer from- it looks like the sewer from Stardew.
(0:19:11) Al: a new fruit for increasing HP. There is the- oh yes, the Lumina sprinkler, as it's called.
(0:19:20) Al: So this is for those who aren't remembering, they are adding.
(0:19:24) Al: Underwater farming so you can farm specific plants underwater and instead of watering them,
(0:19:31) Al: you light them. So you've got like a little stick that lights them daily rather than watering them.
(0:19:37) Al: But up till this point, we didn't know whether there was going to be a sprinkler equivalent.
(0:19:39) Al: Thankfully, there is the Lumina sprinkler. So I'm happy about that.
(0:19:46) Al: They've also added some information on the multiplayer. I mean, it's kind of just
(0:19:51) Al: what you would expect, I think, mostly. It's kind of...
(0:19:54) Codey: Yeah.
(0:19:54) Al: Stardew, same style of multiplayer Stardew.
(0:19:58) Codey: Yup.
(0:19:59) Al: Someone hosts the game and up to three other people can join and you can troll.
(0:20:02) Codey: I'm so, I'm so excited to do it and have Mark from Australia spend all of my money.
(0:20:10) Codey: 'Cause the one time I played multiplayer Stardew, I played it with Mark and he spent all my money 'cause we didn't realize that the money was tied together.
(0:20:16) Al: Wild. And the most exciting thing in this update, I think you'll agree Cody, is dino suits for your animals.
(0:20:17) Codey: It was really funny.
(0:20:22) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:20:24) Codey: Which it doesn't- I love that they call it dino suits because it doesn't look like you put the animal in a suit.
(0:20:30) Codey: Like it's not a costume. It's like you've like transmogrified them to be something.
(0:20:36) Al: Yeah, I think the idea is they're trying to say that you are putting it in a suit.
(0:20:41) Al: But yeah, like, the cow gets smaller in one dimension when you do that.
(0:20:47) Al: Like, the cow cannot fit in there unless you're squishing its head and stretching it out, right?
(0:20:53) Codey: Yeah, it is cute
(0:20:53) Al: But I don't care. I think this is cool. I want a T-Rex. I want to turn my ostrich into a T-Rex.
(0:21:00) Al: I want to turn my cow into a Brontosaurus. I want this. This is great. But my big question is,
(0:21:07) Al: where are they for my dogs?
(0:21:10) Codey: I mean they wouldn't do that because you don't want a dinosaur in the home and dogs can't
(0:21:15) Al: I do I do I want I want I want my dog in a dino suit
(0:21:16) Codey: come out of the home.
(0:21:17) Codey: Well, if you want a dinosaur in the home, get the bearded dragon.
(0:21:22) Codey: I want the bearded dragon.
(0:21:25) Codey: I want the bearded dragon to become like not a dragon, like becomes like something else.
(0:21:32) Codey: I don't even know.
(0:21:34) Al: want to put it in a catsuit? Just get a cat then.
(0:21:35) Codey: Yes.
(0:21:36) Codey: but I want it to be like, I don't want it to be the like,
(0:21:40) Codey: Tom's a cat. I would want it to be a bearded, like a little bearded dragon head sticking out of a little cat outfit.
(0:21:45) Codey: I think that'd be so flipping cute. I might do this to my beard and beardy in real life, actually.
(0:21:50) Al: good.
(0:21:52) Codey: I'm gonna look up bearded dragon outfits.
(0:21:55) Al: Anyway, I'm looking forward to this update.
(0:21:58) Codey: Yep, I am also sorry. I'm there are some really cute bearded dragon outfits.
(0:22:03) Al: Alright, do we need to pause? Do we need to wait until you're finished?
(0:22:06) Codey: No, this is good content. No, it's
(0:22:10) Codey: we're fine um yeah I mean I'm still I've been wanting to jump back into
(0:22:17) Codey: Coral Island so this is just kind of making me want to wait a smidge when is
(0:22:24) Codey: this supposed to come out
(0:22:24) Al: They haven't said, it's currently in beta. I suspect Q3? I say that, that's like, no.
(0:22:30) Codey: okay
(0:22:33) Codey: well this is like the beginning of Q3 so
(0:22:35) Al: I think probably August, that would be my guess, August. Because I think they said there's
(0:22:42) Al: a second update coming out this year, so I feel like they need to get it out soon. But
(0:22:48) Al: I do not want it in July, please and thank you.
(0:22:50) Codey: So the answer is I'm gonna have to make my bearded dragon her own cat costume
(0:22:56) Codey: because they don't exist. Just if anyone else has a bearded dragon in
(0:22:57) Al: Yeah, are you surprised? I'm not surprised that no bearded dragon cat costume exists.
(0:23:06) Codey: I'm pretty surprised you don't know the bearded dragon community do you cuz I
(0:23:09) Al: It seems pretty niche. I mean, why not just get a cat?
(0:23:17) Codey: don't want that I want like it's like when you put your cat in a little cost
(0:23:22) Codey: little dragon costume you don't want a lizard you just want to embarrass your
(0:23:26) Codey: animal
(0:23:27) Al: I don't think they have feelings like that, I don't think they feel embarrassment because
(0:23:33) Al: that's a social construction.
(0:23:38) Codey: Stella acts very embarrassed sometimes. I don't know about the dragon, but
(0:23:43) Codey: we have two new games that we can talk about.
(0:23:48) Al: Not that we're going to have much to talk about the first one.
(0:23:50) Al: Real fishing days of summer.
(0:23:53) Al: The new real fishing game comes out on October 28th on Switch and PS5 and it is exactly what
(0:23:58) Al: you expect.
(0:23:59) Al: It's a new real fishing game.
(0:24:02) Al: It looks exactly the same as the previous real fishing game, and there's fish.
(0:24:08) Al: If you love the real fishing games, I'm sure you'll be excited to play.
(0:24:10) Codey: it just makes me want to play I think there's a fishing game that I've been
(0:24:15) Codey: wanting to play that's on Game Pass and I did grow up playing like I think it
(0:24:21) Codey: was just like Bass Pro Shop fishing I remember playing that as like a eight
(0:24:26) Codey: year old so yeah looks alright
(0:24:30) Al: Cool. The other game is called Preserve and the blurb about this is "Preserve is a relaxing
(0:24:40) Al: puzzle nature building game in which you flourish a vibrant ecosystem by cleverly placing plants
(0:24:47) Al: and animals to create a perfect symbiosis to your liking." So you've got like these hexagonal
(0:24:57) Al: tiles that have different biomes and stuff like that.
(0:25:00) Al: And it looks like you put them together to make a world that you want.
(0:25:04) Al: There's animals as well.
(0:25:06) Codey: - Yep, yeah, I like that it's a puzzle.
(0:25:11) Codey: Like I like the idea of it being a puzzle game
(0:25:14) Codey: and like maybe they have like requirements for each puzzle.
(0:25:19) Codey: Like build a puzzle that has 10 animals
(0:25:22) Codey: from four different biomes or something like that,
(0:25:24) Codey: you know, and like to build maybe like one of the animals
(0:25:28) Codey: requires like a, I'm just making this up.
(0:25:32) Codey: maybe like the wolf requires.
(0:25:36) Codey: a forest biome right next to a meadow biome that has a river biome going through it
(0:25:40) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:25:41) Codey: um to like make it a puzzle I think that would be really cool um I i'm never a fan of these
(0:25:49) Codey: like island games where like it's the world is just kind of a floating thing and you just
(0:25:55) Codey: kind of build on top of these hexagonal I don't even know how to describe it but there
(0:26:02) Codey: There's been a lot of games that have been coming out like this.
(0:26:06) Codey: I'm not a super big fan of that but also like as an ecologist I look at a game like this and I'm like this would never you'd put the wolves in the forest and they'd be like heck you I'm gonna go over here like you can't box you can't box nature that way so but yeah coming on August 8 to steam both Windows Max and Mac and Linux that's cool what did you think about this game?
(0:26:19) Al: Animals don't do what you want them to, yeah.
(0:26:32) Al: It's probably not something I'd play, but I think it looks cool, and I know some people
(0:26:36) Al: love these times for games, so yeah, it's cool.
(0:26:38) Codey: Mm-hmm I wonder how much it's gonna be click does not have an amount
(0:26:49) Al: And speaking of the whole animals not doing what you want, they reintroduced beavers in
(0:26:56) Codey: Yeah.
(0:26:58) Al: Scotland like maybe 10 years ago or something like that. And now the farmers are like, "Can
(0:27:04) Al: we kill them, please?" And you're like, "Oh, no, you can't kill them. We put all the effort
(0:27:06) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:27:09) Al: into putting them back into the wild. No, you can't kill them."
(0:27:12) Codey: Yep. That was the classic thing in Oregon.
(0:27:16) Codey: Everyone was like, "Bring the wolves back, because we killed all the wolves."
(0:27:18) Codey: But then we had too many deer, and the deer population were getting really gross.
(0:27:21) Al: Hmm.
(0:27:24) Codey: to bring them back, and then all of the...
(0:27:26) Codey: Ag folks that live...the agricultural folks that live on the east side of the state were like
(0:27:32) Codey: "We follow the three S's, the shoot it shovel it and shut up."
(0:27:34) Al: Oh, look, it's an animal, can we kill it?
(0:27:39) Codey: Yeah, and they're just like, "We want to kill...it's eating our cows. We're gonna kill it." And it's like...
(0:27:45) Al: Can you just stop killing just just just for a minute, right?
(0:27:48) Codey: Well, and they also...like a lot of those people, they put their cows on
(0:27:53) Codey: Bureau of Land Management land, which is like free land
(0:27:57) Codey: for anyone to use, but like if you're not putting your cows within an enclosure, it's kind of on you. I'm not gonna lie.
(0:28:00) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I recently learned why beavers dam. Do you know how this works? I don't know
(0:28:04) Codey: Bye.
(0:28:10) Al: if this is in your area of interest at all. It's fascinating, because it's like, for those
(0:28:12) Codey: Oh it is. 100%. Oregon is the bigger state.
(0:28:15) Codey: So.
(0:28:16) Codey: All right.
(0:28:18) Al: who, feel free to correct me if I've misunderstood this Cody, but for listeners, basically the
(0:28:23) Al: dam, which raises the level of the water, which means that they store water.
(0:28:30) Al: And not water, they store food under the water, which allows them there, because the water
(0:28:36) Al: is increased, it goes into their house, and then that means that it doesn't freeze inside
(0:28:42) Al: their house, so they can still get into the water, even when the surface of the water
(0:28:46) Al: is frozen outside of there, and it preserves their food in the cold water underneath.
(0:28:51) Al: Isn't that really cool? That's so clever.
(0:28:54) Codey: which if they build on like the edge of a lake or something
(0:28:58) Codey: is fine. that doesn't really mess with anything but then when they build in
(0:29:03) Codey: a riverine system like in a river or a creek or a
(0:29:07) Codey: stream or some small system and they can divert entire
(0:29:11) Codey: like watersheds they're called what's they're known as a keystone species
(0:29:17) Codey: because if they are in an environment they completely change the structure of
(0:29:21) Codey: the environment.
(0:29:22) Al: Don't know anyone else like that.
(0:29:25) Codey: uh-uh.
(0:29:25) Al: Yeah, it's just so clever. I love it.
(0:29:26) Codey: um...
(0:29:28) Codey: usually--
(0:29:32) Codey: they're really mean, though.
(0:29:32) Al: Oh yeah, no, I wasn't planning on doing it. I'll be honest with you.
(0:29:34) Codey: don't go up to them.
(0:29:38) Codey: I haven't had to mess with one yet,
(0:29:40) Codey: but, like,
(0:29:42) Codey: I have a feeling Stella would try and go for it
(0:29:44) Codey: and I would be really worried about that.
(0:29:45) Al: I generally appreciate nature from a distance. That's my general rule. Now, we don't have
(0:29:52) Al: many things in this country that could kill me, but that's just my general rule. I enjoy
(0:29:58) Al: it over there and I'm over here and we're all good.
(0:30:00) Codey: Yeah.
(0:30:03) Codey: Yep.
(0:30:07) Al: So that's the news.
(0:30:08) Codey: Whoo!
(0:30:12) Al: We are going to talk about Gogotown, our first impressions. So I have purchased the
(0:30:18) Al: and I've put in maybe 15, 20 hours I think, something like that.
(0:30:22) Al: Cody has purchased the game and put zero errors into it.
(0:30:22) Codey: didn't even purchase it... no. uh-uh. I mean it's still funny to say Cody has not
(0:30:26) Al: I thought you said you'd bought it already. Did you not say that to me? That ruins my
(0:30:37) Codey: purchased the game and has put none hours into it but I did watch a French
(0:30:46) Codey: guy for like five minutes on Twitch so I basically know everything
(0:30:50) Codey: about the game.
(0:30:50) Al: Hehehe, everything!
(0:30:52) Codey: No, it was, I've watched the developers play a little bit, but not a ton.
(0:31:00) Al: But let me do an intro. I feel an interesting mix between a standard cottagecore farming
(0:31:01) Codey: I'm basically coming in naive, so.
(0:31:14) Al: game and a management style game where you are controlling a character. You have a character
(0:31:20) Al: who you control and you move around and you do your standard things. You do your farming,
(0:31:24) Al: you do your wood chopping, you do your mining, you do your fishing. But you're also...
(0:31:30) Al: So, controlling the town, you're basically in control kind of Animal Crossing-esque. But
(0:31:35) Al: in my opinion, in a much nicer way in that you have a build mode where you can just move
(0:31:41) Al: things around rather than having to manually go and do them all. Different people like
(0:31:44) Al: different things, but I quite like that. Your aim is to build up this town. It basically
(0:31:52) Al: doesn't exist when you get there. You have to build up, you get visitors, you encourage
(0:31:56) Al: visitors to stay and you build up your town.
(0:32:00) Al: Into a thriving mini Metropolis is a kind of short way of explaining it without going into too much detail at the start.
(0:32:11) Al: I guess my first impressions before we go into details of the mechanics would be that I think there's a really fun and strong core game here,
(0:32:25) Al: but it very much feels like an early action.
(0:32:30) Al: Well, it feels like that to me, for listeners, I talked about it in the first Ooblets episode.
(0:32:30) Codey: - Hmm.
(0:32:43) Codey: I have never played Ooblets.
(0:32:54) Al: It was like a very strong, very clearly defined game, but very limited.
(0:33:00) Al: It feels like the game has a lot of room to expand, and it's not there yet, but everything
(0:33:11) Al: that is there is fun, but the question is, is it enough to be a compelling game in and
(0:33:17) Al: of itself just now?
(0:33:19) Al: I think it does, but I think if you were to play this just now, you would feel like there's
(0:33:26) Al: quite a lot missing, but you're not quite sure what that is.
(0:33:30) Al: It's hard, it's not like in Coral Island where you go, "Oh, and now I've reached the end of the
(0:33:37) Al: story," but it's clearly not the end of the story. It's not like that. It's like,
(0:33:42) Al: "Okay, this is fun, but I feel like there's stuff missing. I just don't know what that is."
(0:33:46) Codey: Yeah, like where where is the missing part and is or is this just where it ends?
(0:33:52) Al: Yeah, and it's definitely not because they've had a good detailed list of what they're wanting
(0:33:59) Al: to do and the good thing is that they have taken people's opinions and they've changed
(0:34:04) Al: what they're planning to do, not what they're planning to do, but the order they're planning
(0:34:07) Al: to do because people's priorities are different from what theirs were. So they've gone, "Oh,
(0:34:11) Al: right, OK, you really want this. That's fine. We'll bump that up," the priority list type
(0:34:14) Al: thing, which is really good listening to that feedback.
(0:34:20) Al: I guess let's go into some of this...
(0:34:22) Al: The specifics and feel free to input into any of these that you actually saw in the game.
(0:34:28) Al: So the farming, you start out with just like a few plots, you have to like buy a plot,
(0:34:37) Al: you can't just like you don't have a hole to do whatever. It's like everything in this
(0:34:42) Al: game, it's like you have a limited number that you're allowed to buy until you level
(0:34:46) Al: up and then you can buy more. Which I understand why they've done it because they want to like
(0:34:52) Al: what you can do until you do more and then it feels like you're expanding that way.
(0:34:57) Al: But personally, I'm not a huge fan of that because it feels like oh but I have the money.
(0:35:02) Al: My big problem in this game is I have max money and I can't spend it because there's
(0:35:07) Al: nothing to buy because I've already bought everything. But I can't make any more money
(0:35:12) Al: because apparently there's a max amount of money you can have which feels really weird.
(0:35:20) Codey: I mean your your purse is only so big. Can you upgrade it?
(0:35:20) Al: But yeah it just feels like the balance isn't right there.
(0:35:22) Al: I haven't seen anything to be able to do that. Now having said that, I haven't gone through all
(0:35:33) Al: of the upgrades. I think I'm maybe like level five of the the the tech tree, but I'm not sure.
(0:35:40) Codey: Okay what's your how much do you have for monies okay that's what the
(0:35:42) Al: I haven't seen anything that upgrades that. I think it's a thousand.
(0:35:50) Codey: developers are also they also have on their stream that they're streaming
(0:35:52) Al: Right, okay. I think it is, yeah. And I don't know whether that's something they're planning
(0:35:53) Codey: right now so that's probably
(0:35:57) Al: on adding upgrades to or what. It feels like a weird, like I've never played a game where
(0:36:02) Al: they limit the max amount of money you're able to have. That feels like a weird and arbitrary
(0:36:08) Al: restriction. And I'm not sure why it would be there other than because they don't trust their
(0:36:13) Al: own economy in the game. It's not difficulty though, right? Like, especially if there's nothing
(0:36:14) Codey: Hmm, it adds a level of difficulty.
(0:36:22) Al: money on, because then you just get to the point where you're like, okay, now I've unlocked
(0:36:26) Al: something and I can immediately buy everything. And then I just, and then once I've bought things,
(0:36:31) Al: I can then earn money again. Like I've never got to the point where I've not had enough money for
(0:36:36) Al: that. And money's pretty easy to make because you just, you just wait. Like literally, if you just
(0:36:44) Al: had this game running without you doing anything, especially once you've unlocked a bunch of the
(0:36:48) Al: stuff and you've got it implemented the game basically runs itself so you could just start
(0:36:50) Codey: I think that's what it is. I think that's what I think of it being more
(0:36:52) Al: there and you would gain money doing nothing
(0:36:58) Codey: difficulty is because you can't just do that because at a certain point like if
(0:37:03) Codey: you left the game and went into another room or like went and did something else
(0:37:07) Codey: and you came back maybe like an hour into that it was at max money so there
(0:37:13) Codey: was no point in like letting the game run all of that time you would have had
(0:37:19) Codey: to check in on it.
(0:37:20) Codey: And fix it somehow, you know.
(0:37:22) Al: Yeah, but then my problem is there's nothing to spend the money on. There's literally nothing
(0:37:27) Al: I can spend the money on. Because they limit how much you can do. There is an import/export thing
(0:37:35) Al: that I probably don't need to go into too much detail of, but basically you can sell things
(0:37:41) Al: to other towns. It's not actual multiplayer, don't get me wrong. It's just you're selling
(0:37:46) Al: stuff to someone else. It doesn't matter. Someone requests it and you sell it. You don't get money,
(0:37:52) Al: tokens. Then you can use that to buy more stuff. But I think that's also limited.
(0:37:58) Al: I bought another storage thing and then that was it. It was sold out. It just feels like
(0:38:07) Al: everything is limited. There's nothing that isn't limited in the game.
(0:38:13) Al: And I think that would be my second biggest frustration. I really like this game. I think
(0:38:19) Al: I think it's really fun to play, it's really fluid.
(0:38:22) Al: The movement is fun especially when you get some of the vehicles, like there's a skateboard
(0:38:28) Al: and there's a bike and there's a car, a go-kart and stuff like that. They're all really fun
(0:38:35) Al: to play and I can just, I find myself just riding around on them.
(0:38:44) Al: The game is just fun to play but there's a few things and one of them is the fact that
(0:38:49) Al: it's so limited in what you can buy.
(0:38:51) Al: And that I...
(0:38:52) Al: It adds into the frustration when you basically don't have an inventory and you have a bag
(0:39:03) Al: but it's like you can only fit in certain amounts.
(0:39:07) Al: It's one of these things where it's like different things are different sizes.
(0:39:11) Al: So if you had a steel girder in your bag, you could only have two of them because they're
(0:39:14) Codey: - Mm-hmm, yeah.
(0:39:16) Al: so big.
(0:39:17) Al: If you had rocks, you could have 10 of them sort of thing, which okay, sure, fine.
(0:39:23) Al: You can use to get around that, like you have a van you can drive that you can fill up and
(0:39:26) Al: it has more...
(0:39:27) Al: But then you have to put things places and there are storage boxes, but the storage boxes
(0:39:34) Al: do the same thing as your bag and they are very limited.
(0:39:38) Al: So I'm at the point where I have people mining and their boxes are all full, but I need them
(0:39:45) Al: to get something different.
(0:39:46) Al: So I have to get the stuff out the box so they get something different because I've
(0:39:49) Al: used up all of my iron and they've just
(0:39:52) Al: been filling it with stone because I keep using the iron for things because there's
(0:39:56) Al: nothing to use stone on anymore because I've done everything and the more complex ones
(0:40:01) Al: need iron instead of stone so they just keep adding stone and I can't use the stone for
(0:40:06) Al: anything so I have boxes and boxes full of stone that I don't know what to do with and
(0:40:12) Al: I can't buy more boxes so all of my boxes are full of stone and I can't get any more
(0:40:17) Al: boxes and I just I want to know what to do with the stone.
(0:40:22) Al: And also I just want more boxes like the inventory thing is the thing that I understand that
(0:40:32) Al: some people might like it but I think I actively don't like it like I just I just want a universal
(0:40:40) Al: storage thing or at least like a box that doesn't have a limit to it right like I think
(0:40:45) Al: I see where they're going with the like it's trying to be a very physical game right like
(0:40:52) Al: this thing and then you put it in a box or you mine something and then you take it to
(0:40:55) Al: the place that it's needed and then I'm going to talk about the the hiring of people like
(0:41:02) Al: you can you can use the people that you you convinced to move there you can use them to
(0:41:07) Al: do to to do jobs that you you do at the beginning so it allows you to have that automation which
(0:41:14) Al: is fun and then you assign them to specific jobs so you say this is my miner and this
(0:41:19) Al: This is my tree cutter.
(0:41:20) Al: This is my fisher.
(0:41:21) Al: This is my farmer.
(0:41:22) Al: They will put things in the boxes that you put near them and then you have to move them
(0:41:27) Al: between them but then you can get someone who is a courier so their job is just to take
(0:41:31) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:41:32) Al: things from the places that they are to the places that they need.
(0:41:36) Al: I get that and that's all fun.
(0:41:39) Al: I mean it when I say that, I think that is actually fun because it's very physical and
(0:41:44) Al: it's very material and that's good but because the boxes do the same thing, I just have boxes
(0:41:53) Al: of stone everywhere that I can't do anything with and it's filling up storage that I could
(0:41:58) Al: be using for other things.
(0:42:00) Codey: yeah it's giving factorial vibes you need to make it more efficient so i'm reading the
(0:42:08) Codey: developer update that came out like a week ago and they've uh I don't know if it has a roadmap
(0:42:10) Al: Is this the road map one?
(0:42:16) Al: It's not a road map so much as like, here are the things we're going to focus on, sort
(0:42:20) Al: of thing.
(0:42:20) Codey: yeah so they talk about like minor update one like the things that they're
(0:42:23) Al: Yes.
(0:42:24) Codey: so one of them says one of them says too much stuff the overflow chronicles and
(0:42:30) Codey: it talks about the fact that you have too many items but you don't have anything to do with them
(0:42:34) Al: Oh nice!
(0:42:36) Codey: so you can dispose of the items in a machine that will become available to you through the tech tier
(0:42:41) Al: Oh and you receive import tickets, nice! Okay cool, cool!
(0:42:44) Codey: and then further down they also say like we have broken down the ai worker feedback into
(0:42:49) Codey: the following issues so one of them is the ai over producing resources their backpacks filling up
(0:42:54) Codey: storage bins being placed outside of zones that's not really that important
(0:42:58) Al: Yeah, I think those are mostly bugs rather than the actual fundamental issue and the
(0:43:04) Al: fundamental issue is I have too much stuff, which they're obviously trying to figure out
(0:43:09) Al: some ways to deal with that. Yeah, I can see that that would certainly improve it. I would
(0:43:10) Codey: Yeah.
(0:43:10) Codey: Mmhmm.
(0:43:17) Al: also just be able to buy unlimited storage. I understand why they're limiting a lot of
(0:43:21) Al: things and I'm not saying don't have any limits on things, but storage specifically.
(0:43:22) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:43:28) Codey: Really? Yeah.
(0:43:28) Al: Like, that seems like such a weird thing to limit. Like, if I want to have 100 boxes
(0:43:35) Al: of stone, why not? You know, like, sure, limit the things that you can, like, limit the buildings
(0:43:43) Al: so you can only have certain numbers of people living there. Limit the attractions you have
(0:43:47) Al: so you can't just, like, get infinite money in a day sort of thing. You know, that all
(0:43:52) Al: makes sense. But storage, of all things. Give me more storage, please.
(0:43:56) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:43:58) Al: Yeah, it's interesting, because I generally don't like management games and this is very
(0:43:58) Codey: - Management games, woo!
(0:44:06) Al: much more of a management game than I thought it was going to be. But I do find it fun.
(0:44:15) Al: I don't think it's something that I'm going to put, like, hundreds of hours into, like
(0:44:19) Al: I have done with Stardew and Coral Island. But it's fun being different.
(0:44:25) Codey: Mm-hmm. Honestly, the fact that it's more of a management game, uh, it has endeared me to it more.
(0:44:32) Codey: No. Um, yeah. So I think, because I think that that, like making things more efficient and like
(0:44:39) Codey: hiring people and having them work in different areas and like having, like being like this person
(0:44:44) Codey: gets to work as a courier and like this zone, because it looks like you zone things, right?
(0:44:48) Al: So, the zones are there by default. So, you have, like, the map has - this is the mining
(0:44:55) Al: zone, it is where the caves are. This is the forestry zone. That's the word I keep trying
(0:45:01) Al: to think of - forestry zone. And that's where the forest is, obviously. This is the fishing
(0:45:05) Al: zone, that's where the river is. And then there's the farming zone, which, I mean, that
(0:45:11) Al: could probably be anywhere. But it is a fixed - these are fixed zones. And you put certain
(0:45:15) Al: things within them to do that so you have like
(0:45:18) Al: a time clock so you put a time clock in the zone and then you you go to the time clock and you say I want this person to do this job and then they will use anything that's in that zone so you put things in the zone to allow them to use it so you put storage in and they will use that to put things in you put in machines and they will use the machines to make different things etc etc so I think one of the other complaints that people had in general which I think I agree is something
(0:45:48) Al: they need to improve but I wasn't like oh I can't believe they haven't got it or they need to have it right now is like more space because it does fill up quite quickly and they've definitely said that they're going to be doing that they're going to be adding expansions to the map which is good but yeah I think that is not the thing that I was like I need this right now probably because I hadn't got to the end of the tech tree yet
(0:45:58) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:46:02) Codey: Expanding yeah, yep
(0:46:12) Codey: so okay so there are these different tasks that you can allot to people can
(0:46:19) Codey: you also do the tasks like yourself okay
(0:46:21) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you start out by doing it yourself, right? You have
(0:46:24) Codey: okay
(0:46:26) Al: to upgrade the tech tree to get the time clocks. So like after you've done like the first full
(0:46:29) Codey: got it
(0:46:32) Al: tech tree, then you get a second line of the tech tree and it goes like, here is the forestry
(0:46:39) Al: expansion. And that gives you a machine to make log, not logs, planks. And it gives you
(0:46:49) Al: a time clock for the forestry area and it gives you
(0:46:51) Al: another storage thing and it gives you another chainsaw, which by the way, the chainsaw
(0:46:57) Al: for cutting down trees is so much fun. I don't know why more games don't have that. It's great.
(0:47:02) Al: Then you also have the mining expansion, which gives you the mining time clock, et cetera,
(0:47:07) Al: et cetera. So yeah, you unlock them as you go. So you have to do everything to start with
(0:47:12) Al: and as you go, you get the ability to automate it with workers using the time clocks. But then you
(0:47:18) Al: you can also just do them if you want.
(0:47:20) Al: Yeah, you can just go.
(0:47:21) Al: Oh, this worker's being too slow, or I want this specific thing.
(0:47:24) Al: I'm going to go do that just now.
(0:47:26) Al: And that's-- yeah, that's totally fine.
(0:47:29) Al: I didn't find myself finding I needed to do that, though.
(0:47:31) Al: The AIs, I think, were pretty good.
(0:47:34) Al: Yeah, like, the only time I felt like I needed to do something
(0:47:38) Al: because the workers weren't doing it
(0:47:39) Al: is because all their storage was full,
(0:47:41) Al: so they couldn't do anything, you know?
(0:47:42) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:47:44) Al: Like, they couldn't make more steel beams
(0:47:47) Al: because there was nowhere to put them.
(0:47:49) Al: Fair enough, I understand that.
(0:47:51) Al: Sorry, there's nothing I can do with that.
(0:47:51) Codey: The supply chain must grow, yeah.
(0:47:53) Al: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
(0:47:54) Codey: I mean, it's early access, so it's awesome, yeah.
(0:47:57) Al: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
(0:47:59) Al: I guess my point is more like if these things
(0:48:01) Al: sound like they would be frustrating to you,
(0:48:03) Al: wait for 1.0, like there's nothing wrong with that.
(0:48:05) Al: And I think it is a really fun game.
(0:48:10) Al: I'm really enjoying it.
(0:48:12) Al: But I do think I'm probably at the point where I'm like,
(0:48:15) Al: okay, now I wait for 1.0 before I play more.
(0:48:19) Al: because I feel like
(0:48:21) Al: I can see how it's going to be improving and I want that. I want the improved version.
(0:48:28) Al: I don't regret the time I put into it. It has been fun doing what I've been doing.
(0:48:34) Al: I'm done 15, 20 hours is probably enough in early access. Maybe I'll play a different point
(0:48:41) Al: depending on what the update. Obviously, I'll be keeping an eye on the updates and
(0:48:44) Al: we'll be talking about them here because I always do. The games that I'm more excited
(0:48:46) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:48:48) Al: the boat we talk about more often.
(0:48:49) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:48:51) Al: But I'll definitely I'll definitely get back into it when it hits 1.0.
(0:48:56) Codey: I mean, we definitely talked about that during the halfway through the games episode as well where like what games are we looking forward to the most and a lot of the games were just the 1.0 versions of games that we had already played and it's it's I mean, that's the thing is that you can play them in either early access or whatever and then it just it solidifies that like, yes, this game is worth my time now I'll set it down. Yeah.
(0:49:05) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:49:22) Al: Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because if you play this and you're
(0:49:26) Al: like, it's not for me, then then that's it. You know, you're not going to go back to it.
(0:49:30) Al: But yeah, I did the same thing for, for Coral Island. I played, I played quite a lot of
(0:49:35) Al: that game first time around, like maybe 60 hours in early access. And then I put it down
(0:49:40) Al: and 1.0 came around and I played another 150 hours. So, you know, like, yeah. It's yeah,
(0:49:46) Codey: Yeah, so you mentioned the chainsaw for cutting down trees, so that's how the tree cutting
(0:49:57) Al: Yes oh yes yeah okay yeah good good point so uh mining you have like a big drill that you use
(0:50:04) Al: that you're walking around with and you just like drill into rocks um the farming you have a fire
(0:50:11) Al: hose for watering which is just fantastic um especially love it because well it's not a watering
(0:50:18) Al: can so it's not a limited amount of water love it but you you literally you pick up the fire hose
(0:50:23) Al: you go over you water everything and then when you let go of the fire hose it just like
(0:50:27) Al: coils back up and goes to where it's meant to be just fantastic absolutely love it there's so much
(0:50:32) Al: care and attention into the animations in this game that yeah you really feel that it's so like
(0:50:39) Al: as you're dragging it you see the hose like flapping around and then you press it and you see
(0:50:43) Al: it like expand when it's clearly got water in it yeah just so much fun um fishing it's a fishing
(0:50:46) Codey: Yeah.
(0:50:50) Al: rod they also have crab pots uh but yeah I mean the main thing is a is a is a fishing rod it they
(0:50:57) Al: anything funny like they have for the other ones with that
(0:51:01) Al: oh and cleaning you have to clean they have a bubble gun it's fun the bubble gun
(0:51:02) Codey: I mean The what?
(0:51:08) Codey: Like you what?
(0:51:09) Al: bubble gun it's a gun that does bubbles and it cleans things
(0:51:13) Codey: Assuming bubbles are cleaning?
(0:51:15) Al: yeah like you know but yeah yeah
(0:51:17) Codey: Like getting sudsy with soap?
(0:51:20) Codey: Okay.
(0:51:24) Codey: So what all do you clean?
(0:51:25) Codey: Like are you cleaning your?
(0:51:26) Codey: Oh, okay.
(0:51:26) Al: the road just gets dirty, right? Because people are there, there's mud that appears on the
(0:51:28) Codey: Oh, okay.
(0:51:31) Al: road. People drop rubbish sometimes, you have to pick that up. But yeah, it's like you'll
(0:51:35) Al: just see big splotches on the ground and people don't like it, so you have to clean it up
(0:51:39) Al: if you don't want your guest to be unhappy. So yeah, you grab the bubble gun and you go
(0:51:45) Al: and spray bubbles everywhere and that cleans it. No. They will only throw rubbish if your
(0:51:48) Codey: If someone drops rubbish, can you throw them in jail?
(0:51:55) Al: Your bins are full so you have to empty your bins.
(0:51:56) Al: Your bins so you got to keep on top of these things got to pay your bin worker because there's a you can you can automate that as well.
(0:52:03) Codey: Yep
(0:52:06) Al: So I have a cleaner and he empties the bins and cleans the ground.
(0:52:07) Codey: Yep
(0:52:10) Codey: I always loved that in Zoo Tycoon as well
(0:52:12) Al: Oh.
(0:52:13) Codey: Like there was like the maintenance guy that goes around and fixes everything and I was like bruh so many
(0:52:14) Al: Yeah.
(0:52:18) Codey: So many garbage cans that are over
(0:52:24) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:52:25) Al: Um, I'll see you guys next time.
(0:52:26) Al: Or the other thing is, uh, this might be, if you, if you really care about any sort
(0:52:32) Al: of spoilers for this game, this is where you can, you can stop.
(0:52:34) Al: I think this will probably be the last thing I talk about.
(0:52:37) Al: It's not really a spoiler.
(0:52:38) Al: It's just a funny little thing, but it's the closest story that this game has.
(0:52:42) Al: Um, you go to a certain point in the map, like it feels like you've kind of gone down
(0:52:47) Al: a little bit of a maze and then you appear at this area, you stand there and a UFO comes
(0:52:53) Al: down and aliens just appear and they're just walking they just
(0:52:56) Al: become guests in your town like the humans do and you can convince them to stay there.
(0:52:58) Codey: Yeah.
(0:53:01) Al: So I have an alien who's living in my town and he is the fisherman and he wears a little
(0:53:07) Codey: My gosh oh
(0:53:08) Al: fish he wears a little fisherman's hat.
(0:53:10) Codey: My gosh I did see like in the developer play I was like what the heck there's all these UFOs
(0:53:18) Codey: Aliens streaming out of the UFO like excuse me
(0:53:20) Al: Yeah, that'll be it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, my Fisherman is an alien.
(0:53:22) Codey: It was wild
(0:53:27) Codey: Cool interesting so it's
(0:53:29) Al: It's the sequel to My Parents Are Aliens.
(0:53:32) Codey: Yeah, oh, yeah
(0:53:35) Codey: Which that how does that work?
(0:53:37) Codey: Anyway, um
(0:53:40) Codey: Okay, so we talked about all the mechanics
(0:53:40) Al: He has tentacles.
(0:53:44) Codey: Having guests having hiring. What are the quests?
(0:53:48) Al: Yeah so that's kind of like to unlock the tech tree so you have specific things that
(0:53:55) Al: you do which gives you like it will say like oh get this amount of money in a day or build
(0:54:02) Al: these specific restaurants like you've got a whole bunch of different restaurants like
(0:54:07) Al: you've got like a juice bar and a sushi bar and stuff like that so you have to build specific
(0:54:12) Al: ones and they give you a certain a different kind of currency which you use to unlock things
(0:54:18) Al: and once you've unlocked everything in that on level one of the tech tree then unlocks level two
(0:54:24) Al: that you can then unlock those things so yeah the quests are just ways to give you a second
(0:54:28) Al: currency that allow you to unlock the tech tree and gives you more things to do like the time clocks
(0:54:34) Codey: Okay, so tech tree is mostly like either quality of life or just like things that change the game bliss
(0:54:40) Al: yeah or yeah like bigger houses like you start off with just building like small
(0:54:46) Al: houses that only has two people you can unlock apartment buildings that can house
(0:54:50) Al: up to like ten you can then you know unlock like different shops like to
(0:54:57) Al: start with I think you've just got like two shops and then you can unlock more
(0:55:00) Al: like a fish and chip shop and stuff like that so yeah it's it's unlocking
(0:55:04) Al: buildings or tools or you know stuff like that that allows you to expand the
(0:55:10) Al: and get more people and get more stuff
(0:55:13) Codey: is there a town rating? okay I was gonna say that's like the one thing that's missing for this
(0:55:14) Al: there is yeah
(0:55:19) Codey: to be a zoo tycoon style like management game
(0:55:22) Al: Yeah, no, it's exactly, yeah, it's exactly, it's actually really funny, right? So the
(0:55:26) Al: town rating thing, so you, basically for every positive review you get from a guest, right?
(0:55:32) Al: If they come and they don't see anything negative and they go away, you get a point. And once
(0:55:36) Al: you hit a certain rating, then you can unlock the next level, the next, once you've done
(0:55:42) Al: that and done everything in the current level of the tech tree, that's where you can then
(0:55:46) Al: unlock the next one. But it's like this, the way that it unlocks is you get a call.
(0:55:52) Al: you're ready for your assessment, and then you have to decide what your assessment is,
(0:55:57) Al: and you get three challenges during that assessment, but also you have all these people with hardhats
(0:56:02) Al: appear, so it's like they're assessing the town and stuff like that. So like, you're
(0:56:07) Al: trying to make as much money as possible while also making sure that you've built all the
(0:56:10) Al: things you need to do. And also there's all, like, 20 people in hardhats going around checking
(0:56:16) Al: your town at the same time. It's really funny.
(0:56:20) Codey: Okay, that was really cool.
(0:56:24) Codey: So then you talked about the transportation
(0:56:27) Codey: or the way to like move around the place is really good
(0:56:32) Codey: with the different like vehicles.
(0:56:33) Codey: The thing that I, another thing that I liked
(0:56:35) Codey: that I was watching when I was watching the developer stream
(0:56:37) Codey: is if you have more than one person,
(0:56:39) Codey: like some of the vehicles, you can carry both people.
(0:56:44) Al: Oh, was that in court? Yeah, I didn't realize that because I've not done co-op.
(0:56:48) Codey: If we were playing together and you were like,
(0:56:51) Codey: oh man, I really wanna go to this other zone
(0:56:53) Codey: and we're all the way across the map,
(0:56:55) Codey: like I'd be like, oh, hop on,
(0:56:56) Codey: like I'm also going over there.
(0:56:57) Codey: Then I could like drop you off or something.
(0:57:00) Al: Like on, like you could just take me on your unicorn tricycle.
(0:57:04) Codey: I don't know if the,
(0:57:06) Codey: I would definitely have the unicorn tricycle,
(0:57:07) Codey: but I don't know if those would work.
(0:57:10) Al: Oh just the vat is it the van the van yeah okay yeah makes sense I can see how
(0:57:11) Codey: It might have to be the, yeah, it might just be the van.
(0:57:15) Codey: Though that would be really funny
(0:57:16) Al: that would have the space yeah that would be brilliant
(0:57:17) Codey: if you just jumped on the back of the tricycle.
(0:57:19) Codey: Um, that would be lovely.
(0:57:23) Codey: Um, I'm trying to think of like the other how are the sounds of like the music and stuff? Did you?
(0:57:27) Al: Yeah, I turned it on a little bit. The sound effects and stuff are fine. They are kind
(0:57:36) Al: of as whimsical as you would expect based on the graphics. The music's fun. It's a mix
(0:57:38) Codey: Mmhmm, mhmm, mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.
(0:57:42) Al: of different genres and stuff, and you can change the music if you're not happy with
(0:57:47) Al: what it is. It's kind of like a rolling playlist. I think you can unlock more tunes as you go
(0:57:48) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:57:50) Al: on and stuff like that, but yeah, it's fine.
(0:57:52) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:57:53) Codey: Cool
(0:57:54) Codey: I mean, it seems like a super smooth game and definitely from the gameplay but also from talking to you like i'm
(0:57:59) Codey: I'm dialed in even more
(0:58:02) Codey: Um, like i'm definitely I would love to play this and cover it for the one point
(0:58:06) Al: It is for sure. My real frustration with early access is when they go, "Right, we've built
(0:58:13) Al: all the features in our game. Here is a buggy game." You're like, "That's not what we
(0:58:18) Al: want." It's not to say that no game should ever have bugs. They're never going to be
(0:58:18) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:58:23) Al: able to figure out how to find every bug. Part of the point of early access is getting
(0:58:24) Codey: No, no and
(0:58:27) Al: more people onto it so you can find weird edge cases. But it's like sometimes people
(0:58:31) Al: just do early access because they can't be bothered testing it themselves. This is very
(0:58:37) Al: definitely not that. It's obviously limited in scope in terms of the features in the area
(0:58:41) Al: and blah blah blah blah. But I think that's the best way to do early access because it
(0:58:45) Al: feels like a fun game. The loop is good. The controls are good. It all feels nice. It's
(0:58:53) Al: like they've left me wanting more. It says, "I want more." Absolutely. That's my point.
(0:58:55) Codey: Mm-hmm, which is good. That's what you want. Yeah
(0:59:00) Codey: Yeah
(0:59:01) Al: I want more and more will come at some point. That's good.
(0:59:06) Al: There's been a few bugs that I've encountered but it's nothing big at all. It's little
(0:59:10) Codey: Okay. Arguably, I want bugs in my games. Are there bugs in this game other than the bees? There's a beehive.
(0:59:11) Al: silly things. I haven't encountered any. I haven't encountered any. Yes, you have beehives
(0:59:23) Al: but that's just your – you only see the bees as little dots flying around it when
(0:59:28) Al: there's honey on it. It's like the indicator that there's honey in them. I have not encountered
(0:59:32) Al: bugs. There are some animals, and there's birds that fly around.
(0:59:36) Al: I don't think that would fit in the vibe of the game. Everything's happening and there's stuff
(0:59:42) Codey: Lame, lame.
(0:59:45) Codey: Okay.
(0:59:46) Codey: It did also say.
(0:59:52) Al: moving and you're just sitting in the background creeping up on a bug with a net. It doesn't really
(0:59:56) Codey: No, I mean, there doesn't have to be, doesn't have to be bug net like netting and like catch collecting insects, which is having them in the game in general, like, as part of the world.
(0:59:57) Al: feel like the vibe.
(1:00:06) Al: I have not noticed if there's kind of like stuff around, but the world kind of feels natural. There are definitely animals there, but I don't know if any of them are bugs or not. I've not really been paying attention to that.
(1:00:20) Codey: it wouldn't feel natural if there's no insects. Last question that I have for you, what is your
(1:00:25) Codey: favorite animal to high five? Yeah, you can high five.
(1:00:28) Al: In the game? You can high-five animals? Oh, I know you can high-five the villagers and the guests. I did not realize...
(1:00:36) Al: you could high-five the animals. That does lead up my last complaint. It's really hard
(1:00:37) Codey: It says high five the animals, okay.
(1:00:41) Codey: That does not lead up my last.
(1:00:45) Al: to know who you're going to high-five. This actually matters because when you ask someone
(1:00:54) Al: to come and live there, they will give you a little challenge. One of them will be like,
(1:00:58) Al: "Have a book nook that you've built." That's an easy one. You build a book nook. Great. But there
(1:01:02) Al: There was one that was like high five me and I'm like, okay, cool. I'll high five you but
(1:01:06) Al: I did it and someone he had already turned around and started walking away and so someone
(1:01:11) Al: else came and high fived me instead and I'm like, okay, fine. But there's no way to focus
(1:01:16) Al: on and say, this is the person I want to high five, which just took me like six tries to
(1:01:22) Al: finally high five this person that asked me to high five him.
(1:01:25) Codey: Well, that's part of the challenge as he walks away and then the game like throws a bunch of NPCs at you.
(1:01:26) Al: He's like, I'll stay here if you can catch me.
(1:01:34) Codey: Yeah, exactly. High five me if you can!
(1:01:36) Al: Yeah. So I would like a way of kind of like aiming at who you want to high five.
(1:01:48) Codey: Okay, well, I would love to hear a follow-up of
(1:01:52) Codey: What animal is the best high-five listeners if you've played go-go town, let me know what animal is the best a high-five
(1:02:01) Codey: I'm very curious. Yep the end
(1:02:06) Al: All right, well, thank you, Cody, for joining me to talk about Google 10.
(1:02:11) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:02:12) Codey: Sad I didn't get to play it, but I will play it eventually for sure people can find me

(1:02:38) Al: episode comes out, I'll have done something other than something political because of
(1:02:42) Al: the election today. I feel like that's all it's going to be for 48 hours. Well, yeah.
(1:02:46) Codey: It's all it's going to be for me. Well, I don't post things about it usually, but that's all my
(1:02:53) Codey: brain is my panic. If you see me in a state of perpetual panic for the next like eight months,
(1:02:53) Al: Your timeline.
(1:03:00) Codey: that's why. Politics.
(1:03:01) Al: Well, look, at least the Supreme Court's done for the year, so they can't do any more damage
(1:03:09) Al: for a while. No, they're on holiday now. They don't care about that.
(1:03:10) Codey: They'll find a way.

(1:05:32) Al: Not explicitly, but I mean, that doesn't mean it's not on your other recording.
