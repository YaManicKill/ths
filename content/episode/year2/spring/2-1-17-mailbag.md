[00:30.040 --> 00:35.040]  Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season.
[00:35.040 --> 00:41.040]  My name is Cody. And I'm Kevin. And we're here today to talk about Cottagecore games.
[00:41.040 --> 00:46.040]  I'm gonna say whatever they want. And whatever you guys are asking us.
[00:46.060 --> 01:01.060]  We're finally after much time and demand and me pushing Al to do it. We're doing the mailbag episode.
[01:01.060 --> 01:09.060]  I've been really kind of wanting to get more emails and questions in because I think they're pretty fun on other podcasts I listen to.
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.080]  We have condensed all the ones we had into one episode for now.
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.080]  I don't know if we'll do this again or drip read them later like the one Johnny and I did a while back.
[01:18.080 --> 01:23.080]  But that's the plan for today along with your usual news and whatnot.
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.080]  As always we would like you to know that transcripts are available in the show notes and on the website harvestseason.club.
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.080]  So if you would like a copy of the transcripts that is where you can find them.
[01:34.100 --> 01:39.100]  Yeah there we go. So let's just dive right on in.
[01:39.100 --> 01:40.100]  Cody what have you been up to?
[01:40.100 --> 01:48.100]  I was going to say we're not going to dive in. Before our main topic we have news and before that I have been up to Hollow Knight.
[01:48.100 --> 01:55.100]  I have beaten. Beat? Beaten? Is beaten a word? Like is that an accurate?
[01:55.100 --> 01:57.100]  Beaten yes beaten.
[01:57.100 --> 01:59.100]  Is it like an accurate use of that word? I don't even know.
[01:59.100 --> 02:01.100]  I'm gonna guess yes.
[02:01.120 --> 02:03.120]  That's an answer.
[02:03.120 --> 02:12.120]  There's like three bosses that you're supposed to defeat and then you can defeat like then you can basically beat the game.
[02:12.120 --> 02:22.120]  I've done the three so I just need to like go do the last boss and I am putting it off because yeah I don't know.
[02:22.120 --> 02:28.120]  I just want to do the I'm the kind of person where I'm like I want to do everything and then beat the game.
[02:28.120 --> 02:30.120]  There is a lot to do in Hollow Knight.
[02:30.140 --> 02:32.140]  There really is.
[02:32.140 --> 02:43.140]  Also if I beat the other part of the game like if I beat that boss then it'll give me a percentage like on the loading screen so then I can see how much left I still have.
[02:43.140 --> 02:48.140]  I probably have only I've put like over a hundred and some odd hours into that game.
[02:48.140 --> 02:50.140]  So what maybe 50% there?
[02:50.140 --> 02:52.140]  Yeah exactly.
[02:52.160 --> 02:56.160]  I was not even joking I was about to say I think I'm about 50%.
[02:56.160 --> 03:01.160]  I think like I'm pretty sure there are whole areas that I haven't discovered yet.
[03:01.160 --> 03:07.160]  That's correct right like the real kicker is the DLC is just in there right there's no DLC menu no DLC area.
[03:07.160 --> 03:08.160]  Correct.
[03:08.160 --> 03:11.160]  So you go above 100% that's the real killer right there.
[03:11.160 --> 03:13.160]  You go up to 112.
[03:13.160 --> 03:21.160]  So yeah I don't and I'm actually I've already encountered some of the DLC areas so that's crazy.
[03:21.180 --> 03:27.180]  But yeah so I've been playing that and then with my partner I've been playing Overcooked 2.
[03:27.180 --> 03:38.180]  They are on like the fifth area the fifth direction I guess I don't know so we're doing that and I'm really enjoying that.
[03:38.180 --> 03:49.180]  I think he is enjoying it a little less than I am like I could play it for like eight hours straight like many hours straight and after like an hour or two he's like okay I'm done.
[03:49.200 --> 03:56.200]  I think it hurts his eyes because like my TV is so far away from oh but but still like that game is just amazing yeah.
[03:56.200 --> 04:03.200]  I haven't touched in a minute I know there's all you can eat edition like I assume they've just been putting more and more in that I need to get in check that out.
[04:03.200 --> 04:05.200]  That sounds amazing like it just keeps going.
[04:05.200 --> 04:15.200]  Yeah so the initial thing from what I remember is that they were basically putting both games together in the all you can eat edition I think they called it right.
[04:15.220 --> 04:25.220]  And it was like all the Overcooked 1 in the new engine so like everything's revamped wow and it's nice and I'm pretty sure like their goal was like okay this is going to be our platform or whatever.
[04:25.220 --> 04:33.220]  Now we're just going to keep adding levels and stuff here yeah so because I mean yeah that's the kind of game where you can just just give me more forever right.
[04:33.220 --> 04:42.220]  Yeah instead of this like 10 minutes or like six minutes or whatever to beat and to try and get a certain score just like keep her going you know.
[04:42.240 --> 04:44.240]  Yep yep yep yep yep.
[04:44.240 --> 04:47.240]  Yeah other than that I've just been doing research so.
[04:47.240 --> 04:52.240]  Yeah what have you been researching what have you discovered?
[04:52.240 --> 05:10.240]  So I'm trying to finish a project from last year so in my research like in some type of ecology like so mine is entomology but if you're looking at ecology of anything usually you have a season where your study species is active and then you're collecting them,
[05:10.260 --> 05:22.260]  surveying them, doing all of that and then when they're no longer active that is when you will kind of like identify and run your analyses and then after that that's when you'll write.
[05:22.260 --> 05:34.260]  So I'm in the writing season now but I actually like I have new fieldwork to start up here in a couple weeks and so it's like I'm like really trying to get the old stuff done because.
[05:34.280 --> 05:35.280]  Sure.
[05:35.280 --> 05:47.280]  I mean they can overlap it's not a huge deal but it just basically pushes my ability to do the new stuff like later into the year and then everything kind of gets behind excuse me.
[05:47.280 --> 06:03.280]  So yeah this year I'm looking at insect communities in the canopy versus the understory and then on edge versus forest interior habitats so like think of like a meadow habitat versus like in the middle of a forest.
[06:03.300 --> 06:06.300]  And trying to see like how how that changes so.
[06:06.300 --> 06:07.300]  Okay.
[06:07.300 --> 06:08.300]  Throughout the year.
[06:08.300 --> 06:09.300]  Okay that's neat.
[06:09.300 --> 06:12.300]  Also very in line with the Hollow Knight stuff.
[06:12.300 --> 06:13.300]  Yeah true.
[06:13.300 --> 06:17.300]  What about you Kev what are you doing up to?
[06:17.300 --> 06:24.300]  I have been up to so I talked about it last week on my mad solo episode.
[06:24.320 --> 06:33.320]  I made the unfortunate mistake of seeing there was a let's build a zoo update and some of that game has its meaty hooks back into me.
[06:33.320 --> 06:40.320]  That's that's just one of those games where you can just pick up and just go for it until you burn out go with it until you burn out.
[06:40.320 --> 06:45.320]  And yeah so that that's the primary gaming stuff and just usual.
[06:45.320 --> 06:47.320]  Yeah are you still playing marble snap?
[06:47.320 --> 06:48.320]  I am.
[06:48.340 --> 06:49.340]  I am.
[06:49.340 --> 06:56.340]  That game is in a good place right now they've they've made a lot of updates recently and it's good and fresh and I'm enjoying it.
[06:56.340 --> 07:01.340]  Yeah I'm what I do want to talk about though because that's all same old same old.
[07:01.340 --> 07:04.340]  I watched a good number of movies actually in the past week.
[07:04.340 --> 07:05.340]  Okay.
[07:05.340 --> 07:12.340]  So last weekend I don't know why or how but my siblings and I we just said you know what we're just going to marathon every Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
[07:12.340 --> 07:14.340]  Those are good movies yep yep.
[07:14.360 --> 07:31.360]  So okay like the first one is a timeless classic like it still holds up like dang that that movie is a master like just a master class in set design and costume design everyone looks so good.
[07:31.360 --> 07:35.360]  The second one well have you seen them all Cody before?
[07:35.360 --> 07:36.360]  Yes yes I have.
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.360]  Okay you have okay I had only seen the first three until last weekend.
[07:40.380 --> 07:46.380]  So second one well I mean second third one I think everyone knows like it goes off the rails it gets crazy.
[07:46.380 --> 07:49.380]  The one thing I will say that CGI still holds up really well.
[07:49.380 --> 07:54.380]  Davy Jones looks really really good considering it was like early 2000s.
[07:54.380 --> 07:55.380]  I didn't realize it was CG.
[07:55.380 --> 07:57.380]  Oh Davy Jones sorry.
[07:57.380 --> 07:58.380]  Yes.
[07:58.380 --> 08:04.380]  You said Davy Jones my brain thought Johnny Depp and I was like I was like that wasn't that's his face.
[08:04.380 --> 08:08.380]  Johnny Depp's CGI in real life too.
[08:08.380 --> 08:09.380]  Poor dude.
[08:09.400 --> 08:16.400]  Yeah but yeah no Davy Jones that was so so good such a good story too.
[08:16.400 --> 08:26.400]  I liked it like the second one was good and the third one just went place like I don't know I'm meh on the third one.
[08:26.400 --> 08:32.400]  But I mean I think most people have seen the first three at least because that was you know whole trilogy and they link together.
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.400]  What I will talk about though is the fourth and fifth ones like I said I'd never seen them before.
[08:36.420 --> 08:41.420]  The fourth one man I really liked that one I liked it better than the third now.
[08:41.420 --> 08:44.420]  Maybe on par with the second I don't know if it's as good as the first.
[08:44.420 --> 08:50.420]  It feels like they went back to their roots of just pirate adventures.
[08:50.420 --> 08:59.420]  And more importantly it has Penelope Cruz and she's absolutely incredible in everything I've ever seen with her in it.
[08:59.420 --> 09:02.420]  And has Ian McShane what's his name Blackbeard.
[09:02.440 --> 09:06.440]  Oh I don't know his name but I know who you're talking about.
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.440]  Yeah Ian McShane that's what it is.
[09:08.440 --> 09:14.440]  Yeah he's a fantastic actor he's in the John Wick movie I've seen that he's great in that too.
[09:14.440 --> 09:17.440]  And he did great as Blackbeard.
[09:17.440 --> 09:21.440]  Yeah man that fourth movie was just so good.
[09:21.440 --> 09:25.440]  There's Penelope Cruz's in it that's all I need.
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.440]  And then the fifth one oh man okay what are your thoughts on the fifth one.
[09:31.460 --> 09:39.460]  I think I need to look at the okay fifth that's Dead Men Tell No Tales yeah that's the one.
[09:39.460 --> 09:47.460]  Oh this is the one that has that guy Javier Bardem as yeah gosh what who was he in that.
[09:47.460 --> 09:51.460]  He was the villain he was Captain Salazar he was a ghost pilot.
[09:51.480 --> 09:53.480]  Yeah.
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.480]  Oh and it has Will's child.
[09:57.480 --> 09:59.480]  Yeah.
[09:59.480 --> 10:05.480]  You know I mean I think it should the fact that I forgot about this.
[10:05.480 --> 10:07.480]  There you go.
[10:07.480 --> 10:09.480]  Should tell you.
[10:09.480 --> 10:11.480]  About how I feel.
[10:13.480 --> 10:17.480]  That one was a bit of a disaster in my opinion.
[10:17.480 --> 10:19.480]  Yeah.
[10:19.500 --> 10:28.500]  It felt like they tried to redo the first one because they have the kids or the kid of Will and Elizabeth right.
[10:28.500 --> 10:34.500]  And then there's this other new girl that's in there and they're just trying to redo it it feels like.
[10:34.500 --> 10:38.500]  But it's the chemistry is just not there.
[10:40.500 --> 10:45.500]  This felt like the most phoning it in Johnny Depp did as Captain Jack Sparrow.
[10:45.520 --> 10:53.520]  Also I think they just focused on him less which I don't know if was for better or worse I don't know just all over the place.
[10:53.520 --> 10:59.520]  Best part was gosh was named Geoffrey Rush Barbossa because he's fantastic in all the movies.
[10:59.520 --> 11:11.520]  So he was cool but that that was kind of it every new thing after watching all five movies the key takeaway is the more that movie is about actually like pirates and stuff.
[11:11.540 --> 11:17.540]  That's cool the more it's about weird sea magic that's that's not as good.
[11:17.540 --> 11:21.540]  So they should just keep to more pirate stories and whatnot.
[11:21.540 --> 11:25.540]  Javier Bardem was cool as Captain Salazar.
[11:25.540 --> 11:27.540]  He has a beautiful name.
[11:27.540 --> 11:29.540]  I love his accent.
[11:29.540 --> 11:31.540]  His.
[11:31.540 --> 11:33.540]  The villains were okay written.
[11:33.560 --> 11:41.560]  The part that got me the part that knew would define the movie for me were the zombie sharks.
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.560]  Jumping the zombie sharks oh my goodness.
[11:46.560 --> 11:56.560]  I just remember he like I'm trying I'm looking I'm googling him because like the pictures of Salazar because I loved like his cracked face.
[11:56.560 --> 11:58.560]  Yeah it was a good design.
[11:58.560 --> 12:01.560]  I do remember really enjoying that.
[12:01.580 --> 12:09.580]  Yeah no he he was good right but like I think the whole thing the plot was just kind of weird but I think the character was cool.
[12:09.580 --> 12:14.580]  Yeah like I said zombie sharks is more than over the top.
[12:14.580 --> 12:22.580]  Yeah but yeah so there were some high points in that movie but overall fourth one was really good though.
[12:22.580 --> 12:24.580]  You have Barbossa.
[12:24.600 --> 12:31.600]  I didn't like I guess like the I the story of the mermaid and the fourth one made me really sad.
[12:31.600 --> 12:41.600]  Yeah yeah the mermaid was yeah it wasn't I mean like yeah now I get you but I you're supposed to feel that I think right question mark.
[12:41.600 --> 12:45.600]  So yeah I don't know I liked it it was good enough.
[12:45.600 --> 12:53.600]  It was a little over the top in places too but overall yeah so there you go there's my crash course in the five Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
[12:53.620 --> 12:55.620]  No I've seen them all.
[12:55.620 --> 13:01.620]  And one other movie that I just watched just yesterday no Friday whatever two days ago.
[13:01.620 --> 13:03.620]  Suzume have you heard of this?
[13:03.620 --> 13:04.620]  I have not.
[13:04.620 --> 13:07.620]  Okay have you heard of your name or weathering with you?
[13:07.620 --> 13:08.620]  Nope.
[13:08.620 --> 13:10.620]  Okay oh boy.
[13:10.620 --> 13:14.620]  Some customers are not customers some listeners are screaming right now.
[13:14.620 --> 13:20.620]  Maybe internally well I don't blame you because they're anime films let's be clear right.
[13:20.620 --> 13:22.620]  I mean I like anime.
[13:22.640 --> 13:32.640]  Yeah sure sure sure but I'm just saying they're not it's a little more niche it doesn't get the big you know up front marketing that a bunch of other films get right.
[13:32.640 --> 13:36.640]  So that I get it why you might have missed you might have missed them.
[13:36.640 --> 13:38.640]  The name of this director.
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.640]  No worries.
[13:39.640 --> 13:51.640]  Okay Makoto Shinkai is he's the director and he this is his third movie they're not a trilogy and like their plots are related but they're a set if you will right.
[13:51.660 --> 13:57.660]  Like you can you know you know what I'm talking about right like three movies they go together even though they're not sequels or anything.
[13:57.660 --> 14:17.660]  And so I haven't seen your name to be fair so you know people will blast me for that but weathering with you is about a magical girl who can control the weather but it like costs her she only has a limited amount of time to live or something like that because of this ability.
[14:17.680 --> 14:29.680]  They're all kind of like disaster-esque movies but they're also kind of magical they're really well done this movie Suzume which just released recently.
[14:29.680 --> 14:45.680]  So this one's interesting because there's doors around Japan and these giant magical worms like I'm talking like colossal giant sky sized worms and when they crash they come out of the doors and they land on the ground and earthquake happens in Japan.
[14:45.700 --> 14:53.700]  Nobody can see the worms but except for a hint like two people in the story and they have to go around find these doors and close them.
[14:53.700 --> 15:01.700]  And so yeah so that's the plot of the story but also one of the guys gets turned into a chair.
[15:01.700 --> 15:06.700]  It's really goofy but cute he's like a little toddler's chair.
[15:06.700 --> 15:11.700]  Oh I was gonna say you gotta describe what kind of chair because there's a lot of different kinds of chair.
[15:11.720 --> 15:20.720]  It actually belongs so the lead Suzume that's her name that's the protagonist's name she has this childhood chair as a memento from her mom.
[15:20.720 --> 15:31.720]  And because of magical hijinks the other dude who's the deuteragonist gets his body transformed into this chair but he can walk around and talk and stuff.
[15:31.740 --> 15:51.740]  Yeah like these movies are Ghibli-esque they're not as maybe so Ghibli is almost a little bit more Disney-like these are a little less Disney-like but it has that same niche of wonder and whimsy right.
[15:51.740 --> 16:00.740]  But they also hit I think a more emotional tone especially towards the end towards the latter end of the movies there's some deep stuff in there.
[16:00.760 --> 16:09.760]  But anyways I'm trying to dance around you know too many details because spoilers and whatnot but I really recommend people watch them they're really good.
[16:09.760 --> 16:10.760]  What are they on?
[16:10.760 --> 16:14.760]  Well that's a good question Suzume is in theaters I know that.
[16:14.760 --> 16:15.760]  Oh okay.
[16:15.760 --> 16:21.760]  I don't know if it's already let's see your name like yeah you can find them all you can just find out YouTube, Apple TV, Google Play.
[16:21.780 --> 16:28.780]  If you watch that with some friends yeah same thing like that you can just Google HBO Max there you go that's right.
[16:28.780 --> 16:30.780]  Yep I have that.
[16:30.780 --> 16:40.780]  There's different places though but yeah I just highly recommend them if you like Ghibli films you'll probably like these because they're anime films and the animation is just as quality and beautiful.
[16:40.800 --> 16:51.800]  And there's of course the whole sub versus dub debate I've watched I can't remember Suzume watched dub I can't remember if I watched weathering with you dub or sub.
[16:51.800 --> 16:54.800]  I mean I'm partial to both I don't have any preference.
[16:54.800 --> 17:08.800]  Yeah I my only thing so my only thing with subbed is that I like with my ADHD if I am just watching something like if I'm just sitting and watching something my ADHD is going wild.
[17:08.820 --> 17:18.820]  So I like to if I'm watching something I love to like knit or crochet or like be doing something with my hands at the same time and I can't do that when it's subbed.
[17:18.820 --> 17:19.820]  Sure.
[17:19.820 --> 17:22.820]  So I generally like the dub person.
[17:22.820 --> 17:26.820]  Okay well they you're in luck because the dub was excellent in my opinion.
[17:26.820 --> 17:27.820]  Sweet.
[17:27.820 --> 17:28.820]  Yep so.
[17:28.820 --> 17:29.820]  Cool.
[17:29.820 --> 17:30.820]  There you go.
[17:30.820 --> 17:31.820]  Okay.
[17:31.820 --> 17:32.820]  Yeah.
[17:32.820 --> 17:33.820]  Well let's move on to the news.
[17:33.820 --> 17:35.820]  Yes that's enough from our weeks.
[17:35.840 --> 17:40.840]  So first bit of news Kev you're so excited.
[17:40.840 --> 17:42.840]  Yes I am.
[17:42.840 --> 17:45.840]  Maneka we have a date.
[17:45.840 --> 17:47.840]  Finally.
[17:47.840 --> 18:04.840]  Yeah so part of the indie world that just happened they released they announced the release date of Maneka's Night Market and they also released like a little cute little trailer that you can watch that kind of explains the lore of the area.
[18:04.860 --> 18:15.860]  And what's going on in this area and kind of I don't know shows a little bit of other of other cute things and you getting ready for the night market.
[18:15.860 --> 18:20.860]  So but this is your baby so tell me how do you feel?
[18:20.860 --> 18:27.860]  For people who may not know this was on my most anticipated game for the next year two years running.
[18:27.860 --> 18:28.860]  Yeah.
[18:28.860 --> 18:31.860]  Oh it's been such a long time.
[18:31.880 --> 18:43.880]  I mean what what is there to say about Maneka like oh it's you're farming but you're going to be selling things at a magical night market the farming is also magical you farm cats.
[18:43.880 --> 18:45.880]  You ride cats?
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.880]  Yes the art is just gorgeous that's really what sells me about it.
[18:49.880 --> 18:52.880]  I just can't wait for this game.
[18:52.880 --> 18:54.880]  There's a big cat I don't.
[18:54.880 --> 18:56.880]  They don't care.
[18:56.880 --> 18:58.880]  They don't care.
[18:58.900 --> 19:09.900]  Yeah so it showed the new trailer showed you riding cats like in like a race and they run so cute it's it's just pure it's wholesome as heck.
[19:09.900 --> 19:23.900]  It also showed you like cutting gosh what was it like a tulip like you were like cutting up a plant up to get ready for the market like I think I'm assuming you like make a bouquet out of that.
[19:23.920 --> 19:47.920]  And then it also showed you like stitching something which had me my me and my craftiness I was like oh um because that was cool like sewing something I guess it's not stitching something but um yeah cute little gameplay trailer um gameplay slash lore trailer so and now look at the trailer see that's what five months away.
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.920]  156 days as of this recording.
[19:51.940 --> 19:56.940]  Well every episode now you have to say how many days there are.
[19:56.940 --> 19:58.940]  Oh absolutely.
[19:58.940 --> 20:00.940]  Mineko watch is now a thing.
[20:00.940 --> 20:02.940]  Hashtag Mineko watch.
[20:02.940 --> 20:04.940]  Oh my goodness.
[20:04.940 --> 20:06.940]  Why are the FBI agents chasing her?
[20:06.940 --> 20:08.940]  Why is Mineko dressed like a cat in one scene?
[20:08.940 --> 20:10.940]  I don't know.
[20:10.940 --> 20:12.940]  I just want to find out when I play.
[20:12.940 --> 20:14.940]  You're gonna find out.
[20:14.940 --> 20:16.940]  There's a day now.
[20:16.940 --> 20:18.940]  There's a date.
[20:18.940 --> 20:20.940]  Man those cat races look real good.
[20:20.960 --> 20:25.960]  Alright that's all that matters from this episode to me.
[20:25.960 --> 20:41.960]  No I mean the next time or the next thing on here is in the news is My Time at Sandrock also has a little bit of a new trailer so again this is by the same people who did My Time at Portia.
[20:41.960 --> 20:43.960]  I see yes.
[20:43.980 --> 20:51.980]  Sandrock is a desert town and you turn a rundown workshop into a well-oiled facility is what you're doing.
[20:51.980 --> 21:11.980]  So if you enjoyed My Time at Portia which I know some listeners did then this new game My Time at Sandrock is coming to Switch quote unquote summer 2023 so sometime in the next few months or I guess it could be like six months because they could push it to like the end of summer.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  Even summer is loose.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  How has it summer in quotation marks?
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  Yeah in quotation marks.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  And that is the correct attitude.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  Yeah.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  I didn't play My Time at Portia.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  Yeah I didn't either.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  And I'm pretty meh about it.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  So yeah that's a thing.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  There's a lot going on.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  Look at the trailer.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  There's a first person shooter portion of this trailer.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Yeah.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  That's a lot going on.
[21:40.020 --> 21:42.020]  Speaking of a lot going on, ooblets.
[21:42.020 --> 21:44.020]  There is a lot going on with that one.
[21:44.020 --> 21:46.020]  There is.
[21:46.020 --> 21:48.020]  And there's a new spring event.
[21:48.020 --> 21:50.020]  And so there's a spring update that's just happening now.
[21:50.020 --> 21:52.020]  In that update there is a minimum time ooblet.
[21:52.020 --> 21:54.020]  Sorry limited time.
[21:54.020 --> 21:56.020]  So like it's only available for a certain amount of time.
[21:56.020 --> 21:58.020]  Yeah.
[21:58.020 --> 22:00.020]  A bunny I think.
[22:00.040 --> 22:02.040]  Yeah I'm not sure which one it is.
[22:02.040 --> 22:04.040]  But yeah.
[22:04.040 --> 22:06.040]  There's one that's limited.
[22:06.040 --> 22:08.040]  There's another new one that you can get that's not that one.
[22:08.040 --> 22:10.040]  There's these Glimmy...
[22:10.040 --> 22:12.040]  Glimmy Globes.
[22:12.040 --> 22:14.040]  Which look like little snow globes to me.
[22:14.040 --> 22:16.040]  Yeah they do.
[22:16.040 --> 22:18.040]  That's cute.
[22:18.040 --> 22:20.040]  They're like little snow globes.
[22:20.040 --> 22:22.040]  Yeah they do.
[22:22.040 --> 22:24.040]  That's cute.
[22:24.040 --> 22:26.040]  They're like little snow globes.
[22:26.040 --> 22:28.040]  They're like little snow globes.
[22:28.060 --> 22:30.060]  They're like a little ship in a bottle.
[22:30.060 --> 22:32.060]  That you can design.
[22:32.060 --> 22:34.060]  And make.
[22:34.060 --> 22:36.060]  And those are really cute.
[22:36.060 --> 22:38.060]  I know that there were some people
[22:38.060 --> 22:40.060]  I'm trying to go into.
[22:40.060 --> 22:42.060]  There was recently some ooblets talk in Slack.
[22:42.060 --> 22:44.060]  Cat.
[22:44.060 --> 22:46.060]  Cat in Slack.
[22:46.060 --> 22:48.060]  Shout out to Cat.
[22:48.060 --> 22:50.060]  Said that...
[22:50.060 --> 22:52.060]  It's one of our favorites.
[22:52.060 --> 22:54.060]  True, true, true.
[22:54.060 --> 22:56.060]  That they are playing
[22:56.080 --> 22:58.080]  ooblets right now.
[22:58.080 --> 23:00.080]  And they said
[23:00.080 --> 23:02.080]  quote I really didn't think I'd like it
[23:02.080 --> 23:04.080]  but I'm glad I gave it a try.
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.080]  Oddly enough this
[23:06.080 --> 23:08.080]  trailer is I think the most
[23:08.080 --> 23:10.080]  the one that's intrigued me the most.
[23:10.080 --> 23:12.080]  I don't know why.
[23:12.080 --> 23:14.080]  Something about the little bottles.
[23:14.080 --> 23:16.080]  Something about it's real cute.
[23:16.080 --> 23:18.080]  That looked really cute to me too.
[23:18.080 --> 23:20.080]  We're getting
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.080]  that bunny tater flop it's called.
[23:22.080 --> 23:24.080]  Yeah tater flop seed.
[23:24.100 --> 23:26.100]  Tater flop.
[23:26.100 --> 23:28.100]  Oh that'd be so good if it was.
[23:28.100 --> 23:30.100]  So yeah.
[23:30.100 --> 23:32.100]  If you are into ooblets or if you want to try it out
[23:32.100 --> 23:34.100]  now's a good time not only from our mouth
[23:34.100 --> 23:36.100]  but from our listeners mouth as well.
[23:36.100 --> 23:38.100]  Yeah.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.100]  It's until
[23:40.100 --> 23:42.100]  the spring event is going until the end of
[23:42.100 --> 23:44.100]  May 31st.
[23:44.100 --> 23:46.100]  Oh my goodness.
[23:46.100 --> 23:48.100]  There are 459 variations
[23:48.100 --> 23:50.100]  of Glimmy Globes so you probably
[23:50.100 --> 23:52.100]  shouldn't try to craft them all.
[23:52.120 --> 23:54.120]  Ublipses.
[23:54.120 --> 23:56.120]  Unless.
[23:56.120 --> 23:58.120]  Challenge accepted.
[23:58.120 --> 24:00.120]  Yeah there you go.
[24:00.120 --> 24:02.120]  Ooblets for you ooblets people.
[24:02.120 --> 24:04.120]  Sun Haven.
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.120]  Update 101
[24:10.120 --> 24:12.120]  and in here
[24:12.120 --> 24:14.120]  I don't know if you wrote this
[24:14.120 --> 24:16.120]  or if Al wrote this.
[24:16.120 --> 24:18.120]  No that was Al.
[24:18.120 --> 24:20.120]  I thought it was you who wrote it.
[24:20.140 --> 24:22.140]  There's a parenthetical here
[24:22.140 --> 24:24.140]  something in parenthesis that says
[24:24.140 --> 24:26.140]  quote good thing Al isn't on this episode
[24:26.140 --> 24:28.140]  to complain about the use of the word
[24:28.140 --> 24:30.140]  patch here.
[24:30.140 --> 24:32.140]  So Al wrote update 101
[24:32.140 --> 24:34.140]  but they call it patch 101.
[24:34.140 --> 24:36.140]  Um.
[24:36.140 --> 24:38.140]  I think it's because
[24:38.140 --> 24:40.140]  a patch is like a bug fixer
[24:40.140 --> 24:42.140]  it's not. They're different.
[24:42.140 --> 24:44.140]  I don't know.
[24:44.140 --> 24:46.140]  I don't know if I've ever heard his rant
[24:46.140 --> 24:48.140]  about update versus patch.
[24:48.160 --> 24:50.160]  Somewhere out in Scotland
[24:50.160 --> 24:52.160]  Al just
[24:52.160 --> 24:54.160]  just felt his eyebrow twitch for some reason
[24:54.160 --> 24:56.160]  he's not sure why.
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.160]  He should do a mini episode. Al you should do like
[24:58.160 --> 25:00.160]  a greenhouse mini episode that's like
[25:00.160 --> 25:02.160]  a rants with Al version.
[25:02.160 --> 25:04.160]  It's gonna be inserted right here.
[25:04.160 --> 25:06.160]  No no I want it to be its own content.
[25:06.160 --> 25:08.160]  Of update versus patch.
[25:08.160 --> 25:10.160]  So Sun Haven
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.160]  this update
[25:12.160 --> 25:14.160]  101.1
[25:14.160 --> 25:16.160]  has some new story elements
[25:16.180 --> 25:18.180]  to it. It has some added character
[25:18.180 --> 25:20.180]  customization like you can now become
[25:20.180 --> 25:22.180]  a couple different
[25:22.180 --> 25:24.180]  like not well I guess it's racist
[25:24.180 --> 25:26.180]  like a naga or like a
[25:26.180 --> 25:28.180]  dragon person or something like that.
[25:28.180 --> 25:30.180]  There's also more translation so it's
[25:30.180 --> 25:32.180]  available in more languages
[25:32.180 --> 25:34.180]  which is great and
[25:34.180 --> 25:36.180]  there's improved controller support. So they
[25:36.180 --> 25:38.180]  have had controller support but
[25:38.180 --> 25:40.180]  apparently there were some
[25:40.180 --> 25:42.180]  there was some
[25:42.180 --> 25:44.180]  feedback that they received that it wasn't
[25:44.200 --> 25:46.200]  as good as it could be and so they've
[25:46.200 --> 25:48.200]  improved it. So all of that
[25:48.200 --> 25:50.200]  has happened in this. Which I guess
[25:50.200 --> 25:52.200]  like for them to call it a
[25:52.200 --> 25:54.200]  like maybe it is a patch. No
[25:54.200 --> 25:56.200]  but there's a new story
[25:56.200 --> 25:58.200]  which isn't a patch that's an update.
[25:58.200 --> 26:00.200]  Al I need a mini episode
[26:00.200 --> 26:02.200]  about this.
[26:02.200 --> 26:04.200]  Because like the
[26:04.200 --> 26:06.200]  improved controller support and like more languages
[26:06.200 --> 26:08.200]  like to me that's a patch.
[26:08.200 --> 26:10.200]  But when you're adding new content
[26:10.200 --> 26:12.200]  like the new story and character
[26:12.220 --> 26:14.220]  customization like that is an update.
[26:14.220 --> 26:16.220]  So anyway
[26:16.220 --> 26:18.220]  it is currently out now
[26:18.220 --> 26:20.220]  and it is on sale just for
[26:20.220 --> 26:22.220]  $20 I think it's like 20% off or something
[26:22.220 --> 26:24.220]  it's not only like $25.
[26:24.220 --> 26:26.220]  I believe yeah well no
[26:26.220 --> 26:28.220]  because it's out it's 1.1 now.
[26:28.220 --> 26:30.220]  No wait the
[26:30.220 --> 26:32.220]  oh yes yes yes yes
[26:32.220 --> 26:34.220]  the patch was
[26:34.220 --> 26:36.220]  in the beta and now it is out yes.
[26:36.220 --> 26:38.220]  The update was
[26:38.220 --> 26:40.220]  yes everything is out
[26:40.240 --> 26:42.240]  it is nothing is in beta anymore.
[26:42.240 --> 26:44.240]  End of the bottom line okay.
[26:44.240 --> 26:46.240]  I have a question
[26:46.240 --> 26:48.240]  for you Cody. Oh yeah go for it.
[26:48.240 --> 26:50.240]  Would you call 1.6 Stardew
[26:50.240 --> 26:52.240]  a patch or an update?
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.240]  So it's funny because thinking about
[26:56.240 --> 26:58.240]  oh okay
[26:58.240 --> 27:00.240]  I was going to say thinking about what I
[27:00.240 --> 27:02.240]  think the difference between a patch and an update is
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.240]  like I think an update has to have
[27:04.240 --> 27:06.240]  like more content and
[27:06.240 --> 27:08.240]  it sounds like the changes
[27:08.260 --> 27:10.260]  in the 1.6 update
[27:10.260 --> 27:12.260]  is like
[27:12.260 --> 27:14.260]  modding changes but
[27:14.260 --> 27:16.260]  ConcernedApe does say that there is
[27:16.260 --> 27:18.260]  also content
[27:18.260 --> 27:20.260]  so it looks like there
[27:20.260 --> 27:22.260]  is more dialogue coming
[27:22.260 --> 27:24.260]  for different characters
[27:24.260 --> 27:26.260]  so I don't
[27:26.260 --> 27:28.260]  know if it's like that
[27:28.260 --> 27:30.260]  the dialogue has changed or maybe
[27:30.260 --> 27:32.260]  it's just updated in certain parts of the game
[27:32.260 --> 27:34.260]  or it's just
[27:34.260 --> 27:36.260]  like a completely new cutscene or something
[27:36.280 --> 27:38.280]  we don't have a ton of information
[27:38.280 --> 27:40.280]  ConcernedApe is a man of myth
[27:40.280 --> 27:42.280]  I'm just looking through
[27:42.280 --> 27:44.280]  the twitter thread
[27:44.280 --> 27:46.280]  and the
[27:46.280 --> 27:48.280]  first comment is
[27:48.280 --> 27:50.280]  I crave new info about HauntedChocolatier
[27:50.280 --> 27:52.280]  anything you can tell us?
[27:52.280 --> 27:54.280]  and ConcernedApe's response is
[27:54.280 --> 27:56.280]  that the town is on the water and there are
[27:56.280 --> 27:58.280]  oh dogs I thought it said rocks
[27:58.280 --> 28:00.280]  okay never mind
[28:00.280 --> 28:02.280]  but still
[28:02.280 --> 28:04.280]  yeah not as bad as Stardew
[28:04.300 --> 28:06.300]  I know most people prefer
[28:06.300 --> 28:08.300]  HauntedChocolatier but
[28:08.300 --> 28:10.300]  that means Stardew isn't dead
[28:10.300 --> 28:12.300]  that's interesting
[28:12.300 --> 28:14.300]  it's not gonna ever die
[28:14.300 --> 28:16.300]  I mean
[28:16.300 --> 28:18.300]  really you think he's gonna
[28:18.300 --> 28:20.300]  I mean from his side right
[28:20.300 --> 28:22.300]  I know people will play it forever and ever
[28:22.300 --> 28:24.300]  but do you think he's gonna keep updating it
[28:24.300 --> 28:26.300]  forever and ever and ever?
[28:26.300 --> 28:28.300]  I don't know why not
[28:28.300 --> 28:30.300]  wow I
[28:30.300 --> 28:32.300]  was googling ConcernedApe
[28:32.320 --> 28:34.320]  because I realize that we always say he
[28:34.320 --> 28:36.320]  but I've actually never seen their pronouns
[28:36.320 --> 28:38.320]  anywhere
[28:38.320 --> 28:40.320]  it is a guy
[28:40.320 --> 28:42.320]  and his name is Eric Barone
[28:42.320 --> 28:44.320]  I didn't know that there was actually a name
[28:44.320 --> 28:46.320]  associated with this human
[28:46.320 --> 28:48.320]  that we know of
[28:48.320 --> 28:50.320]  no I'm sure
[28:50.320 --> 28:52.320]  there is but
[28:52.320 --> 28:54.320]  I didn't know if it was a secret
[28:54.320 --> 28:56.320]  so the next here we have a couple games
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.320]  that are new
[28:58.320 --> 29:00.320]  so first is GoGo Town
[29:00.340 --> 29:02.340]  the Steam
[29:02.340 --> 29:04.340]  blurb is
[29:04.340 --> 29:06.340]  quote plan build
[29:06.340 --> 29:08.340]  prosper?
[29:08.340 --> 29:10.340]  it literally has a question mark
[29:10.340 --> 29:12.340]  as mayor
[29:12.340 --> 29:14.340]  it is up to you to breathe life
[29:14.340 --> 29:16.340]  back into this run downtown
[29:16.340 --> 29:18.340]  construct shops
[29:18.340 --> 29:20.340]  hire staff, automate deliveries with
[29:20.340 --> 29:22.340]  couriers and attract tourists to
[29:22.340 --> 29:24.340]  town all while managing infrastructure
[29:24.340 --> 29:26.340]  and avoiding catastrophes
[29:26.340 --> 29:28.340]  who said being mayor was going
[29:28.360 --> 29:30.360]  to be easy
[29:30.360 --> 29:32.360]  um
[29:32.360 --> 29:34.360]  I'm trying to remember what the
[29:34.360 --> 29:36.360]  the graphics are
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.360]  kind of animal crossing-ish
[29:38.360 --> 29:40.360]  they are, that's a good comparison point
[29:40.360 --> 29:42.360]  but there's something a little more
[29:42.360 --> 29:44.360]  I don't
[29:44.360 --> 29:46.360]  cartoony almost
[29:46.360 --> 29:48.360]  yes it has to be cartoony
[29:48.360 --> 29:50.360]  because there are aliens and monkeys
[29:50.360 --> 29:52.360]  yeah
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.360]  I was going to say that
[29:54.360 --> 29:56.360]  I actually like the art style
[29:56.380 --> 29:58.380]  I like
[29:58.380 --> 30:00.380]  the look of the game like you're building up a town
[30:00.380 --> 30:02.380]  this is all appealing
[30:02.380 --> 30:04.380]  and the fact that we got aliens landing
[30:04.380 --> 30:06.380]  and monkeys running around town
[30:06.380 --> 30:08.380]  I'm intrigued now
[30:08.380 --> 30:10.380]  this GoGo Town has caught my attention
[30:10.380 --> 30:12.380]  um
[30:12.380 --> 30:14.380]  no it's to be announced
[30:14.380 --> 30:16.380]  um I didn't see the mummies
[30:16.380 --> 30:18.380]  it's at the very end of the trailer
[30:18.380 --> 30:20.380]  they're not even front and center
[30:20.380 --> 30:22.380]  they're just walking around the streets
[30:22.380 --> 30:24.380]  oh yup you right
[30:24.400 --> 30:26.400]  I don't know
[30:26.400 --> 30:28.400]  there's also robots
[30:28.400 --> 30:30.400]  that was my thing it says avoid catastrophes
[30:30.400 --> 30:32.400]  and I was like I wonder if
[30:32.400 --> 30:34.400]  the aliens are a catastrophe
[30:34.400 --> 30:36.400]  because they just come out of their little
[30:36.400 --> 30:38.400]  their little UFO
[30:38.400 --> 30:40.400]  and they're just coming at you
[30:40.400 --> 30:42.400]  I don't know if they wreak havoc on your town
[30:42.400 --> 30:44.400]  well in Al's notes
[30:44.400 --> 30:46.400]  it says catastrophes include
[30:46.400 --> 30:48.400]  aliens
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.400]  I don't know if that's actually from him or not
[30:50.400 --> 30:52.400]  oh you wrote that
[30:52.420 --> 30:54.420]  um
[30:54.420 --> 30:56.420]  yeah so
[30:56.420 --> 30:58.420]  I mean that's what it looks like it's a catastrophe
[30:58.420 --> 31:00.420]  but they could just be visitors
[31:00.420 --> 31:02.420]  as well who knows
[31:02.420 --> 31:04.420]  um but yeah GoGo Town so that's something
[31:04.420 --> 31:06.420]  to be aware of
[31:06.420 --> 31:08.420]  on the horizon
[31:08.420 --> 31:10.420]  um next is Poglings
[31:10.420 --> 31:12.420]  boy what a name
[31:12.420 --> 31:14.420]  yeah
[31:14.420 --> 31:16.420]  like pogs were originally those little
[31:16.420 --> 31:18.420]  little like token coin things
[31:18.420 --> 31:20.420]  from the 80s and 90s
[31:20.440 --> 31:22.440]  I used to collect some Pokemon ones in Mexico
[31:22.440 --> 31:24.440]  by the time I was a kid
[31:24.440 --> 31:26.440]  well
[31:26.440 --> 31:28.440]  yeah I played with pogs
[31:28.440 --> 31:30.440]  um my own like
[31:30.440 --> 31:32.440]  I had some
[31:32.440 --> 31:34.440]  they were cool for sure
[31:34.440 --> 31:36.440]  uh yeah this is not that
[31:36.440 --> 31:38.440]  this is complicated
[31:38.440 --> 31:40.440]  I was trying to say my point was that the word pog
[31:40.440 --> 31:42.440]  has been ruined forever and ever thanks to Twitch
[31:42.440 --> 31:44.440]  oh no
[31:44.440 --> 31:46.440]  yeah so quote poglings
[31:46.440 --> 31:48.440]  is a cute pet simulation creature collecting adventure
[31:48.460 --> 31:50.460]  evolve breed and race
[31:50.460 --> 31:52.460]  cute mysterious creatures known as poglings
[31:52.460 --> 31:54.460]  stake claim to your island
[31:54.460 --> 31:56.460]  grow your nest and establish yourself as the best
[31:56.460 --> 31:58.460]  pogling catcher the
[31:58.460 --> 32:00.460]  wild vine islands has ever
[32:00.460 --> 32:02.460]  seen
[32:02.460 --> 32:04.460]  um I mean
[32:04.460 --> 32:06.460]  I don't love the art style
[32:06.460 --> 32:08.460]  no it's too
[32:08.460 --> 32:10.460]  saccharine
[32:10.460 --> 32:12.460]  I don't know it looks like a fake
[32:12.460 --> 32:14.460]  game or movie you'd see in a movie
[32:14.460 --> 32:16.460]  you know what I mean
[32:16.480 --> 32:18.480]  yeah I don't know it's not
[32:18.480 --> 32:20.480]  some people like I feel like if you like the games
[32:20.480 --> 32:22.480]  like merge dragons
[32:22.480 --> 32:24.480]  but it's not a merging game
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.480]  so I don't know
[32:26.480 --> 32:28.480]  it's got the same like
[32:28.480 --> 32:30.480]  art style to me
[32:30.480 --> 32:32.480]  the little creatures look like
[32:32.480 --> 32:34.480]  little merge dragon
[32:34.480 --> 32:36.480]  creatures
[32:36.480 --> 32:38.480]  when I first saw it it also reminded me of neopets
[32:38.480 --> 32:40.480]  which it is also not
[32:40.480 --> 32:42.480]  it is not neopets
[32:42.480 --> 32:44.480]  but it kind of is because you creature collect
[32:44.500 --> 32:46.500]  yeah you kind of get the vibe
[32:46.500 --> 32:48.500]  but it's like
[32:48.500 --> 32:50.500]  it's like if it was neopets but you only ever had
[32:50.500 --> 32:52.500]  one neopet
[32:52.500 --> 32:54.500]  like one type
[32:54.500 --> 32:56.500]  and you just
[32:56.500 --> 32:58.500]  coats of paint on that
[32:58.500 --> 33:00.500]  it just looks like it's just coats of paint
[33:00.500 --> 33:02.500]  on the same one
[33:02.500 --> 33:04.500]  it is in kickstarter so benefit of the doubt
[33:04.500 --> 33:06.500]  maybe they were just showing what they have now
[33:06.500 --> 33:08.500]  I was about to say
[33:08.500 --> 33:10.500]  this is also probably like 90%
[33:10.500 --> 33:12.500]  FMV and not actually gameplay
[33:12.520 --> 33:14.520]  yeah who knows
[33:14.520 --> 33:16.520]  but it will actually end up being
[33:16.520 --> 33:18.520]  yeah so I looked it up
[33:18.520 --> 33:20.520]  I know
[33:20.520 --> 33:22.520]  I wrote this
[33:22.520 --> 33:24.520]  I looked at the kickstarter and the kickstarter
[33:24.520 --> 33:26.520]  the goal was just 40k
[33:26.520 --> 33:28.520]  it is already at 311k
[33:28.520 --> 33:30.520]  thousand
[33:30.520 --> 33:32.520]  it's already
[33:32.520 --> 33:34.520]  way over the goal
[33:34.520 --> 33:36.520]  but it actually is still going
[33:36.520 --> 33:38.520]  the kickstarter is still going until may 11th
[33:38.520 --> 33:40.520]  so if you like these little
[33:40.540 --> 33:42.540]  collecting pet simulation games
[33:42.540 --> 33:44.540]  maybe give it a look
[33:44.540 --> 33:46.540]  wait hold the phone
[33:46.540 --> 33:48.540]  chad tronic is the creator
[33:48.540 --> 33:50.540]  I don't know
[33:50.540 --> 33:52.540]  he's a youtuber
[33:52.540 --> 33:54.540]  I don't follow him but I'm familiar with the name
[33:54.540 --> 33:56.540]  I did not
[33:56.540 --> 33:58.540]  that's crazy
[33:58.540 --> 34:00.540]  the wonder it blew the goal
[34:00.540 --> 34:02.540]  it has a following
[34:02.540 --> 34:04.540]  I'll be darned
[34:04.540 --> 34:06.540]  that's interesting
[34:06.540 --> 34:08.540]  no worries
[34:08.560 --> 34:10.560]  wow there is a lot
[34:10.560 --> 34:12.560]  I love seeing the extra stuff
[34:12.560 --> 34:14.560]  in the kickstarter
[34:14.560 --> 34:16.560]  you can get a plushie
[34:16.560 --> 34:18.560]  and all sorts of things
[34:18.560 --> 34:20.560]  you can design some
[34:20.560 --> 34:22.560]  the goals
[34:22.560 --> 34:24.560]  the donation levels
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.560]  aren't unreasonable
[34:26.560 --> 34:28.560]  the highest is 1.6
[34:28.560 --> 34:30.560]  not that bad to be quite frank
[34:30.560 --> 34:32.560]  so overall
[34:32.560 --> 34:34.560]  this is interesting
[34:34.560 --> 34:36.560]  now that I know that chad tronic
[34:36.580 --> 34:38.580]  has a lot of ideas on it
[34:38.580 --> 34:40.580]  this doesn't feel
[34:40.580 --> 34:42.580]  as big a risk anymore
[34:42.580 --> 34:44.580]  big asterisk
[34:44.580 --> 34:46.580]  of course it could
[34:46.580 --> 34:48.580]  very risky
[34:48.580 --> 34:50.580]  oh they've unlocked the cooking system
[34:50.580 --> 34:52.580]  but I'm interested
[34:52.580 --> 34:54.580]  to see how this work plays out
[34:54.580 --> 34:56.580]  like you said
[34:56.580 --> 34:58.580]  the arts are not the biggest fan
[34:58.580 --> 35:00.580]  of the fact that
[35:00.580 --> 35:02.580]  they're all the same creatures
[35:02.580 --> 35:04.580]  it might change
[35:04.600 --> 35:06.600]  yet
[35:06.600 --> 35:08.600]  more creatures eventually
[35:08.600 --> 35:10.600]  it is just like
[35:10.600 --> 35:12.600]  that was my thing
[35:12.600 --> 35:14.600]  the base is the same
[35:14.600 --> 35:16.600]  I don't know
[35:16.600 --> 35:18.600]  I would have liked if there were other things
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.600]  anyway
[35:20.600 --> 35:22.600]  oh wait no there are expensive ones
[35:22.600 --> 35:24.600]  there's a 5000 donation goal
[35:24.600 --> 35:26.600]  oh gosh
[35:26.600 --> 35:28.600]  I was looking to see how much I could donate
[35:28.600 --> 35:30.600]  to get a bee poggling in there
[35:30.600 --> 35:32.600]  it says $160
[35:32.620 --> 35:34.620]  or more
[35:34.620 --> 35:36.620]  a bee poggling
[35:36.620 --> 35:38.620]  yeah
[35:38.620 --> 35:40.620]  so that's poggling
[35:40.620 --> 35:42.620]  oh it's coming to steam and switch
[35:42.620 --> 35:44.620]  yeah there's already
[35:44.620 --> 35:46.620]  switch packaging looks like physical
[35:46.620 --> 35:48.620]  might come out
[35:48.620 --> 35:50.620]  they'll probably do well
[35:50.620 --> 35:52.620]  you know what gabe will definitely do well
[35:52.620 --> 35:54.620]  paleo pines
[35:54.620 --> 35:56.620]  Spencer and I are already ordering
[35:56.620 --> 35:58.620]  five coffees
[35:58.620 --> 36:00.620]  okay
[36:00.640 --> 36:02.640]  so I saw this first on a thread
[36:02.640 --> 36:04.640]  on our other slack
[36:04.640 --> 36:06.640]  our friend Spencer who's been on the show
[36:06.640 --> 36:08.640]  he posted the link to this
[36:08.640 --> 36:10.640]  and in that thread my one reaction
[36:10.640 --> 36:12.640]  was just two words oh no
[36:12.640 --> 36:14.640]  like oh no your money
[36:14.640 --> 36:16.640]  yes oh no my money
[36:16.640 --> 36:18.640]  oh no
[36:18.640 --> 36:20.640]  paleo pines
[36:20.640 --> 36:22.640]  paleo pines
[36:22.640 --> 36:24.640]  okay when I tell you dinosaur farming
[36:24.640 --> 36:26.640]  that can mean a number of different things
[36:26.640 --> 36:28.640]  but here the dinosaurs help you farm
[36:28.660 --> 36:30.660]  in this way
[36:30.660 --> 36:32.660]  that's all I've ever wanted
[36:32.660 --> 36:34.660]  you ride your triceratops
[36:34.660 --> 36:36.660]  and they help you
[36:36.660 --> 36:38.660]  sew your and all that good stuff
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.660]  yeah
[36:40.660 --> 36:42.660]  I'm so excited
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.660]  it's kind of part
[36:44.660 --> 36:46.660]  there's so many different parts of it
[36:46.660 --> 36:48.660]  so you have a dino pal lucky
[36:48.660 --> 36:50.660]  and you've had them since they were an egg
[36:50.660 --> 36:52.660]  and you're trying to find
[36:52.660 --> 36:54.660]  other, so it looks like she's a
[36:54.660 --> 36:56.660]  parasaurolophus
[36:56.680 --> 36:58.680]  so you're trying to find
[36:58.680 --> 37:00.680]  other ones of those and you find
[37:00.680 --> 37:02.680]  and you encounter paleo pines
[37:02.680 --> 37:04.680]  and then you create a dinosaur sanctuary
[37:04.680 --> 37:06.680]  so that kind of gives
[37:06.680 --> 37:08.680]  like zoo tycoon
[37:08.680 --> 37:10.680]  feels like if you look at it
[37:10.680 --> 37:12.680]  then you find
[37:12.680 --> 37:14.680]  and befriend other dinosaurs
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.680]  and like bring them back to your haven
[37:16.680 --> 37:18.680]  and then yeah dino ranching
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.680]  is what they call it because you use
[37:20.680 --> 37:22.680]  that's what it is you're running down
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.680]  well no I mean but also you farm with them
[37:24.700 --> 37:26.700]  because you need them
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.700]  you use them to help
[37:28.700 --> 37:30.700]  well not use they help you farm
[37:30.700 --> 37:32.700]  and you then feed them
[37:32.700 --> 37:34.700]  with the stuff that you farm
[37:34.700 --> 37:36.700]  so it's more humane than the flintstones
[37:36.700 --> 37:38.700]  yeah I just loved it
[37:38.700 --> 37:40.700]  like when I wrote down
[37:40.700 --> 37:42.700]  somewhere yeah
[37:42.700 --> 37:44.700]  quests, dinosaur mounts
[37:44.700 --> 37:46.700]  and cute big eyed dinos
[37:46.700 --> 37:48.700]  they have such big eyes and it just makes them
[37:48.700 --> 37:50.700]  so cute
[37:50.700 --> 37:52.700]  the dinosaurs are very
[37:52.720 --> 37:54.720]  yeah they're all
[37:54.720 --> 37:56.720]  I would almost say chibi
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.720]  well I say that because there's
[37:58.720 --> 38:00.720]  a lot of ones that should be bigger
[38:00.720 --> 38:02.720]  we have feathered dinosaurs
[38:02.720 --> 38:04.720]  controversial opinion
[38:04.720 --> 38:06.720]  controversial topic
[38:06.720 --> 38:08.720]  whether you're pro or anti-feathers
[38:08.720 --> 38:10.720]  they're there
[38:10.720 --> 38:12.720]  I mean it's not controversial
[38:12.720 --> 38:14.720]  it's science
[38:14.720 --> 38:16.720]  no I know it's science but people don't like them
[38:16.720 --> 38:18.720]  well people can be wrong
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.720]  yes I know
[38:20.740 --> 38:22.740]  yes I know
[38:22.740 --> 38:24.740]  I'm not against it
[38:24.740 --> 38:26.740]  I just know people love their Jurassic Park dinosaurs
[38:26.740 --> 38:28.740]  that's it
[38:28.740 --> 38:30.740]  anyways
[38:30.740 --> 38:32.740]  it looks amazing
[38:32.740 --> 38:34.740]  we don't have any dates now
[38:34.740 --> 38:36.740]  yeah there's no information
[38:36.740 --> 38:38.740]  you can come out on well not September 27th
[38:38.740 --> 38:40.740]  give me a few months after Maneko then you can come out
[38:40.740 --> 38:42.740]  yeah
[38:42.740 --> 38:44.740]  so I was a dinosaur kid
[38:44.740 --> 38:46.740]  absolutely
[38:46.740 --> 38:48.740]  that was my first thing
[38:48.760 --> 38:50.760]  as a human being
[38:50.760 --> 38:52.760]  before Pokemon
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.760]  dinosaurs were my thing
[38:54.760 --> 38:56.760]  Jurassic Park is a felony
[38:56.760 --> 38:58.760]  so I'm just
[38:58.760 --> 39:00.760]  oh this is the dream
[39:00.760 --> 39:02.760]  developers called italic pig
[39:02.760 --> 39:04.760]  thank you italic
[39:04.760 --> 39:06.760]  so that's all of our news
[39:06.760 --> 39:08.760]  is that it?
[39:08.760 --> 39:10.760]  so
[39:10.760 --> 39:12.760]  we'll move on to our main topic
[39:12.760 --> 39:14.760]  which is the mailbag
[39:14.760 --> 39:16.760]  and we can probably
[39:16.780 --> 39:18.780]  I can answer a question that was already asked before
[39:18.780 --> 39:20.780]  I'm going to move that to the top
[39:20.780 --> 39:22.780]  before we start
[39:22.780 --> 39:24.780]  I just want to give
[39:24.780 --> 39:26.780]  a big
[39:26.780 --> 39:28.780]  I just want to cover our bases here
[39:28.780 --> 39:30.780]  first of all thank you to everyone who's written in
[39:30.780 --> 39:32.780]  second of all
[39:32.780 --> 39:34.780]  I encourage
[39:34.780 --> 39:36.780]  all you listeners who haven't sent in
[39:36.780 --> 39:38.780]  or even if you have sent another one in
[39:38.780 --> 39:40.780]  you can do that through all our usual socials
[39:40.780 --> 39:42.780]  the slack, the twitter, email, the website
[39:42.780 --> 39:44.780]  whatever
[39:44.800 --> 39:46.800]  very excited to do this
[39:46.800 --> 39:48.800]  go ahead Cody
[39:48.800 --> 39:50.800]  I've always loved this kind of stuff
[39:50.800 --> 39:52.800]  and whenever
[39:52.800 --> 39:54.800]  the podcasts that I listen to
[39:54.800 --> 39:56.800]  that I'm a big fan of
[39:56.800 --> 39:58.800]  having that listener support
[39:58.800 --> 40:00.800]  and listener content
[40:00.800 --> 40:02.800]  bringing the listeners in
[40:02.800 --> 40:04.800]  and having them be a part of the conversation
[40:04.800 --> 40:06.800]  by leading what we say
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.800]  it is so fun to do
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.800]  I remember
[40:10.800 --> 40:12.800]  some of the bigger podcasts that I've been on before
[40:12.820 --> 40:14.820]  or that I've listened to
[40:14.820 --> 40:16.820]  before
[40:16.820 --> 40:18.820]  when they say my name
[40:18.820 --> 40:20.820]  I'm like, it's me
[40:20.820 --> 40:22.820]  that's me
[40:22.820 --> 40:24.820]  I wrote in
[40:24.820 --> 40:26.820]  they said my name
[40:26.820 --> 40:28.820]  I love this kind of stuff
[40:28.820 --> 40:30.820]  I also like
[40:30.820 --> 40:32.820]  the wide breadth of topics
[40:32.820 --> 40:34.820]  that we can cover here
[40:34.820 --> 40:36.820]  we're not asking you guys to ask about
[40:36.820 --> 40:38.820]  farming games
[40:38.820 --> 40:40.820]  ask us total goblin nonsense questions
[40:40.840 --> 40:42.840]  tell us stories, whatever you want
[40:42.840 --> 40:44.840]  I love the nonsense BS stories
[40:44.840 --> 40:46.840]  that's some of my favorite stuff
[40:46.840 --> 40:48.840]  anyways
[40:48.840 --> 40:50.840]  go ahead
[40:50.840 --> 40:52.840]  the first question comes to us from Kat
[40:52.840 --> 40:54.840]  thank you Kat
[40:54.840 --> 40:56.840]  this is a question that you and Johnny already answered
[40:56.840 --> 40:58.840]  on
[40:58.840 --> 41:00.840]  Taranil
[41:00.840 --> 41:02.840]  and so
[41:02.840 --> 41:04.840]  I'm just going to give my answer now
[41:04.840 --> 41:06.840]  the question is
[41:06.840 --> 41:08.840]  what in your opinion makes a game a stardew clone
[41:08.860 --> 41:10.860]  if you want to play it more or less
[41:10.860 --> 41:12.860]  as in what factors make the art style seem similar
[41:12.860 --> 41:14.860]  the UI, the gameplay, the structure, etc.
[41:14.860 --> 41:16.860]  thank you Kat
[41:16.860 --> 41:18.860]  I would say in my opinion
[41:18.860 --> 41:20.860]  the UI is a big thing
[41:20.860 --> 41:27.860]  if the inventory is pretty much the same as stardew
[41:27.860 --> 41:29.860]  and the menu system is very similar
[41:29.860 --> 41:31.860]  also the 2D modeling
[41:31.860 --> 41:33.860]  so seeing a very
[41:33.860 --> 41:35.860]  pixelated
[41:35.860 --> 41:37.860]  kind of simpler
[41:37.880 --> 41:39.880]  2D side scrolling style game
[41:39.880 --> 41:41.880]  if your little character
[41:41.880 --> 41:43.880]  is kind of like a little chibi character
[41:43.880 --> 41:45.880]  and most things
[41:45.880 --> 41:47.880]  that I would say
[41:47.880 --> 41:49.880]  for me it is all aesthetic
[41:49.880 --> 41:51.880]  something could have
[41:51.880 --> 41:53.880]  the same mechanics as stardew
[41:53.880 --> 41:55.880]  but look completely different
[41:55.880 --> 41:57.880]  and I don't think I'd call it a stardew clone
[41:57.880 --> 41:59.880]  so for me
[41:59.880 --> 42:01.880]  most things that look kind of like stardew
[42:01.880 --> 42:03.880]  it just makes me want to play stardew
[42:03.880 --> 42:05.880]  so
[42:05.900 --> 42:07.900]  if it's something that
[42:07.900 --> 42:09.900]  looks a lot like stardew
[42:09.900 --> 42:11.900]  and has some of the similar mechanics
[42:11.900 --> 42:13.900]  I will generally put it down
[42:13.900 --> 42:15.900]  and go play stardew instead
[42:15.900 --> 42:17.900]  because it just makes me want to play that
[42:17.900 --> 42:19.900]  it depends on
[42:19.900 --> 42:21.900]  if the gameplay is fairly unique
[42:21.900 --> 42:23.900]  so one example would be
[42:23.900 --> 42:25.900]  research story
[42:25.900 --> 42:27.900]  so it aesthetically looks like a stardew clone
[42:27.900 --> 42:29.900]  because it has the
[42:29.900 --> 42:31.900]  2D modeling, the chibi characters
[42:31.900 --> 42:33.900]  the UI looks pretty similar
[42:33.920 --> 42:35.920]  but the gameplay is pretty different
[42:35.920 --> 42:37.920]  and you're doing different things
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.920]  and you're doing the research
[42:39.920 --> 42:41.920]  and there's more detail
[42:41.920 --> 42:43.920]  about the world around you
[42:43.920 --> 42:45.920]  so I think that's something that's missing from stardew
[42:45.920 --> 42:47.920]  like you forage but you don't learn
[42:47.920 --> 42:49.920]  about the things that you're foraging
[42:49.920 --> 42:51.920]  you just pick them up
[42:51.920 --> 42:53.920]  so
[42:53.920 --> 42:55.920]  I would say to classify something as a stardew clone
[42:55.920 --> 42:57.920]  it would be
[42:57.920 --> 42:59.920]  something that looks
[42:59.920 --> 43:01.920]  aesthetically looks similar to stardew
[43:01.940 --> 43:03.940]  yeah
[43:03.940 --> 43:05.940]  to read
[43:05.940 --> 43:07.940]  for me it's pretty much the visual
[43:07.940 --> 43:09.940]  style, the 2D pixelated
[43:09.940 --> 43:11.940]  as someone who played
[43:11.940 --> 43:13.940]  the harvest moon games prior
[43:13.940 --> 43:15.940]  to stardew
[43:15.940 --> 43:17.940]  I think stardew is still the heart of his moon clone
[43:17.940 --> 43:19.940]  it sounds as though I linked to it
[43:19.940 --> 43:21.940]  but yeah
[43:21.940 --> 43:23.940]  because so many of the games we cover here
[43:23.940 --> 43:25.940]  even some of the ones we enjoy
[43:25.940 --> 43:27.940]  like roots of pacha I'm still excited for
[43:27.940 --> 43:29.940]  it just has that 2D pixel style
[43:29.960 --> 43:31.960]  yeah
[43:31.960 --> 43:33.960]  okay the next question
[43:33.960 --> 43:35.960]  is what feature in farming games
[43:35.960 --> 43:37.960]  makes you groan
[43:37.960 --> 43:39.960]  I'm Brandon
[43:39.960 --> 43:41.960]  this question comes from Brandon
[43:41.960 --> 43:43.960]  what about you Kev
[43:43.960 --> 43:45.960]  do you have anything off the top of your head here
[43:45.960 --> 43:47.960]  yes
[43:47.960 --> 43:49.960]  well okay I've been thinking about this
[43:49.960 --> 43:51.960]  because this is
[43:51.960 --> 43:53.960]  I doubted my own answer
[43:53.960 --> 43:55.960]  so the number one thing that
[43:55.960 --> 43:57.960]  I knee jerk groan to
[43:57.980 --> 43:59.980]  is seeing the relationships in
[43:59.980 --> 44:01.980]  a cottagecore game
[44:01.980 --> 44:03.980]  and I thought about it and
[44:03.980 --> 44:05.980]  it's not necessarily against
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.980]  a relationship mechanic in itself
[44:07.980 --> 44:09.980]  I don't have an issue with it
[44:09.980 --> 44:11.980]  I just always
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.980]  to me it always looks more of a symptom
[44:13.980 --> 44:15.980]  than the problem if you will
[44:15.980 --> 44:17.980]  so anytime I see a game have
[44:17.980 --> 44:19.980]  relationship mechanics
[44:19.980 --> 44:21.980]  I think, or at least in
[44:21.980 --> 44:23.980]  the area of our
[44:23.980 --> 44:25.980]  internet game sphere here, the cottagecore area
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  I think they're often taking
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  on too much
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  a lot of these are smaller developers
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  that just
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  I think tacking on something that
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  a game doesn't always need
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  I prefer other games
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  going back to the last question
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  I think it's because of a stardew thing
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  or Harvest Moon originally
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  it all comes from there and I get it
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  it's kind of a hallmark of the genre
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  almost at this point
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  but I just look at the practical
[44:54.020 --> 44:56.020]  development cycle
[44:56.020 --> 44:58.020]  I'd rather the resources have been spent
[44:58.020 --> 45:00.020]  somewhere else
[45:00.020 --> 45:02.020]  so that's usually what I'm
[45:02.020 --> 45:04.020]  not always keen on
[45:04.020 --> 45:06.020]  and to be honest, I thought about it
[45:06.020 --> 45:08.020]  it's not just even cottagecore
[45:08.020 --> 45:10.020]  some of my other games and series
[45:10.020 --> 45:12.020]  that I've enjoyed, Fire Emblem is a good one
[45:12.020 --> 45:14.020]  they introduced relationship mechanics
[45:14.020 --> 45:16.020]  it was super fun and enjoyable
[45:16.020 --> 45:18.020]  though one time they did, but they really
[45:18.020 --> 45:20.020]  leaned into it and it started making me
[45:20.020 --> 45:22.020]  grow a little because they were just leaning so much into it
[45:22.040 --> 45:24.040]  again, because I
[45:24.040 --> 45:26.040]  enjoyed other things about that game
[45:26.040 --> 45:28.040]  and would have preferred more time spent on it
[45:28.040 --> 45:30.040]  but again
[45:30.040 --> 45:32.040]  nothing against the relationship
[45:32.040 --> 45:34.040]  mechanic in general
[45:34.040 --> 45:36.040]  I participate in them, I enjoy the characters
[45:36.040 --> 45:38.040]  and stuff through them, and when they're done well, they're done well
[45:38.040 --> 45:40.040]  but it just usually makes me
[45:40.040 --> 45:42.040]  very apprehensive when I hear a game
[45:42.040 --> 45:44.040]  yeah, it's usually one of the last things
[45:44.040 --> 45:46.040]  that I do in a game
[45:46.040 --> 45:48.040]  because it's just not
[45:48.040 --> 45:50.040]  my priority
[45:50.060 --> 45:52.060]  usually doesn't add to the game
[45:52.060 --> 45:54.060]  not usually, no
[45:54.060 --> 45:56.060]  it has to be
[45:56.060 --> 45:58.060]  it's a very hard
[45:58.060 --> 46:00.060]  thing to do for it to add to the game
[46:00.060 --> 46:02.060]  because you have to be invested
[46:02.060 --> 46:04.060]  outside the mechanic
[46:04.060 --> 46:06.060]  the relationship stuff
[46:06.060 --> 46:08.060]  and that can happen, Wildflowers
[46:08.060 --> 46:10.060]  actually was very good at that
[46:10.060 --> 46:12.060]  because the plot is so character-driven
[46:12.060 --> 46:14.060]  and whatnot, that affects the relationship
[46:14.060 --> 46:16.060]  stuff
[46:16.060 --> 46:18.060]  but like Stardew, the more I think about it
[46:18.080 --> 46:20.080]  you don't do the relationship, you're not missing
[46:20.080 --> 46:22.080]  yeah, exactly
[46:22.080 --> 46:24.080]  the one time that I finished one
[46:24.080 --> 46:26.080]  I won't say who the person that I
[46:26.080 --> 46:28.080]  ended up marrying was, but
[46:28.080 --> 46:30.080]  they ended up just
[46:30.080 --> 46:32.080]  living in my house
[46:32.080 --> 46:34.080]  and being a bum
[46:34.080 --> 46:36.080]  and I was just like
[46:36.080 --> 46:38.080]  that could be more than one person
[46:38.080 --> 46:40.080]  I was like, this is bullcrap
[46:40.080 --> 46:42.080]  you're not doing anything
[46:42.080 --> 46:44.080]  you do nothing
[46:44.080 --> 46:46.080]  you just went from one location
[46:46.100 --> 46:48.100]  to my house, and that was it
[46:48.100 --> 46:50.100]  that's all that happened
[46:50.100 --> 46:52.100]  I'm looking at the list, I don't know
[46:52.100 --> 46:54.100]  if it could be a number of people
[46:54.100 --> 46:56.100]  I can tell you who it is later
[46:56.100 --> 46:58.100]  okay, that's the post-credits
[46:58.100 --> 47:00.100]  I will, yeah
[47:00.100 --> 47:02.100]  listeners
[47:02.100 --> 47:04.100]  stay after the post-credits and I'll tell you
[47:04.100 --> 47:06.100]  find out mine
[47:06.100 --> 47:08.100]  yeah, so
[47:08.100 --> 47:10.100]  the feature that makes me groan
[47:10.100 --> 47:12.100]  is
[47:12.100 --> 47:14.100]  when some of the days
[47:14.120 --> 47:16.120]  the timing of the day is really fast
[47:16.120 --> 47:18.120]  so I put
[47:18.120 --> 47:20.120]  non-real time days
[47:20.120 --> 47:22.120]  for example, with Stardew
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.120]  by the time you wake
[47:24.120 --> 47:26.120]  up and do your stuff
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.120]  and then run all the way across the map
[47:28.120 --> 47:30.120]  to go do something
[47:30.120 --> 47:32.120]  suddenly it's already noon
[47:32.120 --> 47:34.120]  and it's just like
[47:34.120 --> 47:36.120]  because as you're traveling
[47:36.120 --> 47:38.120]  time is just going
[47:38.120 --> 47:40.120]  at the same rate, and it's really fast
[47:40.120 --> 47:42.120]  and so you end up wasting
[47:42.140 --> 47:44.140]  so much of your day
[47:44.140 --> 47:46.140]  doing nothing
[47:46.140 --> 47:48.140]  it feels like
[47:48.140 --> 47:50.140]  or just taking care
[47:50.140 --> 47:52.140]  of your crop
[47:52.140 --> 47:54.140]  so a lot of the times in games
[47:54.140 --> 47:56.140]  when they have these day
[47:56.140 --> 47:58.140]  night cycles
[47:58.140 --> 48:00.140]  especially when you have the ones
[48:00.140 --> 48:02.140]  that after a certain time of the day
[48:02.140 --> 48:04.140]  your character passes out
[48:06.140 --> 48:08.140]  Harvest Moon does that
[48:08.140 --> 48:10.140]  and then
[48:10.160 --> 48:12.160]  Stardew does that
[48:12.160 --> 48:14.160]  it hits a certain point of the day
[48:14.160 --> 48:16.160]  and you start getting really sleepy
[48:16.160 --> 48:18.160]  and you pass out
[48:18.160 --> 48:20.160]  no, let me stay awake
[48:20.160 --> 48:22.160]  forever
[48:22.160 --> 48:24.160]  let me not have to sleep
[48:24.160 --> 48:26.160]  I know that's not realistic
[48:26.160 --> 48:28.160]  but it makes me feel
[48:28.160 --> 48:30.160]  limited
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.160]  and it makes me feel
[48:32.160 --> 48:34.160]  like I can't just play the game
[48:34.160 --> 48:36.160]  and enjoy the game
[48:36.160 --> 48:38.160]  almost never in any of my Stardew runs
[48:38.180 --> 48:40.180]  have I gone and talked
[48:40.180 --> 48:42.180]  to all of the people
[48:42.180 --> 48:44.180]  and actually listened
[48:44.180 --> 48:46.180]  or read what they're saying
[48:46.180 --> 48:48.180]  because I feel like it's a waste of time
[48:48.180 --> 48:50.180]  I have fish to catch
[48:50.180 --> 48:52.180]  I have a community center to do
[48:52.180 --> 48:54.180]  I have to go mine
[48:54.180 --> 48:56.180]  I have to go do all of this stuff
[48:56.180 --> 48:58.180]  and I could care less about your story
[48:58.180 --> 49:00.180]  but if they had it so that
[49:00.180 --> 49:02.180]  the time either didn't matter
[49:02.180 --> 49:04.180]  or it was
[49:04.180 --> 49:06.180]  slower
[49:06.200 --> 49:08.200]  I could enjoy that stuff
[49:08.200 --> 49:10.200]  a little bit more
[49:10.200 --> 49:12.200]  Wildflower, the greatest farming game of all time
[49:12.200 --> 49:14.200]  I think has an elegant solution
[49:14.200 --> 49:16.200]  one, they just straight up give you
[49:16.200 --> 49:18.200]  an option to slow down time
[49:18.200 --> 49:20.200]  most of the days
[49:20.200 --> 49:22.200]  I think any game
[49:22.200 --> 49:24.200]  should take a note from that
[49:24.200 --> 49:26.200]  Garden Paws did that as well
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.200]  so that's a game that Bev and I covered
[49:28.200 --> 49:30.200]  and that game does that as well
[49:30.200 --> 49:32.200]  where
[49:32.200 --> 49:34.200]  after a certain time
[49:34.220 --> 49:36.220]  or after you've done the tutorial
[49:36.220 --> 49:38.220]  or after you've
[49:38.220 --> 49:40.220]  I don't remember exactly when it happens in the game
[49:40.220 --> 49:42.220]  but there's a point where it's like
[49:42.220 --> 49:44.220]  would you like to slow things down
[49:44.220 --> 49:46.220]  and I'm like yes
[49:46.220 --> 49:48.220]  because there's now an entirely different island
[49:48.220 --> 49:50.220]  that I want to go to
[49:50.220 --> 49:52.220]  and I have to walk my butt
[49:52.220 --> 49:54.220]  all the way over there
[49:54.220 --> 49:56.220]  and so I don't want to have to waste
[49:56.220 --> 49:58.220]  so much of my time
[49:58.220 --> 50:00.220]  doing that
[50:00.220 --> 50:02.220]  so yeah, I super appreciate that
[50:02.240 --> 50:04.240]  so yeah, I super appreciate that
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.240]  about games
[50:06.240 --> 50:08.240]  Concerned Ape, Eric
[50:08.240 --> 50:10.240]  and now I know your name is Eric
[50:10.240 --> 50:12.240]  listening to this, please
[50:12.240 --> 50:14.240]  add something like that in Stardew
[50:14.240 --> 50:16.240]  Coming in 1.6, just you wait
[50:16.240 --> 50:18.240]  I'm going to Google it, maybe it actually already happens
[50:18.240 --> 50:20.240]  Stardew Valley
[50:20.240 --> 50:22.240]  slow down time
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.240]  oh, it's a mod
[50:24.240 --> 50:26.240]  I don't want it as a mod
[50:26.240 --> 50:28.240]  I'm not a big mod person
[50:28.240 --> 50:30.240]  I'm not either, it'd be nice just to have it
[50:30.260 --> 50:32.260]  yeah, okay, so
[50:32.260 --> 50:34.260]  the next question
[50:34.260 --> 50:36.260]  I keep playing with the
[50:36.260 --> 50:38.260]  thing in here
[50:38.260 --> 50:40.260]  Kat
[50:40.260 --> 50:42.260]  I am messing up this
[50:42.260 --> 50:44.260]  document we're working on
[50:44.260 --> 50:46.260]  I'm watching it live in real time
[50:46.260 --> 50:50.260]  another question from Kat
[50:50.260 --> 50:52.260]  thank you, Kat
[50:52.260 --> 50:54.260]  Kat is curious to know
[50:54.260 --> 50:56.260]  our first few
[50:56.260 --> 50:58.260]  farming or cottagecore games
[50:58.280 --> 51:00.280]  and when we got into the games
[51:00.280 --> 51:02.280]  they say I think a lot of people
[51:02.280 --> 51:04.280]  played Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing as kids
[51:04.280 --> 51:06.280]  and also Stardew and Animal Crossing New Horizons
[51:06.280 --> 51:08.280]  got many people into the genre
[51:08.280 --> 51:10.280]  as adults, it's interesting to see
[51:10.280 --> 51:12.280]  how the popularity of these games has grown
[51:12.280 --> 51:14.280]  so exponentially
[51:14.280 --> 51:16.280]  yeah, so I will say
[51:16.280 --> 51:18.280]  I'll just jump in
[51:18.280 --> 51:20.280]  Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life
[51:20.280 --> 51:22.280]  it was my kind of introduction
[51:22.280 --> 51:24.280]  to this
[51:24.280 --> 51:26.280]  before, so this was maybe
[51:26.300 --> 51:28.300]  when I was like 14
[51:28.300 --> 51:30.300]  maybe a little younger than that, I don't know
[51:30.300 --> 51:32.300]  somewhere around there, 12 to 14
[51:32.300 --> 51:34.300]  I got a GameCube
[51:34.300 --> 51:36.300]  and I was playing
[51:36.300 --> 51:38.300]  the GameCube and
[51:38.300 --> 51:40.300]  I didn't have a ton of games
[51:40.300 --> 51:42.300]  but one of the games that I did have
[51:42.300 --> 51:44.300]  was Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life
[51:44.300 --> 51:46.300]  and then one of my friends got me
[51:46.300 --> 51:48.300]  or my mom got me or someone got me
[51:48.300 --> 51:50.300]  the Animal Crossing game
[51:50.300 --> 51:52.300]  the GameCube version
[51:52.300 --> 51:54.300]  and so those were the two games
[51:54.320 --> 51:56.320]  that got me into this genre
[51:56.320 --> 51:58.320]  and to this day
[51:58.320 --> 52:00.320]  when spring starts hitting
[52:00.320 --> 52:02.320]  I get the urge to play these games again
[52:02.320 --> 52:04.320]  because it reminds me of that time in my life
[52:04.320 --> 52:06.320]  when it was
[52:06.320 --> 52:08.320]  not warm enough to go outside and play yet
[52:08.320 --> 52:10.320]  but
[52:10.320 --> 52:12.320]  I couldn't
[52:12.320 --> 52:14.320]  still play them
[52:14.320 --> 52:16.320]  yeah, I'm trying to think
[52:16.320 --> 52:18.320]  if there's anything else
[52:18.320 --> 52:20.320]  to that
[52:20.320 --> 52:22.320]  I never beat A Wonderful Life
[52:22.340 --> 52:24.340]  I don't recall if I ever even married
[52:24.340 --> 52:26.340]  maybe I did, maybe I married someone once
[52:28.340 --> 52:30.340]  but it's
[52:30.340 --> 52:32.340]  well I don't know, the thing is
[52:32.340 --> 52:34.340]  I didn't know if I'd made it that far in the game
[52:36.340 --> 52:38.340]  but I think I did
[52:38.340 --> 52:40.340]  I mostly liked farming
[52:40.340 --> 52:42.340]  I loved that
[52:42.340 --> 52:44.340]  you have the plot
[52:44.340 --> 52:46.340]  where your cows are
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.340]  the cow pasture
[52:48.340 --> 52:50.340]  and you could go in there
[52:50.360 --> 52:52.360]  and cut all the hay down
[52:52.360 --> 52:54.360]  and
[52:54.360 --> 52:56.360]  put your horse in there
[52:56.360 --> 52:58.360]  I just loved
[52:58.360 --> 53:00.360]  all of that part of the game
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.360]  and the fact that it was 3D
[53:02.360 --> 53:04.360]  top of the line graphics
[53:04.360 --> 53:06.360]  it was pretty mind blowing
[53:06.360 --> 53:08.360]  rotate the camera
[53:08.360 --> 53:10.360]  in some areas
[53:10.360 --> 53:12.360]  oh my goodness
[53:12.360 --> 53:14.360]  and then
[53:14.360 --> 53:16.360]  that Animal Crossing game was the one that didn't have
[53:16.360 --> 53:18.360]  the continuous
[53:18.380 --> 53:20.380]  there was a point
[53:20.380 --> 53:22.380]  I think that you had
[53:22.380 --> 53:24.380]  to run into the next
[53:24.380 --> 53:26.380]  area
[53:26.380 --> 53:28.380]  there was a set
[53:28.380 --> 53:30.380]  it didn't show you the whole map all at once
[53:30.380 --> 53:32.380]  it only showed you some of the map at once
[53:32.380 --> 53:34.380]  and you had to run between
[53:34.380 --> 53:36.380]  I think
[53:36.380 --> 53:38.380]  I might be completely making that up
[53:38.380 --> 53:40.380]  yeah
[53:40.380 --> 53:42.380]  so
[53:42.380 --> 53:44.380]  what got you into farming in Cottagecore?
[53:44.380 --> 53:46.380]  well pretty much the same as you
[53:46.400 --> 53:48.400]  Harvest Moon, Wonderful Life
[53:48.400 --> 53:50.400]  and Animal Crossing
[53:50.400 --> 53:52.400]  so I had the GameCube
[53:52.400 --> 53:54.400]  and interestingly enough
[53:54.400 --> 53:56.400]  both of these were Blockbuster rentals
[53:56.400 --> 53:58.400]  because that was still around back then
[53:58.400 --> 54:00.400]  and
[54:00.400 --> 54:02.400]  Blockbuster worked its magic
[54:02.400 --> 54:04.400]  I rented it, you see if you like it
[54:04.400 --> 54:06.400]  boy did I like both of those games
[54:06.400 --> 54:08.400]  so yeah
[54:08.400 --> 54:10.400]  eventually I was able to get them for birthday
[54:10.400 --> 54:12.400]  pretty much the same as you
[54:12.400 --> 54:14.400]  Animal Crossing
[54:14.420 --> 54:16.420]  it's just a magical experience
[54:16.420 --> 54:18.420]  but Wonderful Life is still
[54:18.420 --> 54:20.420]  in my mind an unmatched
[54:20.420 --> 54:22.420]  farming experience
[54:22.420 --> 54:24.420]  I say that as not playing a lot of other
[54:24.420 --> 54:26.420]  Story of Seasons games
[54:26.420 --> 54:28.420]  but you know what it doesn't matter because we're getting the remake
[54:28.420 --> 54:30.420]  in a few months
[54:32.420 --> 54:34.420]  it's all you man
[54:34.420 --> 54:36.420]  oh man I can't wait
[54:36.420 --> 54:38.420]  it's one of those like
[54:38.420 --> 54:40.420]  I don't know it looked exactly the same
[54:40.420 --> 54:42.420]  and I'm hitting a point in my life
[54:42.440 --> 54:44.440]  where I'm like I don't want to just rehash
[54:44.440 --> 54:46.440]  the same things I want to experience new
[54:46.440 --> 54:48.440]  things I don't want to continue to play the same
[54:48.440 --> 54:50.440]  thing over and over again
[54:50.440 --> 54:52.440]  which is sad because a year ago I was the opposite
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.440]  I was like I'm going to play Skyrim for the
[54:54.440 --> 54:56.440]  40 billionth time
[54:56.440 --> 54:58.440]  but I just
[54:58.440 --> 55:00.440]  I get it
[55:00.440 --> 55:02.440]  I wish I was more like that but here I am
[55:02.440 --> 55:04.440]  I just spent the whole week playing let's build a zoo
[55:04.440 --> 55:06.440]  again just building my fourth zoo
[55:06.440 --> 55:08.440]  no worries
[55:08.440 --> 55:10.440]  other GameCube game Wind Waker
[55:10.460 --> 55:12.460]  such a great game
[55:12.460 --> 55:14.460]  that is actually my number one with a bullet
[55:14.460 --> 55:16.460]  favorite game of all time
[55:16.460 --> 55:18.460]  I know you've talked about it
[55:18.460 --> 55:20.460]  and I was just working up GameCube games
[55:20.460 --> 55:22.460]  and that came up
[55:22.460 --> 55:24.460]  alright
[55:24.460 --> 55:26.460]  next question from our dear friend
[55:26.460 --> 55:28.460]  Dalen, Slack I believe
[55:28.460 --> 55:30.460]  what is a game you would like to get a sequel?
[55:30.460 --> 55:32.460]  farming game not necessary
[55:32.460 --> 55:34.460]  Cody you have your answers
[55:34.460 --> 55:36.460]  go with yours while I think about mine for a second
[55:36.460 --> 55:38.460]  well also you got excited about one of mine
[55:38.480 --> 55:40.480]  so one of mine
[55:40.480 --> 55:42.480]  is Hollow Knight
[55:42.480 --> 55:44.480]  I think that Hollow Knight would be great
[55:44.480 --> 55:46.480]  to have a sequel and there is a sequel coming
[55:46.480 --> 55:48.480]  is it?
[55:48.480 --> 55:50.480]  it is
[55:50.480 --> 55:52.480]  there is
[55:52.480 --> 55:54.480]  video trailers and stuff
[55:54.480 --> 55:56.480]  so it's definitely coming
[55:56.480 --> 55:58.480]  Team Cherry is working on it
[55:58.480 --> 56:00.480]  the real question is will it be one sequel
[56:00.480 --> 56:02.480]  or will they come out with two because they worked
[56:02.480 --> 56:04.480]  on it so much and did so much
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.480]  they had to make two games
[56:06.500 --> 56:08.500]  one and then it will just have
[56:08.500 --> 56:10.500]  I don't know these guys are kind of lunatics
[56:10.500 --> 56:12.500]  yeah it's true
[56:12.500 --> 56:14.500]  you right
[56:14.500 --> 56:16.500]  or like a DLC
[56:16.500 --> 56:18.500]  part of it could be like a DLC
[56:18.500 --> 56:20.500]  so there is that
[56:20.500 --> 56:22.500]  I was trying to think back to games that I like
[56:22.500 --> 56:24.500]  that don't have sequels
[56:24.500 --> 56:26.500]  so the thing about games nowadays
[56:26.500 --> 56:28.500]  is they just do DLC
[56:28.500 --> 56:30.500]  they don't do a sequel
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.500]  so I had to dip back pretty far
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.500]  to think of
[56:34.520 --> 56:36.520]  a game that I would like
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.520]  to have a sequel
[56:38.520 --> 56:40.520]  and so the two that I came up with
[56:40.520 --> 56:42.520]  one is Okami
[56:42.520 --> 56:44.520]  which if people don't know
[56:44.520 --> 56:46.520]  it was a game
[56:46.520 --> 56:48.520]  I think it was on the Wii
[56:48.520 --> 56:50.520]  or it might have been on the GameCube
[56:50.520 --> 56:52.520]  it was originally the Wii because they had the motion control
[56:52.520 --> 56:54.520]  for the garage
[56:54.520 --> 56:56.520]  and then it got released on PS2
[56:56.520 --> 56:58.520]  I think I played it on the Playstation actually
[56:58.520 --> 57:00.520]  so you are a wolf
[57:00.520 --> 57:02.520]  Amaterasu
[57:02.540 --> 57:04.540]  helping a god
[57:04.540 --> 57:06.540]  clear the world
[57:06.540 --> 57:08.540]  of pestilence or something
[57:08.540 --> 57:10.540]  you are the goddess
[57:10.540 --> 57:12.540]  there is someone else
[57:12.540 --> 57:14.540]  helping you as well
[57:14.540 --> 57:16.540]  you are like a wolf god
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.540]  you run around
[57:18.540 --> 57:20.540]  and this came out around
[57:20.540 --> 57:22.540]  the same time as Twilight Princess
[57:22.540 --> 57:24.540]  Zelda Twilight Princess
[57:24.540 --> 57:26.540]  so everyone was like there are so many wolf games
[57:26.540 --> 57:28.540]  coming out
[57:28.540 --> 57:30.540]  but Okami was so pretty
[57:30.560 --> 57:32.560]  there was this Japanese brush
[57:32.560 --> 57:34.560]  calligraphy style game
[57:34.560 --> 57:36.560]  shell shaded
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.560]  wind waker but with a Japanese
[57:38.560 --> 57:40.560]  waters
[57:40.560 --> 57:42.560]  and how you defeated things
[57:42.560 --> 57:44.560]  was by drawing on the screen
[57:44.560 --> 57:46.560]  with either your Wii controller
[57:46.560 --> 57:48.560]  or you hit a certain button
[57:48.560 --> 57:50.560]  on the Playstation controller
[57:50.560 --> 57:52.560]  and then moved the cursor around
[57:52.560 --> 57:54.560]  and by doing a certain
[57:54.560 --> 57:56.560]  pattern you did a certain move
[57:56.560 --> 57:58.560]  and you are just trying to
[57:58.580 --> 58:00.580]  clear the world of evil
[58:00.580 --> 58:02.580]  and throughout the game
[58:02.580 --> 58:04.580]  if you clear an area
[58:04.580 --> 58:06.580]  a bunch of animals start coming back
[58:06.580 --> 58:08.580]  little foxes and little bunnies
[58:08.580 --> 58:10.580]  come back to the area
[58:10.580 --> 58:12.580]  once you have cleared it
[58:12.580 --> 58:14.580]  and you can pet them or lick them
[58:14.580 --> 58:16.580]  or pick them up
[58:16.580 --> 58:18.580]  it was just so cute
[58:18.580 --> 58:20.580]  I played it for just a brief minute
[58:20.580 --> 58:22.580]  but I am very fond of Okami
[58:22.580 --> 58:24.580]  I have it on my Switch
[58:24.580 --> 58:26.580]  one day I will get to it
[58:26.600 --> 58:28.600]  I have a version of it on the Switch
[58:28.600 --> 58:30.600]  but a newer game
[58:30.600 --> 58:32.600]  because it was early 2000s for sure
[58:32.600 --> 58:34.600]  what if I told you there is
[58:34.600 --> 58:36.600]  are you serious?
[58:36.600 --> 58:38.600]  it's called Okami Den
[58:38.600 --> 58:40.600]  you play as the offspring
[58:40.600 --> 58:42.600]  of Amaterasu
[58:42.600 --> 58:44.600]  and it was released on the
[58:44.600 --> 58:46.600]  Playstation 2 originally
[58:46.600 --> 58:48.600]  got a DS port
[58:48.600 --> 58:50.600]  an article in 2021
[58:50.600 --> 58:52.600]  said that
[58:52.600 --> 58:54.600]  Hideki Kamiya
[58:54.620 --> 58:56.620]  the developer
[58:56.620 --> 58:58.620]  or creator of the game
[58:58.620 --> 59:00.620]  says that he wants to make an Okami sequel someday
[59:00.620 --> 59:02.620]  they made it
[59:02.620 --> 59:04.620]  I wonder if what you are talking about
[59:04.620 --> 59:06.620]  isn't a sequel
[59:06.620 --> 59:08.620]  it's a spiritual successor
[59:08.620 --> 59:10.620]  but it's very
[59:10.620 --> 59:12.620]  technically had a sequel
[59:12.620 --> 59:14.620]  on the 3DS called Okami Den
[59:14.620 --> 59:16.620]  but it takes place further in the future
[59:16.620 --> 59:18.620]  it doesn't include the original dude
[59:18.620 --> 59:20.620]  no it doesn't
[59:20.620 --> 59:22.620]  I want a true sequel
[59:22.640 --> 59:24.640]  the other game
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.640]  which I am going to hastily
[59:26.640 --> 59:28.640]  Google if it has a sequel
[59:28.640 --> 59:30.640]  I can tell you
[59:30.640 --> 59:32.640]  that's a David Cage game
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.640]  and there are games
[59:34.640 --> 59:36.640]  in that fashion
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.640]  none of them quite hit the same notes
[59:38.640 --> 59:40.640]  but go ahead say the name
[59:40.640 --> 59:42.640]  I don't know if you've played this game
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.640]  I don't but I know
[59:44.640 --> 59:46.640]  way more than I should
[59:46.640 --> 59:48.640]  Heavy Rain
[59:48.640 --> 59:50.640]  you play a gentleman
[59:50.660 --> 59:52.660]  who is trying
[59:52.660 --> 59:54.660]  well you actually play three different characters
[59:54.660 --> 59:56.660]  you play a guy whose son
[59:56.660 --> 59:58.660]  has been kidnapped
[59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.660]  Jason
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.660]  a guy whose son was kidnapped by
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.660]  a serial killer known as the Origami Killer
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.660]  and then you play a woman
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.660]  who is trying to solve the mystery
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.660]  and then one of the actual
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.660]  detectives who is trying to solve the mystery
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.660]  are the three characters
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.660]  yeah she's a journalist
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.660]  and so basically
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.680]  the Origami Killer
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.680]  kidnaps people
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.680]  sounds really bad
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.680]  and then leaves little origami
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.680]  creatures
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.680]  and he only does this when
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.680]  there is a heavy rainstorm
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.680]  and the children are always found basically drowned
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.680]  and so
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.680]  the main guy
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.680]  I don't remember his name
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.680]  but the guy whose son is taken
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.680]  he just gets a little origami creature
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.680]  so he is trying
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.700]  and the person is playing the game
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.700]  with him he is like do you want your son
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.700]  you have to do what I tell you to
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.700]  and like blah blah blah
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.700]  and in one part of the game
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.700]  I guess the biggest part of this game
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.700]  is that it was a Playstation 3
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.700]  game I think and it was when
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.700]  the controller started having
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.700]  controller motion as part of it
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.700]  you had to not only hold your controller
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.700]  but throw your controller
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.700]  to the right and throw your controller to the left
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.700]  and then mash X
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720]  and then mash Y and do that kind of stuff
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.720]  and it was almost like a movie
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.720]  that you were watching
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.720]  very cinematic game
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  there is a scene
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.720]  where you are playing one of the characters
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.720]  and they are getting attacked
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.720]  and you only have a split second
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.720]  to hit the right button
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.720]  and if you hit the button
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.720]  then you successfully defend yourself
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.720]  and block with the attack
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.720]  but if you don't hit the button in the correct way
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.720]  you get attacked
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.740]  and you get injured from that
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.740]  and it has such
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.740]  great replayability
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.740]  because of the almost
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.740]  choose your own adventure
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.740]  part of it
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.740]  I will say it is a horror game
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.740]  so it is not in the genre of people that listen here
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.740]  because there is a part of it
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.740]  where you are the father
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.740]  and you get to the room they want you to get to
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.740]  or whatever
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.740]  and they are like
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.740]  he just hears a voice
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.760]  out of a speaker
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.760]  and it is like thanks for getting here
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760]  you have 5 minutes to cut your pinky off
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.760]  period
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.760]  and then you just have to go through the room
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760]  saw light
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.760]  it is like saw light
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.760]  you have to investigate
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.760]  and find something to do
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.760]  and there is a bunch of different ways to do it
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.760]  and each of those ways impacts
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.760]  your game going forward
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.760]  if you don't cauterize the wound
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.760]  then you are going to have a bad time
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.780]  there are a lot of things that you can use to do it
[01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.780]  but if you don't do it
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.780]  then your son 100% dies
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.780]  and you have to restart
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.780]  that scene
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.780]  sorry I will stop
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.780]  but it was very unique
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.780]  and it was the first game that I had ever played
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.780]  that was like that
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.780]  I am just going to say
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.780]  there isn't a direct sequel
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.780]  but the studio called
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.780]  Quantic Green
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.780]  that made that game
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.800]  there is a handful of other titles
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  that are very similar
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.800]  the ones that followed
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.800]  Heavy Rain
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.800]  you might enjoy because it is similar stuff
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800]  I wouldn't say formulae
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.800]  but you can definitely see a lot of themes and tropes
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.800]  and gimmicks repeated
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800]  especially the choose your own adventure
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.800]  multiple protagonists
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.800]  there is Beyond Two Souls
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.800]  which came out in 2013
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.800]  and Detroit becomes
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.800]  again not direct sequels by any means
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.820]  oh I just realized
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.820]  so I played Heavy Rain on the
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820]  PlayStation
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.820]  but it is actually on
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820]  Steam
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.820]  I didn't know that
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.820]  and you can get Detroit become human
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.820]  and Beyond Two Souls
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.820]  and Heavy Rain in a bundle
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.820]  the sadness trilogy
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.820]  some people have lovingly referred it
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.820]  lovingly being quotes
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.820]  yeah
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.820]  they are
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840]  for better or worse memorable games no doubt
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.840]  yeah they are considered
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840]  psychological action thrillers
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840]  sure
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840]  ok well there you go
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.840]  ok so now to answer the question
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.840]  I had to think about this
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.840]  because there are so many games I like
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.840]  and they have sequels
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840]  I went back to the GameCube
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.840]  because so many of my fondest gaming memories
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.840]  come from there and there are some that
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.840]  I could use some more
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.840]  the first one is
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.860]  oh boy this is
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.860]  a blast from the past have you heard of Billy Hatcher
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.860]  I have not
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.860]  oh gosh so it was a 3D platform
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.860]  on the GameCube
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.860]  it was made by Sonic Team
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.860]  so the actual Sonic people not just Sega
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.860]  and you played as a kid
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.860]  in a chicken suit
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.860]  and you rolled around an egg
[01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:52.860]  and you would make your egg grow
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.860]  and reach the end of the level
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.860]  by rolling around on your egg
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.860]  flying with it and doing all sorts of things
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.880]  very fun, cartoony
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.880]  magical
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.880]  era game from the GameCube
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.880]  it's
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880]  never got a sequel
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.880]  barely gets any recognition
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.880]  from Sonic Team or Sega
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.880]  and I wish I could find memories with that one
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.880]  it has a lot of
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.880]  seven
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.880]  like the ratings are like sevens
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.880]  yeah
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.880]  it would be a sequel for me
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.880]  yeah
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.900]  let's see
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.900]  now there is
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.900]  a game that did get a sequel or two
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.900]  but I don't think not even all of them hit the states
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.900]  but I'd like to see it again
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.900]  it's called Custom Robo
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.900]  it's an arena fighter with robots that you customize
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.900]  as the name implies
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.900]  and so again another GameCube game
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.900]  I got a DS sequel I know that
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.900]  but I don't think it got a proper sequel
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.900]  at least not out here in the states
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.900]  and I'd like to see it
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.900]  a fun robot pretty
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.920]  which is what you get
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.920]  I enjoyed that immensely
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.920]  and then
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.920]  there will be one farming game I will give
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.920]  a Mention 2 sequel
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.920]  I want Sakuna, Rice and Ruin to get a sequel
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.920]  it was just a fantastic game
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.920]  with fantastic characters
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.920]  I just want Sakuna back up
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.920]  well there you go
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.920]  so yeah those are the ones
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.920]  just off the top of my head
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.920]  okay next question
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.920]  from Jordan
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.940]  on a different slack
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.940]  but we reached out to other people just to get questions
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.940]  go ahead
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940]  Jordan asks
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.940]  how loose of a definition is a farming game for you?
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.940]  Cody go ahead
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.940]  yeah so
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.940]  to me
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.940]  for something to classify as a farming game
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.940]  it has to have farming as the principle
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.940]  the main thing that you do in the game
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.940]  or one of the main things
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.940]  it can't just be a game
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.960]  it can't just be a game that has farming in it
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960]  and I know we've definitely done that on the podcast
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.960]  which is why we like
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.960]  switched to cottagecore instead of
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.960]  farming game
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.960]  because I don't think
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.960]  some of the games that we like to do don't really fit the description
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.960]  and like one example here
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960]  that I have is World of Warcraft
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.960]  so World of Warcraft, love that game
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.960]  played it many years in my life
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.960]  many hours go into that game
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.960]  for me
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.960]  and there was farming
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.980]  the Mists of Pandaria expansion that I played
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.980]  so and that was pretty decent
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.980]  farming
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.980]  you had to go back to the same area
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.980]  like 21 days in a row or something like that
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.980]  for one of your things to grow
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.980]  and like water them
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.980]  but just because it had that farming aspect
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.980]  in it, in that expansion
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.980]  I wouldn't call it a farming game
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.980]  for something to be
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.980]  a farming game
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.980]  like farming has to be
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.980]  something, at least something you spend
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  let's say
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  at least 30 or 40% of your time doing
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  what about you?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  I feel like
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  yeah, so that's definitely part of it
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  because Spiritfarer is another good example
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  that there's farming in that game but it's not a farming game
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  per se
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  so I think another
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  easy check mark
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  do you run slash own the farm?
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  I think that's a pretty easy one
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  if you do, you're gonna be busy
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  with it, right?
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.020]  on your plate, so I think that's a pretty
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.020]  easy rule of thumb
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.020]  you own the farm
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020]  are you the farming manager?
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.020]  yeah, and so that
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.020]  that pretty much ties into
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.020]  what you said, the amount of time, right?
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.020]  because lots of games have farming but it's not the focus
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.020]  or it's a little side mini thing
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.020]  but if you run the farm
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.020]  yeah, so last question here is from
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.020]  Namae
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.020]  not only friend of the pod, but
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.020]  also co-host
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.040]  yes, former friend of the show who's been on here
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.040]  yep
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.040]  so would you rather
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.040]  do dailies
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.040]  or organize your inventory?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.040]  you
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.040]  say your answer because I think mine
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040]  is a little more in depth
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040]  so mine, my answer is yes
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040]  because I like
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040]  both of these, I genuinely like doing both of these things
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.040]  I guess
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040]  with the
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.040]  inventory, it depends
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.060]  how I'm doing it
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.060]  or what the console is
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.060]  if I'm doing it
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.060]  with a controller
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.060]  it's kind of annoying to do that
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.060]  and if the inventory management system
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.060]  of the game sucks
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.060]  then I'm not going to have a good time
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:29.060]  but if it's mouse and keyboard
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.060]  I'm fine, that allows me to have
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.060]  enough dexterity to be able to
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.060]  kind of enjoy it
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.060]  but I do, in most games
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.060]  I like my inventory to be a certain way
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.080]  I like
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:43.080]  key items that I might use multiple times
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.080]  are going to be in one area
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.080]  and then I'll put other things in another area
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080]  and
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.080]  items that I'm going to get rid of
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:53.080]  are going to be in another part of my inventory
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080]  so I do really like
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.080]  doing that
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.080]  and I just love dailies
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.080]  again, going back to World of Warcraft
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080]  I had
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.080]  multiple areas that I would go to
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080]  and do dailies
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.100]  and try and get
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.100]  old games
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.100]  sorry, old expansions
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.100]  so even when I was playing Mists of Pandaria
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.100]  I went back to some of the Wrath of the Lich King areas
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.100]  like the Argent tournament grounds
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.100]  because I wanted the pets
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.100]  and the mounts that you could get
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.100]  and you had to do the jousting
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.100]  and the different things like that
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.100]  to get the currency
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.100]  to get the mount
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.100]  and so
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.100]  I think it
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.120]  dailies also depend
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.120]  dailies, if they punish you
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  for missing a day
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.120]  that's upsetting
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120]  so
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  right now I'm trying to learn Spanish on Duolingo
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.120]  and if I
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  lose a streak
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120]  which I have ADHD
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.120]  I'm really busy right now
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.120]  and they give you
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.120]  a couple streak freezes and stuff
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  I had almost
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120]  a 400 day streak
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120]  and then I had some days that were really bad
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.140]  like just mental health bad
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.140]  and I lost it
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.140]  oh I feel that agony
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.140]  and so
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.140]  those kinds of dailies
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.140]  when it's a daily that's going to punish you for missing it
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.140]  not great
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.140]  but if it's something that
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.140]  you can just go and do
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.140]  at your leisure
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.140]  I do enjoy doing those
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.140]  and I enjoy having the repetition
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.140]  but the familiarity
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.140]  oh I'm doing this, I do this every day
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.160]  it's kind of like a blanket
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.160]  like a comfort, comfy thing
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.160]  what about you?
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.160]  dailies or inventory?
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.160]  ok first of all
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.160]  would I rather do them
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.160]  yes depends on the game
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.160]  because there's
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.160]  this varies
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.160]  I pretty much always enjoy organizing my inventory
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.160]  in any game I can
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.160]  there's something very cathartic about it
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.160]  and I don't play steam games
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.160]  that much so I'm mostly on control
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.180]  and I also go through if it's a pain at times
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.180]  just because I find organizing some things
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.180]  in a way that I like
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.180]  or just seeing all the chaos
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.180]  get into nice neat little order lists
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.180]  or boxes or whatever
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.180]  I find it very cathartic
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.180]  now but the real question
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.180]  is the dailies right?
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.180]  so dailies
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.180]  so here's the question I ask myself
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.180]  am I playing the game to do dailies
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.180]  or am I doing dailies because I'm playing the game
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.200]  ok
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.200]  so and I have two different
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.200]  there's
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.200]  because so many games
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200]  like the Duolingo thing for instance
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.200]  they pressure you, they punish you if you don't do it right
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200]  or that's how they're guiding you
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.200]  I feel like Animal Crossing New Horizons
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.200]  like ultimately that game ended up
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.200]  being a game of dailies for me
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.200]  and I wasn't even necessarily enjoying it
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.200]  at some points
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.200]  but I was still doing it just to do the dailies
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.200]  but now I can give
[01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:56.220]  the other example of Pokemon Unite
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.220]  I actually have played that game
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.220]  almost every single day since its release
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.220]  and I don't
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.220]  there are dailies and checklists
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.220]  and objectives or whatever
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.220]  but I'm not playing it to do those
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.220]  like I get them done because I'm playing the game
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.220]  I'm playing the game everyday because I enjoy sitting down with my brother
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.220]  and we enjoy playing three games a day
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.220]  so
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.220]  and it's cool to get the dailies done
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.220]  and yeah I'm getting rewarded because I'm playing everyday
[01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:22.220]  but it's not
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.240]  killing me that I'm
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240]  being pressured to do it or whatever
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.240]  so yeah it really depends on the game
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240]  because
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.240]  some games like Pokemon Unite I'd rather do the dailies
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.240]  because that just means I'm playing the game and I enjoy the game a lot
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.240]  other games like
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.240]  Animal Crossing is a good example
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240]  like
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.240]  well older Animal Crossing
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.240]  I really enjoyed organizing my inventory in those games
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.240]  but dailies
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.240]  I'd enjoy it more than the dailies at times
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.240]  but yes
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.260]  thank you Nami for the question
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.260]  and that is the end of our questions
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.260]  the end of this mailbag episode
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.260]  thank you very much
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.260]  all your listeners and people who sent in those questions
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.260]  please send in more that was some good discussions
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.260]  send us
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.260]  send us some good stuff, send us some nuts
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.260]  some stuff that'll just
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.260]  make us cringe or laugh
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.260]  no, make you guys laugh at us being cringy
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.260]  that's the ideal thing
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.260]  questions that are going to make us get into arguments with each other
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.260]  and have long rivalries
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.280]  yes
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.280]  or make us tell embarrassing stories
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.280]  those are good ones
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  story driven ones
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.280]  those are good ones
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.280]  Cody, where can people find you on the interwebs?

[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320]  of these delightful questions

[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.340]  Cody and I actually recorded one
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.340]  at least at some point in the future
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.340]  it's about
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.340]  other games, not here, it's about the
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.340]  Nintendo Indie Direct
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.340]  so there's actually a whole lot of games
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.340]  and all sorts of
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:00.340]  fun things that we talk about there
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.340]  something I didn't expect, but you can listen to it
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.340]  and find out about that
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.340]  and I think that is an episode
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.340]  thank you very much Cody for being on
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.340]  thank you Al for inviting us on
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.360]  and until next time dear listeners
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.360]  have a good harvest

[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.360]  in this episode
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.360]  and you know what, I was happy with it
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.360]  yeah, she's who I'm going for now
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.360]  in my most recent thing
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.360]  I just went for him
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.360]  because I'm
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.360]  he's an emo boy
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360]  I love me an emo boy
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.360]  oh my gosh
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.360]  I just read something
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360]  a trivia in Sebastian
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.360]  if you're married to Abigail
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360]  and lose heart, she will say
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360]  I wonder if I could have done better
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.360]  I was very good friends with Sebastian before we met
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.380]  he's probably the one
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.380]  but he said
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.380]  the other part of trivia for Sebastian
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.380]  is despite heavy hints that Sebastian has a crush
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:48.380]  on Abigail, his dialogue implies that he rarely
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.380]  wants to spend time with his friends
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.380]  and when he marries you
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:54.380]  he doesn't really want to spend time with you either
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.380]  because he is a bum
