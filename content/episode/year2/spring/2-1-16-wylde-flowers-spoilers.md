# Transcript

[00:00.000 --> 00:28.500]  for watching.
[00:30.400 --> 00:36.480]  Hello fellow members of the coven and welcome to the harvest season where we talk about
[00:37.200 --> 00:44.160]  whatever I want to. I thought this is a very special episode as my name is Kevin and I am the
[00:44.160 --> 00:52.960]  only host today uh here I am Kevin home alone on this uh harvest season farm whatever you want to
[00:52.960 --> 01:01.360]  call it um due to a number of circumstances uh I am doing this episode solo uh one of those
[01:01.360 --> 01:09.760]  circumstances being uh the today's topic uh which will be wildflowers once again um so last time we
[01:09.760 --> 01:17.120]  talked about it we had only done a brief hover we only touched on certain topics and we weren't very
[01:17.120 --> 01:24.480]  far into the game either al or I um I have since beaten the game as I said last week and uh I have
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.280]  a lot more to talk about so today I will be doing a deeper dive and there will of course be spoilers
[01:29.280 --> 01:36.480]  today um but before that there will be plenty of news and other items etc um before I begin that
[01:36.480 --> 01:44.480]  I should note that we do have as always uh transcripts available on the website that is
[01:44.560 --> 01:52.400]  harvestseason.club where you can also find our show notes and links to all the news items etc
[01:52.400 --> 01:58.880]  that will be covered in this episode and uh so with that let's dive on into the news um now the
[01:59.600 --> 02:03.920]  first piece of news I want to talk about is actually related to one of the few things I
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.280]  ended up doing this week that I wanted to talk about which was uh let's build a zoo
[02:07.280 --> 02:12.240]  um I just so happened to see on my steam page that uh it had an update and so of course I updated
[02:12.240 --> 02:20.480]  that and looked right into it and uh it here it is on our news docket the spas excuse me the
[02:20.480 --> 02:26.560]  sloths and spa update uh this is a free update that is already available and uh at least on
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.480]  steam I do not know if it's out for switch already I'll have to look into that but um it introduces
[02:32.480 --> 02:37.760]  sloths into the game which that's wonderful sloths are incredible little critters um I'm
[02:37.760 --> 02:41.360]  amazed they weren't they weren't in the game already um I didn't even realize it
[02:41.920 --> 02:49.680]  um and introduces spas a new mechanic slash feature uh under a uh attractions category
[02:49.680 --> 02:55.360]  um I have not unlocked it yet so I can't really attest to what it's like but it looks to be like
[02:55.360 --> 03:01.760]  a new sort of metric for you to keep track of um in terms of keeping your zoo guests happy etc
[03:01.760 --> 03:08.480]  um but alongside this was a perhaps bigger announcement of the next big expansion for
[03:08.480 --> 03:15.760]  let's build a zoo the aquarium odyssey update uh this is a big update that like dino island
[03:15.760 --> 03:23.040]  dlc seems to be a separate area uh where you can build an aquarium um it's going to introduce over
[03:23.040 --> 03:28.720]  50 new species all sorts of fish and aquatic critters which I am very very very excited for
[03:29.280 --> 03:36.240]  um as for those of you who do not know I grew up along the coast of california my father's
[03:36.240 --> 03:42.000]  discuba dive my uncle used to fish so I spent a lot of time down there by the bay and have a very
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.560]  deep nostalgic fondness for so many of these secrets um so yeah I will definitely be getting
[03:48.560 --> 03:55.440]  that and playing a good bit of it uh it might be worth who knows doing an episode on the future
[03:55.440 --> 04:03.040]  on all this dlc since this has been significant amount of content that has dropped um as as for
[04:03.040 --> 04:09.680]  the date all we know that is coming in 2023 but no specifics beyond that uh but there is a trailer
[04:09.680 --> 04:17.040]  on the steam page uh so go check it out and be excited alongside me now uh next up on our news
[04:17.840 --> 04:24.720]  we it's a game called homestead arcana so we have a release date
[04:25.680 --> 04:34.080]  april 21st which will be just within a few days of uh this episode dropping um about five days
[04:34.080 --> 04:42.560]  from today's recording here um and so there is a steam page with a trailer for you to check out for
[04:43.280 --> 04:50.400]  people who have missed it myself included uh we have here a magic pottagecore game
[04:51.280 --> 04:59.360]  what a what a coincidence huh um so it that said though it actually looks pretty impressive as far
[04:59.360 --> 05:09.440]  as pottagecore type games go um so it is a full 3d with rotating camera bigger sort of scalar
[05:09.440 --> 05:18.880]  scope than wildflowers um and you play character named huckleberry and you grow crops with magic
[05:18.880 --> 05:26.480]  there's crafting you're building your home oh the usual cottage core works um but the selling point
[05:26.480 --> 05:32.720]  or whatever you want to call it is that there is a miasma that you have to deal with that's the
[05:32.720 --> 05:39.520]  primary issue uh now this kind of reminds me of harv stella to a degree but uh you're going into
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.640]  this miasma and trying to reclaim the land from it right you're trying to grow things in it you're
[05:44.640 --> 05:52.800]  trying to find artifacts and recipes etc um there might be combat it was a little unclear from the
[05:52.800 --> 05:57.520]  trailer but there were hints at that as there were creatures being mentioned but i did not
[05:57.520 --> 06:03.360]  see an actual combat um but there is beer and potions and things for you to upgrade as you
[06:03.360 --> 06:11.280]  prepare for trips into miasma so there will be some degree of challenges and obstacles in there so
[06:11.280 --> 06:19.520]  it'll be very interesting to see um overall i'm intrigued by this um the game does have a very
[06:19.520 --> 06:26.000]  nice presentation i think the art style is decent enough i think it's stronger than say wildflowers
[06:26.720 --> 06:34.960]  um but uh like i said it's a full 3d game um which is you know again impressive given the
[06:34.960 --> 06:44.080]  usual fare we have on this show um and perhaps most mind-blowingly uh at least the primary
[06:44.080 --> 06:52.160]  character huckleberry will be voice acted by one yuri lowenthal um for people not familiar with
[06:52.160 --> 06:58.320]  that name that is a very very big name at the voice acting world he has done all sorts of
[06:58.320 --> 07:05.040]  characters uh i think he's been in the persona series and honestly the number one role most
[07:05.040 --> 07:12.640]  notably uh he is sasuke from in our series in the english dub um oh he was also spider-man in the
[07:12.640 --> 07:19.920]  ps4 game so i know al would be excited to hear that um so yeah um and he's also narrating this
[07:19.920 --> 07:26.000]  trailer and he you know he's very good at his craft and very excited um but anyway so all
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.200]  that to say the presentation is very strong so i'll be keeping my eye on this one this game again
[07:31.200 --> 07:39.040]  is called homestead arcana um dropping it just a few days in april 21st it will be on steam and
[07:39.040 --> 07:48.320]  bucks game pass i believe um oh one item i did see just looking at the uh xbox versus windows thing
[07:48.800 --> 07:53.120]  uh the mouse controls seem a little awkward there's like points we have to grab plants and
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.600]  i don't know it just seems a little awkward but that might just be a me thing um overall though
[07:57.600 --> 08:03.200]  very very strong trailer um i suggest you check it out and speaking of things to check out i'll
[08:03.200 --> 08:10.960]  definitely be checking this one out uh fable them is the next item on our list here and as of last
[08:10.960 --> 08:18.560]  thursday april was it sorry april 13th i believe yes thursday april 13th this game is now
[08:18.560 --> 08:25.520]  available for early access on the steam page uh for 20 dollars i'm sorry 16 dollars
[08:26.720 --> 08:33.520]  yes um i apologize i am looking at the price um anyways uh i'm having difficulty because it's
[08:33.520 --> 08:40.160]  actually on sale for 10 off right now in these first seven days um luckily by the time this
[08:40.160 --> 08:44.800]  episode releases you will still have a couple of days to check it out if you like to to get that
[08:44.800 --> 08:53.440]  early access um now for people who may not remember how fable them is this village builder i
[08:53.440 --> 08:59.840]  would call um where you're you know kind of like the civilization or actually i say i haven't
[08:59.840 --> 09:04.640]  played civilization where you're just trying to build this village i mean you're kind of overseeing
[09:04.640 --> 09:12.640]  it um now i think we talked about this with al last time um where it's really focused on like
[09:12.640 --> 09:17.680]  village rustic lifestyles you're not going so far as to progressing to cities and whatnot
[09:18.320 --> 09:24.800]  um i think the art style is very cute it's 3d very looks very nice the art style reminds me of uh
[09:24.800 --> 09:33.120]  overcooked if you people are familiar with it um the characters uh one of the primary little
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.040]  characters they show on this has a mustache that reminds me a lot of the onion king um anyways i
[09:39.040 --> 09:45.280]  look think it looks nice um and i like seeing the villagers interacting with the actual village and
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.840]  helping build it so i am looking forward to it very much let's see there's also a flying pig
[09:52.480 --> 10:00.240]  on the title image or whatever you want to call it um and i i don't know what that is about that
[10:00.240 --> 10:07.680]  but uh flying pigs excite me um so yeah that again that is already out for early access and
[10:07.680 --> 10:16.720]  you have just until uh thursday whatever date that is seven days after the 13 uh april 20th i guess
[10:16.720 --> 10:24.320]  uh to get the 10 off on that early access now uh for another game that uh i don't know if it's
[10:24.320 --> 10:30.960]  doing early access but our next item is koa and the five pirates let me make sure i got that name
[10:30.960 --> 10:38.640]  correctly correct excuse me oh yes come on the five pirates will be launching about excuse me
[10:38.640 --> 10:44.720]  the kickstarter will be launching on may 4th um there's not much to go off because the kickstart
[10:44.720 --> 10:52.320]  hasn't launched but this is the next entry in the chibi games universe right uh koa is the
[10:52.320 --> 10:59.920]  protagonist from summer and mara if i recall correctly um and you know they did encora and
[10:59.920 --> 11:06.960]  alt and is it violent i forget the name of that i apologize but the point being uh we've covered
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.240]  a lot of those games here and they've been all over the place so it will be interesting to see
[11:12.800 --> 11:19.200]  absolutely um and so again that is may 4th and just a few weeks we'll have the kickstarter and
[11:19.200 --> 11:25.040]  definitely have more information than uh something else that we have information and a lot more
[11:25.040 --> 11:37.760]  information is cult of the lamb a cult classic playing off myself here folks um so we have a
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.600]  big update coming soon and it is free it is called relics of the old faith it is
[11:45.600 --> 11:53.360]  a whole new post game story slash campaign there is a lot new really it feels like
[11:53.360 --> 12:00.400]  a little bit of everything new enemies new dungeons new bosses etc etc new abilities um
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.480]  so on the tweet uh twitter thread that where they talk about it one of the items they note
[12:06.480 --> 12:13.040]  is some of the feedback they asked for was uh or that fans asked for was more depth to the
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.440]  battle system a little more challenge and so that seems to be a lot of the focus um
[12:18.400 --> 12:26.080]  so this storyline has you listening to some other odd featured deity thing um
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.040]  the trailer shows a lot only little bits of it right so you just get just the taste of what's
[12:33.040 --> 12:40.560]  coming but overall it looks very very hefty and again this is a free update uh no bait they're
[12:40.560 --> 12:48.640]  working on this and they put the final touches i believe um and i don't know if that includes
[12:48.640 --> 12:57.600]  let me check switch i wager that might be a little delayed uh yeah no i am uh it doesn't specify but
[12:58.160 --> 13:03.200]  uh keep an eye out because that update will be coming hopefully soon and honestly give me a
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.680]  reason to get back in because i've been thinking about cult of the lamb it's a great game i want
[13:07.680 --> 13:12.560]  to see the polish on it and just seeing more for free is is just absolutely wonderful what a great
[13:12.560 --> 13:20.560]  what a great game uh let's see here and our final item on the news list here ooblets another update
[13:21.120 --> 13:30.080]  um we know two things primarily first we are getting a spring event in ooblets
[13:31.040 --> 13:41.360]  uh i don't know if we have a date yet uh the one thing that is rather clear is that it looks like
[13:41.360 --> 13:49.120]  a bunny uh which sure spring easter it makes sense um that said though i think it's a little
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.800]  tough because i still think the king of easter events is zipperty and of course you can't compete
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.040]  with that um but that's it go check it out there's a little teaser trailer showing the
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.880]  silhouette of this new ooblet um for you fans i'm hopeful it's good for you uh and you guys
[14:04.880 --> 14:11.840]  are excited but uh yeah no no other information other than that right now okay and that more or
[14:11.840 --> 14:18.240]  less covers the news for today a little lighter today since it's just me um i know some of the
[14:18.240 --> 14:26.960]  other news items will be uh moved to next week's episode um which uh i know at least there's one
[14:26.960 --> 14:33.200]  game i'm very excited to talk about um and spencer if you're listening you know exactly
[14:33.200 --> 14:40.880]  what it is um anyways uh oh before i get into the primary topic since some people might want to
[14:40.880 --> 14:47.840]  talk about the spoilers i want to uh just announce one important item that uh next week's episode as
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.280]  of right now we are planning a mailbag episode i know we've been talking about and we've gotten
[14:53.280 --> 15:00.720]  a few questions um but uh next week we will be dedicating a good amount of the episode to that so
[15:00.720 --> 15:06.400]  uh please if you're in the slack feel free to drop questions in the feedback and questions
[15:07.200 --> 15:14.320]  or thread or reach out to al via twitter versus the email all the usual links and places you can
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.160]  find in the harvest season and drop as many questions as you'd like because uh i know
[15:21.040 --> 15:24.800]  it's gonna be fun to see what the hosts have to say about it
[15:24.800 --> 15:32.000]  who will be on it i will not say it's me um i as of right now at least i'm planning to be on it
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.680]  along with one other person who i will uh let that be a surprise um anyways so yeah keep that
[15:39.680 --> 15:48.080]  in mind for next week and now with uh that little announcement out of the way let's uh dive right on
[15:48.080 --> 15:55.360]  into the main topic which is me talking about how much i love wild flowers all right this is uh
[15:56.080 --> 16:02.080]  i this is a spoiler alarm i'm going to try to ease into the spoilers so you know
[16:03.680 --> 16:11.280]  your mileage may vary on how much you want to hear or not um i will not be i will not be
[16:11.280 --> 16:17.360]  covering the most like blatant end game spoilers right because there's mysteries and some questions
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.200]  and i won't be covering every nook and cranny i believe some stuff for people to to explore and
[16:23.200 --> 16:32.080]  enjoy on their own um but there is plenty to talk about on this story which i think might attract
[16:32.080 --> 16:39.120]  people to this game which i bring can't uh suggest enough of it's already an amazing game like even
[16:39.120 --> 16:47.040]  just knowing the core mechanics and such um but yes so again once again here is your spoiler warning
[16:47.840 --> 16:55.040]  everything will be spoiled but i am planning to cover the gist of the plot um as it's pretty
[16:55.040 --> 17:02.400]  jam-packed um which again one of the i think most amazing things about this game is that we have a
[17:02.400 --> 17:10.000]  sort of bonafide story um not often the case in these cottage core type games that we often cover
[17:10.000 --> 17:18.240]  here um and so let's uh so to begin this i i think i'm just gonna have to kind of go
[17:19.440 --> 17:25.680]  chronologically because this game takes the story you hit credits after your quote-unquote
[17:25.680 --> 17:33.520]  one-year anniversary of uh terra wild moving into the uh into the uh gosh fair haven excuse me the
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.680]  town of fair haven um oh once again if you want to hear we al and i did an episode i think about
[17:39.680 --> 17:44.240]  two weeks ago covering this game if you want to hear the general mechanics and things like that
[17:44.240 --> 17:50.000]  i suggest to go give it a listen first um it's it's absolutely fantastic and i won't cover too
[17:50.000 --> 17:59.840]  much of that um but anyway so yeah so uh the game you open in spring where you the well terra wild
[17:59.840 --> 18:06.720]  you playing as terra wild move into this town called fair haven um and you'll meet your
[18:06.720 --> 18:17.040]  grandmother hazel wild um that's wild with a y and uh she and so she introduces you to the
[18:17.040 --> 18:24.320]  farm that she runs she is getting in on her age and terra has decided to uh start a new life
[18:24.320 --> 18:32.240]  as uh she had a rough time she lost her job recently and she uh had a fiance who broke
[18:32.240 --> 18:37.600]  off the engagement so you know that's a pretty rough start and it makes a lot of sense to go
[18:37.600 --> 18:44.880]  help your aging grandmother run enough harm uh it's a it's a pretty win-win situation for her
[18:44.880 --> 18:51.840]  at least given her circumstances um and so you start off the game you know as so often these
[18:51.840 --> 19:00.240]  games though learning about the farm learning the town right and this town it is full of so
[19:00.240 --> 19:07.360]  many characters um i am considering doing a separate section on the characters i am
[19:08.000 --> 19:13.840]  still debating that at the moment um but uh i will keep that in a separate section
[19:14.720 --> 19:20.160]  but uh anyways i digress um and so in meeting these various characters you also
[19:21.360 --> 19:28.720]  meet some people with masks and robes and these are the witches of fair haven which of course it
[19:28.720 --> 19:36.720]  turns out hazel is a member of and hazel introduces hera to the coven um she's initiated into the
[19:36.720 --> 19:41.760]  coven and so she starts to learn this kind of balance between this farm that she has to run
[19:41.760 --> 19:48.800]  and uh these responsibilities as a witch uh because it turns out they play a pretty pivotal
[19:48.800 --> 19:54.960]  role in fair haven they control the weather and the seasons um pretty pretty thingy all things
[19:54.960 --> 20:01.360]  considered um and so in doing that first ritual to change the seasons from spring to summer
[20:01.360 --> 20:07.840]  this is our first big story point as our grandma hazel actually passes away
[20:08.720 --> 20:16.400]  um kind of a big deal at the start of the game i was strongly you you strongly see that
[20:16.960 --> 20:22.320]  from the beginning that she's really really having a rough time she's on medications etc
[20:22.320 --> 20:26.240]  um but i didn't expect it like just after that first season that she would passed away
[20:26.800 --> 20:31.200]  um but given that uh terra is now fully in charge of the farm so
[20:31.920 --> 20:40.080]  uh come summer that's a lot of responsibility on her shoulders etc and so summer you get into
[20:40.080 --> 20:48.960]  the rhythm of the barn etc and you actually meet a few new characters in summer some people who
[20:49.680 --> 20:58.960]  move in um one of them is uh geva a meteorologist who lives kind of out in the mountains to study
[20:59.600 --> 21:07.920]  and the more no well let's say central to the plot character a rancher by the name of marty um
[21:09.040 --> 21:14.320]  now off of that you can see marty has some questionable history as it's already implied
[21:14.320 --> 21:23.600]  he's using a false surname um but uh moving into the town also opens up your ability to get
[21:23.600 --> 21:30.320]  animals on which is you know pretty core part of any farming game uh but i digress um during the
[21:30.320 --> 21:37.200]  summer season uh there's a the kind of the end note for the summer season is this summer festival
[21:37.920 --> 21:42.480]  where uh terra is of course crowned the summer queen i forget the exact title but
[21:43.200 --> 21:50.240]  at this moment during this festival she's accidentally transported to a new location
[21:51.520 --> 21:59.760]  kind of in fairhaven it's called ravenwood hollow and it is this magical forest area with
[21:59.760 --> 22:11.760]  magical inhabitants um we're talking a fairy a werewolf a gnome her etc uh and uh
[22:12.480 --> 22:20.880]  so right like this is halfway point of the year and the status quo has changed pretty significantly
[22:20.880 --> 22:26.640]  right you can see okay there's a lot more to this game um it's it i think it was a really well
[22:26.640 --> 22:32.080]  placed move and just really as someone who had already been enjoying it at that point just
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.840]  really hooked me and like i wanted to see what was going on now because clearly
[22:35.840 --> 22:44.320]  there was a lot more to explore um let's see here and i apologize okay and so after
[22:45.680 --> 22:52.720]  this summer festival um an interesting event well circumstance occurs let's say
[22:53.280 --> 22:58.800]  right because once again as part of the coven you have to change the seasons but now you actually
[22:58.800 --> 23:04.960]  have some pressure to change it because after the summer festival a drought kicks in and this
[23:04.960 --> 23:11.600]  actually starts affecting the gameplay you will run out of water in your well certain shops can't
[23:11.600 --> 23:18.400]  function etc you actually have a bit of pressure to change the seasons because it costs you if you
[23:18.400 --> 23:24.800]  don't right and so you uh right you put in that effort and once you actually do change the seasons
[23:24.800 --> 23:31.440]  enters the next chapter which is fall now fall is where the story really starts to gain traction
[23:32.080 --> 23:38.800]  um the i think the first event that happens right away in fall is the announcement of an election
[23:39.520 --> 23:46.800]  um which is really surprised me because there the mayor in this town uh his name is auto
[23:47.520 --> 23:56.400]  uh a very mayoral type let's say um and it didn't even occur to me that there would possibly a change
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.600]  in the status quo um and it just so happens that marty the aforementioned rancher is the one
[24:01.600 --> 24:09.440]  running against him um and so uh that's when uh as i said this is when the story starts to pick
[24:09.440 --> 24:12.960]  up because the town life becomes a little more interesting a little more dynamic with the
[24:12.960 --> 24:20.240]  selection and also with the introduction of raven one hollow the magic uh inhabitants etc you learn
[24:20.240 --> 24:25.200]  a bit more from that side as well right and some of the history of the coven and some of the
[24:25.200 --> 24:30.160]  lingering issues right uh one of the key elements from the beginning of the game is
[24:31.120 --> 24:36.400]  hazel wanting to unite the town's people with the coven who are hiding in the shadows and so
[24:36.400 --> 24:43.280]  you start digging into that issue a little more now uh i i will say with the election i was
[24:44.880 --> 24:51.120]  unfortunately disappointed because you do vote in it but you can't actually affect the outcome um
[24:51.200 --> 25:00.160]  much to my disappointment um auto will retain uh the title as mayor which is uh actually still
[25:01.120 --> 25:05.360]  it's a little disappointing but it makes sense because it is pivotal to the story later on
[25:05.360 --> 25:13.440]  um i digress um but with mayor with mayor auto having hit one reelection he
[25:13.920 --> 25:23.360]  the story starts going in an unexpected direction as there's how should i put this it starts really
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.960]  you can start seeing the some conflicts arising in the town regular town's life um right and it
[25:30.960 --> 25:35.920]  begins with this program he calls the neighborhood watch as some people have started to take notice
[25:35.920 --> 25:42.720]  of some of the questionable people in the forest at night you know implicating the coven
[25:43.360 --> 25:51.920]  the witches etc right and so this leads to actual bona fide witch trials as neighbors start accusing
[25:51.920 --> 26:00.400]  each other of being witches etc um it's very dramatic for this type of game to be quite frank
[26:00.400 --> 26:08.160]  like emotions are in high i got terribly upset at certain people and so on and so forth they just
[26:08.640 --> 26:16.240]  the trails and treacheries um there is a bit more to it that plan a bit into the details again not
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.000]  trying to spoil every single item but there is again being this town being so linked to this
[26:22.000 --> 26:30.240]  magical world right there's some impacts from that side of it as well and as a member of the coven
[26:30.240 --> 26:38.240]  terra has to address those issues and and resolve the unfortunate magical implications going on
[26:40.000 --> 26:48.320]  and this is all tying into issues from the magical world itself which is suffering sort of imbalance
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.240]  there's an item called the wellspring which is the source of magic and has to be replenished
[26:56.240 --> 27:02.720]  and kept in balance and as that is suffering from balance issues it's leaking over into these
[27:02.720 --> 27:12.400]  witch trials and the life of the townspeople etc um so a lot of the fall season is spent with this
[27:12.400 --> 27:20.640]  setup of them right you know leading up to the primary conflict the kendo the climax right um
[27:20.640 --> 27:28.480]  and so during this time you do move over to winter the final season which actually is a
[27:28.480 --> 27:33.520]  fairly sizable season compared to the others that felt like um because again there's some
[27:33.520 --> 27:40.640]  more witch trials and the whole issue with the uh the wellspring and the balance of magic on
[27:40.640 --> 27:48.800]  the island comes kind of to a head um as there is a another masked witch not part of the coven
[27:48.800 --> 27:55.680]  that's discovered that is running around right and so this becomes a central issue and all leads
[27:55.680 --> 28:02.080]  to this climactic conflict at the end of the game which uh again i'm not going into details here but
[28:02.720 --> 28:10.800]  was quite a finale to be honest it went places i didn't expect they were again betrayals treachery
[28:10.800 --> 28:19.280]  and then just a really big finale sort of final sequence um and it's it's just so interesting to
[28:19.280 --> 28:26.400]  see in this kind of game uh attempt that right because this isn't a pulitzer prize winning story
[28:26.400 --> 28:32.320]  right it's it's not it's strong suit you know looking in the general video game world there's
[28:32.320 --> 28:39.040]  much better stories and so on but in a farming cottagecore game like this stands out for sure
[28:39.840 --> 28:47.200]  um i enjoyed parts of it absolutely it was maybe predictable or you know not
[28:48.320 --> 28:55.520]  really um treading new ground etc but overall i enjoyed it right and and so much of it comes from
[28:55.520 --> 29:01.600]  the characters right the the dialogue the personalities which are all really really well
[29:02.160 --> 29:10.480]  um and so uh yeah so i i was still engaged even if it felt maybe weak or you know
[29:12.400 --> 29:18.560]  standard story whatever you want to call it right um but i i was still engaged throughout the whole
[29:18.560 --> 29:24.960]  way and genuinely interested in seeing where things went um and it's why should i put this
[29:25.040 --> 29:32.400]  one of the interesting aspects that i think i think it's pretty clear that a lot of the themes
[29:32.400 --> 29:40.000]  are very reflective of relatively current events at least in the us here right the election the
[29:40.000 --> 29:48.560]  witch trials i think are very reflective of uh you know not getting into specifics but real world
[29:48.560 --> 29:55.280]  issues that at least here in america we've had to deal with um in recent years let's say right um
[29:56.000 --> 30:04.480]  the polarization of people and these conflicts that arise from that like yeah right they're
[30:04.480 --> 30:13.200]  using witches and in malcolm says stand-ins for several groups i think um which again it's not
[30:13.200 --> 30:18.080]  particularly deep because i think it's a little a little clear where's it a little on sleeve
[30:19.040 --> 30:24.080]  you know again for a farming game this is this is death right we don't see that in farming games so
[30:24.080 --> 30:33.200]  it's it's really fun to actually be able to see and think about that um so with that said um i
[30:33.200 --> 30:38.960]  think i'm trying to think what other items need to be addressed um right because as you're
[30:38.960 --> 30:44.000]  progressing through the story you're constantly unlocking more mechanics and locations and things
[30:44.000 --> 30:49.040]  like that um right when you as i mentioned give this meteorologist lives out and kind of like the
[30:49.040 --> 30:55.840]  mountain area that's a whole new area you have to unlock um and a whole bunch of new resources and
[30:55.840 --> 31:02.320]  things to see right as you progress relationships with a village or you know towns people and what
[31:02.320 --> 31:06.240]  not you unlock different facilities different things right there's the mine and there's
[31:06.880 --> 31:11.200]  a whole little backstory with the mind too and learning about that is interesting
[31:13.280 --> 31:20.080]  seeing again these conflicts of people being accused and sometimes unintentionally or or
[31:20.080 --> 31:24.160]  well i don't know if unintentionally is the right way but again as people try to repair
[31:24.160 --> 31:30.240]  relationships and and how these story events actually affect the daily routines that you see
[31:30.240 --> 31:35.120]  the accounts people go through and and doing and whatnot affecting their moods right some
[31:35.600 --> 31:39.840]  characters won't be smiling during certain times right certain characters will
[31:39.840 --> 31:50.400]  avoid certain locations etc um so it's all again none of this is i think mind-blowing or or maybe
[31:50.400 --> 31:56.400]  not super notable in the grand scheme of things but for a farming game you know the type of
[31:56.400 --> 32:04.000]  content we cover on this podcast it's really really impressive to see and and well done i
[32:04.000 --> 32:10.560]  don't think any of it was really bad maybe a little weak a little meh at times then you know
[32:10.560 --> 32:21.920]  your mileage will vary um but i enjoyed it um and so yeah i think with that said really the uh
[32:22.720 --> 32:28.400]  i think that more or less covers all i really want to talk about for this game um again that's
[32:29.360 --> 32:36.880]  not covering a lot of more specific spoilers i think i think i did an okay job of leaving out
[32:36.880 --> 32:45.920]  a lot of these answers and questions um so i i really invite you to play this game um right
[32:45.920 --> 32:51.120]  because all this talk was primarily story but if you listen back to the other episode there is
[32:51.840 --> 32:58.320]  so much um in regards to the uh to the mechanics and just the gameplay which is all super enjoyable
[32:59.280 --> 33:06.240]  um so i cannot recommend wildflowers enough it is a wonderful wonderful game and so uh yeah thank
[33:06.240 --> 33:12.800]  you very much dear listener for uh entertaining this talk about wildflowers again um there's you
[33:12.800 --> 33:17.120]  know more content coming out i don't know if there'll be more story it would be kind of nice
[33:17.120 --> 33:22.400]  to see because i think there are some some things you could go some directions you could work with
[33:22.400 --> 33:31.360]  um but i will probably be bringing up this game as stuff comes and goes um but until then um
