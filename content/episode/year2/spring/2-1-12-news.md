[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  ðŸŽµMusicðŸŽµ
[00:30.500 --> 00:35.000]  Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  My name is Al.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.000]  I'm Kevin.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  And we're here today to talk about so many clones of Stardew Valley.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  Hahahaha!
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Ain't that the truth.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  Oh, yeah.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  We're here to do a news episode, folks, and Al hit it on the head.
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  I think there is there is there's definitely some stuff in here that's going to be really interesting to talk about and eventually play.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:05.000 --> 01:14.000]  But yeah, there's I think I think this episode is going to be the perfect example of everybody being inspired by Stardew Valley, but not really taking it anywhere.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  But we'll get we'll get we'll get to that.
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  So as I'm trying to do early on in the podcast, just to let people know, transcripts will be available in the show notes and on the website.
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  So there you go.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  Yeah, as Kevin mentioned, this is going to be a bumper news episode.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  We have so much news.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  I was worried because we had an episode that was was delayed from this weekend and I was like, oh, what are we going to do?
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  And then I looked at all the news and went, I think we're fine.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  I think we have enough news to fill, fill, fill, fill an episode.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  And it became even more.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  And then, oh, no, it's too much.
[01:50.000 --> 01:52.000]  It just kept coming.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  There was a point when I posted on Slack and said, I think I think this was a good week to do this because we have 13 news news things.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  And then, yeah, there were more the next day.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  I still haven't gone through them all. Full disclosure.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  That's all good. Most of them don't matter.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  That's me hyping people up for the episode.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  However, first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
[02:19.000 --> 02:30.000]  Oh, I'm so busy with life, but on the little bits of non-work and furniture moving things I have actually gotten to.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  I have done a lot of my usual mobiles, whatnot.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  One I want to talk about real quick is Masters, Pokemon Masters.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  I don't know if you keep up with it, Al, but recently they came out with...
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  It is like fan fiction, but official.
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.000]  Yeah! The canon, not canon game. It's great.
[02:56.000 --> 03:08.000]  I don't know if you saw, they did a release with some of the Galar trainers, Marnie, Hop and Bede with the Galarian birds.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  And they look amazing. I've been pulling for Marnie, haven't gotten her yet.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  But forget that, because breaking news just today. Ball Guy is coming to Masters.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  I saw that. That is very odd.
[03:22.000 --> 03:31.000]  But, I mean, there are weirder things. I'm not going to complain. Maybe this is the thing that pulls me back in again. Who knows?
[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  But the question to me is, what Pokemon is he going to have? Is he going to be a Voltorb? An Electro?
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Or is it just going to be Ball Guy?
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  I bet. Have we had a Hisuian Voltorb yet?
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  No, actually they haven't touched Hisui at all.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  Could be that. I mean, I know he's known for Galar, but could be Hisuian Voltorb.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  I just wish it were Ball Guy on the field himself.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  That would be very funny.
[04:04.000 --> 04:18.000]  That's Masters. I have been booted up again Octopath Traveler. I recently got the sequel Octopath Traveler 2 and decided I should go back and finish the first one.
[04:19.000 --> 04:29.000]  For people unfamiliar, it's a Square Enix RPG. It's a very beautiful 2.5D pixel game.
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  They're 2D pixel sprites, but they stand out like a pop-out book, and the backgrounds do too.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  Can we just call it Paper Mario-esque?
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  Yeah, sure. Pixel Paper Mario.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  I hate 2.5D. It's such a stupid term. Do you get 4DX in the cinemas?
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  No, at least I don't watch it. That's too rich for my blood.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  No, but you get it in America, right? It's a thing that exists.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Probably. I don't pay attention.
[04:57.000 --> 05:04.000]  It's like 4DX. Every film is 4D, because they all have time. It's not just a picture. That's why they have four dimensions.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  People just love to use the dimension word like they don't understand what it is, because they don't.
[05:12.000 --> 05:21.000]  You say that, but we'll get to your week in a bit. You've been playing some Kirby, and boy is that some 2.5D.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000]  Anyway, Octopath.
[05:25.000 --> 05:40.000]  Yes, Octopath. It's an RPG. It's very traditional, classic. You have a party of eight people, you have four in a battle, you swap them out,
[05:40.000 --> 05:49.000]  and they have roles and classes, and you can do a second job in second class, and you have items, and it's turn-based combat.
[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  It's just all this great, comfort, classic RPG stuff, like the old Final Fantasies that Square Enix used to make.
[05:58.000 --> 06:03.000]  It's very comforting, very, very good, very well-polished, fantastic music, fantastic visuals.
[06:03.000 --> 06:15.000]  The biggest flaw in Octopath Traveler is that, despite the name, the eight characters barely interact with each other. It's just eight separate stories, which is bizarre.
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.000]  Eight-path, not Octopath. Because Octo implies that they're separate, but they'll converge at some point.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  Something like that. From what I've read, it's very in the background how they converge, but by and large they're just eight separate stories.
[06:32.000 --> 06:42.000]  It's weird because they're traveling with each other, and there'd be scenarios where having a thief would probably help in this situation, or having a warrior, whatever.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  But, I say that I have heard Octopath 2 fixes this mistake, which will be exciting to see.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  So I've progressed through that, and it's good fun.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  Other than that, I have dipped my toes back into Scarlet, well, I say that as if I've stopped.
[07:00.000 --> 07:07.000]  Scarlet and Violet, but in particular, I finally got into competitive battling last weekend, I think it was.
[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  There was their first online tournament, Althea Prologue. It was a lot of fun.
[07:15.000 --> 07:30.000]  I am someone who enjoys competitive Pokemon battling, and the early year, the first year of the game, is usually a lot of fun because they don't introduce all the broken legendaries and stuff, so people have weird teams with all sorts of wacky Pokemon.
[07:30.000 --> 07:46.000]  And yeah, it was great fun. It's cool to see all the new Pokemon. Goldengo is ridiculous, Fluttermane is kind of ridiculous, but I saw a wide variety of stuff, so that always makes you super happy.
[07:47.000 --> 08:05.000]  Preparing your building up your in-game team for competitive is easier in some regards, but also they took a few steps back, and some other ones, and I'm not going to get into the details, but it just feels emblematic of the whole game.
[08:06.000 --> 08:12.000]  Two steps forward, two steps back, but in a different direction.
[08:13.000 --> 08:20.000]  So that's really what I've been up to, game-wise and whatnot. What about you Al, what have you been up to?
[08:21.000 --> 08:37.000]  Just to quickly touch on the competitive Pokemon aspect, I've never been a huge Pokemon competitive player, but let me tell you, see when I went to Worlds last year, it was incredible to actually watch, like in a crowd, watching games.
[08:37.000 --> 08:56.000]  Just so good. If you ever get the chance to go to a competitive Pokemon tournament, obviously Worlds would be the best, but I'm guessing the regionals could be just as good depending on the matchups. Just incredible.
[08:56.000 --> 09:15.000]  I honestly, full disclosure, I haven't been to a regionals. I don't know if they have the screens like they do at Worlds, because Worlds is definitely much more of a spectator event. They put up the store, and they have decorations and whatnot.
[09:15.000 --> 09:36.000]  Worlds is fantastic. If you're a Pokemon fan, I suggest you go to it. It's the closest thing you'll get to a PokemonCon. But I don't know if they have screens on regionals. They will stream the games and have commentators. But yes, it is very enjoyable to see the gameplay between them. Two people know what they're doing. It's very, very enjoyable, I agree.
[09:37.000 --> 09:54.000]  You don't have to know a huge amount to know when something good has happened as well. So just seeing the crowd and hearing everyone go, whoa! Like when someone's protect fails, or someone gets frozen, or just one of these low percentage chance things happen.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  You can definitely feel those moments.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  Or someone switches out the perfect switch out or something like that. It's amazing.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.000]  They take down one dude on the first turn with a double attack.
[10:08.000 --> 10:28.000]  And the best thing about Worlds was on the Sunday we went in nice and early and we saw the Unite and then we saw the TCG and the VGC as well. It was great seeing the different kinds as well. There were just so many people there. So much hype.
[10:28.000 --> 10:40.000]  Obviously I didn't go to the one in London. It was a bit far for me. But the last one I went to pre-Covid, they still had Pokken going.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  That one was probably the hypest to see.
[10:44.000 --> 11:00.000]  They did it in London as well. It was really good. They didn't have it on the main stage except for the finals. They had that on the Saturday. The Pokken was very fun to watch as well. I'm really sad that they've finished that. That was really good to watch.
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.000]  They should probably do a Pokken too so we can get new Pokken and whatnot.
[11:06.000 --> 11:20.000]  They could have just kept it going. It didn't feel like there was too much at Worlds. It felt like it was good enough. Maybe it's too much money for them to run that or whatever but I thought it was great.
[11:20.000 --> 11:27.000]  The community around Pokken is so tight-knit. Everyone is cheering for each other and stuff like that. It was really good.
[11:28.000 --> 11:40.000]  Anyway, what I've been playing. As you stole my thunder, I've been playing Kirby Return to Dreamland DX. So I have finished the main story for that.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  DX is for 2.5D, 2.5DX.
[11:45.000 --> 11:55.000]  It's really good. It's only the second Kirby game I've played because I played Forgotten Land, the 3D one from last year and then I played this one.
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  This is a traditional one. What are your thoughts?
[11:59.000 --> 12:10.000]  I really liked it. It's obviously quite different being in 2D rather than 3D. It's funny me coming at this from this way around because everyone else last year got the other way around going from 2D to 3D.
[12:11.000 --> 12:22.000]  It feels similar. I can see why when Forgotten Land came out, people went, oh yeah, this is a 3D Kirby game. They don't feel like different games.
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  It's hard to explain other than it feels like Kirby but in different number of dimensions.
[12:30.000 --> 12:40.000]  I can absolutely see that they did clearly the jump from 2D to 3D really well. I've been really enjoying Return to Dreamland.
[12:40.000 --> 12:50.000]  I will probably play some of the older ones but the problem with this is that this is obviously really good. I suspect it's not going to be the same going back to the older ones.
[12:51.000 --> 13:03.000]  I'm going to let you in on a little secret. There aren't any bad Kirby games. There's maybe some meh ones but I think most Kirby fans agree there are almost no actually bad ones.
[13:03.000 --> 13:12.000]  Of course that's the taste. I think you enjoy the latest and greatest usually so maybe going back will be a bit harder.
[13:12.000 --> 13:26.000]  I think it depends. When I played the 2D Zeldas, I liked the 2D Zeldas. Obviously there were issues with the first few of them in terms of quality of life and stuff like that but I still enjoyed playing them. The 3D Zeldas not so much.
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.000]  The Kirby DNA is very strong and present in each game so once you have a taste of it, I think you'll have a good idea.
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  Does the physics feel quite similar between different games?
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  Close enough. I can't think of any egregious ones that I can think of.
[13:45.000 --> 13:54.000]  That feels like the biggest thing to me with Kirby is the physics. If you don't float the way you expect to float, then that's where problems come in.
[13:54.000 --> 14:05.000]  Obviously that improves. The first Kirby will feel a bit different or whatever but in general it's close enough. You can feel that DNA.
[14:06.000 --> 14:13.000]  I haven't played Return to Dream Land in a hot minute. I played the original briefly. I didn't even finish it.
[14:13.000 --> 14:25.000]  It's called Return to Dream Land because it was also like the return to Kirby in general. There had been a very big blow in Kirby games at that point.
[14:26.000 --> 14:37.000]  There were a lot of updates with their abilities and copy abilities and whatnot. The remake added a few which is a big deal for a Kirby game.
[14:37.000 --> 14:51.000]  There are so many things you can do with any of them. If you want to get this specific collectible you have to use the fire one to melt these blocks.
[14:52.000 --> 14:59.000]  Most of the time you can choose your favourite one and just go through most of the game with it. Assuming you don't lose it obviously.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  I really like that there's a mech suit one. I don't know if that's a new one or not.
[15:06.000 --> 15:15.000]  It feels a little bit overpowerful but it's so much fun. Instead of jumping and floating you have a jetpack on the mech suit.
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  You just smoothly move up like a jetpack. It's so much fun.
[15:20.000 --> 15:32.000]  That's awesome. Return to Dream Land. Like Forgotten World, the copy abilities because of the whole new 3D thing were really stripped down.
[15:32.000 --> 15:40.000]  With Fire Kirby you breathe fire. That's kind of how Kirby originally started. When you had Fire Kirby you just breathe fire.
[15:40.000 --> 15:47.000]  But starting with Return to Dream Land they really started building on top of them where each ability had their own move set and it's fantastic.
[15:47.000 --> 15:58.000]  There's loads of moves. You've got the standing still pressing a button, you've got the moving and pressing a button, you've got the pressing down if you're in the air, pressing down if you're on the ground, pressing up.
[15:58.000 --> 16:07.000]  It's loads of different moves with the same ability which feels like there's lots of choice in the combat.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  I'm glad you like it.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  It's been good fun. I've done the main story of that. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do now in the game.
[16:16.000 --> 16:26.000]  There's an extras part of the story and there's a new epilogue as well. I will probably do them. We'll see.
[16:26.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm not going to get 100% it because there's a missions part of it that's like do a level like this. Wear a mask and carry this random item.
[16:36.000 --> 16:46.000]  You have to do 100 of them to get 100%. I'm not doing these 100 random challenges which is like attach this thing to yourself and then play a level.
[16:46.000 --> 16:54.000]  I'm not doing that. That's not fun. So I'm not going to 100% this game but I will do the 3 main things at least probably.
[16:54.000 --> 17:07.000]  I listened to the epilogue because that one is interesting both as a gameplay and from the 1% of people who care about Kirby Lauren's story. That one's fascinating.
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  Good stuff.
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.000]  Let me tell you, I was shocked by the story in this game. Shocked. I was not expecting that twist.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  Are you serious then?
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  It's a good twist. It's a very good twist.
[17:26.000 --> 17:33.000]  Let's not spoil it. Good game. Go play it if you've ever liked a Kirby game or if you just like 2D platforms in general. Good fun.
[17:33.000 --> 17:39.000]  I have finished up the new levels on Mario Kart.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  Mario Kart 9 you mean?
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  Call back.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  So yeah, I enjoyed them. They're fun.
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  I played them too. I thought they were good. I'm not a fan of the tour ones with the changing and everything.
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  Yeah, we talked about this in Slack. I love them. I think it's ridiculous but I really like it.
[18:03.000 --> 18:11.000]  I mean, there's nothing wrong with them on paper but I guess I'm just not playing enough Mario Kart to get used to them.
[18:11.000 --> 18:17.000]  Someone just sits down like okay let's play the Mario Kart track and oh it's a different course. I'm totally confused.
[18:17.000 --> 18:24.000]  I guess the problem is it's only a few levels within 48 groups of levels.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  It's just so many levels and to randomly one of them is not the same every time you go around. I get that would be weird.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  Yeah, exactly. That's it.
[18:33.000 --> 18:41.000]  And yeah, it's Mario Kart. It's good and they're going to keep giving us more Mario Kart including characters.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  This really is just Mario Kart 9 this DLC because it's like the actual size of the original Mario Kart 8.
[18:48.000 --> 18:57.000]  And I've been playing through the update for Bloom so it's taking a long time obviously because it's just a little bit every day but it's been good fun.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  Good. That's great.
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  And that's what we've been playing.
[19:04.000 --> 19:11.000]  So I've done the thing that I do when we have a ridiculous number of news and I've split them up into some logical chunks.
[19:11.000 --> 19:20.000]  So the first section is the releases section. So we have first of all RuneFactory 3S. We have a release date for that.
[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  So that's the remake of RuneFactory 3 coming to the Switch and PC. That is coming out on the 5th of September.
[19:28.000 --> 19:37.000]  Wait, the 5th? Do you remember the 5th of September? Do you remember RuneFactory? Do you remember the 5th of September?
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  You didn't either.
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  Okay, I have a few notes on this. So one of the things they tweeted was a special edition.
[19:50.000 --> 20:05.000]  Yes, there's a limited edition so it comes with a notebook, character stickers, some badges, a woven patch, an A3 poster and the usual swimsuit mode DLC.
[20:05.000 --> 20:12.000]  As we all love. We all love the swimsuit mode. It's not all creepy and weird.
[20:13.000 --> 20:24.000]  I'll talk about this later because it will come up again. But one thing I do want to note. Does Nintendo have a standard for special editions now?
[20:24.000 --> 20:33.000]  Because all the special editions come in the same sized box. You can fit everything you can in there.
[20:33.000 --> 20:47.000]  I bought a few and it's kind of odd but whatever. It's nice to see. I like physical things and people who are fans of RuneFactory probably enjoy that I guess. Question mark?
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  I would assume so.
[20:51.000 --> 21:04.000]  So I watched the trailer. I really had not paid attention to RuneFactory 3 at all before. First of all, congratulations to our friend Micah making it into the series after his long dedication and following through the game.
[21:05.000 --> 21:22.000]  So the trailers I saw have this banging music playing with the trailer. We need a rhythm farming game. I think that would be great. I could see farming to the music. It would be good. I want to see that.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  We got close with Mad Dash but it's not technically rhythm. It's just like fast.
[21:29.000 --> 21:38.000]  We need better music in farming games. I'm tired of the chill, wholesome, laid back farm.
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  You want a stressful farming game?
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  Yes, I do.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  You want a hard metal farming game?
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  Dude, you say that but that would be the best.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  I can't remember what Automicrops soundtrack was like.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  I don't know but it should be heavy metal. I'd beat down for that.
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  So one more comment on RuneFactory.
[22:02.000 --> 22:10.000]  They're already very anime but boy this one feels anime.
[22:10.000 --> 22:22.000]  Those trailers, there's farming and then there's the relationship anime girls and boy do they go heavy in that. I'm talking about even on the RuneFactory standard.
[22:23.000 --> 22:29.000]  But that's all I got to say. RuneFactory. What are your thoughts Al?
[22:29.000 --> 22:39.000]  It's RuneFactory. People don't mind me on RuneFactory. It's an older RuneFactory game just on the Switch. I'm alright, thanks.
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  For some people this will be great and I'm happy for you. Go get your RuneFactory.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  One more thing I should say. The art is beautiful I will say.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  It's 2D not the 3D of RuneFactory 5 or whatever.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  I think it looks beautiful. They really freshened it up for the Switch. So good on that.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  Looks fine.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  No one else looks fine.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  SunHaven.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  Wow. Damning with faint praise.
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  SunHaven 1.0 is out now.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  It feels like it was only yesterday that 0.8 was out.
[23:17.000 --> 23:28.000]  So full. There are more things coming but the non early access version is now out on Steam.
[23:28.000 --> 23:35.000]  They added the museum and a bunch of character customisation and stuff.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  That museum is very pretty.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  I think it is a good looking game this SunHaven.
[23:42.000 --> 23:47.000]  The more I look at it the more I like it. I think they put effort into it.
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.000]  As far as StarDuke ones go this one does stand out a bit.
[23:53.000 --> 23:59.000]  This is just a side comment not specific to SunHaven.
[23:59.000 --> 24:06.000]  1.0 release is still weird to me because it's this continuous cycle.
[24:07.000 --> 24:13.000]  There's a whole bunch of early access beta version and then at some point you have a 1.0.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  But then you have a whole bunch of updates after and it all feels arbitrary and weird.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  It is arbitrary. Of course it's arbitrary.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  I don't like that because I don't know when to join in.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  All that said this update is huge and it does feel like a 1.0 release.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  So good for SunHaven.
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  I think these things are completely arbitrary.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  1.0 is basically the point where we think there's enough in it for it to count as a full game.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  That's kind of where things go.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  You're obviously not against game updates in general.
[24:51.000 --> 24:59.000]  The StarDuke updates were fantastic and added a lot to that game.
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  But I don't feel like the original version of StarDuke or the 1.0 version of StarDuke was bad.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  Certainly not.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  I don't think StarDuke ever did an early access or anything like that.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  I don't know.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Regardless.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  The weird thing for me is just...
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  It might just be a marketing word.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  We did a whole episode on this.
[25:23.000 --> 25:30.000]  We're having 1.0. We're officially releasing after X number of months or years with people playing it.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  It's an odd feeling to me.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  But that might just be a me thing.
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  Either way, good on SunHaven.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  Like I said, it's not specific to them but the work they have put in does look very good.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  There's a lot of new customization. Good on them.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  Also Switch port coming soon.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Yeah.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  Who knows what soon is.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  Arbitrary releases!
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  We love it.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  So they've got an upcoming roadmap as well.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  There's some more features they'll be adding to it later on.
[26:06.000 --> 26:12.000]  If you want to play the game, play the game.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  The stuff they're adding is more player customization, more pets, more race specific dialogue.
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  Having children with your spouse, farm buildings, proximity animations, minor DLCs.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  What does that even mean?
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  Main story epilogue.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  You're going to get enough out of this game if you play it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  And if you really enjoy it, then come back for more.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  Speaking of updates, we've got a bunch of updates.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  So, first we have the Coral Island Spring update. Is that now?
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  It is a lot.
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.000]  Well, let's go through the list and then if there's anything you want to comment on.
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  So obviously there's a bunch of new content, including some of the like, there's a tree planting festival.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  There is, here we go, bathing suits.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.000]  I think, well, so I will say, I think this feels different from Rune Factory's bathing suits, right?
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  Because in this case, they'll change into bathing suits when they're doing activities on the beach.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  Right. That makes sense.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  Whereas the thing about Rune Factory is, exactly.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  Whereas with Rune Factory, it's like, I am in charge and I decree that you all have to wear your swimsuits all the time.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  Right. Like it's very different.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  It's very different.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  It is very different.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  So I also wanted to comment on the same thing, right?
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  Like it actually makes sense here. I'm surprised it wasn't in already, to be honest.
[27:47.000 --> 27:55.000]  And I think there was, there were certain situations where they could go, but not all the situations.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  Yeah. And so like, I mean, again, we're going to be talking about a lot of games and guess what?
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  A lot of these games have relationship dating mechanics.
[28:04.000 --> 28:12.000]  I appreciate putting more effort into it because if you're going to add it in, make it feel, you know, well-rounded and substantial.
[28:12.000 --> 28:21.000]  So something like even if, you know, your mileage will vary in the context of swimsuits and creepiness or whatever.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  Like it's, I appreciate putting something in to make it feel worth it.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  Yeah. You know, on paper.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  I think we've talked about this before as well.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  Like all of the characters in Coral Island feel like they are kind of unique characters, much like the stargy ones do.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  It's not just like, oh, here's the blonde.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  And, you know, it's like they actually feel like they have a character who is divorced.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  They have, you know, these sorts of things.
[28:47.000 --> 28:56.000]  You know, there's different, like reasonable wide variety of like, you know, body builds and races and these sorts of things.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  It doesn't feel like they're all just like cookie cutter, you know?
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.000]  Yeah. I definitely agree. Coral Island, it's not a tacked on feature.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  So I appreciate it.
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  Yeah. So good on them.
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  I mean, like I said, I'll comment, you know, we'll definitely have more to compare to as we go down this list.
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  Yeah. So there's a bunch of accessibility stuff they've added in this update, which is good.
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  So they've added the dyslexic font, which I think we mentioned about before.
[29:24.000 --> 29:34.000]  They've added font size settings, which for some reason so many games still don't include, especially like triple A games.
[29:34.000 --> 29:41.000]  Get your font size settings in. I want to be able to read subtitles, not just squint at them.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.000]  Oh, boy, subtitles are rough.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.000]  So common for them to be terrible.
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  I don't understand why. It's like they don't care.
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  It's almost like they don't care.
[29:53.000 --> 29:58.000]  What are you triple A game that's not not caring about?
[29:58.000 --> 30:03.000]  Imagine that. They added the colorblindness settings as well.
[30:03.000 --> 30:07.000]  Accessibility wise. So that's good. And they've moved a bunch of options around.
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  They've got like an accessibility tab, which is good.
[30:09.000 --> 30:15.000]  So if you've been waiting for Coral Island because you couldn't play it because of the lack of these settings.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  Go have a look. See if what you need is there. Go play the game.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  We like accessibility options.
[30:20.000 --> 30:26.000]  And now that you can play it with these accessibility options, you can see the new stuff like the tree planting festival.
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  I like the idea of reforesting stuff. I like growing trees.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  It's like in Minecraft, it's really a zen relaxing thing. I like doing a forest and whatever.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  So that's cool. And there's a whole bunch of other stuff.
[30:41.000 --> 30:49.000]  That's quite a theme in Coral Island is respect for the environment and stuff like that.
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  Even just in the name Coral Island.
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  I should pick this up. This sounds like the point I want to join in now.
[30:57.000 --> 31:02.000]  I think if we're not there, we're certainly very close for me.
[31:02.000 --> 31:05.000]  It's on my list. I need to play it at some point.
[31:05.000 --> 31:13.000]  I can't remember. Is this one? So I'm in this annoying situation where there's a bunch of kickstarters that I purchased.
[31:13.000 --> 31:20.000]  And then they were like, oh, what platform would you like the key for?
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  And so obviously, if you put Steam, you got the early access. And if you didn't put Steam, you didn't.
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  And before I got the Steam Deck, I was just going, oh, yeah, well, I want Switch.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  Obviously, that's how I play my games.
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  And I'm like, can I change? I want to get the Steam one now because I have the Steam Deck and I can play games on the Steam Deck.
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  So I think this was one that I said on the Switch. So I need to need to go and change that if I want to play it before it comes out on the Switch.
[31:45.000 --> 31:50.000]  Well, I will get it at some point when it's on the Switch.
[31:50.000 --> 31:57.000]  We talked about the reforesting, but there's a whole bunch of other stuff, too.
[31:57.000 --> 32:02.000]  There's Giants now, a storyline, Giants Village. There's Duck and Sheep.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  There's solar panels. Just one singular duck.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  Just one. You can only have one.
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.000]  Duck can be bought.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  All sorts of customization things.
[32:19.000 --> 32:29.000]  Yeah, I love growing the fruits. I don't know why, but growing fruits in a farming game seems way more exciting to me than growing vegetables.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  Maybe it's because I like fruits more than vegetables.
[32:31.000 --> 32:41.000]  The fruit trees in Stardew were always very satisfying because you plant one and then every year you'll get fruit from that tree forever.
[32:41.000 --> 32:50.000]  Whereas even the strawberries, which would regrow and regrow and regrow, they would still die when you left the season.
[32:50.000 --> 32:56.000]  Whereas the trees wouldn't. So it's a really good way to get constant money.
[32:57.000 --> 32:58.000]  No, I agree.
[33:01.000 --> 33:08.000]  What is rambutan? I'm just looking at the list. There's bananas, cocoa, lemons and rambutan.
[33:08.000 --> 33:10.000]  Oh, this is another one of those things.
[33:10.000 --> 33:11.000]  Yeah, time to learn.
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  Oh, my word. That is an incredible looking fruit.
[33:17.000 --> 33:20.000]  It looks like it's going to crawl on me.
[33:20.000 --> 33:22.000]  It looks like a sea urchin.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  Oh, it does. That's exactly what it looks like.
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  With an egg inside.
[33:26.000 --> 33:28.000]  Wow.
[33:28.000 --> 33:30.000]  I love when we actually get education.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  Native to Southeast Asia.
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  It's from Malaysia.
[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  Malaysian word. Malay. It's from Vietnam.
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  It's closely related to the lychee.
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  Oh, there you go.
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  Yeah, that's what it looks like. It reminds you of the lychee.
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  That is an incredible looking fruit.
[33:46.000 --> 33:52.000]  It's like a lychee, but the straggly bits are longer.
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  I'm looking at the wiki here.
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  In Vietnam, they're called chom chom. I don't know how to pronounce that.
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  I don't speak Vietnamese.
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  But it means messy hair in Vietnamese.
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  I can see where they got that name from.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  Yeah, it looks like messy hair.
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.000]  They look quite big when you see pictures, but I've seen one with a scale and it's like two centimetres.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  It's really not that big.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  Oh, no, that's tiny.
[34:20.000 --> 34:24.000]  Oh, my word. I was thinking they were like coconut size.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  They do, but no, it's next to glass and it looks like a strawberry.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  Oh, my word, it's like a grape. That's bizarre.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  Well, there you go.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  Now we've got to play Coral Island to go rambutans.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  Rambutans.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  I'd like to eat one.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  Anything else your eye has been drawn to?
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  You can't top that.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  You can't top the rambutans.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  Cool.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  So that's Coral Island. Go and go play it if now's the time.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  Oh, and their soundtrack is out now.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  Oh, love that.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  Another soundtrack is good, but I love soundtracks being released in general.
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  I have heard some good music from it.
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  Although it's not what you're wanting.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  It's more of the Stardew Cam music rather than the heavy metal.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  Well, look, it's an island. Can I get, you know, tropical calypso?
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  I don't know.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  I mean, there might be. I've not listened to all the music.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  I'll take that.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Go find it. I'm sure it's on Spotify.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  OK. I can find out now that the OST is out.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Potion Parrot.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  That's out, too.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  It's got an update.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  They have added the grow box.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  You can plant seeds and harvest the herbs and flowers you need from these boxes by your cauldron.
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  I'm surprised it took them this long to get out.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  Because that seems kind of good.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  Yeah. Was this not something that...
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  Was it Bev and Cody?
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  Or was it Maddy?
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  Oh, and Maddy. Yeah, that's what it was.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  Or was it Kelly?
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Haha, I lose track.
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Potion Parrot.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  I'm not sure it was Bev.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  It was Bev, Maddy and Kelly.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  It wasn't Cody. That's where I went wrong.
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  I'm pretty sure this was basically something they were asking for on the episode.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  It's been a minute since we listened to the episode.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  It was a great episode, by the way.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Yeah, but that seems like a really good feature.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  So good on you, Potion Parrot.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  You're listening to the podcast and you added it in.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  Speaking of listening to the podcast and adding stuff to games,
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  Garden Galaxy have an update out.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  And they have added a rainbow coin,
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  which gets you multiple items at once.
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  And they've added area selections,
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  so you can now go and grab a whole bunch of things
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  and move them all together.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  Again, this is Garden Galaxy.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  I was laughing a little while there.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  Oh, the area selection. That was needed.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  Oh boy, that's a good one.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  There's a whole bunch of other smaller additions.
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.000]  I mean, there's quote unquote spoiler items.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  I don't know how you can have spoilers in this game,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  but whatever.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  They have vending machines.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  Seems like an answer to what we wanted here.
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  Oh, I missed that.
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  I missed that one. Yeah, available item cycles
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  after time or once bought out.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  Yeah, vendor cart.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  Oh, food orders can be fulfilled to earn coins.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  What? You can do mechanics to earn coins?
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  One of the things we talked about?
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  Yeah.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  And vanishing items that can be used to float terrain or objects.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  Waypoint Science, you can just snap to areas of your garden.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  Oh, that's a good one.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Oh yeah, this is good stuff. This is good.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  Nice.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  Some coins on the shrine stuff. Drop their poo straights.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  This is good.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  OK.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Good on you, Garden Galaxy.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  You also listened to the podcast
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  and listened, as Al said.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Yeah, I like that. I'm happy with that one.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Are you happy with Orange Season?
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  Yeah, their 0.9 update is out now.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  The summer update.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  Getting close to the 1.0.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  They are.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think anyone on the podcast has actually played this game yet.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  We don't know.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  They've added the summer season.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  They've added the beach.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  New trees and new characters.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  And if you really care about the game,
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  I'll add the show notes.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  One thing I do want to say is
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  there's this quote in the update
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  which is
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  Unfortunately, you won't be able to use your save files
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  you previously made on version 0.8
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  because we have run into an issue
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  that prevents you from saving this data
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  without causing issues.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  We're working on a proper fix.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  In the meantime, we didn't want to let
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  anybody wait any longer
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  for all this content because of one bug.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  So we will be resolving this issue next week
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  in another patch.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  I'm assuming
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  that they just warn you
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  that you can't use your old save file
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  and they don't overwrite it or corrupt it
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  because otherwise
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  that seems really bad
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  to go
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  Oh, we didn't want to wait
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  so here's a version that corrupts your save file.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Oh boy.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  That's a big one.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  You know, in the summer season
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  you probably could have waited
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  to have dropped that.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  I get not wanting to wait for one bug
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  but for this bug
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  That's a big one.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  Maybe wait for this bug.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  This isn't like
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  the orange umbrella
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  can't be used in one square.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  This is a very different bug from that.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  You can't
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  use your save file.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  So don't
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  update your game until
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  0.9.1 is out.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  Pokemon didn't learn the lesson
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  I won't hold it against the orange season.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  Well look, the Pokemon one
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  is not like it happens.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  Nobody can use their 0.8
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  save file.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  It's a much bigger issue.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  Did they not have the
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  summer season?
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  It's called orange season.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  Or summer fruit.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  You gotta wait to make people
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  pay for it.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  I don't know why this next one
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  was in this section.
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  It probably should have been in the previous section.
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Song of the Prairie has a release date now.
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  It's the 7th of April.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  What is Song of the Prairie?
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  I don't remember.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  Song of the Prairie is a 3D relaxing farm game.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  A hero who defeats the demon
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  begins a new rural life.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  Experiencing the fun of exploration to the town.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  Harvesting giant fruits and crops.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Taking care of
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  fantastic animals.
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  Dating with someone you like.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  This feels like it's been
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  auto-translated.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  They defeat
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  the demon.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  Not capitalized, just the demon.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  This game
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  I think
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  I've said this before.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  It feels like
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  fine.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  This feels like the epitome of
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  a 3D stardew clone.
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  There's some extra things.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  If your sheep gets hit by lightning
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  they become an electric sheep.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  Fine. Whatever.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  It doesn't feel like there's anything
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  unique about this game.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  I'm looking at the trailer
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  and I agree with you.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  The overall
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  feel is definitely 3D stardew
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  and isn't super noble.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  But there's lots of little things that are kind of cool.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  Yeah, I think the
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  problem is that little things
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  isn't really enough.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  Coral Island is very much a stardew clone.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  But when I look at it
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  I want to play this.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  When I look at this one I'm like
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  I'm alright, thanks.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  I think I'll skip this one.
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  There's nothing super differentiating.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  I totally agree with you.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  I will just give them props for
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  the little things they do that
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  are fun.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  I don't know what they're doing but
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  you plow something.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  It's like a wave.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  They're on an animal
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  I think.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Yeah, boar or something.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  They're running around with it.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  And causing dirt holes.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  There's a crab where you can
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  put different flowers on it.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  I don't know what that's about but it's a cute crab.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  I do worry that a bunch of these things
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  are late game stuff.
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  Oh, you're probably right.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  All this looks really nice
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  so it's probably a late game.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  Or takes a minute to get.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  The giant fruits and veggies.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  That's a fun bit.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  It could be a game.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  It's a good looking game.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  The animations seem good.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  It looks all fine.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  There's just something about it.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  I'm not excited by it and I don't know why.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  I don't blame you.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  I agree with this.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  But, hey, you
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  listener, check it out. Song of the Priory.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  Make your own judgement.
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  Maybe it will interest you.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  Again, that's April 7th.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  6th on the Steam page.
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  Next we have
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  some generic
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  miscellaneous announcements.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  So, Lightyear Frontier.
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  This is the game where you're
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  on another planet and you have a mech suit
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  farming.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  That has been delayed.
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  The early access has been delayed.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  Fine.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  I can't even remember
[43:28.000 --> 43:30.000]  when it was scheduled for.
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  Neither!
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  Spring 2023
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  is when it was scheduled for.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  There's a new time frame, as far as I can see.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  There's a lot of words
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  in this statement.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  So, I might have missed something, but I can't see
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  an updated time frame.
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  You know what
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  does have a release date, though?
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  Terra Nil.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  Yeah, it does.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  That's not news,
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  listeners, just in case you're confused.
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  We did already know when Terra Nil is coming out.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  They've got an updated
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  trailer.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  And the trailer has a cool name.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  It's A Beginner's Guide to Ecosystem
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  Restoration. And they've got a cool looking book
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  that I presume is in the game.
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  Yeah, you can see it in the trailer.
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  There's a notebook thing
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  that pops up with really
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  nice sketches.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  I was excited about this game.
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  So excited that I don't know, maybe I'll
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  find a place and time to talk about it somewhere.
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  Empty, empty, hint, hint.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  But that said,
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  this trailer really excites me.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  The animation,
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  there's like these
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  waves
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  of leaves that
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  go into a machine and expand
[44:42.000 --> 44:44.000]  in Terra form. It looks really nice.
[44:44.000 --> 44:46.000]  The animations are really nice.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  Like I said, there's a notebook
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  that shows sketches of animals
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  and machines and stuff. It looks very nice.
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  I think it's just
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  like your standard menu stuff, but it's just
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  very stylish.
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  I think what I like about this as well
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  is it feels
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  very much like a modern
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  a modern management
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  sim without all of the
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  3D aspects of a lot of newer
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  ones. So it
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  feels more like
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  the kind of late 90s, early
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  2001s.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  Which is where I liked
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  management games.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.000]  I think
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  the modern ones for me have
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  just become a bit too involved
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  and stressful and the
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  3D aspect of things means that it's not
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  grid based, so there's
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  too much customization for my liking.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  Whereas this is still very much
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  grid based.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  But it still feels nice and
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  modern and good graphics and
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  stuff like that.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  The theme of
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  Terraforming
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  is very strong.
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  It's really well done.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  Watch the trailer.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  Be excited.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  It comes out in two weeks!
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  Less than two weeks!
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  3.28?
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  That's less than two weeks from now.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  They've even got
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  underwater ecosystems
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  you can recreate, like coral
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  and stuff like that.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  You can see sharks in the water.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  It's such a good looking
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  game.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  It is!
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  I'm so excited to listen
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  to a possible future podcast
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  about this game.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  I wonder where you could find such a podcast.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  Only time will tell.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  You know, I heard our friend Johnny's
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  excited about it.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  I don't know
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  what makes you think that.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  Solar Punk
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  are doing a Kickstarter
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  in two to three months.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  There you go.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  That's the news!
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  Solar Punk
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  describe themselves as a calm, survival
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  craft game. I don't know what to
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  tell you.
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  Now we know what it's all about.
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  There's not a trailer.
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  There's an image of
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  a dirt army looking
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  thing with a solar panel.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  That's all you get.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  Are you hyped
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  for Solar Punk?
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  You know what you could
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  be hyped for?
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  Is this the right one I'm looking at?
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  Is it Traveler's Rest?
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  Yes, it is.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  Traveler's Rest.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  Let me hype for that.
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  They've put up
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  a roadmap.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  That's cool.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  If you're really up for that one, go.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  I appreciate
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  roadmaps, but come on guys.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  This is like a Microsoft Planner roadmap.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  This is
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  100%. This is how
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  they are internally working on
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  the game.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  There's obviously some
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  information that's going to be hidden from us.
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  But 100%, this is
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  their whole
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  management system that they're using to build the game.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  It is.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  I want a little more
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  style with my roadmaps, but it's also kind of
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  funny just to see them drop it like that.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  There's
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  a lot of stuff
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  most of you can look at.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  They're working on
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  biome animals and all sorts of things.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  The one thing I want to bring up.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  There's a new NPC, Bob. That is my friend
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  is a Goron from The Legend of Zelda.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  That is a legally synced Goron.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  It really is.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  That's exactly what I thought when I saw him as well.
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  I bet Buzz is
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  definitely Scottish as well.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  What?
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Are you telling me
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  that the character with small
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  eyes and a big
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  lush red beard is going to be Scottish?
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  I guess he could be Irish.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  He could be Irish.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  But no, he's going to be Scottish.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  I totally agree.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  Yeah.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  If you really want to know the detail about what they're
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  currently working on and what the next update is
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  and the very long term stuff.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  I love how in the very long term column
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  they have main story.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  Ok.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  Fair enough.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  There we go.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  They have a road map.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  At least they have a focus.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  I'm not complaining.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  I'm just mocking them.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  Because it's fun to mock people.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  Next, we have...
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  Sorry, did I just ruin your
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  segue there?
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Yes, whatever.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Moonstone Island.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  Moonstone Island is out.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  It's coming to the Switch.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  I don't think it is out yet.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  Is it?
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  No, it's not out yet.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  Oh goodness.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  Moonstone Island is meant to be coming out this year.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  But it's not out yet.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  The news
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  is that they are officially coming to Switch.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  And we get a picture of the game
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  on Switch.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  I don't remember
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  if I have looked
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  at this game. I might have even talked about it on the show.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  I don't remember.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  But you
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  can have a lamp follow you.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  That's really cool.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  This one
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  is an interesting one.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  It's a creature collection
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  life sim
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  set in an open world for some reason
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  with 100 plus islands to explore.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  This one certainly
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  seems like it's definitely
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  trying to do something different.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  It's got
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  card based combat.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  I always like
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  card based combat.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  It looks fun.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  It definitely is
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  art style
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  based off
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  GBA
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  or SNES maybe?
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  I'd say
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  Game Boy Color.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  It reminds me of the Game Boy Color
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  with more colors.
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  I have a few thoughts on this one.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  You're right.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  There's stuff that interests me
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  and stuff that
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  lessens my excitement.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  The premise is
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  you're an alchemist
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  and you
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  make friends, brew potions,
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  collect spirits,
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  and test your strength in
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  card based encounters.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  That's from the Steam page.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  That aspect of it
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  is very cool.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  I like alchemy.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  I like brewing stuff.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  Creature collecting
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  is a whole genre
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  that is hit or miss
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  because you're in the room with Pokemon.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  But the creatures they do have
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  are very cool and unique.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  There's a lamp and a coffee cup
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  and they don't seem gimmicky
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  and actually fun and cute.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  And a lizard dragon with a scuba gear.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  I don't know what that's about.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  Is it a scuba gear?
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  Is it additional to it?
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  Can you give your creatures
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  accessories?
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Or is that just part of the creature itself?
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  I'm guessing that's part of the creature.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  I love the creativity.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  All that is very fun
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  and exciting.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  If you show me that, I will be all in.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  But then they show me
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  the relationship system.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  The dating trailer.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  This game really didn't need that.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Going back to
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  what I was mentioning earlier
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  the Stardew
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  knockoff syndrome
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  whatever you want to call it
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  that so many of these games suffer from.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  This is part of it.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  I know it's so prevalent
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  in many of these games
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  but the relationship system
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  feels tacked on at times.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  Obviously I'm prejudging this.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  I don't know how well these characters are going to look
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  or whatever.
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  Not every game needs it.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  When you look at Coral Island
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  it feels well developed.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  The swimsuit thing adds to it
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  because they're on an island.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  But here this game
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  you're selling me weird, goofy Pokemon
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  and alchemy brewing.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  That's very cool on its own.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  Relationship mechanics
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  don't necessarily benefit this game.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  They could, but on paper
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  I don't need that to sell me this.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  When a game tries to do too much
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  sometimes it suffers.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  So
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  that's just a general
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  comment.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  Moonstone Island is far from
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  the only game to do this.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Research Story
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  I mentioned before. Similarly
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  I don't think you need a date in Research Story.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  So I don't know.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  It bums me out to see when
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  games do this, and again on this podcast
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  we see a lot of that.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  But I will still be looking
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  at Moonstone Island
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  because even if there's boring dating
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  they have
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  a lizard with scuba gear
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  and a lamp
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  and a coffee cup
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  and I'm excited to
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  play with those Pokemon.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  But you know what?
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  I'm actually really excited for
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  this was the reverse scenario
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  for me. Our next story
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  is for Lottlenuts.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  So I
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  watched the trailer
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  and one of the first things they say is
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  use the adjective wholesome in this game
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  and that killed my
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  excitement because again, saturation
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  of the word wholesome in this
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  little sphere of the video game world.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  But then I see what the game actually
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  is.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  You are a
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  space janitor.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  That's what they actually call you.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  You're on an ocean planet
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  and you have to use your gun
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  to clean up the ocean from pollutants
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  and garbage and stuff.
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  It's 3D. The art is very
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  cute. Your character doesn't
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  have a face. It's just a round astronaut
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  helmet and it's very cute and you have a little
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  bubble gun.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  I was thinking, are they going to aim for
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  power? They're kind of going for a power wash
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  and then they actually say power wash
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  swimulator.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  I'm very excited for
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  Lottlenot.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  He's very in-depth.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  The art style is
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  I think kanimari. That's what I think of.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  Yeah.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  Did we see the actual news of this?
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  There's a demo.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  I forget. I don't think we did mention that.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  There's a demo
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  for Lottlenot.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  We'll probably be playing this demo
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  and looking at it.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  Oh wow, this was
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  just Friday.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  Do we have
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  release date tentative thing?
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  Oh, Steam in 2023. That's all we got.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  Yeah, it's just 2023.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  Which probably means not 2023.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  That said, I really
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  encourage the listener to
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  check out this link because
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  I think it has a lot to offer.
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  The initial
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  image didn't necessarily excite me, but now I
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  looked at the trailer. Oh man, I'm in love with
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  this game. I like oceans in general.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  So ocean games
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  excite me and this looks like a really
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  well done one.
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  So next
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  we have two new games. The first of
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  which is called Mudborne.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  The best name ever!
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  And this is
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  a new game from the creator
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  of Apico.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  It's
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  Apico but frogs.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  I was thinking that when I was reading the
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  tweet and then I scroll and he
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  actually says the phrase Apico but frogs
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  and I'm like yeah!
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  Yeah, I mean if you like Apico
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  and you like frogs
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  go play this game.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  I mean it's a very small
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  concept game.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  It's a game jam game.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  But it looks great.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  Yeah.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  Okay
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  I maybe didn't
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  look at this hard enough but are you a frog
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  collecting other frogs? Am I seeing that correctly?
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  Yeah.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  I mean you're like a person frog.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  Like I think you're...
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  Frog man.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  I don't...
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  So it says finally
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  reach your life goals and become an actual
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  frog. And then it says tiny
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  little frogs you can catch and chase.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  I think you are a person who has become
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  a frog.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  So you're like a person sized
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  and person shaped
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  frog and
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  you're catching actual frogs.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  Is this like if Cody became a bee
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  person? A frog person.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Well I mean for her for bees you know.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  Oh right. Mud born but bees.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  And then it says one of the frogs has a tiny
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  hat. Game of the year contender.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Play God
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  and manipulate your frogs
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  I'm going to guess this is not as
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  accurate as Apico.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  Just a theory.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  Oh it looks
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  very cute though. You know what? A lot of
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  people like frogs.
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  So check out Mud Born.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  Amazing name. It does look pretty good.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  I hope he expands
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  on it because it's a little concept game
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  but I think this would be fun to work
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  on into a more proper
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  game. Yeah but also like you know
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  just small concept games are fun to do as well.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  Not everything needs to become a
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  money maker.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  Hobbies are good.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  That's true but this one should
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  be money maker.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  And the other new game
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  before we get into our final piece of news
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  is Outlanders.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Welcome to the Outlands. A far away
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  place where work is hard but rewarding.
[58:46.000 --> 58:48.000]  Where people dream big
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  but stay grounded. Where friends
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  become family and settlements
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  become cities.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  Outlanders is a town building strategy
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  game populated by
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  hard working charming folk in search
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  of a simpler life. Some just
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  want to survive off the land. Others want to
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  create amazing things. It's up
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  to you to use the extensive catalogue of
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  tools and buildings at your disposal to
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  guide them towards their goals. So why I think
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  it's really interesting about this is it's a city
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  builder but it's
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  not like a city builder.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  It's like a village builder.
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  Yeah.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  And so it's not like, because I think the
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.000]  problem with one of my issues with city builders
[59:26.000 --> 59:28.000]  is it's always like, build the biggest
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  and most
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  capitalistic and most
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  horrifically urban
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  city you can.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  A forge of empires
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  from the androids place
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  And then this is like, let's build a place
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  where people live. Build a bakery
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  that, it literally says yum
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  when you build your bakery.
[59:48.000 --> 59:50.000]  Yum.
[59:50.000 --> 59:52.000]  So when I first
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.000]  saw this, I was a little
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  eh, it looked a little generic because
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  the art style is kind of
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  um,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  I don't know how to describe it, but we've seen it before.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  Uh, Goose Game.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  That's probably a good comparison.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  Untitled Goose Game looks like that.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  It's like quite simple textures.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  And you're building a city and it looks
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  fine. What excites me though,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  something like a small detail
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  that really differentiates city builders
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  for me is the people
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  actually like working on the stuff, right?
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Um, so it's not just clicking
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  and oh, here's a construction site
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  or, you know, poof, the building appears.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  You actually see like, people going
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  and using the buildings or working on
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  them. And I don't know, that
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  just really makes it come to life for me.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  And uh, I don't know,
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  it looks very cute. I like it. I think I
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  will probably take a look at it.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  There is a demo available.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Wait, no, it's out. It's out already.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  $15 on Steam.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  $23 if you want to
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  buy the complete edition
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  which has two DLC
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  packs.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  This is a lot.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  I'm probably going to guess
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  this.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  Add all the DLC
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  to cart. Click.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Yeah, check it out. Outlanders on Steam.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  Yeah, cool.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  I know you people think we've covered
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  a lot of these, and we have. And we only have one more
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  piece, but you know, it's only like a third
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  of the
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  notes we have here.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  It's a little game they call Harvest Moon.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  Harvest Moon, the
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Winds of Anthos.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  So, I mean, let's start this off
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  with, I honestly don't know how
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  I'm going to feel about this game.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  But, we have a bunch
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  of news about this upcoming Harvest Moon
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  game.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Still no release date,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  but we'll go with that.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  We have a bunch of screenshots.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  We have a bunch of
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  text describing it.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  And let's
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  go through the
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  list of texts that they've given first
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  and then we can comment on the screenshots
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  and what we think about it. Before that, I just want to
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  make one comment. Okay.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  This is the Harvest Moon,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  not Story of Seasons. Yes.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  So this is Natsu Meihime
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  and they make the games.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  They regionalized the original
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Harvest Moon games and then they had
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  the trademark and then they decided to make
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  their own games, blah blah blah blah.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Yeah, and I know we
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  repeated that ad nauseam here, but
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  I only bring that up because one of the links
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  that I shared
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  and I'm looking through,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  the author, it's like a blog post or something,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  seems to be confused and seems
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  they were playing through Story of Seasons
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  and saying now Natsu Meihime has made
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  the Harvest Moon, Wind of Anthos
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  and those are not the same people
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  making these games.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  Oh, that hurts to see.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  That hurts to see.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Okay, let's go through the text now.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Okay, cool.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  So,
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  bit of blurb.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  The land players will explore is known as
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Anthos and is home to the Harvest Sprites.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  I'm shocked.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Spirits that protect people and nature
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  as well as the goddess of nature known as
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  the Harvest Goddess. However,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  about ten years ago,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  an unprecedented eruption in
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Anthos' volcanic
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  region forced the Harvest Goddess
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  and her Harvest Sprites to use
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  all their powers to protect the people.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  The people were saved,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  but the eruption left the villages
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  cut off from each other. Believing
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  that the separated villages and people
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  would one day be reconnected, the Harvest
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  Goddess sent a mothal into the
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  ocean with a letter and a magic key
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  then fell into a deep
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  sleep.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Discover five unique towns
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  with their own seasons, terrain, and villagers.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  Explore the world of
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Anthos while searching for harvest
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  wisps, wild animals,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  mines, and more.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Care for livestock such as cows,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  sheep, chickens, and more, and earn
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  bonuses on your farm for keeping a variety of animals.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Woo five
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  different bachelors and five different
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  bachelorettes. Marry whoever your heart
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  desires. Keep pets such
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  as cats, dogs, parakeets, wolves, and
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  more. Doc Jr.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  is back with a new and improved
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  expando farm that lets you easily
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  move your farmer in the land of Anthos
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  and cook multiple dishes
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  in your kitchen at the same time.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Woo.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  That's how long I'm done. I'm just looking at the list of the
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  two more bullets that I believe
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  aren't official. No, these are just my
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  bullet points.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  Same sex marriage, finally.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  This is the first
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  harvest moon game.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  Same sex marriage.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  I mean, it's good
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  that they've finally done it. It's just absolutely
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  bizarre that it's taken to 2023.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Alright,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  I'm just
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  going to agree with your statement
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  finally and not comment
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  on that rabbit
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  hole. Yeah, we don't need to do
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  that. We're there, we're there,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  we're good, you can marry anyone.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Just go with it.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  Yeah.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  So, I guess there's a few things to talk about.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  So, first of all, it's interesting
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  that they're going on with the
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  concept in the previous game.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Harvest Moon...
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  what was it? Harvest Moon...
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  No.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  That's a story of seasons.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  One World.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  Harvest Moon, One World, where you
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  have your expando farm and you can move your
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  farm around the world. So, they're
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  continuing with that. You still have this,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  you have your farm that you can move
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  with you. Which I really
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  liked the concept of, the idea
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  of it didn't really work as well
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  as I would have wanted it to in the game.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  But
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  it's an interesting concept.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  So, that's
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  an interesting thing. It's clearly
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  like a sequel to the previous one because
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Doc Jr. was in the previous game.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  So, like, presumably it's
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  a land that's near where you were in the last game.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  Who knows? Are they actually going to
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]  do anything about that? Or is it just like
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  hey, here's a character you knew.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  I don't know. Whatever.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  Again,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  they're doing like the different
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  areas and have different seasons
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  and different things can grow in them.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  That was a vaguely interesting thing in the last game.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  It was just really badly implemented.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  It'll be interesting to see.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  We don't know anything about how that works.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  And we probably won't know about how that works
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  until we actually play the game.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  It could be really good or it could be the same as One World
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  in which case I will hate it.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  But
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  what do you think, Kevin,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  about the look of this game? Because that's the biggest
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  thing we know about is how this game now looks.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Yeah.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  I feel like I saw your comments on it
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  earlier.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  It's the best looking
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  non-Story of Seasons
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  Harvest Moon game
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  by far.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  The game's
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  really nice looking for the most part.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  I think some of the human designs
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  are maybe still a little generic.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  But in general the visuals are
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  very nicely done.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  I
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  I'm very wary
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  because it's a Harvest Moon game.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  But
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  it looks like
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  the first one
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  they're making an effort to refine
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  a lot of the stuff they had before.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  So maybe
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  there's a cautious
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  iota of hope
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  of excitement
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  for this.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  But
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  I will definitely wait
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  to see what other people
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  say.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  But I mean
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  I know
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  they've had a very rough
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  history with the Harvest
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Moon name and the development
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  calling short but
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  this looks like the best attempt I think
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  since they took
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  over the name.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  So I think that's my
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  overall thoughts. What about you?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Yeah, I mean
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  I am
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  Cautiously optimistic?
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  Yes, cautiously optimistic.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  I don't know if this game will be good
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  I was going to say great. I don't think it'll be great.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  I don't know if this game will be good.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  But I certainly am encouraged
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  by how it looks
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  because we never thought
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  One World looked good.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  It looked passable.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  Whereas this game
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  in multiple ways in both
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  the portraits
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  the conversation portraits
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  that come up and
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  the 3D models both look
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  actively good.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  Whereas
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  a lot of these games you can have really bad
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  3D models and better
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  conversation portraits
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  or the other way around in which case
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Oh boy, does that happen.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  So that's encouraging.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  That legitimately is really
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  encouraging that it
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  looks good. They feel like they've actually put in
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  effort into how the game looks.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  I can see how someone
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  is not my style of
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  I don't like how it looks. That's fine. But it's not because it
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  looks bad. It's just one of these things where
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  it's like that's fine. Whatever.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  No one's going to make you
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  like it.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  Who will?
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  That's our job. That's what we're paid for.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  I am
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  certainly
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  cautiously optimistic with this. I think it could
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  be good.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  They're obviously very
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  slowly putting
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  this information out there.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  They don't want people to
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  I suspect they're doing it
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  to gather how people feel about it
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  and whether they look great
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  or not.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Yeah, it'll be interesting.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  That seems odd.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  It feels like they care
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  and are making an effort.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  I know. I don't know how to feel about that.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  Just the
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  whole history of the name and
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  the trademark is like the most
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  cash-grabby
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  drop whatever
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  to pass a game
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  history.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  It feels odd to see them
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  feel like making a genuine effort
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  to make a really
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  good game.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  Even a good game. I would take a good game at this point.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  I wouldn't argue.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  I don't argue that at all.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  It's still relatively little we're going
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  off by, but what we do see
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  looks nice.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  So we'll see.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  We will see.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  We will see. I promise you that.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  Do we have ETA
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  on the release?
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  Summer is what we've got.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  So that
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  probably does mean
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  2023. Maybe it's not actually summer.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Who knows? Or like Nintendo
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  where summer is in October.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Yeah, what is summer? I don't know.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Will we get it in
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  June or July?
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Probably not. Will it be August or September?
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Probably something like that.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  If it was June or July they'd be giving us a date
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  by now.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Oh yeah, probably. Oh gosh, we're in March. Time's going by
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  too fast!
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  Yeah, not long now.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  Not long until April.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  Alright, anything else
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  on this one?
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  No, I've been exhausted.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  I've been beaten by the news.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Alright.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  Awesome sauce then. Thank you Kevin
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  for joining me
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  for this bumper news episode.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  My word, who knew we could get over an hour
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  just on news.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Where can people find you on the internet?
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  They can find me at
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Koopa Price or my art account
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  at SpriterSquared. Hey!
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  I actually posted art again for once.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  I did a Mario Day thing.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  So I have
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  done some doodles and stuff.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  I'm just going to post it.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  It's one step closer to being active so you can check it out
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  to see something.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Where can they find you Al?
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  You can find me on Twitter
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  at TheScottBot
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  or also you can find me on
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  Mastodon.Scott
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  at TheScottBot.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  You can find the podcast on Twitter at THSPod.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  You can also get links to
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  everything for the podcast
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  including a feedback form.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Give us your feedback
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  and a link to the Patreon
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  where Kevin, what can people find
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  on the Patreon?
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Also you can find
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  two big things.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  One, access to our Slack
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  which is growing and growing
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  and is feeling more and more like
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  active Slack and makes me happy to see.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  We have opened
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  a feedback and questions
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  channel that maybe in the future
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  people will drop things
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  and we can add to the podcast.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  And by future
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  that will happen.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  It's already started.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  You can find
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  the Patreon
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  exclusive podcast called
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  The Greenhouse
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  where you can find all sorts of
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  non-farming game related topics
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  that we talk about
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  including Pokemon and Pokemon
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  and sometimes other Pokemon.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  We talked about Pokemon Day
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  a while back and who knows, maybe we'll talk about
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  actually what happened on Pokemon Day.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  Crazy idea.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  Actually,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  I say that but it is going to be
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  an interesting episode
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  because it's going to be a bit different from what we've done before
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  so I do suggest people keep
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  an eye out for the upcoming
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  post-Pokemon Day episode
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  because it's going to be a bit different and I'm very curious
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  to see what people think.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  Yeah, me too.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  See how it goes.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Awesome, well I think that's everything.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  Thank you for joining me again.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  Thank you for inviting me out.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  Until next time,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  have a good harvest.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Yeah, close enough.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Okay.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  Alright, that's a wrap.
