# Transcript

[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  🎵Music🎵
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.880]  Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
[00:35.520 --> 00:36.800]  My name is Al.
[00:36.800 --> 00:37.840]  My name is Kevin.
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.640]  And we are here today to talk about Eurovision, wait no, cottagecore games.
[00:43.840 --> 00:45.440]  No, Eurovision's correct.
[00:45.440 --> 00:46.880]  Sorry, I've got Eurovision on the mind.
[00:46.880 --> 00:48.480]  Get out of the way, cottagecore.
[00:48.480 --> 00:53.040]  We are recording this literally an hour before the Eurovision Grand Final,
[00:53.040 --> 00:54.640]  so it's all on my brain.
[00:55.600 --> 00:56.640]  That is what it is.
[00:56.640 --> 00:58.720]  Oh, I didn't know.
[00:58.720 --> 01:01.520]  I thought this was the start of the season or whatever.
[01:01.520 --> 01:02.640]  No, this is it.
[01:02.640 --> 01:03.600]  This is the final one.
[01:03.600 --> 01:04.100]  This is it.
[01:04.720 --> 01:07.520]  We're done after today for this year.
[01:07.520 --> 01:09.600]  Okay, who is in the final?
[01:09.600 --> 01:10.640]  I don't know how these things work.
[01:12.480 --> 01:14.640]  There are 26 countries in the final.
[01:14.640 --> 01:16.160]  Do you really want me to read them all out to you?
[01:16.800 --> 01:17.840]  Oh my goodness.[01:20.640 --> 01:22.480]  I don't get how Eurovision works,
[01:23.360 --> 01:26.080]  but if the listener's interested,
[01:26.080 --> 01:30.880]  maybe they could find out in some place on some medium.
[01:30.880 --> 01:35.200]  Yeah, we do have a greenhouse episode that was just released today,
[01:35.200 --> 01:38.160]  as we're recording, a few days ago when you hear this,
[01:39.840 --> 01:43.280]  where me and Cody go over our favorites at that point.
[01:44.560 --> 01:47.600]  And we're going to do another episode where we update our favorites
[01:47.600 --> 01:50.880]  because the live stuff always changes who my favorites are.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.960]  My favorites are never my favorites by the end
[01:52.960 --> 01:56.400]  because some of the stage performances are great or rubbish
[01:56.400 --> 01:57.280]  and that changes things.
[01:58.640 --> 02:01.200]  And go over our feelings about who won
[02:01.200 --> 02:02.720]  and what we're annoyed about
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.320]  and why we're annoyed about Sweden winning.
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.080]  Anyway, so this episode we have a very exciting interview.
[02:12.080 --> 02:14.800]  Yeah, how long has it been since we had an interview?
[02:14.800 --> 02:17.920]  I know, it must be a year since the last interview.
[02:17.920 --> 02:20.240]  So this is an interview with Valerie Rose Loman,
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.720]  who is the voice actor for the main character in Wild Flowers.
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.080]  And, you know, just going to keep throwing these Wild Flowers episodes at you.
[02:30.080 --> 02:34.240]  Before long, Kevin's going to make us a Wild Flowers podcast.
[02:34.240 --> 02:36.000]  I will not be stopped.
[02:37.520 --> 02:38.320]  Oh dear.
[02:38.320 --> 02:42.240]  So we have that, which Kevin has done with Valerie.
[02:43.120 --> 02:44.640]  So we'll get to that when we get to it.
[02:45.520 --> 02:47.360]  Before that, obviously we'll have some news.
[02:47.440 --> 02:50.000]  But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
[02:51.280 --> 02:52.640]  Let's see, Marvel Snap.
[02:52.640 --> 02:54.240]  It's in a good place right now.
[02:54.240 --> 02:55.760]  New season recently started.
[02:55.760 --> 02:57.920]  Fun cars, no dominant effects.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.880]  Let's see, I have been playing Roots of Pacha.
[03:04.400 --> 03:07.120]  That is one.
[03:07.120 --> 03:09.440]  Boy, that is a Stardew Valley clone.
[03:09.440 --> 03:11.600]  And two, boy, that is a good game.
[03:12.640 --> 03:13.440]  Interesting.
[03:13.840 --> 03:17.360]  It definitely feels like the season of Stardew Valley clones.
[03:17.360 --> 03:20.960]  And I'm very excited to hear how good it is compared to that.
[03:20.960 --> 03:23.920]  Because obviously, there'll be lots of comparisons to Stardew Valley.
[03:23.920 --> 03:27.360]  But the real question is, how does it do the other things?
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.080]  Yeah, yeah, I will go in depth on some other time about this.
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.360]  But one thing I will note, I need to see how,
[03:39.360 --> 03:42.960]  because I know Stardew has updated significantly since it last played.
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.400]  And I wonder how much of, I think, the improvements from Roots of Pacha
[03:48.400 --> 03:50.880]  are just the updates from Stardew that I missed.
[03:52.800 --> 03:55.760]  Overall, I mean, I've been playing it for like, how long has it been out?
[03:55.760 --> 03:57.040]  Like two weeks almost.
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.200]  And so I'm still playing it and enjoying it.
[03:59.840 --> 04:02.160]  And I'm not playing it for rushing for coverage.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.760]  I'm playing because I actually enjoy it.
[04:03.760 --> 04:06.080]  So, you know, that's a thumbs up.
[04:06.080 --> 04:06.640]  Cool.
[04:06.640 --> 04:07.360]  Awesome, awesome.
[04:07.920 --> 04:08.400]  Yeah.
[04:08.400 --> 04:11.920]  Other than that, hey, I don't know if you've heard of this game.
[04:11.920 --> 04:13.840]  I play this game called Wildflowers.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.520]  Wildflowers!
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.240]  We got update two days after Pacha release.
[04:20.240 --> 04:22.960]  Oh, it was a lot on me at once.
[04:22.960 --> 04:25.120]  So have you been playing both of those regularly?
[04:25.120 --> 04:25.440]  Yes.
[04:26.320 --> 04:27.440]  How do you find the time?
[04:27.440 --> 04:27.920]  My word.
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.840]  I schedule today's Roots of Pacha day, the other day's Wildflowers day, etc.
[04:33.840 --> 04:35.280]  You gotta tag team.
[04:35.280 --> 04:36.960]  I definitely, I cannot do that.
[04:36.960 --> 04:38.640]  I can't do that with games.
[04:38.640 --> 04:40.560]  I mean, like I'm all in on a game or not.
[04:41.040 --> 04:41.760]  That's how I work.
[04:42.480 --> 04:43.120]  Yeah.
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.320]  I mean, it's easier because these don't have end goals exactly.
[04:48.320 --> 04:53.520]  Like, you know, Wildflowers, I'm in quote unquote postgame where it's just new content that I can do.
[04:53.520 --> 04:56.080]  But I mean, that's part of what helps.
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.840]  But yeah, the update to Wildflowers has been substantial.
[05:01.840 --> 05:03.520]  A whole bunch of new stuff.
[05:03.520 --> 05:07.920]  A whole bunch of, there was a lot of farming focused updates.
[05:08.000 --> 05:12.480]  You can expand a lot of your facilities, greenhouse, etc.
[05:12.480 --> 05:13.120]  New animals.
[05:13.120 --> 05:14.800]  Some end game content as well, isn't it?
[05:15.360 --> 05:15.600]  Yeah.
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.440]  So yeah, it's good.
[05:19.440 --> 05:21.600]  I mean, that's pretty much what's been eating up my life.
[05:21.600 --> 05:24.480]  What has been eating up your life aside from Eurovision, Al?
[05:24.480 --> 05:27.600]  Well, I finally started playing Hollow Knight, right?
[05:27.600 --> 05:31.280]  So I got really into Metroid Dread last year and really enjoyed it.
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.320]  It was really good.
[05:32.320 --> 05:35.920]  And I was like, maybe I should try some more kind of similar sort of games.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.600]  And everyone's like, oh, you should play Hollow Knight.
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.100]  It's great.
[05:39.200 --> 05:41.360]  So I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I'll do it at some point.
[05:41.360 --> 05:46.160]  And then they went and put it on sale for like, it was like six quid or something like that on the Switch.
[05:46.160 --> 05:48.160]  And I was like, oh, well, I guess I'm buying it now then.
[05:49.200 --> 05:49.840]  So I bought it.
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.400]  And then I had to play Coral Island and stuff like that.
[05:54.400 --> 05:56.800]  But then last week I started playing Hollow Knight.
[05:57.360 --> 05:58.720]  So I haven't finished it.
[05:58.720 --> 06:01.360]  I tried to finish it before Zelda came out, but I didn't manage.
[06:01.360 --> 06:03.600]  I've got maybe two thirds of the way through the game.
[06:04.480 --> 06:06.720]  So at some point I'll come back to it and finish it off.
[06:06.720 --> 06:07.520]  I am enjoying it.
[06:07.520 --> 06:08.020]  It's good.
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.400]  I have my issues with it, but it's generally pretty good.
[06:13.280 --> 06:19.200]  I still, and this is going to sound stupid for playing Metroidvanias and saying I enjoy them.
[06:19.200 --> 06:23.760]  I still don't like the exploration, the backtracking exploration of it.
[06:23.760 --> 06:26.960]  So like, I'm fine when you're going through and you're like, oh, yeah, okay, well, you know,
[06:26.960 --> 06:31.040]  let's go look at all the areas and like, okay, I'll need to come back here and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[06:31.040 --> 06:35.440]  My problem is when you have to like, okay, now I need to go back to that thing I couldn't do before.
[06:35.440 --> 06:39.600]  I really don't like that because it's just so much of just doing the same thing again
[06:39.600 --> 06:42.400]  to get back to another bit that I can then do.
[06:42.400 --> 06:48.000]  And I feel like these games need many more fast travel areas.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.320]  Like Hollow Knight has a bunch of them, but it's like one per area.
[06:52.320 --> 06:56.320]  And it can take like five minutes to get from one end of the area to another.
[06:56.320 --> 06:59.840]  And it's like, I'm now trying to get to this area because I can now,
[06:59.840 --> 07:02.160]  I've now unlocked this ability to do this thing.
[07:02.160 --> 07:04.880]  But then I have to like spend five minutes going across.
[07:04.880 --> 07:06.960]  And if you die, oh well, you have to do it all again.
[07:07.520 --> 07:09.920]  Like it's just that, but I just don't find fun.
[07:09.920 --> 07:12.160]  So that kind of makes the end game a bit annoying.
[07:13.360 --> 07:15.040]  But overall, I'm enjoying it.
[07:15.040 --> 07:15.840]  It's good fun.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.800]  The combat's fine.
[07:16.800 --> 07:17.440]  It does the job.
[07:18.240 --> 07:20.320]  It is a fun world that they've created.
[07:20.320 --> 07:22.960]  There's lots of different things, lots of different enemies.
[07:22.960 --> 07:26.800]  And the boss battles are challenging, but not impossible.
[07:26.800 --> 07:28.400]  So yeah, no, I'm enjoying it.
[07:28.400 --> 07:29.520]  It's good fun.
[07:29.520 --> 07:30.020]  Okay.
[07:31.200 --> 07:31.440]  Yeah.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.360]  I mean, I think I agree with you.
[07:33.920 --> 07:36.080]  I think they could use more fast travel points.
[07:37.520 --> 07:40.320]  But on the other hand, like especially towards the later game,
[07:40.320 --> 07:43.360]  when you have everything unlocked and you can just breeze through everything,
[07:43.360 --> 07:44.560]  that kind of feels cool too.
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.320]  But I see your point.
[07:47.440 --> 07:48.880]  Yeah, I mean, you can do both.
[07:48.880 --> 07:50.560]  You don't have to use fast travel options.
[07:51.520 --> 07:54.080]  Like one of my favorite things about Breath of the Wild
[07:54.080 --> 07:56.480]  is just how many fast travel areas there are.
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.080]  You go to Shrine, that's it.
[07:58.080 --> 07:59.280]  It's another fast travel area.
[08:00.160 --> 08:04.240]  So you can just like tear through, go to everything you can see,
[08:04.240 --> 08:06.560]  and then you can really quickly travel around the map.
[08:07.360 --> 08:08.320]  Yeah, sure.
[08:08.320 --> 08:10.480]  But speaking of which...
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.920]  Speaking of which, we're recording the day after Tears of the Kingdom came out,
[08:15.920 --> 08:18.000]  and boy, have I played that game so far.
[08:18.880 --> 08:22.720]  So I have done the tutorial area,
[08:22.720 --> 08:25.840]  and I've done a wee bit more of the main story since then,
[08:25.840 --> 08:29.120]  and maybe another five Shrines or so since the tutorial area.
[08:29.120 --> 08:30.240]  So it's going well.
[08:30.240 --> 08:30.880]  I'm enjoying it.
[08:30.880 --> 08:32.080]  It's fun.
[08:32.080 --> 08:36.080]  It still has, obviously, I fell straight back into the controls from Breath of the Wild.
[08:36.080 --> 08:39.920]  It feels the same control-wise, just with you obviously have extra abilities.
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.120]  So that's something you have to learn.
[08:41.120 --> 08:44.800]  But like the combat, it feels almost exactly the same,
[08:44.800 --> 08:46.160]  and that's good, right?
[08:47.120 --> 08:48.800]  I don't think they needed to change it.
[08:49.600 --> 08:52.400]  I think that obviously they've got the new weapons and fusing and stuff like that,
[08:52.400 --> 08:52.960]  which is good.
[08:52.960 --> 08:56.720]  But like the actual combat, exactly the same, exactly how I want it.
[08:56.720 --> 09:01.360]  Like I went straight in immediately as good as I was before.
[09:01.360 --> 09:03.200]  Maybe take me like five minutes to get there.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.320]  But that was it.
[09:04.320 --> 09:05.920]  And I know what I'm doing.
[09:05.920 --> 09:06.480]  I love this.
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.120]  This is great.
[09:07.920 --> 09:09.120]  I really like what they've done.
[09:09.120 --> 09:10.400]  I won't say too much, obviously,
[09:10.400 --> 09:12.480]  because I don't want to spoil it for people who want to play the game,
[09:12.480 --> 09:14.320]  but can't afford it at launch or whatever.
[09:14.320 --> 09:16.480]  But like I love what they've done about the world.
[09:16.480 --> 09:20.160]  Like it's not Breath of the Wild just again, right?
[09:20.160 --> 09:25.040]  They've done loads of things to make it feel like time has passed in many different ways,
[09:25.040 --> 09:26.480]  and I'm really liking that.
[09:26.480 --> 09:30.960]  And obviously the sky islands and the caves is a really fun addition,
[09:30.960 --> 09:33.040]  having the kind of three different levels.
[09:33.040 --> 09:34.880]  So yeah, no, I'm really enjoying it.
[09:34.880 --> 09:37.040]  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in this game.
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.320]  I'm hoping that I can kind of get to the point where I'm playing it in chunks,
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.760]  rather than because like, as I've said before, my the way that I play is like,
[09:45.760 --> 09:50.320]  I'm going to play this game and nothing else for like two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, whatever.
[09:51.280 --> 09:53.040]  I don't want to do that for Tears of the Kingdom.
[09:53.040 --> 09:53.920]  I want to enjoy it.
[09:53.920 --> 09:55.200]  I want to take it slowly.
[09:55.200 --> 09:56.240]  I want to explore.
[09:56.240 --> 09:58.080]  I want to do lots of things.
[09:58.080 --> 10:00.480]  But I also want to play other games at the same time, right?
[10:00.480 --> 10:02.640]  Because like there's loads of games coming out.
[10:02.640 --> 10:05.600]  I've got podcast episodes to do and I want to play these games.
[10:05.600 --> 10:09.040]  So hopefully, hopefully I can get into that sort of like,
[10:09.040 --> 10:12.080]  you know, spend a few days playing and then spend a few days playing something else.
[10:12.080 --> 10:14.640]  I don't think I can do what you're doing with the one day on, one day off.
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.960]  That is just not, I can't do that.
[10:20.560 --> 10:23.200]  So it sounds like it's a sequel to Breath of the Wild.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.360]  That's kind of the general consensus I've heard.
[10:25.360 --> 10:26.960]  It absolutely is.
[10:26.960 --> 10:29.120]  If you like Breath of the Wild, you will like this game.
[10:29.120 --> 10:32.480]  If you don't like the Breath of the Wild and the things that Breath of the Wild does
[10:32.480 --> 10:35.120]  differently to other Zeldas, you're not going to like this game.
[10:35.760 --> 10:37.360]  Because it very definitely is.
[10:37.360 --> 10:38.960]  It's built on that and it changes things.
[10:38.960 --> 10:40.880]  And I think it does things in a better way.
[10:41.760 --> 10:42.880]  There's a lot of changes.
[10:43.440 --> 10:45.360]  So it doesn't feel like the exact same game.
[10:45.360 --> 10:47.120]  It doesn't feel like DLC.
[10:47.120 --> 10:48.320]  It feels like a sequel.
[10:48.960 --> 10:51.360]  But yeah, if you didn't like Breath of the Wild, you're not going to like this game.
[10:51.360 --> 10:52.960]  Don't bother picking it up.
[10:52.960 --> 10:53.460]  Sure.
[10:54.160 --> 10:54.660]  Yeah.
[10:55.200 --> 10:57.360]  If you liked Breath of the Wild, but you had some issues with it,
[10:57.360 --> 10:59.520]  you'll probably still have some issues with it, but you'll still love the game.
[10:59.520 --> 11:00.080]  It's great.
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.280]  And I guess just follow up on last episode.
[11:05.280 --> 11:08.880]  I said I was playing Fall Guys and I was trying to get to level 100 on the season pass.
[11:08.880 --> 11:09.360]  I did it.
[11:09.360 --> 11:10.240]  I got SpongeBob.
[11:10.240 --> 11:11.040]  We're sorted.
[11:11.040 --> 11:11.840]  All good.
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.360]  And Craig doesn't care.
[11:13.360 --> 11:14.640]  He still wants to be the duck.
[11:16.960 --> 11:17.460]  Classic.
[11:21.760 --> 11:22.240]  All right.
[11:22.240 --> 11:22.960]  Good stuff.
[11:22.960 --> 11:23.680]  Good stuff.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.240]  Yeah.
[11:24.240 --> 11:25.680]  That's what we've been up to.
[11:25.680 --> 11:28.320]  So should we talk about some news?
[11:28.320 --> 11:28.820]  No.
[11:29.840 --> 11:30.340]  Okay.
[11:30.560 --> 11:31.760]  Well, that's our episode.
[11:34.160 --> 11:38.480]  First off, we have the Ranch of Riverside.
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.880]  This is the horse riding slash rearing slash.
[11:43.520 --> 11:45.760]  I think you breed them breeding game as well by
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.160]  who made Capybara Spa and Lemon Cake.
[11:52.160 --> 11:53.600]  And what else?
[11:53.600 --> 11:55.440]  There was a couple of games that she made as well.
[11:56.240 --> 11:56.800]  Lemon.
[11:56.800 --> 11:58.160]  Wait, did you say Lemon Cake?
[11:58.160 --> 12:00.240]  I said Lemon Cake and Capybara Spa.
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.120]  Yeah, there's another one.
[12:01.120 --> 12:01.760]  I can't remember.
[12:02.640 --> 12:03.440]  I can't remember the name.
[12:03.440 --> 12:06.160]  Anyway, from Elise who made those games.
[12:06.160 --> 12:07.920]  It is now in early access.
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.600]  So if you want that horse riding slash rearing slash breeding
[12:11.600 --> 12:14.640]  game, it's available now on Steam.
[12:14.640 --> 12:15.140]  Yeah.
[12:16.080 --> 12:19.040]  Wait, it's early access, to be clear.
[12:20.640 --> 12:22.720]  Yes, it is early access.
[12:22.720 --> 12:23.120]  Yeah.
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.880]  Looking at the tweet, this is, I would say, her most ambitious
[12:28.880 --> 12:30.400]  game. We're talking full 3D.
[12:32.080 --> 12:33.600]  It looks very detailed.
[12:33.600 --> 12:34.320]  Very well done.
[12:34.320 --> 12:35.280]  Yeah, looks good.
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.880]  It looks like a horse game.
[12:38.880 --> 12:40.320]  Yeah, so good on Eloise.
[12:41.440 --> 12:42.800]  Yeah, I'll be interested.
[12:42.800 --> 12:44.560]  It's going to be $30 when it releases.
[12:44.560 --> 12:47.280]  Saw her tweet that, which is, you know, that's a full on game.
[12:47.280 --> 12:49.520]  That is not little micro Lemon Cake game.
[12:49.520 --> 12:50.020]  That is.
[12:50.880 --> 12:53.600]  Well, you already can tell it's bigger because it's taken
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.440]  much longer than her previous games.
[12:56.880 --> 12:59.600]  Like, I think Capybara Spa took like eight months, which
[12:59.600 --> 13:02.000]  is an incredibly quick time to play.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.040]  I was about to say, even if it's taking longer than the
[13:05.040 --> 13:07.760]  other ones, she is a machine.
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.240]  Like Stephen King levels of just cranking them out.
[13:12.240 --> 13:12.640]  Jeez.
[13:12.640 --> 13:13.360]  I know.
[13:13.360 --> 13:13.860]  Absolutely.
[13:14.560 --> 13:15.360]  Well, good for her.
[13:15.360 --> 13:16.160]  I can't wait to see.
[13:17.120 --> 13:19.680]  It looks like a lot of excitement for it from the people
[13:19.680 --> 13:21.040]  who played her game.
[13:21.040 --> 13:22.800]  So I'm very much looking forward to it.
[13:22.800 --> 13:25.040]  Bunny Park and Alchemy Storia are the other two games.
[13:25.040 --> 13:26.000]  That's the one I was thinking of.
[13:26.000 --> 13:26.500]  But yeah.
[13:27.920 --> 13:28.420]  Awesome.
[13:29.600 --> 13:30.640]  What else have we got?
[13:30.640 --> 13:31.280]  Fabledom.
[13:31.280 --> 13:36.400]  So they went into early access last month, I think.
[13:37.360 --> 13:40.320]  They have outlined their roadmap for the early access.
[13:40.960 --> 13:43.840]  So it looks like they have a number of updates detailed
[13:43.840 --> 13:44.960]  and what they're going to add in.
[13:44.960 --> 13:47.040]  Obviously, they don't have timings because that is silly.
[13:47.040 --> 13:49.600]  Don't add timings for a huge long roadmap like that.
[13:52.480 --> 13:54.320]  But it looks like there's also another update coming,
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.200]  which is unannounced at this point.
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.880]  It just says to be revealed at the bottom.
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.000]  So if you're interested in Fabledom or you're playing it
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.160]  or whatever, the roadmap is out now.
[14:04.160 --> 14:05.040]  I'm interested.
[14:05.040 --> 14:05.920]  I haven't played it.
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.880]  I will probably wait.
[14:08.880 --> 14:11.920]  I just saw the quest system isn't out yet, even.
[14:11.920 --> 14:14.800]  So yeah, I'll probably wait for that to cook in the oven
[14:14.800 --> 14:15.300]  a little more.
[14:16.560 --> 14:18.080]  Of course you're interested.
[14:18.080 --> 14:18.960]  It's a city builder.
[14:18.960 --> 14:23.200]  What city builder are you interested in?
[14:23.200 --> 14:24.320]  Guilty as charged.
[14:26.720 --> 14:27.440]  All right.
[14:27.680 --> 14:28.880]  Next, big thing.
[14:28.880 --> 14:30.240]  Paleo Pines.
[14:30.240 --> 14:32.160]  So this is the dinosaur farming game
[14:32.160 --> 14:34.320]  where you're farming with your dinosaurs.
[14:34.320 --> 14:36.000]  I didn't see what I was looking at next.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.360]  But yeah, I was about to say.
[14:37.360 --> 14:40.160]  Speaking of games I'm interested in.
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.440]  They have detailed their accessibility options
[14:45.440 --> 14:48.160]  and considerations because they're not all options,
[14:48.160 --> 14:50.160]  which is where I find this interesting.
[14:50.160 --> 14:52.560]  So we obviously, on this podcast,
[14:52.560 --> 14:55.360]  we appreciate when there are accessibility options.
[14:55.360 --> 14:56.800]  And we call that out when there are
[14:56.880 --> 14:57.680]  and when there aren't.
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.000]  So it's always good to call it out when there are
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.920]  and celebrate when people are doing good things.
[15:02.480 --> 15:04.400]  So they have a bunch of things.
[15:04.400 --> 15:07.840]  So first of all, they've kind of thought about dyslexia
[15:07.840 --> 15:09.520]  from the get go because they do have
[15:09.520 --> 15:11.120]  a dyslexic person on a team.
[15:11.120 --> 15:13.600]  I always say it's important to have lots of different people
[15:13.600 --> 15:15.600]  on the teams because then you actually think about things
[15:16.960 --> 15:18.400]  that you otherwise wouldn't think about.
[15:19.600 --> 15:20.320]  Oh boy.
[15:21.200 --> 15:23.360]  I'm just not getting to other news,
[15:23.360 --> 15:25.040]  but like some of those big companies
[15:25.040 --> 15:26.720]  could learn a lesson from that,
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.960]  Pop, Activision, Blizzard, Koff.
[15:31.520 --> 15:32.880]  And they're big enough to have enough
[15:33.520 --> 15:38.400]  to probably have most people with most differences
[15:38.400 --> 15:41.600]  in the company and they can't deal with things properly.
[15:41.600 --> 15:44.720]  I bet they have a significant...
[15:44.720 --> 15:45.760]  Well, maybe not.
[15:45.760 --> 15:46.240]  I don't know.
[15:47.040 --> 15:48.240]  If they do, they don't.
[15:48.240 --> 15:50.800]  The people who should care don't care.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.840]  But that's neither here nor there.
[15:53.920 --> 15:56.720]  Paleopines does care and we applaud them for that.
[15:56.720 --> 15:57.280]  Yes.
[15:57.280 --> 15:58.320]  Do we have an update?
[15:58.320 --> 15:58.880]  I don't remember.
[15:58.880 --> 15:59.680]  Is this game out?
[15:59.680 --> 16:00.480]  I want this game.
[16:01.200 --> 16:01.760]  Coming soon.
[16:02.800 --> 16:03.600]  Coming soon, yeah.
[16:04.560 --> 16:07.600]  So the second thing which I think is really interesting
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.600]  is they don't have a colorblindness option,
[16:09.600 --> 16:11.760]  but they have chosen their colors
[16:11.760 --> 16:14.320]  with colorblindness in consideration.
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.200]  So the idea is that they don't need a colorblindness option
[16:17.200 --> 16:19.280]  because everybody should be able to notice the differences
[16:19.280 --> 16:21.040]  because there are colors that can do that,
[16:21.040 --> 16:22.000]  that fit all the...
[16:22.000 --> 16:22.800]  Because there's lots of different...
[16:22.800 --> 16:26.160]  There's like five or six different colorblindness standards.
[16:27.200 --> 16:30.320]  And obviously, each of them is a bit of a spectrum,
[16:30.320 --> 16:32.640]  but individually, I think they're quite different
[16:32.640 --> 16:35.760]  because it's about different things that are wrong with your eye.
[16:35.760 --> 16:38.080]  Like you might not have the right number of cones
[16:38.080 --> 16:41.040]  or I'm not a doctor, but it's stuff like that.
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.000]  And so, yeah, they have chosen colors with that in mind,
[16:46.640 --> 16:48.800]  which I think is definitely the better way to do it,
[16:48.800 --> 16:49.520]  if you can do it.
[16:50.240 --> 16:51.920]  A colorblindness option is fine.
[16:51.920 --> 16:52.560]  It does the job.
[16:53.360 --> 16:56.000]  It's good not to have to make people turn on options,
[16:56.000 --> 16:57.280]  if you can, I think.
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.680]  That's food for thought.
[17:01.440 --> 17:03.280]  Probably a discussion too long for here.
[17:04.240 --> 17:07.280]  It is interesting because you don't see this that often,
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.880]  where people or a game studio designs it from the get-go.
[17:10.880 --> 17:13.520]  So that is interesting to compare and see.
[17:14.720 --> 17:17.360]  But yeah, but the fact that they're thinking about it,
[17:17.360 --> 17:18.320]  like major props for that.
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.200]  So good for them.
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.080]  Yep, yep.
[17:20.080 --> 17:24.480]  And this stuff is in it from before Early Access,
[17:25.280 --> 17:26.960]  which I don't know, are they doing Early Access?
[17:26.960 --> 17:27.520]  It doesn't say.
[17:27.520 --> 17:29.680]  But the point is they haven't released a version and gone,
[17:29.680 --> 17:31.040]  ah, but this one isn't accessible,
[17:31.600 --> 17:34.400]  which always feels a little bit meh when people are like,
[17:34.400 --> 17:36.160]  yeah, here's a game that you can't play yet.
[17:38.960 --> 17:39.600]  You know what?
[17:40.240 --> 17:42.640]  I mean, that happens a lot too, though,
[17:42.640 --> 17:47.120]  for other big companies and not even accessibility reasons.
[17:47.680 --> 17:48.880]  Looking at you, Redfall.
[17:50.240 --> 17:52.240]  No, you're absolutely right.
[17:52.240 --> 17:55.440]  And it's why I get a bit grumpy when Early Access versions
[17:55.440 --> 17:57.520]  don't have controller support and stuff like that,
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.360]  because you're reducing things massively.
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.600]  There's lots of people that need controllers for accessibility,
[18:05.600 --> 18:08.160]  not just for, I want to play on my Steam Deck, right?
[18:08.160 --> 18:09.520]  Because you can deal around those things.
[18:09.520 --> 18:12.080]  But people have physical disabilities.
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.760]  That means they can't use a mouse and a keyboard
[18:13.760 --> 18:14.640]  and stuff like that.
[18:14.640 --> 18:17.680]  So not having that at the beginning always annoys me.
[18:17.680 --> 18:21.120]  As a side note, you mentioned this for Early Access.
[18:24.080 --> 18:26.880]  I remember Bed and Breakfast didn't release
[18:26.880 --> 18:28.800]  the full version with controller support.
[18:29.520 --> 18:30.000]  Oh, yeah.
[18:31.840 --> 18:33.440]  You can tell that game was developed
[18:33.440 --> 18:34.960]  before the Steam Deck came out.
[18:34.960 --> 18:37.840]  That's not happening with any games ever again.
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.600]  Yeah, because guess what?
[18:39.600 --> 18:43.200]  Roots of Pacha came out, and it is a joy
[18:43.200 --> 18:44.960]  to have controller support from the start.
[18:45.760 --> 18:48.400]  Let me tell you, that helped my review a lot.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.520]  Anyways, but yeah.
[18:50.240 --> 18:51.920]  Good job, paleo pines.
[18:52.800 --> 18:54.400]  Speaking of things that aren't options,
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.400]  that are just there from the beginning,
[18:57.360 --> 18:59.840]  when there are audio elements that are critical,
[19:00.800 --> 19:04.000]  they've included visual cues to help people who can't hear,
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.560]  or with just lower hearing abilities.
[19:06.560 --> 19:07.040]  That's good.
[19:07.040 --> 19:07.840]  Which is good.
[19:07.840 --> 19:10.240]  You should never have something that only relies on one sense
[19:10.240 --> 19:11.840]  to be able to do these things.
[19:12.800 --> 19:16.720]  Except for games, it's difficult to not have visual things.
[19:20.560 --> 19:22.640]  I'm a web developer, so I'm always thinking
[19:22.640 --> 19:23.440]  in these sorts of things.
[19:23.440 --> 19:25.040]  And with web development, it's really easy
[19:25.040 --> 19:27.360]  to make it work for people who can't see.
[19:27.360 --> 19:29.920]  But of course, games is probably a bit more difficult.
[19:29.920 --> 19:32.880]  Yeah, that's a lot.
[19:32.880 --> 19:35.280]  Speaking of which, did you know you can see the transcripts
[19:35.280 --> 19:37.920]  for this audio podcast on the website?
[19:38.560 --> 19:40.240]  Yeah, apparently I forgot to say that in the beginning.
[19:40.240 --> 19:40.960]  It's my word.
[19:40.960 --> 19:42.720]  I'm really not in the habit of saying it yet.
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.720]  Yeah, we need podcast apps to support the transcript option,
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.480]  so it can just happen by default.
[19:56.560 --> 20:00.000]  Because it's in one of the newer RSS standards,
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.920]  but most apps don't support it yet,
[20:01.920 --> 20:03.680]  so I haven't put in the work.
[20:04.960 --> 20:06.800]  And here's one that I've never thought about,
[20:06.800 --> 20:08.240]  which is very interesting.
[20:08.240 --> 20:11.520]  The character speed can be slowed down
[20:11.520 --> 20:14.640]  to increase accuracy for people with fine motor impairments.
[20:14.640 --> 20:17.360]  That's, first of all, yeah, like that's, wow.
[20:17.360 --> 20:20.560]  This is detailed accessibility design.
[20:20.560 --> 20:21.680]  Yeah, right, right.
[20:21.680 --> 20:22.400]  Holy moly.
[20:24.240 --> 20:26.560]  And yeah, I've never thought about that either.
[20:27.520 --> 20:29.600]  Wow, that's a lot.
[20:30.400 --> 20:32.000]  Yeah, I think it's great.
[20:32.720 --> 20:34.000]  I don't know what else to say there.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.840]  Wow, that's impressive.
[20:36.880 --> 20:37.440]  Absolutely.
[20:37.440 --> 20:40.400]  But the fact that they care this much about this,
[20:40.400 --> 20:42.960]  like, I think that gives me high hopes,
[20:42.960 --> 20:48.000]  because I think that correlates in general
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.760]  for the quality of a game,
[20:49.760 --> 20:52.800]  because they care about really fine details.
[20:53.520 --> 20:54.080]  Absolutely.
[20:56.080 --> 21:01.520]  I think this is really good for paleo pines in general,
[21:01.520 --> 21:03.120]  like, looking forward to it.
[21:03.120 --> 21:05.200]  So yeah, I mean, they can take the time,
[21:05.200 --> 21:07.120]  but boy, I can't wait to play this game.
[21:07.200 --> 21:08.720]  I want my dinosaur farm.
[21:08.720 --> 21:09.600]  Absolutely.
[21:09.600 --> 21:12.000]  I want to farm with my dinosaurs.
[21:13.520 --> 21:15.760]  Next, we have a completely different thing.
[21:15.760 --> 21:19.360]  So Go! Go! Town, which we talked about a couple of weeks ago.
[21:19.360 --> 21:20.640]  Was it last week or a couple of weeks ago?
[21:20.640 --> 21:21.440]  Anyway, doesn't matter.
[21:23.120 --> 21:27.600]  This is by the developers of Yonder,
[21:28.160 --> 21:30.000]  the Cloud Cratcher Chronicles,
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.240]  and Grow, Song of the Ever Tree.
[21:32.240 --> 21:33.600]  My word, they're bad at names.
[21:34.720 --> 21:36.560]  This one is a better name, Go! Go! Town.
[21:37.360 --> 21:40.400]  Yeah, I'm sure they'll add on a subtitle at some point
[21:40.400 --> 21:41.200]  and make it a worse name,
[21:41.200 --> 21:42.800]  but this is a good name so far.
[21:42.800 --> 21:43.600]  Go! Go! Town.
[21:43.600 --> 21:45.200]  We're not Animal Crossing.
[21:46.720 --> 21:48.240]  That's a subtitle.
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.640]  Well, look, look, look, look, look.
[21:51.200 --> 21:54.560]  They have added something that I have never considered
[21:55.360 --> 21:56.480]  for a farming game,
[21:56.480 --> 21:59.360]  but now I do not know why nobody has done this.
[21:59.360 --> 22:01.600]  They have added power tools,
[22:01.600 --> 22:03.120]  and let me tell you,
[22:03.760 --> 22:06.480]  this has made my excitement for this game go from,
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.880]  maybe like a three or a four,
[22:08.880 --> 22:09.520]  to a ten.
[22:10.400 --> 22:11.360]  In fact, maybe eleven.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.240]  I am so excited for this game.
[22:14.240 --> 22:16.720]  Not only does it look so much fun just in general,
[22:17.840 --> 22:19.840]  I think this is the first video I've seen of it.
[22:19.840 --> 22:22.480]  I love the graphics and the animations in general
[22:22.480 --> 22:23.200]  are so much fun,
[22:23.200 --> 22:24.560]  but these power tools,
[22:24.560 --> 22:27.520]  they just take the fun to a whole different level.
[22:27.520 --> 22:28.720]  I love it, it's great.
[22:29.920 --> 22:33.840]  That is a fun distinction.
[22:34.720 --> 22:36.640]  Uh, one thing I will say from the video,
[22:36.640 --> 22:38.000]  that is some bigger music.
[22:38.720 --> 22:40.320]  Um, they have a leaf blower!
[22:40.320 --> 22:41.760]  That's an interesting one.
[22:41.760 --> 22:42.880]  Yeah, yeah!
[22:42.880 --> 22:46.080]  You don't need to sickle the grass away,
[22:46.080 --> 22:46.960]  just blow it.
[22:46.960 --> 22:48.480]  Oh my gosh, you can blow the cow!
[22:48.480 --> 22:50.000]  I'm looking at the trailer and just,
[22:50.000 --> 22:51.600]  boof, blows the cow away.
[22:51.600 --> 22:52.720]  Um, this is,
[22:53.360 --> 22:55.280]  it does, it's a good look for it, I will say.
[22:55.280 --> 22:56.640]  Like you said, um,
[22:56.640 --> 22:58.880]  yeah, you don't see this in Cottagecore games,
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.000]  power tools and whatnot.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.120]  Yeah, well this is the thing,
[23:01.120 --> 23:03.200]  I haven't checked every single game,
[23:03.280 --> 23:05.280]  but I'm sure I've never seen this,
[23:05.280 --> 23:08.080]  and listeners, if you know of a farming game
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.440]  that has power tools,
[23:09.440 --> 23:10.640]  please tell me, because I've never,
[23:11.360 --> 23:13.200]  I've never even considered it before.
[23:13.200 --> 23:15.280]  How have I never thought about this?
[23:15.840 --> 23:17.920]  One, yeah, I don't know,
[23:17.920 --> 23:20.720]  it's really interesting to think about.
[23:21.760 --> 23:25.120]  One, uh, one thing I also note about this,
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.960]  that it really helps the game,
[23:26.960 --> 23:30.000]  like, the game feels a lot more dynamic,
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.160]  like, everything's kind of bouncy,
[23:32.240 --> 23:33.200]  for lack of a better word,
[23:33.200 --> 23:34.960]  you know, like, you start up a chainsaw
[23:34.960 --> 23:36.720]  and it rumbles because the motor's going.
[23:36.720 --> 23:37.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.680]  There's the walk kind of bounce.
[23:39.680 --> 23:41.520]  Yeah, the way you're walking is so much fun.
[23:42.080 --> 23:45.600]  Yeah, um, so it's better than just the usual
[23:45.600 --> 23:47.200]  chop chop chop of an axe, right?
[23:47.200 --> 23:47.600]  Definitely.
[23:47.600 --> 23:49.600]  So that is a good look at us.
[23:49.600 --> 23:52.080]  Um, yeah, that's a good,
[23:52.080 --> 23:53.360]  that's really cool.
[23:53.360 --> 23:55.040]  This game, I don't,
[23:55.040 --> 23:57.680]  I'm a little eh on the art style,
[23:57.680 --> 23:59.280]  but the animation,
[23:59.280 --> 24:00.240]  Oh really? Interesting.
[24:00.240 --> 24:02.160]  The, well, okay, there's not,
[24:02.160 --> 24:04.160]  it's not bad, but it really feels
[24:04.160 --> 24:05.680]  like an Animal Crossing to me.
[24:06.560 --> 24:08.080]  Um, I don't know, it feels,
[24:08.080 --> 24:09.360]  it feels much more cartoony
[24:09.360 --> 24:10.560]  than Animal Crossing to me.
[24:10.560 --> 24:12.400]  Somewhere between Animal Crossing
[24:12.400 --> 24:14.000]  and Link's Awakening, um.
[24:14.640 --> 24:16.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:17.280 --> 24:20.400]  It's just that it's just a version design,
[24:20.400 --> 24:22.640]  I think is, I can't stop looking at,
[24:22.640 --> 24:24.480]  um, but, uh, but no, you're right.
[24:25.520 --> 24:27.280]  Is it their overly simplified faces?
[24:27.280 --> 24:28.160]  Is that the issue?
[24:28.160 --> 24:28.880]  I think so.
[24:28.880 --> 24:30.080]  Something about the proportions
[24:30.080 --> 24:31.200]  just really is really similar,
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.920]  but, um, but I mean, overall though,
[24:33.920 --> 24:36.800]  um, it's, even with that,
[24:37.600 --> 24:38.800]  it's really selling itself
[24:38.800 --> 24:40.160]  with all this stuff we're talking about,
[24:40.160 --> 24:42.480]  because you're carrying like this huge basket
[24:42.480 --> 24:44.000]  and this huge chainsaw,
[24:44.000 --> 24:44.880]  you're running around
[24:44.880 --> 24:47.280]  and there's all these machines and baskets
[24:47.280 --> 24:48.720]  and oh, there's a lot going on,
[24:48.720 --> 24:50.080]  um, but in a good way.
[24:50.640 --> 24:51.680]  Um, it looks,
[24:51.680 --> 24:53.200]  Yes, it doesn't feel overwhelming.
[24:53.200 --> 24:54.960]  It just, it feels like they're going fast
[24:54.960 --> 24:56.000]  because they want to,
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.360]  not because they have to.
[24:57.360 --> 24:58.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[24:59.120 --> 25:00.560]  Which feels like a really nice balance
[25:00.560 --> 25:00.960]  because you know,
[25:00.960 --> 25:02.560]  I don't like games where you have to go fast.
[25:02.560 --> 25:03.680]  Like they stress me out,
[25:03.680 --> 25:05.680]  but if I can go fast, I'm going fast.
[25:06.240 --> 25:06.880]  Yep, yep, yep.
[25:07.520 --> 25:09.760]  Um, so yeah, no, this is again,
[25:09.760 --> 25:11.920]  what a good look for, uh, just like paleo pines.
[25:11.920 --> 25:14.560]  This is a pretty good look for, uh, go, go town.
[25:14.560 --> 25:16.800]  So we'll be keeping an eye on it.
[25:16.800 --> 25:18.480]  It does excite me more like,
[25:18.480 --> 25:20.320]  like you, maybe not an 11 quite like you,
[25:20.320 --> 25:23.120]  but, uh, I'm definitely a lot more interested.
[25:23.120 --> 25:24.960]  I'm seriously considering it as opposed to,
[25:24.960 --> 25:26.320]  I forgot what this game was
[25:26.320 --> 25:27.600]  before we talked about it.
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.360]  Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely.
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.080]  I, I would be very surprised if anybody
[25:32.080 --> 25:33.360]  like looks at this trailer
[25:33.360 --> 25:35.280]  and isn't more excited about the game
[25:35.280 --> 25:36.400]  than before they watched it.
[25:37.520 --> 25:38.160]  Yeah.
[25:38.160 --> 25:39.360]  You know, even, even if that's not
[25:39.360 --> 25:40.880]  a huge amount more, right?
[25:40.880 --> 25:42.480]  It's, it's, I think everybody's
[25:42.480 --> 25:43.840]  going to be increased slightly.
[25:43.840 --> 25:45.760]  I think it's just so much fun.
[25:45.760 --> 25:49.520]  Yep. Um, and also just a note,
[25:49.520 --> 25:52.960]  uh, there is a, to use their quote,
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.000]  super early pre-alpha digital demo.
[25:56.400 --> 25:58.400]  Unfortunately for listeners,
[25:58.400 --> 25:59.760]  it ends on May 14th,
[25:59.760 --> 26:01.440]  which is only a day after this recording,
[26:01.440 --> 26:03.840]  but before this podcast releases.
[26:03.840 --> 26:05.600]  So travel back in time
[26:05.600 --> 26:07.200]  and get the demo if you can.
[26:09.280 --> 26:11.920]  But it's, it's still really early.
[26:11.920 --> 26:14.720]  Um, so there'll be plenty of more times
[26:14.720 --> 26:16.160]  to opportunities to play it later
[26:16.160 --> 26:18.320]  and with bugs ironed out and whatnot.
[26:18.320 --> 26:21.200]  So good for you Prideful Sloth game.
[26:21.200 --> 26:21.840]  Exciting.
[26:22.480 --> 26:25.280]  Um, and our final piece of news
[26:25.280 --> 26:26.960]  is Farming Simulator
[26:26.960 --> 26:27.840]  because we can't get enough
[26:27.840 --> 26:29.760]  of Farming Simulator on this podcast.
[26:29.760 --> 26:32.640]  I was thinking the one that might have
[26:32.640 --> 26:34.240]  power tools that we didn't know about
[26:34.240 --> 26:35.120]  is Farming Simulator.
[26:35.120 --> 26:35.840]  That's true.
[26:35.840 --> 26:37.200]  That is a very good point.
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.200]  That is a very good point.
[26:39.200 --> 26:40.480]  Yep. We'll have to ask Johnny.
[26:44.480 --> 26:47.120]  So they've released in beta
[26:47.120 --> 26:48.560]  a new competitive mode
[26:49.360 --> 26:51.120]  for their esports competitions.
[26:51.680 --> 26:52.320]  Oh, yeah.
[26:52.320 --> 26:54.720]  With bail stacking.
[26:55.360 --> 26:56.720]  Oh, yeah.
[26:59.520 --> 27:00.720]  And like, I mean, like,
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.560]  I'm not a huge fan of Farming Simulator,
[27:02.560 --> 27:03.920]  but I love that they're leaning
[27:03.920 --> 27:05.360]  into what they're good at.
[27:05.360 --> 27:07.520]  And like the esports stuff is,
[27:07.520 --> 27:09.280]  it looks, it looks fun, right?
[27:09.280 --> 27:09.920]  It's the one thing
[27:09.920 --> 27:11.600]  I could probably get into not playing,
[27:11.600 --> 27:13.120]  but watching the,
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.560]  the Farming Simulator esports.
[27:14.560 --> 27:15.520]  Like it sounds like
[27:15.520 --> 27:17.040]  it would be fun to watch.
[27:17.600 --> 27:20.400]  It's yeah, like it's such a weird
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.240]  niche thing, but I love it
[27:24.240 --> 27:25.280]  that they're leaning into it.
[27:25.280 --> 27:25.840]  Like you said.
[27:26.720 --> 27:27.840]  Are you familiar with Evo?
[27:27.840 --> 27:28.800]  Do you know what Evo is?
[27:29.840 --> 27:31.200]  Not off the top of my head.
[27:31.200 --> 27:31.600]  Okay.
[27:31.600 --> 27:34.560]  It's the premier fighting game event.
[27:35.360 --> 27:36.880]  Like, okay.
[27:36.880 --> 27:37.440]  Annual.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.240]  I'm aware of it.
[27:38.240 --> 27:39.600]  I'm aware of it as a concept.
[27:39.600 --> 27:41.040]  I don't think I've ever watched it.
[27:41.040 --> 27:42.400]  It's not a specific game.
[27:42.400 --> 27:44.160]  It's like, okay, here's all the big games.
[27:44.160 --> 27:45.440]  We're doing the big tournament
[27:45.440 --> 27:46.160]  for all of them, right?
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.280]  I want to see that for farming games
[27:49.280 --> 27:50.000]  at some point.
[27:50.640 --> 27:52.080]  Let's get to that point.
[27:52.080 --> 27:53.360]  Farming Simulator is leading the way,
[27:53.360 --> 27:54.960]  but we can work with this.
[27:54.960 --> 27:55.840]  We can get there.
[27:57.040 --> 27:57.540]  Yeah.
[27:58.160 --> 27:58.880]  Awesome.
[27:58.880 --> 27:59.360]  All right.
[27:59.360 --> 27:59.920]  All right.
[27:59.920 --> 28:01.120]  So that's all the news.
[28:01.760 --> 28:03.760]  So next we're going to have
[28:03.760 --> 28:05.600]  Kevin's interview with Valerie.
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.680]  And yeah, I don't know.
[28:09.680 --> 28:10.480]  Probably not much to say
[28:10.480 --> 28:11.440]  about that beforehand.
[28:11.440 --> 28:13.040]  Hope you enjoy the interview.
[28:13.040 --> 28:13.760]  Yeah, it's great.
[28:20.000 --> 28:27.840]  Hello, farmers, witches,
[28:27.840 --> 28:29.200]  and all you wonderful listeners.
[28:29.200 --> 28:30.880]  I'm Kevin, and I've got a very
[28:30.880 --> 28:32.640]  special treat for us all.
[28:32.640 --> 28:34.480]  I am here with someone
[28:34.480 --> 28:36.000]  truly born to be wild.
[28:36.640 --> 28:38.880]  One, Ms. Valerie Rose Lohman,
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.440]  the voice of Tara Wild herself.
[28:41.440 --> 28:42.160]  Hello.
[28:42.160 --> 28:42.560]  Hello.
[28:42.560 --> 28:43.840]  I'm so happy to be here.
[28:44.480 --> 28:47.360]  It's we thank you for being on Valerie.
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.440]  I've talked about wildflowers
[28:51.440 --> 28:52.800]  at length on this show.
[28:52.800 --> 28:54.320]  Multiple episodes solely
[28:54.320 --> 28:55.280]  dedicated to it.
[28:56.160 --> 28:57.680]  So to have the star herself
[28:57.680 --> 28:59.360]  here is beyond thrilling.
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.400]  That makes me so happy.
[29:00.400 --> 29:01.920]  I am so glad to like,
[29:02.720 --> 29:04.080]  this is my first podcast
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.440]  talking about wildflowers.
[29:05.440 --> 29:07.120]  So I'm thrilled to be here.
[29:07.120 --> 29:07.620]  Yeah.
[29:08.320 --> 29:09.600]  Oh, that's exciting.
[29:09.600 --> 29:10.100]  Oh, man.
[29:11.440 --> 29:12.320]  Al isn't with us,
[29:12.320 --> 29:13.840]  but he will be here.
[29:13.840 --> 29:14.720]  Listen, I'm sure he'll be
[29:14.720 --> 29:15.600]  pumped to hear that.
[29:15.600 --> 29:16.100]  Cool.
[29:17.440 --> 29:18.880]  OK, so I guess
[29:18.880 --> 29:19.600]  why don't you go ahead
[29:19.600 --> 29:20.480]  and tell us about yourself,
[29:20.480 --> 29:21.200]  you know, your career,
[29:21.200 --> 29:22.320]  et cetera, whatever.
[29:22.320 --> 29:23.280]  How did you like to
[29:23.280 --> 29:24.000]  introduce yourself
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.280]  to our listeners and such?
[29:25.280 --> 29:26.880]  Yeah, so my name is
[29:26.880 --> 29:28.080]  Valerie Rose Lohman.
[29:28.080 --> 29:31.040]  I am an actor and voiceover artist.
[29:31.040 --> 29:32.400]  I am born and raised
[29:32.400 --> 29:33.520]  in Southern California.
[29:33.520 --> 29:34.720]  I live in L.A. now,
[29:34.720 --> 29:36.080]  but I grew up out in the
[29:36.720 --> 29:38.640]  Inland Empire in Orange County.
[29:40.160 --> 29:41.040]  I started working
[29:41.040 --> 29:42.000]  when I was 14,
[29:42.000 --> 29:42.640]  doing a lot of like
[29:42.640 --> 29:43.840]  regional theater and stuff,
[29:43.840 --> 29:45.040]  and I fell into voiceover
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.000]  a couple of years ago.
[29:46.880 --> 29:48.480]  I love it.
[29:48.480 --> 29:49.920]  It's one of my favorite things
[29:49.920 --> 29:51.600]  in the whole wide world to do.
[29:53.600 --> 29:56.080]  Yeah, I just adore acting.
[29:56.080 --> 29:56.960]  I have a puppy.
[29:56.960 --> 29:57.920]  Her name is Wendy.
[29:57.920 --> 29:59.280]  She just turned four.
[29:59.280 --> 30:00.320]  She's a multi family.
[30:00.880 --> 30:02.240]  Yeah, and I think that's
[30:02.240 --> 30:03.920]  kind of like covers the basics.
[30:03.920 --> 30:05.920]  Yeah, very cool.
[30:05.920 --> 30:06.720]  Very cool.
[30:06.720 --> 30:08.160]  So from Southern Cali, huh?
[30:08.160 --> 30:09.520]  I was I'm actually from
[30:09.520 --> 30:10.480]  there originally myself.
[30:10.480 --> 30:11.760]  I'm from Santa Maria.
[30:11.760 --> 30:12.260]  Oh, cool.
[30:13.440 --> 30:15.520]  But yeah, very, very cool.
[30:16.080 --> 30:19.120]  I follow a handful of voice
[30:19.120 --> 30:20.000]  actors and such.
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.200]  I'm a big fan of
[30:21.840 --> 30:23.440]  the voice acting industry,
[30:23.440 --> 30:24.160]  that world.
[30:24.160 --> 30:25.200]  A lot of you people are
[30:25.200 --> 30:26.160]  absolutely, absolutely
[30:26.160 --> 30:26.960]  wonderful people.
[30:29.680 --> 30:32.640]  And yeah, so Wildflowers, right?
[30:32.640 --> 30:33.760]  So on this show,
[30:33.760 --> 30:36.480]  we cover all sorts of farming
[30:36.480 --> 30:37.680]  and cottagecore games,
[30:37.680 --> 30:39.280]  as the genre is called, right?
[30:39.280 --> 30:40.720]  But Wildflowers is,
[30:40.720 --> 30:42.720]  I think, the first one
[30:42.720 --> 30:44.640]  to be fully voice acted like this.
[30:44.640 --> 30:45.440]  So, you know.
[30:45.440 --> 30:45.940]  Yeah.
[30:46.800 --> 30:48.080]  You and the rest of the cast
[30:48.080 --> 30:50.560]  did an absolutely impeccable job.
[30:50.560 --> 30:53.200]  I think that it's definitely
[30:53.200 --> 30:54.240]  one of the strongest selling
[30:54.240 --> 30:54.800]  points of the game,
[30:54.800 --> 30:56.000]  really makes it comes to life.
[30:56.560 --> 30:57.760]  So thank you very much
[30:57.760 --> 30:59.280]  for all your hard work on the game.
[30:59.280 --> 30:59.840]  Thank you.
[30:59.840 --> 31:00.560]  Excellent, excellent job.
[31:00.560 --> 31:04.000]  I have never been in a cast
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.440]  for a VO job with
[31:05.440 --> 31:06.800]  like this large a cast.
[31:06.800 --> 31:08.720]  I think we have near 30 actors
[31:08.720 --> 31:09.600]  or something like that.
[31:10.240 --> 31:10.800]  Wow.
[31:10.800 --> 31:13.120]  Yeah, big, big, big game.
[31:13.120 --> 31:14.160]  It's very cool
[31:14.240 --> 31:16.480]  because you don't get
[31:16.480 --> 31:17.360]  that kind of cast
[31:18.800 --> 31:19.760]  for farming games
[31:19.760 --> 31:21.600]  or especially for games
[31:21.600 --> 31:23.200]  that start out only on mobile
[31:23.200 --> 31:24.000]  and stuff like that.
[31:24.640 --> 31:26.720]  So it's been such a treat.
[31:26.720 --> 31:27.120]  Yeah.
[31:27.120 --> 31:28.320]  Why don't you tell us about that?
[31:28.800 --> 31:30.560]  How did you end up as Tara?
[31:30.560 --> 31:31.680]  Like what was the history?
[31:31.680 --> 31:33.680]  How did you get contacted
[31:33.680 --> 31:35.760]  or did you take your audition?
[31:35.760 --> 31:38.400]  Yeah, so I auditioned
[31:38.400 --> 31:40.800]  in November of 2020
[31:41.440 --> 31:43.120]  and I remember
[31:43.120 --> 31:44.320]  reading the breakdown
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.360]  and it was about like,
[31:45.360 --> 31:46.560]  you know, this girl
[31:46.560 --> 31:47.840]  has recently gone through a breakup.
[31:47.840 --> 31:50.240]  She's moved home to her grandma.
[31:50.240 --> 31:51.520]  I had recently gone through
[31:51.520 --> 31:53.680]  like a really big breakup
[31:53.680 --> 31:54.880]  and had moved myself.
[31:54.880 --> 31:56.400]  So I was like, oh my gosh,
[31:56.400 --> 31:58.080]  I totally relate to this girl.
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.440]  I just thought the writing
[32:01.440 --> 32:03.520]  was so fun.
[32:04.880 --> 32:06.560]  I had this great audition scene
[32:06.560 --> 32:07.840]  that I don't think made it in
[32:09.360 --> 32:10.960]  where like Tara first starts
[32:10.960 --> 32:13.120]  to discover her grandma's
[32:13.120 --> 32:14.240]  like witchy items
[32:14.240 --> 32:15.360]  and she's realizing,
[32:15.360 --> 32:16.800]  oh, my grandma's not quite
[32:16.800 --> 32:18.080]  like a regular grandma.
[32:19.040 --> 32:20.720]  And I just, you know,
[32:20.720 --> 32:21.840]  there's this thing that has happened
[32:21.840 --> 32:23.120]  to me a couple of times in my life
[32:23.120 --> 32:25.600]  where when I'm auditioning,
[32:25.600 --> 32:27.600]  I'll get chills and like
[32:27.600 --> 32:28.720]  if I get those chills,
[32:28.720 --> 32:30.640]  usually it means I've booked it
[32:30.640 --> 32:32.240]  or like I'm going to get it
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.920]  and that happened with this.
[32:33.920 --> 32:35.680]  But then I didn't hear for months.
[32:36.240 --> 32:38.160]  I auditioned in November 2020
[32:38.640 --> 32:41.040]  just like remotely.
[32:41.040 --> 32:42.640]  I got the audition for my agent
[32:42.640 --> 32:47.440]  and I got a call back late February 2021
[32:48.080 --> 32:49.680]  and then I had a Zoom call
[32:49.680 --> 32:51.200]  with Chrissy Abejos,
[32:51.200 --> 32:54.160]  who is our amazing director.
[32:55.040 --> 32:57.440]  And I found out two hours later
[32:57.440 --> 32:58.720]  that I had gotten it,
[32:58.720 --> 32:59.760]  which was, yeah.
[32:59.760 --> 33:01.600]  Oh man, that's exciting, right?
[33:02.880 --> 33:05.120]  And yeah, and so 2020,
[33:05.120 --> 33:07.680]  so we were already in pandemic at the time.
[33:07.680 --> 33:10.400]  So yeah, that's very cool.
[33:12.080 --> 33:14.960]  I guess, sorry, one second.
[33:14.960 --> 33:17.280]  So actually on that note of the pandemic,
[33:17.280 --> 33:19.040]  I know so many voice actors
[33:19.040 --> 33:20.080]  and such went remote.
[33:20.080 --> 33:21.840]  Did you ever get a chance to interact
[33:21.840 --> 33:23.440]  with any other of the cast members
[33:23.440 --> 33:24.800]  or did everyone kind of do
[33:24.800 --> 33:26.000]  their own thing separately?
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.520]  We all worked remotely.
[33:28.240 --> 33:30.160]  Sissy Jones, who plays grandma Hazel,
[33:30.160 --> 33:33.200]  did pop into one or two of my sessions,
[33:33.200 --> 33:34.080]  which was very cool
[33:34.080 --> 33:36.640]  because I got to like
[33:36.640 --> 33:37.440]  meet her virtually
[33:37.440 --> 33:39.040]  before I ended up meeting her in person.
[33:39.760 --> 33:43.600]  But we never like worked together
[33:43.600 --> 33:44.560]  in person with the cast.
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.520]  I worked with the engineering team
[33:47.520 --> 33:48.560]  at Rocket Sound,
[33:48.560 --> 33:50.560]  who's just the loveliest people
[33:51.920 --> 33:52.800]  head by Z,
[33:52.800 --> 33:54.720]  who is like one of my favorite
[33:54.720 --> 33:55.680]  engineers to work with.
[33:57.920 --> 34:00.080]  Yeah, we did not meet in person
[34:00.080 --> 34:01.600]  until we did a cast meet up
[34:01.600 --> 34:03.760]  after the game had come out for everyone.
[34:03.760 --> 34:04.800]  Okay, okay.
[34:04.800 --> 34:05.440]  Yeah.
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.320]  That's absolutely fascinating, right?
[34:08.320 --> 34:09.200]  Because I mean,
[34:09.200 --> 34:12.240]  I know some recordings already
[34:12.240 --> 34:13.600]  kind of were like that
[34:13.600 --> 34:15.200]  with today's technology beforehand,
[34:15.200 --> 34:17.520]  but that's so crazy to think
[34:17.520 --> 34:19.040]  everyone just making this happen
[34:19.040 --> 34:21.360]  from their own homes or remotely or whatever.
[34:21.360 --> 34:21.760]  Yeah.
[34:21.760 --> 34:23.120]  Because yeah,
[34:23.120 --> 34:25.440]  shout out to Drydock Studios
[34:25.440 --> 34:26.640]  and the engineering team
[34:26.640 --> 34:27.440]  and the voice director
[34:27.440 --> 34:29.760]  because it came out phenomenal.
[34:29.760 --> 34:32.240]  I think all the voice direction
[34:32.240 --> 34:33.360]  and performances were just
[34:33.360 --> 34:34.640]  absolutely stellar, right?
[34:34.640 --> 34:36.560]  And I'm not saying that just because of,
[34:37.440 --> 34:38.240]  again, you know,
[34:38.800 --> 34:41.200]  it's not common in this genre or whatever,
[34:41.200 --> 34:44.000]  but like I like to,
[34:44.800 --> 34:45.120]  you know,
[34:45.120 --> 34:48.480]  analyze or appreciate the voice acting
[34:48.480 --> 34:49.920]  in a lot of different games and whatnot.
[34:50.720 --> 34:51.680]  And I think you guys did
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.560]  absolutely stellar job.
[34:52.560 --> 34:54.160]  I love all the little emotions
[34:54.160 --> 34:56.160]  and little nuances
[34:56.160 --> 34:58.080]  that go into the performances.
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.040]  It's great.
[34:59.040 --> 35:00.800]  And would you believe it was Kritzia
[35:00.800 --> 35:01.440]  who again,
[35:01.440 --> 35:02.560]  our fearless director,
[35:02.560 --> 35:05.040]  it was her first directing job.
[35:05.600 --> 35:06.080]  Wow.
[35:06.080 --> 35:08.000]  And you would never have guessed that
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.960]  based on like how we as the actors
[35:10.960 --> 35:11.920]  got to interact with her
[35:11.920 --> 35:13.200]  because I have a ton of friends in the cast
[35:13.200 --> 35:15.280]  and they've all told me the same thing.
[35:15.280 --> 35:16.880]  She just handles herself
[35:16.880 --> 35:18.560]  as such an experienced
[35:20.640 --> 35:22.560]  and like confident director
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.200]  that we never,
[35:25.200 --> 35:26.080]  at least I can,
[35:26.080 --> 35:27.760]  I guess I can only speak for myself.
[35:27.760 --> 35:30.880]  I always felt completely at ease
[35:30.880 --> 35:33.440]  and safe and just trusting her direction
[35:33.440 --> 35:34.240]  and her vision
[35:34.240 --> 35:36.160]  and like what she wanted to get from me.
[35:37.840 --> 35:38.720]  And when I found out
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.160]  it was her first directing job,
[35:40.160 --> 35:42.720]  obviously she's an incredibly accomplished
[35:42.720 --> 35:44.480]  voice actress and on-camera actress,
[35:45.920 --> 35:48.720]  but I was just blown away
[35:48.720 --> 35:50.480]  that it was her first directing job.
[35:50.480 --> 35:50.880]  Yeah.
[35:50.880 --> 35:51.680]  I, wow.
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.680]  I never would have guessed that myself.
[35:53.680 --> 35:54.320]  Wow.
[35:54.320 --> 35:54.640]  Yeah.
[35:54.640 --> 35:55.840]  That's amazing.
[35:55.840 --> 35:56.800]  Major props to her.
[35:56.800 --> 35:58.480]  I cannot wait to see what she does next.
[35:58.480 --> 36:00.080]  I think she's going to be a really big deal
[36:00.080 --> 36:01.360]  in the directing world.
[36:01.360 --> 36:01.920]  Oh man.
[36:01.920 --> 36:03.120]  I'm excited too.
[36:03.120 --> 36:04.480]  That's fantastic.
[36:06.640 --> 36:08.480]  Now I know voice actors
[36:08.480 --> 36:11.440]  and such are generally really busy people,
[36:12.160 --> 36:13.840]  but have you ever gotten a moment
[36:13.840 --> 36:15.360]  to actually sit down and play the game?
[36:15.920 --> 36:18.320]  I own the game.
[36:18.320 --> 36:18.960]  I haven't.
[36:18.960 --> 36:20.800]  I have not sat down and played it yet.
[36:21.840 --> 36:23.920]  Part of it is like the game
[36:23.920 --> 36:25.440]  is very emotional for me
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.680]  because I, my own grandma's name
[36:29.680 --> 36:31.440]  is grandma Hazel and she passed away
[36:31.440 --> 36:33.200]  during the recording process.
[36:33.840 --> 36:34.640]  Wait, really?
[36:34.640 --> 36:35.360]  Yeah.
[36:35.360 --> 36:36.480]  No, no way.
[36:36.480 --> 36:38.400]  That's, that's crazy.
[36:38.400 --> 36:40.320]  It was such a weird, I had a,
[36:41.200 --> 36:43.200]  me and a lot of the cast had like
[36:43.200 --> 36:45.600]  weird coincidences with our characters
[36:45.600 --> 36:47.520]  that it was very much like a meant to be thing
[36:48.080 --> 36:49.120]  and I want to play it
[36:49.120 --> 36:50.320]  and I'm so excited to play it
[36:50.320 --> 36:52.000]  and I've watched a ton of the cut scenes,
[36:52.640 --> 36:54.080]  but I also am like,
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.160]  my heart is not quite ready,
[36:57.680 --> 36:59.360]  but I'm excited to start playing it.
[36:59.840 --> 37:01.360]  At some point, probably soon,
[37:01.360 --> 37:02.560]  probably this summer.
[37:02.560 --> 37:03.840]  I don't blame you like,
[37:03.840 --> 37:06.240]  because yeah, I think,
[37:07.120 --> 37:09.600]  especially the Tara and Hazel relationship,
[37:09.600 --> 37:11.120]  I think it's some of the strongest
[37:11.120 --> 37:12.640]  emotional notes in the game, right?
[37:12.640 --> 37:12.640]  Yeah.
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.080]  Um, I'm not going too specific
[37:16.080 --> 37:17.120]  for people who don't play the game,
[37:17.120 --> 37:17.920]  but right, but there's,
[37:18.880 --> 37:21.440]  we've seen towards the end of the game,
[37:21.440 --> 37:23.360]  um, that gives some closure
[37:23.360 --> 37:24.400]  for Tara and Hazel.
[37:24.400 --> 37:27.040]  I hope you know what I'm talking about.
[37:27.040 --> 37:30.880]  That one, that one just hit me right in the gut.
[37:30.880 --> 37:32.160]  Yeah, that one broke my heart.
[37:34.240 --> 37:35.840]  That's incredible though.
[37:35.840 --> 37:36.340]  Yeah.
[37:37.920 --> 37:38.420]  Wow.
[37:39.600 --> 37:40.240]  And on that note,
[37:40.240 --> 37:41.200]  I guess let's talk about
[37:41.200 --> 37:42.720]  Tara herself for a moment.
[37:42.720 --> 37:43.600]  Do you have,
[37:43.600 --> 37:44.880]  what are some of your favorite things
[37:44.880 --> 37:47.600]  about Tara working with the character and such?
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.280]  I love how multi-dimensional she is
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.280]  and how passionate she is
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.080]  and fun and awkward and adorable.
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.760]  And I just think that she is so well fleshed out
[38:01.760 --> 38:04.240]  and she, especially for games,
[38:04.240 --> 38:05.360]  I think is important that we have
[38:05.360 --> 38:08.400]  a really well-rounded player character
[38:08.400 --> 38:10.240]  because we're going to spend,
[38:10.240 --> 38:11.360]  I think there's 80 hours
[38:11.360 --> 38:12.800]  of finished dialogue in this game.
[38:15.280 --> 38:15.840]  Minimum.
[38:15.840 --> 38:16.480]  Yeah.
[38:16.480 --> 38:16.980]  Yeah.
[38:17.280 --> 38:19.040]  So for me,
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.800]  it was knowing that she was very complex.
[38:23.440 --> 38:25.760]  And she was able to have these intricate
[38:25.760 --> 38:27.600]  and interesting and nuanced relationships
[38:27.600 --> 38:29.040]  with each of these characters.
[38:29.600 --> 38:31.600]  And it just, it was a joy to play.
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.400]  Also, Tara is very much like me.
[38:34.400 --> 38:37.200]  The team and I have talked at length about this.
[38:37.200 --> 38:39.600]  Like so much of like the weird,
[38:39.600 --> 38:41.600]  awkward Tara stuff is just stuff
[38:41.600 --> 38:43.520]  that I do in my own personal life.
[38:43.520 --> 38:45.520]  So I've never gotten to play a character
[38:45.520 --> 38:48.240]  as much like me as, as Tara.
[38:48.240 --> 38:50.960]  Well, that's, that's wonderful to hear.
[38:50.960 --> 38:53.360]  I absolutely adore Tara as a character.
[38:53.360 --> 38:54.400]  Like I fully agree.
[38:54.400 --> 38:56.800]  She's wonderfully designed,
[38:56.800 --> 38:58.720]  lots of nuances and complexities
[38:58.720 --> 39:00.880]  to her personality and as a character, right?
[39:02.880 --> 39:05.280]  And I say this as someone who like
[39:05.280 --> 39:07.360]  think characters are among my favorite things
[39:07.360 --> 39:08.800]  in video games in general, right?
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.160]  Like if there's a strong character,
[39:10.160 --> 39:11.760]  I'll go through a bad game even.
[39:11.760 --> 39:12.260]  Yeah.
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.360]  And lost my train of thought here.
[39:18.000 --> 39:18.500]  Oh yes.
[39:18.500 --> 39:19.000]  Yes.
[39:19.540 --> 39:21.860]  One of the, and especially again,
[39:21.860 --> 39:23.700]  in our little corner of the world
[39:23.700 --> 39:24.580]  here on this podcast,
[39:24.580 --> 39:26.740]  farming and object core games, right?
[39:27.540 --> 39:30.100]  A lot of the player characters
[39:30.100 --> 39:32.660]  are silent link slate characters, right?
[39:32.660 --> 39:34.340]  Because, you know, they're trying to
[39:35.620 --> 39:39.140]  let you have that fantasy
[39:39.140 --> 39:40.340]  or however you want to call it, right?
[39:40.340 --> 39:43.060]  The role of owning the farm
[39:43.060 --> 39:44.420]  or doing whatever it is, right?
[39:44.420 --> 39:47.700]  So to have this Tara
[39:47.780 --> 39:49.220]  on the total opposite side
[39:49.220 --> 39:52.900]  where she's a full character on her own
[39:52.900 --> 39:54.580]  with her own likes, dislikes,
[39:54.580 --> 39:55.700]  personality and whatnot.
[39:55.700 --> 39:58.020]  It's really refreshing
[39:58.020 --> 40:00.020]  and incredibly well done.
[40:00.020 --> 40:01.700]  Again, fantastic job on that.
[40:01.700 --> 40:03.540]  Thank you very much for all that work.
[40:03.540 --> 40:03.860]  Thank you.
[40:03.860 --> 40:04.980]  I really appreciate that.
[40:05.620 --> 40:08.100]  Do you have any favorite lines
[40:08.100 --> 40:10.260]  or moments or scenes from the game?
[40:12.740 --> 40:14.660]  Oh gosh, so many.
[40:14.660 --> 40:16.020]  That's hard to pick, I know.
[40:16.020 --> 40:16.820]  It's hard to pick
[40:16.900 --> 40:18.180]  and I'm trying to think of what
[40:18.980 --> 40:20.260]  everything with Grandma Hazel
[40:20.260 --> 40:20.900]  was really fun.
[40:22.260 --> 40:25.700]  I, oh gosh, I love
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.660]  when Tara realizes
[40:28.660 --> 40:31.460]  she can turn into Cleocatra.
[40:32.420 --> 40:35.940]  Like, it's so funny.
[40:35.940 --> 40:37.540]  And I was so excited
[40:37.540 --> 40:38.420]  because they didn't tell me
[40:38.420 --> 40:40.180]  until I started recording that scene
[40:40.180 --> 40:42.340]  that that was going to be a thing in the game.
[40:42.340 --> 40:45.460]  And like that I was just so like,
[40:46.100 --> 40:48.340]  yes, oh my gosh, yes.
[40:48.340 --> 40:51.380]  So it just was purely thrilling
[40:51.380 --> 40:52.580]  and I just thought it was so cute.
[40:53.780 --> 40:54.900]  Yeah, I agree.
[40:54.900 --> 40:56.340]  That whole little scene
[40:56.340 --> 40:58.020]  where they can transform into animals,
[40:58.020 --> 41:00.180]  that was just an absolute delight.
[41:01.620 --> 41:06.100]  And Cleocatra is a runaway star of the show.
[41:06.100 --> 41:08.980]  Oh yeah, the amount of Cleocatra fan art
[41:08.980 --> 41:11.460]  I've seen, I really want them to make
[41:11.460 --> 41:13.220]  like a Cleocatra stuffy
[41:13.220 --> 41:14.100]  or something like that.
[41:14.500 --> 41:16.740]  Or like, because I'd buy it.
[41:16.740 --> 41:18.500]  Yeah, I want it.
[41:19.460 --> 41:21.620]  Oh man, I'd buy it in a heartbeat too.
[41:21.620 --> 41:23.380]  That's that's a genius idea.
[41:25.780 --> 41:26.500]  I'm trying to think
[41:26.500 --> 41:28.020]  some of my favorite moments.
[41:28.020 --> 41:29.300]  Well, obviously.
[41:30.340 --> 41:31.540]  So I've only played
[41:31.540 --> 41:32.660]  through the game once, right?
[41:32.660 --> 41:34.580]  There's like, I can't imagine
[41:34.580 --> 41:35.380]  the amount of dialogue
[41:35.380 --> 41:36.980]  because you had to record for like
[41:37.700 --> 41:38.900]  X number of routes
[41:38.900 --> 41:40.260]  for each spouse and whatnot.
[41:40.260 --> 41:44.100]  So Wesley was my spouse
[41:44.100 --> 41:46.500]  and I like the boop that you do.
[41:47.700 --> 41:49.620]  That you can do later on after mirror.
[41:49.620 --> 41:50.980]  The boop is strong.
[41:50.980 --> 41:53.300]  Those boops were so fun to record.
[41:55.060 --> 41:56.260]  And they're so cute.
[41:56.980 --> 42:00.100]  They are, yeah, right?
[42:00.100 --> 42:02.340]  And exactly like it's these little things
[42:02.340 --> 42:04.420]  that just really sell the game for me
[42:04.420 --> 42:05.380]  and the performances.
[42:07.380 --> 42:09.220]  The number of puns in the game,
[42:09.380 --> 42:11.380]  I know we have Angus like one character
[42:11.380 --> 42:12.020]  all about them,
[42:12.020 --> 42:13.380]  but the number of puns
[42:13.380 --> 42:15.060]  everyone else gets into too
[42:15.060 --> 42:17.300]  is just delightful.
[42:17.300 --> 42:20.660]  Oh yeah, I think it's like a real testament
[42:20.660 --> 42:22.420]  to the writing team who just,
[42:23.060 --> 42:25.540]  they bring so much of their sense of humor.
[42:25.540 --> 42:26.820]  Like they are just,
[42:26.820 --> 42:28.820]  they are that sweet and funny
[42:28.820 --> 42:32.100]  and like adorable in real life.
[42:33.300 --> 42:35.140]  Because we would always have at least
[42:35.140 --> 42:37.140]  one or two of the writers in every session.
[42:37.700 --> 42:42.180]  And I love puns, so I love those.
[42:43.380 --> 42:43.940]  So cute.
[42:45.700 --> 42:46.900]  So I know you haven't played the game,
[42:46.900 --> 42:47.860]  but like there's this,
[42:48.500 --> 42:49.780]  you know, you have a list of quests
[42:49.780 --> 42:50.660]  and missions and whatnot.
[42:50.660 --> 42:53.780]  And I think almost every single title
[42:53.780 --> 42:55.940]  of them is a pun or reference or something.
[42:55.940 --> 42:57.380]  Yes, I love that.
[42:57.380 --> 42:58.580]  They had an absolute ball.
[43:00.340 --> 43:01.860]  So major props to the writing team.
[43:01.860 --> 43:04.660]  They, I think one of the hardest things
[43:04.660 --> 43:06.740]  to do in games is humor, right?
[43:07.220 --> 43:09.060]  They really knocked it out of the park.
[43:10.980 --> 43:14.020]  One line that always makes me laugh
[43:14.020 --> 43:16.180]  when I think about it is early on
[43:16.180 --> 43:19.220]  when Tara learned she can change
[43:19.220 --> 43:20.340]  the seasons and whatnot.
[43:21.700 --> 43:23.220]  Was it Finn, I think the little kid?
[43:23.700 --> 43:25.060]  He mentions like,
[43:25.060 --> 43:27.300]  feels like this spring's taking forever.
[43:27.860 --> 43:29.860]  Tara responds, I'm working on it.
[43:32.420 --> 43:34.580]  Oh yeah, no brilliant, brilliant writing.
[43:34.660 --> 43:36.660]  Major shout outs to the writing team for that.
[43:37.380 --> 43:41.460]  And they had us in stitches in the booth.
[43:41.460 --> 43:44.900]  Like I have had more than one session
[43:44.900 --> 43:47.460]  where I've like, my sides are splitting
[43:47.460 --> 43:48.820]  and I'm like doubled over,
[43:48.820 --> 43:51.380]  like cannot breathe because I'm laughing so hard.
[43:52.180 --> 43:56.340]  So I mean, it's just, it was fun for us as well.
[43:56.980 --> 43:58.900]  Yeah, yeah, I can tell like,
[43:58.900 --> 44:00.980]  oh man, everyone really brought it.
[44:01.940 --> 44:03.300]  You can tell how much love went
[44:03.300 --> 44:05.540]  into every performance and the game as a whole.
[44:06.500 --> 44:09.060]  So major, major props to everyone involved.
[44:09.060 --> 44:09.560]  Thank you.
[44:10.740 --> 44:12.900]  Who would you say is your favorite character,
[44:12.900 --> 44:14.180]  you know, aside from Tara?
[44:14.180 --> 44:15.060]  Cause like you said,
[44:15.060 --> 44:17.940]  this is a big, pretty sizable cast and well done.
[44:17.940 --> 44:20.180]  Everyone has their own quirks and personality.
[44:20.180 --> 44:23.780]  So who are some of your favorite characters?
[44:23.780 --> 44:25.940]  Ah, I love Finn and Emmy
[44:25.940 --> 44:28.340]  cause I think they are so funny.
[44:28.340 --> 44:30.100]  Like I just think they're just so,
[44:31.060 --> 44:33.700]  like that was me at 10 and nine years old,
[44:33.700 --> 44:36.420]  like little, like go get her entrepreneur.
[44:36.420 --> 44:39.460]  And I just, I think they're both so funny.
[44:41.060 --> 44:44.820]  I think for me, my favorite romance option
[44:44.820 --> 44:46.020]  is probably Amira.
[44:46.020 --> 44:49.140]  Cause I think Amira has like the best game
[44:49.140 --> 44:50.980]  in terms of like her flirting game.
[44:52.500 --> 44:54.420]  That's the first thing she does.
[44:54.420 --> 44:54.980]  I know.
[44:56.980 --> 44:58.740]  She's so good.
[45:00.500 --> 45:02.500]  She is a superstar.
[45:02.500 --> 45:03.300]  Absolutely.
[45:04.580 --> 45:05.060]  Oh man.
[45:05.060 --> 45:05.460]  Yeah.
[45:05.460 --> 45:06.020]  I don't blame you.
[45:06.020 --> 45:08.020]  She's definitely one of the top contenders.
[45:08.020 --> 45:08.580]  Yeah.
[45:08.580 --> 45:08.900]  Yeah.
[45:08.900 --> 45:13.380]  And Emmy, I absolutely adore her business mogul,
[45:13.380 --> 45:14.420]  Lemonade Stan.
[45:15.060 --> 45:16.100]  It's so cute.
[45:16.900 --> 45:17.700]  It's great.
[45:19.540 --> 45:20.660]  Let's see here.
[45:20.660 --> 45:21.780]  Do you, okay.
[45:22.580 --> 45:24.020]  Here's a fun one, right?
[45:24.020 --> 45:27.300]  So like one of the selling points is the witch
[45:27.300 --> 45:30.020]  and all the potions and magic and whatnot of the game.
[45:30.660 --> 45:34.420]  What, what would be one you'd like an incantation
[45:34.420 --> 45:36.420]  or potion you wish you could use in real life?
[45:36.420 --> 45:38.900]  Oh, that's a really good question.
[45:38.900 --> 45:42.740]  Um, I think it'd be really cool to be able
[45:42.740 --> 45:44.020]  to change the seasons.
[45:44.980 --> 45:48.020]  Um, I feel like that would be very helpful here
[45:48.020 --> 45:50.820]  in California to be like, okay, let's move it
[45:50.820 --> 45:52.740]  to where we can get a good amount of rain.
[45:52.740 --> 45:53.940]  And then now it's going to be spring.
[45:53.940 --> 45:55.620]  Cause now we watered everything and now everyone's
[45:55.620 --> 45:58.260]  tired of the rain or like, that would be cool.
[45:58.820 --> 46:01.620]  Um, I probably would want to turn into a cat.
[46:01.620 --> 46:03.860]  I just, because, or like any animal, cause like,
[46:03.860 --> 46:06.020]  I look at my dog all the time and I'm like,
[46:06.020 --> 46:07.140]  what do you do all day?
[46:07.140 --> 46:08.580]  Like, what do you think about?
[46:08.580 --> 46:10.820]  And I just would love to live a day as my dog.
[46:11.460 --> 46:13.780]  So I think maybe that one.
[46:13.780 --> 46:15.460]  I hadn't even thought about that one.
[46:15.460 --> 46:16.420]  Yeah, that's good.
[46:16.420 --> 46:17.780]  Do you have pets?
[46:17.780 --> 46:23.140]  I, so I used to, I had a little toy poodle.
[46:23.140 --> 46:25.780]  He passed away last October, unfortunately.
[46:25.780 --> 46:28.580]  He was 17 years old.
[46:28.580 --> 46:29.700]  Oh, what was his name?
[46:29.700 --> 46:31.300]  The same age as my brother.
[46:31.300 --> 46:34.180]  His name was Dodo, um, which is actually a name
[46:34.180 --> 46:36.900]  my younger brother came up with as a baby.
[46:39.220 --> 46:40.580]  That's so cute.
[46:41.220 --> 46:41.540]  Yeah.
[46:42.180 --> 46:42.500]  Yeah.
[46:42.500 --> 46:45.220]  He, um, 70 years was a good run.
[46:45.220 --> 46:45.780]  Um, right.
[46:45.780 --> 46:47.620]  And like my little brother grew up with him.
[46:47.620 --> 46:49.140]  So it's, oh man.
[46:49.140 --> 46:49.620]  Yeah.
[46:49.620 --> 46:53.220]  Like that's so full of personality and such.
[46:53.220 --> 46:53.460]  Right.
[46:53.460 --> 46:55.460]  And, and that definitely carried over to the game.
[46:55.700 --> 46:58.260]  Like Cleocatra was a ton of fun.
[46:58.260 --> 46:59.060]  Amazing name.
[46:59.780 --> 47:03.460]  Um, yeah, no, so that, that's a, that's a great pick.
[47:03.460 --> 47:07.140]  Um, I could use the freeze time spell myself.
[47:07.140 --> 47:09.300]  It's just not enough hours in the day, you know?
[47:09.300 --> 47:10.980]  No, that would be really helpful.
[47:11.540 --> 47:12.660]  Yeah, that's a good pick.
[47:12.660 --> 47:13.700]  Absolutely.
[47:13.700 --> 47:15.060]  Um, oh man.
[47:15.060 --> 47:15.540]  Yeah.
[47:15.540 --> 47:17.700]  Um, let's see here.
[47:18.420 --> 47:22.340]  So, you know, this we're talking about wildfires a lot, but have you ever played
[47:22.340 --> 47:24.660]  any other sort of farming or cottagecore games?
[47:24.660 --> 47:24.900]  Right.
[47:24.900 --> 47:26.500]  Do you have any history with them?
[47:26.500 --> 47:29.060]  I'm unfortunately a terrible gamer.
[47:29.060 --> 47:38.180]  So I, I do not, I have, I, I own animal crossing the, the new horizons one, which
[47:38.180 --> 47:43.140]  I have played a couple of times and I own it cause I own a switch and I find it very
[47:43.140 --> 47:50.420]  relaxing, but I am unfortunately such a workaholic that I, I have a really hard
[47:50.420 --> 47:52.260]  time relaxing on my own.
[47:52.260 --> 47:56.420]  So I have to like go out with my friends or like do something.
[47:56.420 --> 47:58.900]  So I am, I wish I was a better gamer.
[47:59.540 --> 48:03.780]  Um, but I have really liked what I've played of animal crossing, but I'm also a little
[48:03.780 --> 48:08.420]  scared to go back to it because I've heard that the, that the people there are very
[48:08.420 --> 48:10.980]  sassy to you if you haven't played for a while.
[48:10.980 --> 48:14.340]  And I know they're going to like yell at me when I returned to my island.
[48:15.300 --> 48:21.540]  Um, I, I'm a big, big animal crossing fan and, uh, going back is always a wild ride.
[48:21.780 --> 48:22.500]  Absolutely.
[48:23.140 --> 48:25.460]  But, um, but no, I get that.
[48:25.460 --> 48:25.620]  Right.
[48:25.620 --> 48:29.060]  Like you've clearly got the established career here.
[48:29.620 --> 48:32.100]  I get that it's hard to fit those hours in.
[48:32.580 --> 48:37.140]  Um, and, and I can see from that, like I can see the Terra coming out right there.
[48:38.820 --> 48:41.380]  Um, yeah, absolutely.
[48:41.380 --> 48:45.460]  Um, you know, actually on that note, let me go back a second.
[48:45.460 --> 48:46.740]  I want to go back to Terra.
[48:46.740 --> 48:52.340]  Um, like I, I can't appreciate enough to you and the, the writing and directing.
[48:52.980 --> 48:59.300]  Like you mentioned like, yeah, she, uh, she had that messy breakup, the engagement
[48:59.300 --> 49:02.420]  broke off and she just moved and, and, and lost her job even.
[49:02.420 --> 49:02.660]  Right.
[49:02.660 --> 49:09.300]  Like I think for so many people in their twenties and thirties, I think that's so
[49:09.300 --> 49:09.940]  relatable.
[49:09.940 --> 49:10.340]  Right.
[49:10.340 --> 49:15.940]  And, and it's so cathartic to see her, you know, trying this fresh start in this
[49:16.020 --> 49:18.340]  little island and meeting all these new people.
[49:18.340 --> 49:21.620]  Um, I think that's really one of the selling points of the game.
[49:21.620 --> 49:26.820]  Um, and, and yeah, and I think you did a great job showing that of Terra, getting
[49:26.820 --> 49:28.260]  her feet back up on everything.
[49:28.260 --> 49:29.060]  Thank you.
[49:29.060 --> 49:34.740]  I mean, I think that, um, I think that we collectively, I know so many people that
[49:34.740 --> 49:40.580]  through the, through the end of, um, the hardcore quarantining, their lives had
[49:40.580 --> 49:42.340]  completely changed mine as well.
[49:42.340 --> 49:46.420]  You know, I think a lot of people went through a lot of really big life altering
[49:46.420 --> 49:51.700]  stuff and, and came out the other side on a new adventure.
[49:51.700 --> 49:56.100]  So I think that because we kind of have this collective experience, it may, it
[49:56.100 --> 49:59.060]  makes her very relatable to a lot of people.
[49:59.060 --> 50:03.220]  I know so many people that had huge breakups and had to move to the other side
[50:03.220 --> 50:05.140]  of the country or things like that.
[50:05.140 --> 50:05.780]  Yeah.
[50:05.780 --> 50:07.780]  So I think it's very relatable.
[50:07.780 --> 50:09.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[50:09.060 --> 50:10.980]  Um, let's see here.
[50:12.260 --> 50:16.180]  Do you have any other hobbies or interests you'd like to talk about and such?
[50:16.180 --> 50:17.860]  Yeah, I do a lot of stuff.
[50:17.860 --> 50:22.420]  So acting is my job, obviously, um, acting and voice acting.
[50:22.980 --> 50:27.380]  I also last year started making music for the first time, which was really fun.
[50:28.020 --> 50:31.060]  Oh, do you play instrument or is it singing or what is it?
[50:31.060 --> 50:32.100]  I'm a singer.
[50:32.100 --> 50:37.860]  Um, I wish I played better, but I very luckily have, my brother-in-law is an
[50:37.860 --> 50:40.740]  incredibly talented musician and producer.
[50:40.740 --> 50:46.260]  So I have, um, him and my other producer, um, who I work with.
[50:46.260 --> 50:52.740]  I, I write, but I wish I do not play, but I sing.
[50:52.740 --> 50:57.380]  So I'm very lucky to have two collaborators who are like musical geniuses who can
[50:57.380 --> 51:00.100]  play every single instrument known to mankind.
[51:00.100 --> 51:03.380]  Um, cause I, I wish I played, but I do that.
[51:03.380 --> 51:09.940]  And I, I, that was kind of, uh, something I, I'd always kind of like entertained.
[51:09.940 --> 51:15.620]  Like I think every kid wants to be a rock star at some point, but over the pandemic,
[51:15.620 --> 51:20.260]  I actually started writing and, um, have released a couple songs and released my
[51:20.260 --> 51:22.900]  first music video last year and have more on the way.
[51:22.900 --> 51:27.220]  So it's been a really fun outlet that I've really enjoyed.
[51:27.220 --> 51:29.380]  Oh, tell us about it.
[51:30.100 --> 51:31.060]  Give us the plugs.
[51:31.140 --> 51:33.860]  What are the names of some of the songs or albums or whatever?
[51:33.860 --> 51:36.900]  So I produce under my musician name VRL.
[51:36.900 --> 51:43.380]  Um, so it's my initials and it's, it's like the complete opposite of like, if, if,
[51:43.380 --> 51:48.980]  if Wildflowers is like bright and cheerful and just like delightful, the stuff I write
[51:48.980 --> 51:56.420]  is like sad, depressing, like dark synthwave music, which always really surprises
[51:56.420 --> 52:00.260]  people because I am myself very like outgoing.
[52:01.860 --> 52:07.620]  And like, I don't know, bubbly is usually the word people describe me as.
[52:08.340 --> 52:09.700]  But my music is a complete opposite.
[52:09.700 --> 52:10.980]  So I have two songs out now.
[52:10.980 --> 52:12.980]  One of them is called easy to love.
[52:14.020 --> 52:20.180]  And the other one that has a music video out is called kill for you, die for you.
[52:20.180 --> 52:24.980]  And it's the word kill and then the number four and the letter U and then the same thing
[52:25.700 --> 52:27.380]  die is spelled correctly.
[52:27.380 --> 52:30.740]  And then four, the number four and then you, the letter you.
[52:31.380 --> 52:33.940]  Um, and it's like dark and witchy.
[52:33.940 --> 52:39.540]  Like Stevie Nicks is, I mean, I guess, okay, I guess I will say that like the witchy vibes
[52:39.540 --> 52:44.900]  are parallel to Wildflowers, but it's like, I'm really inspired by like Stevie Nicks and
[52:44.900 --> 52:50.260]  Florence, um, Florence the machine and like Marina and the diamonds.
[52:50.260 --> 52:52.660]  So that's kind of the vibe it goes.
[52:52.740 --> 52:53.220]  Yeah.
[52:53.220 --> 52:55.780]  Also those, I love Marina.
[52:55.780 --> 52:56.420]  Yeah.
[52:56.420 --> 52:58.500]  Um, oh man, I love that music.
[52:58.500 --> 53:00.900]  Um, Florence the machine's pretty dang good too.
[53:00.900 --> 53:01.400]  Yeah.
[53:01.860 --> 53:02.180]  Right.
[53:02.180 --> 53:06.740]  Like a jammer nerd here, but like the rendition of, uh, stand by me.
[53:07.540 --> 53:08.040]  Yeah.
[53:08.580 --> 53:09.300]  Is it stand by me?
[53:09.300 --> 53:09.700]  Gosh, no.
[53:09.700 --> 53:10.740]  Wait, what's the name of the song?
[53:10.740 --> 53:13.220]  Uh, I know what you're talking about.
[53:13.220 --> 53:15.700]  Um, they did it for fancy 15.
[53:16.340 --> 53:16.980]  Um, wow.
[53:16.980 --> 53:17.940]  It is stand by me.
[53:17.940 --> 53:18.420]  Yeah.
[53:18.420 --> 53:18.980]  Yes.
[53:18.980 --> 53:19.300]  Yeah.
[53:19.300 --> 53:19.620]  Okay.
[53:19.620 --> 53:19.940]  Yes.
[53:19.940 --> 53:20.100]  No.
[53:20.100 --> 53:20.500]  Okay.
[53:20.500 --> 53:22.340]  I can hear it in my head kind of.
[53:22.740 --> 53:23.240]  Yes.
[53:23.300 --> 53:24.260]  Um, yes, no.
[53:24.260 --> 53:24.820]  Okay.
[53:24.820 --> 53:26.100]  Um, but okay.
[53:26.100 --> 53:26.820]  Going back here.
[53:26.820 --> 53:27.620]  I'm getting distracted.
[53:27.620 --> 53:29.460]  Um, yes.
[53:29.460 --> 53:29.700]  Okay.
[53:29.700 --> 53:30.980]  I need to listen to this music.
[53:30.980 --> 53:32.020]  That sounds amazing.
[53:32.020 --> 53:33.540]  I'm totally down for that vibe.
[53:33.540 --> 53:38.580]  It's on all platforms and the goal is hopefully to start performing live this year.
[53:38.580 --> 53:41.700]  I have a few releases coming up.
[53:41.700 --> 53:47.220]  So once, once the things are released, um, we can start thinking about performing live.
[53:47.860 --> 53:56.820]  Um, yeah, it's been, it's been a fun juggle of I, um, of like spending time and also like
[53:56.820 --> 54:00.500]  producing music is I didn't realize kind of expensive.
[54:00.500 --> 54:07.380]  So it's like kind of slow going cause I I'm funding everything out of my own pocket.
[54:08.340 --> 54:10.500]  So expensive is an understatement.
[54:10.500 --> 54:11.780]  Oh my goodness.
[54:11.780 --> 54:12.980]  That's amazing.
[54:12.980 --> 54:16.340]  Well, so that's why I only released two songs last year.
[54:17.140 --> 54:21.620]  So one has to budget to also be able to pay rent in Los Angeles.
[54:22.500 --> 54:24.100]  Uh, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[54:24.100 --> 54:24.900]  Absolutely.
[54:24.900 --> 54:26.580]  Um, oh man.
[54:28.340 --> 54:29.060]  Um, wow.
[54:29.060 --> 54:30.180]  That's really impressive though.
[54:30.980 --> 54:35.620]  I'm definitely gonna take a listen to that after this interview and then follow along.
[54:35.620 --> 54:36.420]  Absolutely.
[54:36.420 --> 54:36.980]  Cool.
[54:36.980 --> 54:42.420]  And I'm on, I'm on, um, the, I also have a separate Instagram account for it.
[54:42.420 --> 54:45.380]  So it's a VRL music official on Instagram.
[54:45.460 --> 54:45.780]  Okay.
[54:45.780 --> 54:46.020]  Okay.
[54:46.020 --> 54:46.340]  Okay.
[54:46.340 --> 54:47.060]  That's right here.
[54:47.060 --> 54:48.820]  See that from the first Google results.
[54:48.820 --> 54:49.540]  Yeah.
[54:49.540 --> 54:50.420]  Good to see you.
[54:50.420 --> 54:52.420]  Um, uh, all right.
[54:52.420 --> 54:54.740]  That's um, and that's, that's super cool.
[54:54.740 --> 54:56.500]  Um, I love music, right?
[54:56.500 --> 55:00.980]  But I, I, I played a few instruments back in the day, but it's one of the areas where
[55:00.980 --> 55:02.740]  I, it just doesn't click naturally.
[55:02.740 --> 55:07.700]  So I'm just always in awe of anyone who can play or sing or write music.
[55:07.700 --> 55:12.020]  Um, so hats off to you because I think that's just really, really impressive.
[55:12.020 --> 55:12.580]  Thank you.
[55:12.580 --> 55:16.180]  I'm very lucky that my parents are very artistic.
[55:16.180 --> 55:17.380]  Neither of them worked at the arts.
[55:17.380 --> 55:18.260]  My mom was a nerd.
[55:18.260 --> 55:22.260]  My mom still is a nurse and my dad was a bottle water delivery guy.
[55:22.820 --> 55:27.620]  So like my parents are like absolutely did not work in the arts, but were very creative
[55:27.620 --> 55:27.860]  people.
[55:27.860 --> 55:33.220]  Like my mom has painted her entire life and done like stained glass and my dad like really
[55:33.220 --> 55:35.220]  loved pottery and stuff like that.
[55:35.780 --> 55:38.180]  And they really allowed.
[55:39.140 --> 55:45.460]  My brother is like, he's, he's deciding whether or not he wants to go into like gaming design.
[55:45.460 --> 55:47.540]  So like a different type of creativity.
[55:48.100 --> 55:51.700]  Um, but my sister, my sister's an opera singer.
[55:52.260 --> 55:55.380]  Uh, so, and she's nine years older than me.
[55:55.380 --> 56:00.260]  So I was very, always very lucky to have like creative role models in my life.
[56:00.260 --> 56:02.660]  I wanted to be just like her when I was little.
[56:02.660 --> 56:04.660]  Oh, that's, that's awesome.
[56:05.380 --> 56:06.660]  Man, what a cool family.
[56:07.540 --> 56:09.140]  So you're the middle child of three then?
[56:09.140 --> 56:09.620]  I am.
[56:09.620 --> 56:09.940]  Yes.
[56:10.500 --> 56:11.060]  Okay.
[56:11.060 --> 56:11.380]  Yeah.
[56:11.380 --> 56:11.860]  Very cool.
[56:12.660 --> 56:14.900]  Um, I'm, I'm the eldest of three myself.
[56:14.900 --> 56:15.300]  Oh, cool.
[56:15.940 --> 56:16.180]  Yeah.
[56:16.740 --> 56:19.220]  Um, oh man, that's, oh man.
[56:19.220 --> 56:19.780]  That's so cool.
[56:19.780 --> 56:21.060]  Especially your sister and opera singer.
[56:21.060 --> 56:26.260]  That's such a kind of job, but so impressive.
[56:26.260 --> 56:27.620]  She's very impressive.
[56:27.620 --> 56:29.940]  Her name is Brooke Iva Loman.
[56:29.940 --> 56:34.980]  Um, and she is, she's got a ridiculous voice.
[56:34.980 --> 56:37.700]  Like I saw her sing at LA opera.
[56:37.700 --> 56:42.180]  Like, uh, they did a really interesting, there was an intro, what was it called?
[56:42.980 --> 56:46.980]  She worked for LA opera a couple months ago for this thing where it was like teaching
[56:46.980 --> 56:49.620]  children about opera and it was just so cool.
[56:50.340 --> 56:53.540]  Um, and she just, yeah, she just, she performs all over.
[56:53.540 --> 56:58.900]  She's so busy and she's like constantly booked and busy and I'm just so proud of her.
[56:58.900 --> 56:59.380]  Oh man.
[56:59.380 --> 56:59.620]  Yeah.
[56:59.620 --> 57:00.260]  Like I found her.
[57:00.260 --> 57:03.220]  Iva, that's I-V-A for people who might want to Google.
[57:03.220 --> 57:04.580]  Um, Brooke Iva Loman.
[57:04.580 --> 57:05.140]  Um, wow.
[57:05.140 --> 57:06.420]  That's, yeah, that's really impressive.
[57:07.060 --> 57:08.340]  Um, hats off to her.
[57:09.380 --> 57:18.660]  Um, and like on this note of, of, uh, projects and whatnot, are there any other projects
[57:18.660 --> 57:21.940]  or anything like the other side from the music that you're hyped about right now?
[57:21.940 --> 57:23.620]  Anything you want to plug?
[57:23.620 --> 57:26.660]  Several things I'm excited about, but I can't talk about yet.
[57:26.660 --> 57:30.260]  Oh, I know that's always the case with voice actors.
[57:30.260 --> 57:31.300]  It is, it is.
[57:31.940 --> 57:33.380]  It's that NDA life.
[57:34.020 --> 57:40.420]  Um, yeah, I feel like it's, and because it's always like you can't talk about anything
[57:40.420 --> 57:44.020]  and then all of a sudden you just talk a lot about the thing that came out and it's just
[57:44.020 --> 57:46.420]  kind of an endless rollercoaster of that.
[57:47.220 --> 57:48.020]  Right, right.
[57:48.020 --> 57:48.660]  I get it.
[57:48.660 --> 57:54.100]  Um, and it's, it's funny for voice acting too because like at least when you do theater,
[57:54.100 --> 57:59.540]  you know, you're, you're posting about it as you're doing the thing or like even for
[57:59.540 --> 58:04.180]  film, you, I feel like the, the, the window is often shorter.
[58:04.180 --> 58:09.300]  Like it's sometimes a year in post, whereas games, games and animation, sometimes you
[58:09.300 --> 58:14.740]  start working on two or three years or more depending on the project before it ever sees
[58:14.740 --> 58:18.660]  the light of day and you've wrapped it two years ago and then all of a sudden you're
[58:18.660 --> 58:19.940]  talking about it again.
[58:19.940 --> 58:26.500]  So it's such an interesting like cyclical experience for, for voiceover artists.
[58:26.500 --> 58:34.020]  Yeah, like, oh man, hats off to you guys because some of those, like, I just imagine
[58:34.020 --> 58:38.900]  being in your, in your shoes and having a really cool role and just having to hold it
[58:38.900 --> 58:39.940]  in for two years.
[58:39.940 --> 58:41.780]  That's, that's crazy.
[58:41.780 --> 58:45.620]  It's really good that my dog doesn't talk because my dog does everything.
[58:46.740 --> 58:47.620]  She's the only one.
[58:48.420 --> 58:49.860]  She has the friend DA.
[58:49.860 --> 58:50.360]  Exactly.
[58:50.360 --> 58:53.800]  Um, okay.
[58:53.800 --> 58:59.880]  Well, what about stuff that is, uh, what are, what are some of your past roles or whatnot
[58:59.880 --> 59:01.320]  that you've enjoyed doing?
[59:01.320 --> 59:01.720]  Yeah.
[59:01.720 --> 59:05.320]  So most people know me from the game What Remains of Edith Finch.
[59:05.960 --> 59:10.600]  Um, that's, that's kind of the game that gave me my start and is still like, people
[59:10.600 --> 59:12.200]  are still discovering that game.
[59:12.200 --> 59:13.880]  It came out in 2017.
[59:13.880 --> 59:18.440]  It came out five years ago and people are still messaging me being like, I just played
[59:18.440 --> 59:20.120]  it for the first time today.
[59:20.120 --> 59:20.920]  Oh my gosh.
[59:20.920 --> 59:22.040]  Which is really exciting.
[59:22.680 --> 59:27.880]  Um, and then, uh, I really loved working on Wolfenstein Youngblood.
[59:27.880 --> 59:30.840]  I got to go, like, do all the mocap for that.
[59:30.840 --> 59:35.560]  I got to go do the mocap in Sweden, which is actually where I, yeah.
[59:35.560 --> 59:40.440]  Um, where, that's where I met Shelby Young who plays Natalia in Wildflowers.
[59:41.000 --> 59:41.800]  Okay.
[59:41.800 --> 59:45.720]  And Shelby is like one of my best friends now and it just, it was very cool that we
[59:45.720 --> 59:48.040]  have now gotten to work together on stuff.
[59:48.040 --> 59:50.680]  Like since that, cause we played twins in that game.
[59:50.680 --> 59:52.120]  Oh, that's fascinating.
[59:52.120 --> 59:53.080]  I love Natalia.
[59:53.080 --> 59:57.880]  Um, since like her shop's the closest to your, uh, to your farm in the game.
[59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.920]  Like she's like the first one to become best friends with.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.880]  Um, so yeah, that's great.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.360]  Um, and then I also, that's so cool.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.640]  All the way to Sweden.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.480]  Yeah, I didn't expect that.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.680]  It was very cool.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.600]  We shot for like two and a half, three weeks over there and it was my first time working
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.160]  overseas.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.040]  Um, I had been to Europe, but the first time I'd been to Europe was literally two months
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.640]  before for the London BAFTAs.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.960]  Um, oh wow.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.600]  Yeah.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.720]  Uh, that year was a crazy, crazy year.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.960]  Um, it was a lot of traveling.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.680]  Um, and I had never, I had never worked in another country.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.520]  I had never been in another country for that long before.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.720]  And I'd also had never done motion capture before.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:48.360]  So it was like a lot of new things and it just, it's still to this day, one of the most
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.520]  special, lovely jobs I've gotten to do.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:58.200]  Like I just met so many people on that job that I love and care about so much.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:04.760]  Like Tom Keegan, who, um, I mean, he, he's one of the best in the biz for video game
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.920]  directing and especially for motion capture.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.680]  Like he does a ton of Star Wars stuff.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.200]  He does the Wolfenstein games.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.600]  He, he, he's amazing.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:19.880]  And he's also just like the kindest human and the loveliest human and just such an actor's
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.840]  director.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.760]  I just, I love him so much.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.160]  So that's, that sounds awesome.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.440]  It is very cool.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.400]  It's cool.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:27.960]  Yeah.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.600]  Yeah.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.000]  Um, oh man, that's, that's exciting.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.640]  Um, and going back one second here, Edith Finch, like I haven't played it myself, but
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.680]  I've heard about it.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:38.920]  Right.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.800]  And like, especially after Wildflowers, knowing that you're like, uh, you're playing Edith,
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.800]  I'm probably going to play it.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.440]  I will absolutely play a game just to hear a voice performance.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.080]  It's a really fun one.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.600]  Make sure you bring tissues though.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.760]  It's incredibly sad.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.640]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.920]  I've, I've heard, um, yeah, with me with a name like that.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.240]  Right.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:01.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.040]  Um, uh, yeah.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.200]  And then I got to do the complete opposite of Terra simultaneously.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:13.480]  I worked on a game called Black Tail that came out in December and it's about the origin
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.040]  story of Baba Yaga from like Russian and Slavic folk folklore.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.200]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:20.600]  Yeah.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:28.520]  And it's, she was like so fun to voice, but the complete opposite of Terra.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:36.120]  Also a young witch or a young, a young woman finding her power, but, um, lot of rage, lot
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.800]  of screaming, lot of like dire situations.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.040]  And it was so fun to do.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.160]  And it was really fun to do parallel to recording Wildflowers because like some days I would
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.960]  like cast spells and be all like happy and like, we're going to change the seasons.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.120]  And then the next session would be like, we're going to burn everything down.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.880]  And like, I like, I'm in a medieval Europe witch.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.640]  So it was fun.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.140]  Oh man.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.580]  That's, oh, I hadn't heard of this, but, oh, that's such a fascinating, uh, Remus.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.900]  So let's, uh, we'll listen to this Black Tail, T-A-I-L, one word.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.060]  Um, I'm looking at it now.
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.980]  Um, oh, this game looks fascinating.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.780]  The art is so trippy and cool.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:24.940]  Like it's, it gives me like, just, it's so, I love the art in it.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:30.700]  I think it's so creepy and it really fits the eerie, eerie atmosphere for it.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.700]  Yeah, I can see that just from the screenshots.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.460]  Um, that's some strong art direction.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:40.940]  And yeah, definitely opposite end of the spectrum from, uh, um, Wildflowers.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.700]  Um, oh, that's so cool.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.200]  Yeah.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.900]  Um, oh man, that, okay.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:50.620]  That is, oh, I'm so glad we're having this chat because I'm learning all these new things
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.140]  I want to check out now.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.900]  I've just learned that I, and I only learned this recently because a couple of friends
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.940]  commented.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.660]  I apparently, I always think I post a lot.
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.780]  Like I feel like I post so much that I must be annoying or irritating with how much I
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.620]  post, but lately I've been posting, I'll like post some about something I worked on and
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.580]  someone will be like, I had no idea you worked on that.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.860]  When did that come out?
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.980]  You worked on that?
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.860]  And I, I've just started to realize, oh, I don't think I post enough on like my grid
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.980]  on my Instagram.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:24.620]  So I try to get better with that because apparently no one knows what I'm working on.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:25.660]  Oh man.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.020]  I mean, it's, it's tough, right?
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.580]  Like so many social medias to keep up with.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.580]  Like, I, oh yeah, that's, that's a tall order for anyone.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:40.220]  Um, but yeah, but hey, that's what we're here for too, to help, uh, spread the word a
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:40.620]  little.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.860]  Um, that's, that's good.
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.140]  That is exciting stuff.
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:49.180]  Um, you also do some onscreen acting, correct?
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:55.580]  Um, what, like how, so how do you prefer, but like, what do you, do you find any big
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.980]  differences between the two on that camera and voice acting?
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:07.740]  Um, yeah, I think, I think that there is a big difference between, um, any medium because
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.580]  I also work in theater as well.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:20.140]  I think that voiceover requires so much imagination and trust because you have to trust your team
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.740]  because you have to know that their vision is strong and that they are getting what they
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.860]  want out of you because you usually, depends on the game, depends how far along it is,
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:34.540]  but I've worked on plenty of things where I have zero concept art or any idea of what
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.820]  something will look like.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:39.900]  I had no idea what Blacktail would look like until I think the first trailer dropped.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.580]  I think I had seen maybe like one piece of concept art halfway through recording.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.060]  So you do have to really trust.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:52.380]  Um, and also you, you don't really have your scene partner most of the time, unless you're,
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:56.620]  I did a couple dual sessions for Wolfenstein with Shelby because we played twins.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.260]  But most of the time you don't have your scene partner.
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:05.420]  So you either get your director being your scene partner, which sometimes they're actors
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.860]  too, which can be really helpful.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.260]  And sometimes you're on your own.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:14.860]  Whereas for on camera, so much is given to you.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.220]  Like you have to come to set knowing your lines and being memorized and doing your own
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:19.020]  homework.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:24.380]  But then there's a lot of collaboration and the costume designer helps figure out what
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.260]  the visual look of your character is and putting on the costume helps you feel what they feel
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:29.980]  like.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:36.300]  Hair and makeup makes you look even more like, uh, like you, like the character, you see
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.500]  the set around you so you know what environment you're playing in.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.540]  You have your other actor there most of the time.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:47.500]  I mean, sometimes you, sometimes you act off of a tennis ball if you really can't get the
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:55.020]  other actor for some reason, but most of the time you have, you have them.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:02.620]  And then for theater, there's like that lovely extra element of you're doing something that
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:07.340]  like you are so memorized because you, you may be doing a, sometimes you're doing a three
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:11.980]  week run and sometimes you're doing Broadway and you've, you're working on a role for over
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.900]  a year and it's, it's in your bones.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:21.580]  And it's finding the nuances and the newness every night and letting it be so new and like
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.340]  finding the discoveries and also having the energy of the audience because that really
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.620]  affects the show.
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.740]  So I love them all, but they're all very different.
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.660]  Yeah, that's interesting, right?
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:39.500]  Like I've, I mean, I like to say I like following voice actors and, you know, like you, some
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.380]  voice actors dabble in on camera and theater and stuff.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:46.700]  So, but hearing it all laid out like that, yeah, that's fascinating to hear all these
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.260]  differences.
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:48.860]  It's very, very cool.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:58.940]  And speaking of audience energy, so you don't get that per se in a game, but I know games
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:04.460]  have some of the biggest like fandoms and fan arts and whatnot, right?
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:10.460]  Have you had any memorable fan interactions or seen any fan art or et cetera that you've
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.180]  enjoyed?
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:17.100]  So I am just starting to try to get into the convention scene, but I've only done like
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.460]  one or two so far.
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:25.420]  I've only, the only two that I've done, I've done ClexaCon in Vegas twice, but I know the
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:31.180]  team there and that one's, it feels less like a meeting fan experience because like, I know
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.580]  every single person who like works there.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.740]  So it's more just like, let's all putz around and talk about art.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:42.380]  But I want, I really want to get onto the convention circuit.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.820]  So I'm starting to try to figure out how to do that because I would love to meet more
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:53.500]  fans in person because I do get a lot of, yeah, I'm really like, that's the aim right
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:59.020]  now, but I've had just such lovely interactions on social media.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:06.700]  Um, I think both, I, I definitely, I stock the hashtags of the games to look at the fan
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.420]  art on TikTok, on Instagram.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:15.900]  I look for it because I love seeing what people are making inspired by like what, what we're
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.620]  doing.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:24.940]  I just found out, I didn't read it, um, but I do know that there is like wildflowers fan
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:25.660]  fiction out there.
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.340]  I saw the tweet.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.060]  Yeah.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:32.060]  Craig Lee Thomas, uh, who plays Cameron found that for us, I think.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.660]  And that was, that was, that was so cool.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.060]  I don't think I've ever worked on, actually, that's not true.
[01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:41.820]  I don't think I've looked at the other AO3 tags for the other stuff I've worked on.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.180]  So maybe there's, maybe there's Edith Finch fan, uh, fan fiction out there.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.300]  Oh, I bet there is.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.740]  There has to be.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.940]  Yeah, there's gotta be.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.260]  Um, but that's always lovely.
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.340]  People have been very kind to me.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:10:00.780]  Um, and also I, I always really appreciate when people like share how a game made them
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.740]  feel and share how a project changed their life.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.180]  I still walk into parties sometimes.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:11.820]  There's been one or there's been, there's been a few parties where I've just like dropped
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:15.580]  that I, when people ask me what I do, I'll say I'm a voice actor.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:19.900]  And the question that people always ask you is what have I heard you in?
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:22.540]  And I always say Edith Finch first.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:29.020]  And there has been more than one occasion where like 10 people have stopped and turned
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:36.780]  around and come to talk to me, which is like really like not a normal person experience,
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.300]  but also like really fun.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.060]  And like, I do not take for granted.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:46.540]  Um, because like, again, it's a game that came out five years ago and it's still affecting
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.180]  people.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.460]  And what a gift, what a gift.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:56.940]  Yeah, no, um, oh man, I, I, I really hope you get into the convention scene because
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:02.620]  like, as someone who attends them, you know, from the fan side, it's, it's just so awesome
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:08.380]  to, to see, um, yeah, people like you, the people who put the work into it and meeting
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:08.620]  you.
[01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:13.100]  Um, so I really do hope, uh, we get to see you around the cons a bit more.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:18.860]  Um, I'm over here in Atlanta, so MomoCon and Anime Weekend Atlanta are the big ones.
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.620]  You need some suggestions.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.060]  Yeah, I'm always looking.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.980]  If there's any, if there's any programmers listening, I want to go to your convention.
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.700]  I'll go anywhere.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:30.620]  Oh man.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.340]  Look, talk to Ray from, um, Wesley Ray Chase.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.500]  He goes to lots of cons.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.780]  He goes to a lot.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.300]  He'll, he'll hook you up, I'm sure.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.700]  Um, I'll send him a message.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:46.460]  Oh man, that's, oh, that's, uh, that's super exciting to hear.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:51.900]  You might get into that more, but, um, yeah, very, very cool to see, to experience that.
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:57.580]  I can't even imagine because yeah, I, I, I, I know so many people who, you know, all,
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.500]  there's so many different stories in games, right?
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:04.220]  And, and so many people get so close because you spend so much time with it, unlike maybe
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.020]  other media, right?
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.940]  You're not, it's not a two hour movie or X number, right?
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:13.260]  You can spend hundreds and hundreds of hours, like, like I have in Wildflowers.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.420]  Um, so you really get attached to these characters and performances.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:17.660]  Yeah.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.180]  It's very deeply personal.
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.540]  And I, I, I think that's so cool.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500]  Like what a cool medium.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.420]  And I think it teaches empathy.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:33.580]  I think it is so wonderful to get to step into other people's shoes in that way.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:35.660]  Yeah.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.780]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.180]  Yeah.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.620]  Um, okay.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:45.900]  Um, and with that, um, let's see, I guess, first of all, do you have any socials or links
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.060]  or anything you like to plug here?
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:49.180]  Shout out here.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:49.740]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.260]  Before we start wrapping up.
[01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:51.740]  Yes.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:55.740]  So I am on Instagram at Valerie Rose Loman.

[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.820]  I saw the coaching thing too, right?
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.780]  Like I'm getting personal here.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.060]  I've always wanted to dabble myself.
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.540]  Never have had the time, but it's still on my list.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.340]  So I might look at that some time.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:49.820]  Okay, cool.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.100]  Yeah.
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:56.460]  Um, but yeah, I'm sure, you know, we have our website where we have the podcast and
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.580]  Alan always has show notes.

[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.180]  listeners to click on and check out all your stuff.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:05.740]  Amazing.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:06.220]  Thank you.
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:07.340]  Yeah.
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:08.620]  Okay.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:13.020]  Um, so thank you once again, Valerie, for taking the time to chat with us today.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.700]  Um, it really was an honor.
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:20.300]  Um, uh, fun fact, I actually reached out to you and planned all of this without letting
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.420]  Al, our, our main host slash creator know.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:30.220]  So I dropped it on him just last week, um, just because I'm that big of a Wildflowers
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:30.700]  fan.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:31.920]  Yes.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.140]  That makes me so happy.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.100]  I'm so much of a fan that I am announcing here.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.940]  He's going to be listening to this when he edits it.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:45.420]  So he'll be hearing this for the first time that I actually have another interview with
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.460]  Ray Chase, the voice of Wesley set up.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:48.960]  Yes.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.460]  Okay, cool.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.260]  So that will be happening soon.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.660]  I'll enter surprise when he hears that.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.820]  I absolutely adore Ray.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:03.660]  Um, his voice is so good.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:09.260]  It's, uh, I love Wesley so much as a character, but yeah.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:09.760]  Yeah.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:10.940]  So dapper.
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.980]  I know it sounds so sweet and lovely.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:16.060]  Like I love him.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.100]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.380]  Um, okay.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:24.460]  But yeah, so thanks again for joining us and would you do us the honor of signing us off?
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.060]  I would be so honored.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:30.140]  Until next time, farmers have a good harvest.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:42.220]  The harvest season is created by Al McKinley with support from our patrons, including our
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.460]  pro farmers, Kevin and Stewart.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:50.220]  Our art is done by Micah the Brave and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.100]  Feel free to visit our website, harvest season.club
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.140]  for show notes and links to things we discussed in this episode.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:10.300]  Uh, so the countries that are in the final are Austria, Portugal, Switzerland, Poland,
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:13.660]  Serbia, France, Cyprus, Spain, Sweden, all Albania.
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.780]  I nearly said Albany there.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.420]  What on earth?
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.940]  Why on earth was that in my mind?
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:24.220]  Albania, Italy, Estonia, Finland, Czechia, Australia, Belgium, Armenia, Moldova, Ukraine,
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:29.340]  Norway, Germany, Lithuania, Israel, Slovenia, Croatia, and the UK.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.300]  Whoa, Serbia, Dark Horse Serbia.
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.260]  Can take it all.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:39.820]  I highly doubt it because I can't even remember what that song was.
