# Transcript
[00:00.740 --> 00:06.120]  Of course Mr.
[00:06.120 --> 00:23.140]  C
[00:23.140 --> 00:35.260]  Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
[00:35.260 --> 00:42.060]  My name is Al, I'm Kevin, and we're here today to talk about farming games, all the farming
[00:42.060 --> 00:43.060]  games.
[00:43.060 --> 00:44.060]  Yeah!
[00:44.060 --> 00:50.660]  Before we get into it, your regular reminder that transcripts are available in the show
[00:50.660 --> 00:53.540]  notes and on the website for the podcast, so go get them if you need them.
[00:53.540 --> 00:56.820]  Kevin, how are you doing?
[00:56.820 --> 01:01.420]  I'm tired.
[01:01.420 --> 01:11.260]  It's been a busy, busy month for me for a number of many things, but outside of that
[01:11.260 --> 01:20.380]  and the brief snippets of gaming, I got, let's see, I've been playing a lot of Marvel Snap,
[01:20.420 --> 01:24.660]  it's good, I've been playing Octopath Traveler, it's good.
[01:24.660 --> 01:26.460]  There was a Minecraft update recently.
[01:26.460 --> 01:27.460]  Oh, another?
[01:27.460 --> 01:30.020]  They just keep going, they never stop with that game.
[01:30.020 --> 01:34.100]  Yeah, they really don't, and I'm talking about like, you know, not Patch Note, like, not
[01:34.100 --> 01:38.920]  Bug Fix or whatever, I'm talking about like a big content update.
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.620]  They introduced like, archaeology, quote unquote, into Minecraft, where you can dig into little
[01:43.620 --> 01:48.620]  ruins and discover little trinkets and shards and things like that and make pottery.
[01:49.260 --> 01:55.140]  They added sakura, like cherry blossoms, cherry blossom forests, and they added camels, that's
[01:55.140 --> 01:57.500]  the real highlight of this update.
[01:57.500 --> 01:58.820]  They're cute.
[01:58.820 --> 02:00.500]  I like camels.
[02:00.500 --> 02:05.140]  Yeah, so for people who enjoy Minecraft, go check it out.
[02:05.140 --> 02:09.620]  Always fun to fire it up again when a new thing is out.
[02:09.620 --> 02:16.100]  Other than that, I watched the first episode, yeah, there's only one so far, at least at
[02:16.100 --> 02:17.860]  the time of this recording.
[02:17.860 --> 02:26.140]  Sword Invasion, the latest MCU series to hit Disney Plus, I know MCU turns people off
[02:26.140 --> 02:31.660]  right away, but this is a good one, it was a banger of an opening.
[02:31.660 --> 02:38.700]  That show hit the ground running, wasted no time, I won't get too much into detail, but
[02:38.700 --> 02:44.700]  I enjoyed the ending, I enjoyed the action, I enjoyed the setup, everything was good,
[02:44.700 --> 02:46.140]  no complaints.
[02:46.180 --> 02:48.900]  I have one complaint, but it's a spoilery complaint, so I'm not going to-
[02:48.900 --> 02:54.700]  Oh, well okay, yes, I can complain about that too, but I wasn't bringing it up.
[02:54.700 --> 02:58.700]  We're not going to bring it up, we're not going to bring it up, we're annoyed, annoyed,
[02:58.700 --> 03:01.020]  how dare you do that.
[03:01.020 --> 03:05.100]  I find it funny because like you say, this series is a good one, right, we've only got
[03:05.100 --> 03:11.180]  one episode, but assuming it continues in this way, I feel like the series have generally
[03:11.180 --> 03:13.340]  been good.
[03:13.340 --> 03:15.500]  What was the last bad series?
[03:15.500 --> 03:19.380]  Some people didn't like Ms. Marvel because it's just not their kind of thing, fair enough,
[03:19.380 --> 03:23.420]  some people wished that She-Hulk maybe had some more lawyer stuff, some people were very
[03:23.420 --> 03:28.220]  sexist about She-Hulk, but other than that, I think most of it has been like, if you didn't
[03:28.220 --> 03:32.940]  like it, it's just not your style of thing, I feel like the shows have been really good.
[03:32.940 --> 03:40.780]  I agree with that, I can't think of anything super offensive, I mean there's like-
[03:40.780 --> 03:47.100]  There's individual issues that people had with like specific things that happen or like
[03:47.100 --> 03:53.100]  some episodes and stuff like that, but like I don't, outside of like, oh I wish that She-Hulk
[03:53.100 --> 04:00.740]  had more lawyer stuff and I didn't really like how kiddy Ms. Marvel was and some sexist
[04:00.740 --> 04:04.300]  stuff, outside of those three things, I've not really heard anyone go, I just did not
[04:04.300 --> 04:09.260]  like this series or this series is bad.
[04:09.260 --> 04:16.540]  I'm looking at a list here, my least favorite was probably Falcon and the Winter Soldier,
[04:16.540 --> 04:24.220]  I don't think it's bad per se, just I enjoyed the other ones, maybe Ms. Marvel, but anyways,
[04:24.220 --> 04:29.100]  I mean yeah, looking at it, I've enjoyed them all, there's definitely been weaker series
[04:29.100 --> 04:35.180]  or weak points of the series, WandaVision, that ending, oof.
[04:35.180 --> 04:44.220]  No you're right, it's clear they've put the money in, I didn't know what to expect
[04:44.220 --> 04:51.420]  from these series, like I didn't know if- right, Marvel slash MCU has tried TV stuff
[04:51.420 --> 04:57.220]  before and it's all been, you know, kind of erased, or they're trying to erase it
[04:57.220 --> 04:58.220]  from history.
[04:58.220 --> 05:03.340]  Oh I mean some of it has been great, I can understand why some of it's not amazing right,
[05:03.340 --> 05:08.420]  and obviously there were many parts of Agents of the Field that maybe they could have just
[05:08.420 --> 05:12.940]  missed some episodes and it still would have been good, but the Netflix series were almost
[05:12.940 --> 05:22.700]  all great, let's ignore Luke Cage, not Luke Cage, sorry, let's ignore Iron Fist, I know
[05:22.700 --> 05:28.180]  some people didn't really like The Defenders, but other than that, I generally really liked-
[05:28.180 --> 05:30.980]  I mean I could be wrong, I don't know how to watch them myself, I'm only speaking
[05:30.980 --> 05:31.980]  about what I've heard.
[05:31.980 --> 05:40.760]  But to your point, looking at the Disney Plus series, it's been- they don't feel
[05:40.760 --> 05:50.680]  like side projects per se, right, whereas quality, whatever it may have been, the other
[05:50.680 --> 05:56.180]  series definitely felt like side projects, whether it was Agents of Shields or the Netflix
[05:56.180 --> 06:02.540]  stuff, but here, no, it's clear, they're basically broken up movies, that's what
[06:02.540 --> 06:08.180]  these series are, and so yeah, if you know how you feel about the MCU, that's probably
[06:08.180 --> 06:09.820]  how you'll feel about these series.
[06:09.820 --> 06:16.580]  Yeah, that's fair, I feel like the overall quality has been better, and yeah, they could
[06:16.580 --> 06:22.060]  probably have trimmed a few of them down and stuff like that, but I certainly have enjoyed
[06:22.060 --> 06:23.060]  every single one of them.
[06:23.060 --> 06:24.300]  I obviously have my favorites.
[06:24.300 --> 06:25.300]  Of course.
[06:25.420 --> 06:32.980]  By default, you have to have your least favorites, aw, Midnight was good, but I actually find
[06:32.980 --> 06:38.380]  it really hard to decide what my favorite would be, like, I loved WandaVision, I would
[06:38.380 --> 06:41.780]  probably say Falcon and the Winter Soldier isn't my favorite, but I still really like
[06:41.780 --> 06:42.780]  it.
[06:42.780 --> 06:47.660]  Loved Loki, loved What If, loved Hawkeye, loved Midnight, loved Ms. Marvel, loved She-Hulk,
[06:47.660 --> 06:52.100]  and I've been very much enjoying Secret Invasion so far, like, I have enjoyed every single
[06:52.100 --> 06:53.100]  one of them.
[06:53.100 --> 07:04.300]  Yeah, I agree with that, it'll be interesting to see how Secret Invasion holds up, like,
[07:04.300 --> 07:11.500]  the one big advantage this series has is Samuel L. Jackson, right?
[07:11.500 --> 07:16.660]  That man can act, I don't know if you knew that, but he's an actor.
[07:16.660 --> 07:20.860]  Yeah, I feel like he's thrown himself into this one as well, it's not just a paycheck
[07:20.860 --> 07:26.300]  for him, he's actually, he's doing it, he's acting it.
[07:26.300 --> 07:34.820]  Yeah, and it's a fun premise for people who don't know, Secret Invasion is, I know, in
[07:34.820 --> 07:40.500]  the comics, storyline, where there are alien shapeshifters invading Earth, posing as people,
[07:40.500 --> 07:43.900]  and they're basically running with that same basic premise.
[07:43.900 --> 07:50.800]  So now it's an interesting question of who do you trust, who's an alien, yada yada yada.
[07:50.840 --> 07:54.480]  So yeah, I'm looking forward to the next episode, which airs tomorrow, no, not tomorrow, I'm
[07:54.480 --> 08:00.400]  losing track of the days, next Thursday, they release on Thursdays, Wednesdays, oh my gosh,
[08:00.400 --> 08:06.600]  time has no meaning for me anymore, what have you been up to?
[08:06.600 --> 08:12.520]  So I too have been watching Secret Invasion, I have not really been playing any games other
[08:12.520 --> 08:20.560]  than a couple of games for the podcast that listeners will hear in about a month and a
[08:20.560 --> 08:27.960]  half, yeah, because my Switch is still getting fixed, so.
[08:27.960 --> 08:33.640]  Better, hopefully it'll come in soon, because boy, there's some good things coming to the
[08:33.640 --> 08:34.640]  Switch.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.640]  Yeah, I know.
[08:35.640 --> 08:40.360]  I just, I want it to come back, I just, as long as it gets to me, by just before I go
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.840]  on holiday, then I'm happy, right?
[08:42.840 --> 08:45.720]  There's nothing in the next couple of weeks that I'm like, oh, I must play this.
[08:45.720 --> 08:50.520]  I'm obviously missing it, there are some things I'd like to be playing just now, but yeah,
[08:50.520 --> 08:55.600]  as long as it gets to me before I go on holiday, and as long as it has my Pokemon saves, that's
[08:55.600 --> 08:57.480]  all I care about.
[08:57.480 --> 08:59.480]  Sounds good to me.
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.480]  So before we get into the news, we have some feedback.
[09:03.480 --> 09:07.880]  Okay, is this the first time this has happened?
[09:07.880 --> 09:11.640]  I think it's the first time it's happened so much as I felt the need to cover it on
[09:11.640 --> 09:12.640]  the podcast.
[09:12.640 --> 09:19.440]  We've had a few game devs reply and kind of, not clarify things, but just thank us and
[09:20.360 --> 09:21.360]  Well, sure, sure, sure.
[09:21.360 --> 09:22.360]  There's like, yeah.
[09:22.360 --> 09:26.480]  I think this is the first time we've had like a clarification to something said on the podcast.
[09:26.480 --> 09:30.920]  From the developers or team, whoever, the official people.
[09:30.920 --> 09:36.840]  So last episode, Bev and Cody were talking about Mossfield Origins.
[09:36.840 --> 09:39.040]  And I think there were a couple of things mentioned.
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.760]  First of all, it was mentioned that it looks a bit like, like it has, it doesn't really
[09:43.760 --> 09:48.440]  have goals and stuff like that.
[09:48.480 --> 09:54.560]  And the developer has replied to us and said that it in fact does have goals that are research
[09:54.560 --> 09:59.360]  levels and each research level has stuff to progress and various things change over time.
[09:59.360 --> 10:02.560]  And it doesn't matter if you take a while to do these goals, it's less sandbox and more
[10:02.560 --> 10:03.640]  narrative driven.
[10:03.640 --> 10:06.480]  So that's good to know.
[10:06.480 --> 10:12.520]  And also a follow up for that was there was mentioned that it was very sepia and I can't
[10:12.520 --> 10:13.520]  remember who it was.
[10:13.520 --> 10:16.800]  One of the two said they weren't a huge fan of the sepia tones.
[10:16.800 --> 10:21.960]  And the developer said it's less sepia and more vibrant now than it used to be.
[10:21.960 --> 10:23.920]  There was a steam post about that.
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.960]  So if you're interested in looking up that there, you can look on the steam page and
[10:27.960 --> 10:29.800]  see the post for that.
[10:29.800 --> 10:30.800]  Yeah.
[10:30.800 --> 10:32.800]  Thank you for the clarification.
[10:32.800 --> 10:33.800]  Yeah.
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.160]  So, and this means they're listening.
[10:37.160 --> 10:38.160]  Yeah.
[10:38.160 --> 10:39.160]  They're listening.
[10:39.160 --> 10:44.540]  Well, let me tell you, let me tell you, I wouldn't be surprised if they were the only
[10:44.540 --> 10:50.100]  developer actually listening when they respond to my tweets because so many times like I'll
[10:50.100 --> 10:54.420]  say something negative or something and they just like, like it and retweet it and that's
[10:54.420 --> 10:55.420]  it.
[10:55.420 --> 10:56.420]  And it's, they've clearly not listened to it.
[10:56.420 --> 11:00.700]  Whereas this developer is very definitely listening because you wouldn't know that without
[11:00.700 --> 11:01.700]  having listened to the podcast.
[11:01.700 --> 11:02.700]  So that's cool.
[11:02.700 --> 11:03.700]  Thank you very much.
[11:03.700 --> 11:04.700]  If you're listening this time.
[11:04.700 --> 11:10.700]  See, now the play, the play is the title of this episode, something cryptic in regards
[11:10.700 --> 11:12.120]  to Mossfield.
[11:12.120 --> 11:18.480]  And then they're going to be sweating as they listen for this very moment in the podcast.
[11:18.480 --> 11:24.840]  Something uh, something clickbaity like, uh, developer slams podcast hosts.
[11:24.840 --> 11:27.080]  You wouldn't believe what this developer said.
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.440]  Our response to Mossfield ends.
[11:29.440 --> 11:34.280]  Ah, we wouldn't do that.
[11:34.280 --> 11:35.520]  That's that's, that's mean.
[11:35.520 --> 11:40.600]  We wouldn't do that, we wouldn't do that.
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.600]  All right, cool.
[11:42.080 --> 11:43.800]  So let's talk about some news.
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.000]  So I thought there's quite a few releases, um, just now.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.800]  So I thought I would just do a quick rundown of what's happened.
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.120]  So we've just had ever dream valley release on switch.
[11:56.120 --> 12:03.080]  And then Kevin is crying because we also then have, uh, two releases that will be out by
[12:03.080 --> 12:05.200]  the time this episode comes out.
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.400]  One lonely outpost and story of seasons, a wonderful life.
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.320]  Wait, lonely outpost?
[12:10.320 --> 12:11.320]  It's coming out.
[12:12.040 --> 12:13.040]  It's early access.
[12:13.040 --> 12:14.040]  Oh, early.
[12:14.040 --> 12:15.040]  Okay.
[12:15.040 --> 12:16.040]  So not coming.
[12:16.040 --> 12:17.040]  Okay.
[12:17.040 --> 12:18.040]  Okay.
[12:18.040 --> 12:19.040]  Well, people will be able to play it and buy it.
[12:19.040 --> 12:20.040]  Right.
[12:20.040 --> 12:25.600]  It's just, uh, we don't, we don't, yeah, we don't need to go into that debate again.
[12:25.600 --> 12:33.680]  I'm I'm just, uh, I'm just saying that, uh, I'm just going to say that I feel like there's
[12:33.680 --> 12:40.960]  a game that's filled that, that niche that a real legend had.
[12:40.960 --> 12:43.800]  But anyways, uh, what I am crying over is story of seasons.
[12:43.800 --> 12:44.800]  Oh no.
[12:44.800 --> 12:45.800]  Oh no.
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.960]  That's, that's three days from the day of this recording.
[12:47.960 --> 12:48.960]  I don't like it.
[12:48.960 --> 12:51.960]  No, no, I don't need it now.
[12:51.960 --> 12:55.400]  I want a wonderful life.
[12:55.400 --> 12:56.800]  You're excited about this Kevin.
[12:56.800 --> 12:57.800]  I am.
[12:57.800 --> 12:59.200]  I am so excited.
[12:59.200 --> 13:01.760]  Maybe the game I'm well, that's not true.
[13:01.760 --> 13:05.280]  There's a lot of good games coming out now, but at least in terms of the cottage core
[13:05.280 --> 13:10.400]  sphere on this podcasting field, it's probably the game I'm most excited for.
[13:10.400 --> 13:11.400]  No, that's not true.
[13:11.400 --> 13:15.280]  Minneko comes out this year.
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.840]  I don't know how I'm going to, I'm not ready for this game, but I need it a wonderful life.
[13:20.840 --> 13:22.200]  It's it's a good game.
[13:22.200 --> 13:24.920]  Um, I'm wondering, I'm doing okay there, Kevin.
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.200]  No, no, I'm falling apart before the podcast and just falling apart more.
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.200]  I'm kidding.
[13:31.200 --> 13:39.880]  I wonder this feels like probably one of the biggest quote unquote releases in the cottage
[13:39.880 --> 13:41.480]  core field in a while.
[13:41.480 --> 13:49.460]  I'm curious to see how much traction or tension it gets because, uh, yes, you know, this,
[13:49.460 --> 13:51.520]  this is the nostalgia, right?
[13:51.520 --> 13:53.400]  Like that's, that's always a big one.
[13:53.400 --> 13:58.880]  Um, it's not just nostalgia, but it's specific nostalgia for this one because like this one,
[13:58.880 --> 14:03.120]  as I've mentioned this a couple of times, but this seems to be like most people who
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.800]  are kind of like our sort of age, this was their first farming game.
[14:07.800 --> 14:08.800]  Absolutely.
[14:08.800 --> 14:14.520]  Um, the time planets just kind of aligned at the timeline there.
[14:14.520 --> 14:16.400]  There wasn't a lot of competition back then.
[14:16.400 --> 14:17.400]  Right.
[14:17.400 --> 14:18.400]  Like, yeah.
[14:18.400 --> 14:22.440]  Um, so sure, but it's not, it's not, it wasn't one of the earlier harvest means it was this
[14:22.440 --> 14:23.440]  one specifically.
[14:23.440 --> 14:25.480]  Yeah, no, you're right.
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.000]  I think it, I think it might just be like the age we were when it came out, we could,
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.280]  we're old enough to appreciate it versus, you know, little kids probably don't fully
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.040]  get the intricacies of farming game or whatever.
[14:39.040 --> 14:43.040]  Anyways, point is, there's probably, there's a lot more people who care about this than
[14:43.040 --> 14:50.320]  say, Everdream Valley, no offense to Everdream Valley or any of the other games, just the
[14:50.320 --> 14:54.000]  name I saw, it's just, this is a big one.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.680]  So I'm really curious to see if this gets some traction and, and, and if it does, we
[14:59.680 --> 15:07.360]  will absolutely abuse the SEO and hashtag AWL or whatever we need to do to get people
[15:07.360 --> 15:08.360]  listening to this show.
[15:08.360 --> 15:15.240]  And it will be interesting to see how it, how it, how it works out compared to the original
[15:15.240 --> 15:17.560]  and your nostalgia and stuff like that.
[15:17.560 --> 15:18.560]  Oh gosh, oh gosh.
[15:18.560 --> 15:24.520]  I'm, I'm, I'm trying not to think about that because I'm not a big fan of some of the changes
[15:24.520 --> 15:31.160]  they've done, but we'll see, hopefully, I mean Story of Seasons will probably be good,
[15:31.160 --> 15:32.160]  at least mechanically.
[15:32.160 --> 15:33.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:33.160 --> 15:40.160]  All right, well, let's get into the, the actual new news.
[15:40.160 --> 15:43.160]  So first of all, Palia.
[15:43.160 --> 15:50.880]  So this was on the Nintendo Direct, that Palia is coming to Switch by the end of the year!
[15:50.880 --> 15:51.880]  Wow.
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.040]  So, I mean, if you, I guess, if you've not paid attention to what Palia is, we've talked
[15:57.040 --> 16:07.040]  about it a couple of times, but it's a free-to-play, cottagecore MMO set in the, in a high fantasy
[16:07.040 --> 16:08.040]  world.
[16:08.040 --> 16:16.880]  Yeah, I, I've been, I've missed, oh, I haven't been paying too close attention to Palia until
[16:16.880 --> 16:21.720]  the Direct one is forced in my face, basically, yeah.
[16:21.720 --> 16:28.200]  I don't know what to think, I mean, have people been enjoying this already?
[16:28.200 --> 16:36.200]  I don't know, it's, it's a tough spot to be in, MMO and cottagecore, like, it's, those
[16:36.200 --> 16:43.520]  are both big, big playing fields with big, big players, so it takes a lot to stand out.
[16:43.520 --> 16:45.840]  It's an interesting combination of things.
[16:45.840 --> 16:46.840]  It is.
[16:47.800 --> 16:59.960]  I mean, I think, on paper, those, those two Venn diagram circles overlap a lot, because
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.560]  a lot of cottagecore slash farming is, like, task-based, right?
[17:05.560 --> 17:09.080]  You gotta do your farming tasks, your fishing, yada yada.
[17:09.080 --> 17:14.400]  And a lot of MMO stuff is like that, too, so it probably lines up well.
[17:15.280 --> 17:19.600]  Yeah, yeah, I guess it'll be interesting, because, like, there are some things that
[17:19.600 --> 17:25.640]  can be in MMOs that are very definitely not calming, you know, and very much stressful,
[17:25.640 --> 17:27.840]  so it'll be interesting to see how it works with those sorts of things.
[17:27.840 --> 17:34.040]  I will admit, I haven't really looked into the game, but yeah, that's, it'll be interesting
[17:34.040 --> 17:35.040]  to see how that goes.
[17:35.040 --> 17:40.600]  Are you saying you don't want 10-person farming raids, whatever that would look like?
[17:40.600 --> 17:44.240]  I didn't, I didn't say that, no.
[17:44.240 --> 17:50.680]  My, okay, okay, so, all that, like, the general stuff aside, more specifically, I'm curious,
[17:50.680 --> 17:52.800]  is this gonna be cross-play?
[17:52.800 --> 17:55.080]  You would hope so, right?
[17:55.080 --> 17:56.860]  I think so, yeah.
[17:56.860 --> 18:00.400]  The interesting thing is, when they posted about this, they still haven't technically
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.840]  said, they still hadn't technically said that the PC version would be fully released by
[18:06.840 --> 18:10.720]  this year, and so they had some people complaining about that, so they were like, oh no, it will
[18:10.720 --> 18:15.000]  be fully releasing on PC before Switch, don't worry.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.160]  The fully released version, exclusive to Switch.
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:24.720 --> 18:29.080]  I'm not seeing anything about cross-play, but I'm not seeing anything about not cross-play,
[18:29.080 --> 18:31.920]  like, surely it would be, right?
[18:31.920 --> 18:40.200]  Yeah, I, it, it would be bananas if it didn't, cause they, um, yeah, I, I can't.
[18:40.200 --> 18:46.360]  Yeah, it was like the bread and butter for this sort of genre, to have everyone connect
[18:46.360 --> 18:47.360]  online, right?
[18:47.360 --> 18:49.480]  So, it'd be weird to split up your audience like that.
[18:49.480 --> 18:55.680]  Oh yes, here we are, I checked on our blog, um, we intend to support cross, cross-progression
[18:55.680 --> 19:00.160]  and cross-play, so you can bring your Palio character from PC to Nintendo Switch or vice
[19:00.160 --> 19:01.160]  versa.
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.360]  We're still working out the final details, so be sure to stay tuned to our Discord, Twitter,
[19:05.360 --> 19:08.000]  Instagram and Facebook for all the latest updates.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Okay, yeah.
[19:09.040 --> 19:11.800]  Yeah, alright, well, good for them.
[19:11.800 --> 19:14.440]  Um, what else we got going on?
[19:14.440 --> 19:22.320]  Uh, yes, so, Sunhaven, a new update for Sunhaven, 1.2, uh, cool, get me on Switch, please, hurry
[19:22.320 --> 19:23.320]  up.
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.360]  Um, so this is the Romance and Barns update.
[19:27.360 --> 19:29.080]  You can romance barns?
[19:29.080 --> 19:32.080]  Uh, yeah, everybody loves to romance barns.
[19:32.080 --> 19:38.480]  Um, so it's got new, romanceable characters, three of them, I believe, some new and upgradeable
[19:39.480 --> 19:47.400]  farm building with customization, some new player house customizability, there's quite
[19:47.400 --> 19:54.440]  a lot of customizability here, lots of colors, lots of things.
[19:54.440 --> 20:01.040]  You can customize your farm building to look like a tub of noodles.
[20:01.040 --> 20:04.440]  That's not bad, you've caught my attention.
[20:04.440 --> 20:10.080]  I thought I would, I thought I would, I know you, Kevin, I knew you.
[20:10.080 --> 20:14.760]  Now, I was about to say this game looks busy, just looking down the pictures and adding
[20:14.760 --> 20:15.840]  more to that is chaotic.
[20:15.840 --> 20:21.800]  But when you told me and I see it now, like the Oh, yeah, the Chinese takeout ramen box,
[20:21.800 --> 20:25.320]  like, okay, okay, no, they're, they're onto something.
[20:25.320 --> 20:29.760]  Now, now they have my attention, as soon as they hit the switch, you can make the player
[20:29.760 --> 20:36.360]  house look like a gingerbread house, a cup of coffee, you can have cat ears, I love the
[20:36.360 --> 20:37.360]  cat ears.
[20:37.360 --> 20:38.360]  Yeah.
[20:38.360 --> 20:47.760]  And for new DLC packs, so the their DLC packs are all like additional cosplayer cosmetics.
[20:47.760 --> 20:52.040]  There's a snacks snackoon costume.
[20:52.040 --> 20:54.640]  So this this snackoon one is free as well.
[20:54.640 --> 20:58.160]  So you can go get the snackoon outfit and I suspect they've done this to just get you
[20:58.160 --> 21:02.480]  used to the idea of getting a DLC.
[21:02.480 --> 21:07.080]  There's the set sale DLC, which contains over 40 items.
[21:07.080 --> 21:13.960]  The pirate themed pack, next you have the mush mushy DLC, which is a mushroom themed
[21:13.960 --> 21:15.880]  pack with over 40 items as well.
[21:15.880 --> 21:21.240]  I don't like mushrooms and eating at least well, no, but I mean, you like things are
[21:21.240 --> 21:22.240]  themed like mushrooms.
[21:22.240 --> 21:25.480]  I do love the mushroom themed things though.
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.820]  And the ocean shores DLC, which contains over 30 items.
[21:29.820 --> 21:32.080]  And it's a beach themed pack.
[21:32.080 --> 21:33.560]  This is pretty cool.
[21:33.560 --> 21:38.840]  Um, like, now, like just thinking about this, I'm a paid or I mean, I have paid attention
[21:38.840 --> 21:44.040]  to Sunhaven, but it's falling out of my brain, and so I'm repaying attention right now.
[21:44.040 --> 21:49.360]  I going all out and turning your farm into nonsense.
[21:49.360 --> 21:51.340]  That's not something you see that frequently.
[21:51.340 --> 21:52.840]  So I appreciate that.
[21:52.840 --> 21:53.840]  Yeah.
[21:53.840 --> 21:56.200]  I'm looking forward to playing this game.
[21:56.200 --> 21:57.860]  I just want it on the switch.
[21:57.860 --> 22:00.960]  Can we get on the switch, please?
[22:00.960 --> 22:01.960]  Coming soon.
[22:01.960 --> 22:04.720]  Bunch of stuff.
[22:04.720 --> 22:06.920]  Give me on switch.
[22:06.920 --> 22:10.280]  That's I mean, that's a common sentiment for most things in my life.
[22:10.280 --> 22:13.040]  I'm not even seeing any mention of the switch anymore.
[22:13.040 --> 22:17.400]  They're they're listening to this right now, just like the mosque people.
[22:17.400 --> 22:19.440]  They're they're avoiding it intentionally.
[22:19.440 --> 22:20.440]  Yeah.
[22:20.440 --> 22:21.440]  Anyway.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.440]  Cool.
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.440]  What's next?
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.840]  So we've got silent hope.
[22:25.840 --> 22:30.460]  So this is a new game announced by the ring factory team because they hadn't announced
[22:30.460 --> 22:33.760]  enough games recently.
[22:33.760 --> 22:36.360]  This is a battle and farming RPG.
[22:36.360 --> 22:42.560]  So I mean, can the same concept as ring factory, but a different way of thinking about it.
[22:42.560 --> 22:47.340]  They've said it is in the same world as ring factory.
[22:47.340 --> 22:51.280]  It also, you know, contains the chicken and cow.
[22:51.280 --> 22:52.280]  Yeah.
[22:53.120 --> 22:54.720]  I didn't pay attention.
[22:54.720 --> 22:55.720]  It's the cow.
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.720]  I didn't.
[22:56.720 --> 23:00.000]  Oh, I love that cow.
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.320]  It's coming out on the third of October on steam and switch.
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.920]  I'm intrigued by this.
[23:07.920 --> 23:10.960]  It looks a lot more like something I would enjoy.
[23:10.960 --> 23:17.280]  It looks like if I if, if somebody had designed room factory for me to like, sure.
[23:17.280 --> 23:20.380]  Like it just looks a lot more fun.
[23:20.380 --> 23:25.140]  And they're going, they're keeping on the kind of like 2.5 D style.
[23:25.140 --> 23:29.960]  Like you're kind of like, it's, you're moving around in three dimensions, but you're not
[23:29.960 --> 23:36.340]  like your camera isn't like down low and you're, I just don't, I'm not a huge fan of how ring
[23:36.340 --> 23:37.340]  factory has gone.
[23:37.340 --> 23:38.900]  I'm not saying they shouldn't do that.
[23:38.900 --> 23:40.060]  I know a lot of people would enjoy.
[23:40.060 --> 23:43.500]  I'm just personally not a huge fan of that.
[23:43.500 --> 23:49.540]  But I much prefer the graphics to this and the combat looks more fun to me.
[23:49.540 --> 23:52.860]  So I will almost certainly be picking this up.
[23:52.860 --> 23:56.320]  I on it was on the direct.
[23:56.320 --> 23:59.500]  I watched it wasn't paying too much attention, probably because I was still reeling from
[23:59.500 --> 24:02.100]  other news.
[24:02.100 --> 24:06.980]  But now, like, I totally missed that it was in the room factory world.
[24:06.980 --> 24:07.980]  That's cool.
[24:07.980 --> 24:10.980]  I say is someone who's never factory game.
[24:10.980 --> 24:12.460]  Yeah, but it's still it's still cool.
[24:12.460 --> 24:16.620]  You can it's cool in concept, even if they've never actually been part of that.
[24:16.620 --> 24:17.620]  Yeah.
[24:17.620 --> 24:18.620]  I'm looking at it.
[24:18.700 --> 24:19.700]  With your points.
[24:19.700 --> 24:20.700]  It looks dynamic.
[24:20.700 --> 24:23.800]  It looks the visuals are nice enough.
[24:23.800 --> 24:25.300]  And it has the cow.
[24:25.300 --> 24:26.300]  That's all that.
[24:26.300 --> 24:27.300]  That's the selling point.
[24:27.300 --> 24:32.000]  It is one of the best designed cows in in the genre.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.260]  You know, it really is.
[24:33.260 --> 24:35.940]  You'd be hard pressed to find a better cow.
[24:35.940 --> 24:36.940]  Yeah.
[24:36.940 --> 24:37.940]  Oh, so yeah.
[24:37.940 --> 24:38.940]  Do we have it?
[24:38.940 --> 24:39.940]  I forget.
[24:39.940 --> 24:40.940]  Did you say date?
[24:40.940 --> 24:41.940]  Do we have a date?
[24:41.940 --> 24:42.940]  Yeah.
[24:42.940 --> 24:43.940]  Third of October.
[24:43.940 --> 24:45.780]  So although I say I will be buying this, let's be honest, I'm not going to buy on and play
[24:45.780 --> 24:49.780]  on release day because that's only a week after Maneko's Night Market, Harvest Moon,
[24:49.780 --> 24:54.980]  The Winds of Anthos, Paleo Pines and My Time at Sandrock all release.
[24:54.980 --> 24:56.780]  How are you going to survive that week?
[24:56.780 --> 24:57.780]  Good heavens.
[24:57.780 --> 25:00.820]  I'm going to survive it by not playing My Time at Sandrock.
[25:00.820 --> 25:04.140]  Yeah, I don't.
[25:04.140 --> 25:07.700]  We've got I'm trying to figure out the right order to do these things.
[25:07.700 --> 25:09.960]  And that's only the cottagecore obligations.
[25:09.960 --> 25:12.100]  There's some other good junk coming.
[25:12.100 --> 25:16.740]  Well, yeah, there's a few weeks at least before other things come out.
[25:16.740 --> 25:17.740]  Mm hmm.
[25:17.740 --> 25:22.860]  Oh, man, yeah, it's definitely gonna be a busy autumn.
[25:22.860 --> 25:23.860]  Surprise!
[25:23.860 --> 25:27.220]  Pokemon DLC launches that week.
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.940]  I don't think it would come out in October.
[25:28.940 --> 25:30.580]  No, I don't think so either.
[25:30.580 --> 25:32.460]  And I think it will come out in November.
[25:32.460 --> 25:33.460]  Probably.
[25:33.460 --> 25:34.460]  I think it will be in November and February.
[25:34.460 --> 25:37.180]  I think it will be what it is, but we'll see.
[25:37.180 --> 25:39.420]  We'll talk about that on a different thing.
[25:39.420 --> 25:47.220]  And the final news entry is another new game, Wild Mender.
[25:47.220 --> 25:49.620]  So I think this one was mentioned on the...
[25:49.620 --> 25:50.820]  Was this one mentioned on the...
[25:50.820 --> 25:53.220]  No, it wasn't mentioned on the direct.
[25:53.220 --> 25:57.180]  This was just another random thing.
[25:57.180 --> 25:58.180]  What was this?
[25:58.180 --> 26:02.980]  So this is a desert gardening survival game.
[26:02.980 --> 26:07.020]  Start from a tiny spring and cultivate a blooming garden.
[26:07.020 --> 26:11.900]  Explore a vast world amid the sands and uncover its mysteries.
[26:11.900 --> 26:17.540]  Can you defend against the relentless forces of nature and mysterious wraith corruption
[26:17.540 --> 26:19.900]  to bring life to a dying world?
[26:19.900 --> 26:20.900]  That's...
[26:20.900 --> 26:21.900]  That was a lot of words.
[26:21.900 --> 26:22.900]  It was.
[26:22.900 --> 26:26.380]  I'm not really sure how to get all in.
[26:26.380 --> 26:27.380]  I like the graphics.
[26:27.380 --> 26:29.520]  Yeah, no, I'm looking at the trailer.
[26:29.520 --> 26:32.180]  This has very pleasing visuals.
[26:32.180 --> 26:33.820]  It's a really nice kind of combination.
[26:33.820 --> 26:36.700]  It's kind of like a nice balance between...
[26:36.700 --> 26:41.380]  It's not ridiculously cartoony, but it's also not trying to be realistic.
[26:41.380 --> 26:46.420]  It's more on the kind of like, I guess, kind of like, you know, Breath of the Wild kind
[26:46.420 --> 26:47.420]  of idea.
[26:47.420 --> 26:48.420]  Yeah, in that general direction.
[26:48.420 --> 26:51.100]  Realistic cartoony, if that makes sense.
[26:51.100 --> 26:55.740]  Like it's not trying to look wind waker-y, like really ridiculously cartoony, but it's
[26:55.740 --> 26:57.380]  not trying to be realistic.
[26:57.380 --> 27:00.900]  Yeah, no, I totally see what you mean.
[27:00.900 --> 27:04.120]  And something it does very well is lighting.
[27:04.120 --> 27:10.960]  Like there's some sunset scenes and you have like a little cape that's glowing and oh,
[27:10.960 --> 27:11.960]  that's really pretty.
[27:11.960 --> 27:12.960]  Yeah.
[27:12.960 --> 27:14.540]  There's glowing plants and things.
[27:14.540 --> 27:16.780]  Northern Lights, or I guess it's just the Aurora.
[27:16.780 --> 27:17.780]  I don't know where this is.
[27:17.780 --> 27:19.780]  This is some Aurora.
[27:19.780 --> 27:20.780]  Yeah.
[27:20.780 --> 27:26.500]  So I don't know, there's a lot going on.
[27:26.500 --> 27:30.060]  I'll be keeping an eye on this because it does look very pretty.
[27:30.060 --> 27:35.420]  If nothing else, like these visuals are worth checking out.
[27:35.420 --> 27:39.260]  It looks like it might, I've not seen a mention of it, but it looks like it might be open
[27:39.260 --> 27:40.260]  world.
[27:40.260 --> 27:46.700]  It's definitely kind of like the way that you're traveling is very much like kind of
[27:46.700 --> 27:51.100]  Breath of the Wild type thing where you're running around and climbing, you can, it looks
[27:51.100 --> 27:56.900]  like you can climb anything and kind of go anywhere sort of thing.
[27:56.900 --> 28:01.900]  So a minor complaint, and this is probably just a personal thing.
[28:01.900 --> 28:05.020]  For a, they're selling themselves as a desert game.
[28:05.020 --> 28:07.180]  There's a lot of not desert in this game.
[28:07.180 --> 28:08.860]  There's a lot of lush forests and-
[28:08.860 --> 28:11.980]  Yeah, well, I think the point is you're turning the desert into a forest.
[28:11.980 --> 28:17.940]  I think that's the point because it says, turn the desert green with the tools you crafted
[28:17.940 --> 28:23.620]  set out to grow the little oasis in the middle of a vast desert into your own thriving garden.
[28:23.620 --> 28:29.340]  Dig canals, nurture your plants, craft useful and beautiful structures, harness magical
[28:29.340 --> 28:32.740]  essence, protect against the forces of nature and more.
[28:32.740 --> 28:36.220]  You'll have plenty of space and choices to create the garden of your imagination.
[28:36.220 --> 28:41.180]  Acre by acre, you will reclaim the desert and reforest the world.
[28:41.180 --> 28:46.700]  I get that, but I also would like to see a game that's just purely desert farming.
[28:46.700 --> 28:49.340]  I want to see what that would look like.
[28:49.340 --> 28:57.980]  But yeah, so I'm guessing your loop here is you go out into the desert to explore and
[28:57.980 --> 28:58.980]  find things.
[28:58.980 --> 29:03.300]  You come back to your oasis and you nurture it and grow things and that slowly expands
[29:03.300 --> 29:08.100]  and then as that expands, you're then able to explore further out.
[29:08.100 --> 29:11.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:11.180 --> 29:12.180]  It's a good looking game.
[29:12.180 --> 29:15.900]  I will keep my eye on this, what is it?
[29:15.900 --> 29:16.900]  Wild Mender.
[29:16.900 --> 29:17.900]  Yeah.
[29:17.900 --> 29:18.900]  Wild Mender.
[29:19.460 --> 29:25.260]  I've not seen anything about Switch, it looks like it's just Windows on Steam as far as
[29:25.260 --> 29:26.260]  I can see.
[29:26.260 --> 29:30.980]  Well, hopefully it does well enough that they feel a Switch port would be justified.
[29:30.980 --> 29:35.020]  Yes, and presumably it'll work on the Steam Deck.
[29:35.020 --> 29:40.100]  The good thing, as I've mentioned before, about Steam Deck is that it gets people thinking
[29:40.100 --> 29:46.980]  of controllers from the start so that then porting to Switch can be a little bit easier
[29:46.980 --> 29:48.540]  in that aspect of things.
[29:48.580 --> 29:51.100]  Yeah, yeah, that's very true.
[29:51.100 --> 29:52.340]  Alright, cool.
[29:52.340 --> 29:54.780]  That's all the news.
[29:54.780 --> 29:56.780]  So I realized I didn't mention at the top what we're doing.
[29:56.780 --> 30:01.940]  Well, you said we're going to talk about farming games and we're going to talk about farming
[30:01.940 --> 30:02.940]  games.
[30:02.940 --> 30:05.100]  So we're going to do a mid-year catch up.
[30:05.100 --> 30:12.860]  So this is the middle of the year, this is the 26th episode of the year, my word, that's
[30:12.860 --> 30:13.860]  ridiculous.
[30:13.860 --> 30:14.860]  I don't like that.
[30:14.860 --> 30:17.180]  I don't like that at all.
[30:17.180 --> 30:22.020]  We have now done more episodes this year, or as many episodes this year as we did last
[30:22.020 --> 30:23.020]  year.
[30:23.020 --> 30:27.620]  Oh, that's cool, but I don't like the halfway point thing.
[30:27.620 --> 30:30.500]  Oh, oh no.
[30:30.500 --> 30:33.060]  So we're going to talk about what's happened so far.
[30:33.060 --> 30:36.020]  Out of what's happened so far, what's our favorite?
[30:36.020 --> 30:39.180]  Is anything in contention for Game of the Year so far?
[30:39.180 --> 30:45.300]  And we'll maybe go over what's still to come out, which I'm just going to reorganize things,
[30:45.300 --> 30:46.740]  so I'll pull that down.
[30:46.740 --> 30:50.900]  So I guess I'll just go through this list of things that have released so far, because
[30:50.900 --> 30:54.840]  I've got much better on keeping track of what games are coming out.
[30:54.840 --> 30:57.680]  And so hopefully this will be much easier at the end of the year as well.
[30:57.680 --> 30:59.340]  So here's my long list.
[30:59.340 --> 31:00.740]  We love lists.
[31:00.740 --> 31:02.100]  Games released so far this year.
[31:02.100 --> 31:08.420]  Above Snakes, Before the Green Moon, Everdream Valley, Fableton, Early Access, Farming Simulator
[31:08.420 --> 31:16.980]  23, Garden Inn, Homestead Arcana, Enchanted, Research Story Early Access, Roots of Pacha,
[31:16.980 --> 31:24.100]  Season A Letter to the Future, Smooshy Come Home, Song of the Prairie, Sundown, Sunhaven
[31:24.100 --> 31:30.740]  1.0, T'Chia, Terra Nil, and of course not technically out yet, but by the time this
[31:30.740 --> 31:36.520]  podcast comes out are One Lonely Outpost Early Access, no I'm going to redo that one, One
[31:36.520 --> 31:43.520]  Lonely Outpost Early Access, and Story of Seasons, A Wonderful Life.
[31:43.520 --> 31:47.000]  I think that's more games than came out in 2021.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  It feels like it.
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.280]  Yep, looking at the list, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, yeah there's like
[31:52.280 --> 31:56.880]  12 games that came out in 2021, and that is more than 12 games.
[31:56.880 --> 32:05.800]  I mean, well okay, I probably, not just Cottagecore, it feels like gaming in general a lot is coming
[32:05.800 --> 32:08.480]  out this year.
[32:08.480 --> 32:17.720]  I think that might be thanks to getting over the COVID pandemic stuff, or a lot of that.
[32:17.720 --> 32:25.440]  By this point people have adjusted or whatever, that's just a thought maybe, I have no actual
[32:25.440 --> 32:27.520]  evidence of that.
[32:27.520 --> 32:32.680]  But that is a lot of games though, I'm on the show every now and then, I don't know
[32:32.680 --> 32:33.720]  some of these games.
[32:33.720 --> 32:36.960]  What is Smooshy?
[32:36.960 --> 32:37.960]  What is Smooshy?
[32:37.960 --> 32:39.720]  What is before the green moon?
[32:39.720 --> 32:40.720]  What are these?
[32:40.720 --> 32:45.480]  Smooshy Come Home is the one where you're a wee toadstool or mushroom type thing, and
[32:45.480 --> 32:50.080]  you're running around delivering mail and doing tasks and stuff like that.
[32:50.080 --> 32:51.080]  What?
[32:51.080 --> 32:53.560]  I don't remember this, this is an adorable mushroom guy!
[32:53.560 --> 32:55.600]  Yeah, it came out like two weeks ago.
[32:55.600 --> 32:57.200]  It's on Switch, what?
[32:57.200 --> 33:00.640]  It was a shadow drop for the Wholesome Direct.
[33:00.640 --> 33:01.640]  What?
[33:01.640 --> 33:07.280]  I'm going to look at this, that's an adorable mushroom man guy thing.
[33:07.280 --> 33:13.600]  Okay, that's new, oh wow, that's new to me.
[33:13.600 --> 33:18.280]  So there are, so I just counted, so in 2019 there were 14 games that I've tracked that
[33:18.280 --> 33:19.280]  came out.
[33:19.280 --> 33:23.000]  In 2020 there were 10 games that came out, makes sense, in 2020.
[33:23.000 --> 33:26.560]  In 2021 there were 16 games that came out.
[33:26.560 --> 33:31.400]  So far this year, that was 19 games.
[33:31.400 --> 33:38.240]  Wow, that's a lot.
[33:38.240 --> 33:49.080]  So Kevin, maybe I should go first, so I don't think I've played any of these games at all.
[33:49.080 --> 33:54.760]  I legitimately don't think I've played any of these games, which is really kind of a
[33:54.760 --> 34:00.040]  little bit embarrassing to say, and also quite a little bit shocking that I've not played
[34:00.040 --> 34:02.520]  a single game that's come out this year so far.
[34:02.520 --> 34:06.720]  We're halfway through the year and I've not played a single 2023 game!
[34:06.720 --> 34:12.720]  Well I think it's two things, one, well a few things, one, there's a lot of games in
[34:12.720 --> 34:21.040]  general, slash life in general, you can't blame anyone for that, but two, it's not like
[34:21.040 --> 34:24.680]  this show's not covering anything, we're still trying to catch up from older stuff
[34:24.680 --> 34:25.680]  right?
[34:25.680 --> 34:27.080]  There's a lot!
[34:27.080 --> 34:31.640]  I was looking through the list of episodes that I've been on, and the game ones are all
[34:31.640 --> 34:36.320]  games that came out at the end of last year basically.
[34:36.320 --> 34:45.340]  And three, I don't know the statistics, but we've got a lot of people on the team now
[34:45.340 --> 34:49.240]  for this show, so it's been splitting up more.
[34:49.240 --> 34:52.920]  Some of the games that have been played that come out this year were played by other people
[34:52.920 --> 34:53.920]  that weren't you.
[34:53.960 --> 34:56.280]  Yes that is true, the podcast has covered them.
[34:56.280 --> 35:01.360]  But also, also, all of the games I was most looking forward to aren't out yet, right?
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.600]  So we've got Vanecco's Night Market, which isn't out yet, we've got Snacko, which isn't
[35:06.600 --> 35:10.120]  out yet, we've got, what else was there?
[35:10.120 --> 35:12.120]  Winds of Anthos, Palaeopines.
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.560]  I wouldn't say the Winds of Anthos is what I'm most excited about, but yeah, of course
[35:16.560 --> 35:20.280]  A Wonderful Life was the third one that I put in that episode of the ones I'm most
[35:20.280 --> 35:21.280]  excited about.
[35:21.280 --> 35:23.040]  All three of them are not out yet.
[35:23.040 --> 35:26.640]  And then yeah, everything else that I'm really obviously going to cover, obviously I'm going
[35:26.640 --> 35:33.600]  to cover the Winds of Anthos, you know, all these things, they're just not out yet.
[35:33.600 --> 35:36.120]  I mean I will play some of these, but like-
[35:36.120 --> 35:39.360]  I'm going to play Smooshy at some point.
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.880]  Yeah, I do need to play that.
[35:41.880 --> 35:47.200]  The problem is, the Shadow dropped it, so I can't just add it into the list of games.
[35:47.200 --> 35:48.200]  Especially at this time of year.
[35:48.200 --> 35:52.880]  This is a really bad time of year to Shadow drop a game and then just cover it, right?
[35:52.880 --> 35:59.760]  Because we have been planned the next two months of episodes, we planned it like two
[35:59.760 --> 36:00.760]  months ago.
[36:00.760 --> 36:07.520]  Because there's a lot of work to do, to do more than two months worth of podcasting in
[36:07.520 --> 36:08.520]  the course of a month.
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.160]  It's a lot of work to do that.
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.880]  So maybe that will be one of the episodes we do in the second half of the year, because
[36:15.880 --> 36:19.120]  yeah, I do definitely want to play that game.
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.640]  Okay, well since you don't have a game of the year contender per se, what are you most
[36:24.640 --> 36:26.480]  excited for to play?
[36:26.480 --> 36:27.720]  Either these ones.
[36:27.720 --> 36:30.400]  Yeah, well I don't know, or just the ones upcoming.
[36:30.400 --> 36:34.680]  Well, yeah, we're going to talk about the ones that are coming later, we'll talk about
[36:34.680 --> 36:35.680]  them afterwards.
[36:35.680 --> 36:36.680]  Out of the list.
[36:36.680 --> 36:39.960]  Like you said, you'll play one of these at some point, probably.
[36:39.960 --> 36:44.240]  So I think probably the games.
[36:44.240 --> 36:48.920]  So I think there are four in this list that I definitely want to play at some point and
[36:48.920 --> 36:51.680]  definitely excited about.
[36:51.680 --> 36:54.240]  So obviously story seasons a wonderful life.
[36:54.240 --> 36:58.760]  And, of course, I'm not going to be on the episode that we're covering that for.
[36:58.760 --> 36:59.760]  But anyway, whatever.
[36:59.760 --> 37:03.160]  Maybe I'll do a second harvest on it.
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.920]  There's roots of patch I do want to play at some point, I'm quite excited about that.
[37:07.920 --> 37:09.780]  I've just not taken the time to do.
[37:09.780 --> 37:11.120]  Unknownly outpost.
[37:11.120 --> 37:15.660]  I'm still excited about I think, but not to the degree that I used to be, but I think
[37:15.660 --> 37:17.300]  I'm still excited about it.
[37:17.300 --> 37:19.820]  And of course, smooshy come home.
[37:19.820 --> 37:21.460]  I'm excited about as well.
[37:21.460 --> 37:22.460]  Yeah.
[37:22.460 --> 37:24.300]  Um, so there we go.
[37:24.300 --> 37:25.300]  Those are my four.
[37:25.300 --> 37:29.700]  I don't think any of them except possibly a wonderful life.
[37:29.700 --> 37:33.900]  I don't think any of the others will be in my running for game of the year.
[37:33.900 --> 37:39.020]  I think all of my games run game of the year will probably be in the games are not out
[37:39.060 --> 37:44.060]  But obviously depends on how many of them actually get released.
[37:44.060 --> 37:45.140]  Is it true?
[37:45.140 --> 37:49.140]  I mean, the ones we do have dates that will very likely come out.
[37:49.140 --> 37:52.820]  Those are already some of the contenders, though, look, it's gonna be really it's gonna
[37:52.820 --> 37:56.300]  be really hard for me not to choose my neck was my market, right?
[37:56.300 --> 37:57.300]  Right.
[37:57.300 --> 38:00.380]  Like, like, I don't like to give too much away.
[38:00.380 --> 38:04.260]  But let's be honest, we have been excited about that for years, Kevin.
[38:04.500 --> 38:06.660]  I need it so bad.
[38:06.660 --> 38:12.020]  Finally, we still have you didn't put our way is that not coming out this year?
[38:12.020 --> 38:13.020]  What's up?
[38:13.020 --> 38:14.020]  Mika?
[38:14.020 --> 38:18.540]  Oh, Mika, do I not have that on my list?
[38:18.540 --> 38:20.660]  Yeah, Mika, when is that?
[38:20.660 --> 38:21.660]  Oh, it's odd.
[38:21.660 --> 38:23.660]  It's because it's 2020 23.
[38:23.660 --> 38:24.660]  Yeah.
[38:24.660 --> 38:26.180]  So we don't technically have it.
[38:26.180 --> 38:33.060]  There are ways that like 20 games, your bullet point says a million games with just 2023
[38:33.060 --> 38:35.820]  in their release date.
[38:35.820 --> 38:36.820]  Which is true.
[38:36.820 --> 38:41.460]  There are 24 games that are on my list that just say 2023.
[38:41.460 --> 38:45.140]  Yeah, we're not gonna talk about those.
[38:45.140 --> 38:47.340]  Half of them will not release this year.
[38:47.340 --> 38:48.580]  Oh, absolutely.
[38:48.580 --> 38:51.140]  You're being generous.
[38:51.140 --> 38:53.980]  At least half of them.
[38:53.980 --> 38:54.980]  We'll get to that.
[38:54.980 --> 38:55.980]  We'll get to that.
[38:55.980 --> 38:56.980]  Okay, Kevin.
[38:56.980 --> 38:57.980]  What about you?
[38:58.900 --> 39:03.180]  Okay, I mean, like, I haven't played that many games because there's too many games
[39:03.180 --> 39:07.580]  not even just cottagecore.
[39:07.580 --> 39:13.540]  I think, as of right now, what I have played, well, I played, let's see, Roots of Pacha,
[39:13.540 --> 39:22.340]  I played Taranil, and I'm going to play Story of Seasons, which, oh, man, Homestead Arcana
[39:22.340 --> 39:23.340]  is out.
[39:23.340 --> 39:27.700]  When did that come out?
[39:28.420 --> 39:31.620]  I did want to check that out because it has Yuri's Lontal in it.
[39:31.620 --> 39:38.060]  Anyways, still, out of all those, like, I think it goes without saying, Roots of Pacha
[39:38.060 --> 39:45.020]  right now is holding the crown, because that's a darn good game.
[39:45.020 --> 39:47.420]  I'm still playing that game.
[39:47.420 --> 39:52.020]  I can't wait for more content updates and whatever.
[39:52.020 --> 39:55.300]  And you're saying, obviously, I'm not saying that you're saying that it will be Game of
[39:55.300 --> 39:56.300]  the Year.
[39:56.300 --> 40:00.700]  But you're saying that if nothing else comes out this year, you're saying it is a contender
[40:00.700 --> 40:01.700]  for Game of the Year?
[40:01.700 --> 40:04.900]  Yes, yes, I would say so.
[40:04.900 --> 40:07.500]  I would never have guessed that before it came out.
[40:07.500 --> 40:11.740]  I would never have guessed that Roots of Pacha would be that good.
[40:11.740 --> 40:18.020]  I mean, I, I didn't, I don't think I expected it to be this good either.
[40:18.020 --> 40:24.260]  Because again, just rehashing stuff I've said, Nauseam, at the end of the day, it's a very,
[40:24.260 --> 40:27.340]  very Stardew clone game.
[40:27.340 --> 40:33.740]  But the Stone Age coat of paint, and what the love they give to the mechanics and stuff
[40:33.740 --> 40:36.460]  are all really well done.
[40:36.460 --> 40:38.460]  It sucks you in like Stardew does.
[40:38.460 --> 40:39.460]  Well that's the thing.
[40:39.460 --> 40:41.000]  And that's, that's all you need.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.820]  You need to be able to do it well.
[40:42.820 --> 40:43.820]  And that's the thing, right?
[40:43.820 --> 40:47.820]  Like that's, that's what you just don't know until, until it comes out.
[40:47.820 --> 40:48.820]  Yeah.
[40:48.820 --> 40:53.560]  So yeah, Roots of Pacha again, and that's the stuff I played right now.
[40:53.560 --> 40:57.220]  What story of Seasons in that weird place of basically being here?
[40:57.220 --> 41:03.600]  That one, I mean, is probably, again, heavy bias for me, just like many other people.
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.880]  First Codgecore game, well, or farming game, let's say.
[41:07.880 --> 41:09.200]  There's a lot riding on that one.
[41:09.200 --> 41:13.120]  I think the devs know there's a lot riding on this one.
[41:13.120 --> 41:14.120]  Hopefully.
[41:14.120 --> 41:15.120]  Yeah.
[41:15.120 --> 41:16.120]  Hopefully indeed.
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.120]  But that's, but that's the thing, with that one, you can't see at this point, right?
[41:21.120 --> 41:24.580]  You can potentially say that it will be in the running, but you just don't know, because
[41:24.580 --> 41:25.580]  you haven't played it.
[41:25.580 --> 41:26.580]  You don't know how it feels.
[41:26.580 --> 41:27.580]  Yeah.
[41:27.580 --> 41:28.580]  That's the problem.
[41:28.580 --> 41:31.960]  So yeah, out of this list, yeah, it's going to be Roots of Pacha, but it's...
[41:31.960 --> 41:35.200]  Wildflowers, though.
[41:35.200 --> 41:36.440]  Didn't come out this year, dude.
[41:36.440 --> 41:37.440]  Too late.
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.520]  I played it this year, Kao, this year for me.
[41:40.520 --> 41:43.320]  Well, this is the thing, right?
[41:43.320 --> 41:46.440]  Back when we started, I was, I was allowing that in Game of the Year.
[41:46.440 --> 41:49.960]  I was like, you know, if you played one this year, then sure, we'll do it.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.400]  But there's too many games that come out for us to do that now.
[41:52.400 --> 41:53.400]  Yeah.
[41:53.400 --> 41:55.280]  I think it's just ridiculous.
[41:55.280 --> 41:58.200]  And I say that, but I don't remember, did I start?
[41:58.200 --> 42:02.440]  I don't know when I started Wildflowers, I might have started last year.
[42:02.440 --> 42:04.440]  I don't know.
[42:04.440 --> 42:06.860]  Anyways, but yeah, okay.
[42:06.860 --> 42:11.320]  Let's talk about the ones that are coming out, though, the heavyweights.
[42:11.320 --> 42:16.040]  So here's the, here's the list of games that we have either an exact date for or a window
[42:16.040 --> 42:18.760]  that isn't just 2023, right?
[42:18.760 --> 42:23.400]  I don't think all of these will come out, but I think most of these will come out.
[42:23.400 --> 42:31.240]  Those are Sprout Valley, Cloudscape, Cornucopia, Flutteraway, Faefarm, Moneko's Night Market,
[42:31.240 --> 42:36.360]  Harvest Moon the Winds of Anthos, Paleopines, My Time at Sandrock, Moonstone Island, Spirit
[42:36.360 --> 42:45.520]  Tea, Dragon Acres, Critter Crops, Meat Light, Circle of Kurzovin, and Cloa, Child of the
[42:45.520 --> 42:46.520]  Forest.
[42:46.520 --> 42:53.960]  And that's not to mention all the ones that are just 2023, which include Iconi Island,
[42:53.960 --> 43:01.840]  Wonderful, Mica and the Witch's Mountain, Laudelnot, Petodachi, Horticular, Snacko,
[43:01.840 --> 43:07.120]  Wanderlust, Ever After Falls, Little Witch in the Woods, Ova Magica, Elusive People,
[43:07.120 --> 43:13.360]  Moonhaven, Wholesome Out and About, Super Zoo Story, Pixel Shire, A Last Song, Distant
[43:13.360 --> 43:20.460]  Doom, Moondrop, Moss Field Origins, Disney Dreamlight Valley, Coral Island, Harvest Days,
[43:20.460 --> 43:23.720]  and Lens Island.
[43:23.720 --> 43:27.240]  This genre needs to get better at naming things.
[43:27.240 --> 43:28.640]  How many islands were there?
[43:28.640 --> 43:30.720]  How many valleys were there?
[43:30.720 --> 43:32.160]  Like oh my word.
[43:32.160 --> 43:34.000]  They're all just...
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.920]  I started glazing over a little.
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.880]  Again, I don't even know all these games, but just the names, holy moly.
[43:41.880 --> 43:42.880]  Here's the problem.
[43:42.880 --> 43:47.720]  Even if you're just going to pick out the ones you're excited about, we've got obviously
[43:47.720 --> 43:53.480]  Mineko's Night Market, we've got Harvest Moon in the Winds of Anthos, we've got Paleo Pines,
[43:53.480 --> 44:04.500]  we've got Snacko, Mica and the Witch's Mountain, Petodachi, I know you're excited about Super
[44:04.500 --> 44:10.260]  Zoo Story, we've got Disney Dreamlight Valley, Coral Island, Lens Island.
[44:10.260 --> 44:16.180]  These are just like, we're just picking out them, we've still got to a list of ten.
[44:16.180 --> 44:18.060]  Is this you googling Super Zoo Story?
[44:18.060 --> 44:19.060]  It is!
[44:19.060 --> 44:20.060]  I don't remember!
[44:20.060 --> 44:21.060]  Am I excited?
[44:21.060 --> 44:22.060]  Oh, come on!
[44:22.060 --> 44:23.860]  How do you not remember it, man?
[44:23.860 --> 44:26.500]  You were so excited about it when we talked about it last.
[44:26.500 --> 44:31.980]  Okay, I don't remember, but okay, there's a lot going on here.
[44:31.980 --> 44:38.900]  Alright, I mean, I like Let's Build a Zoo, so I'll probably be excited, I like animals.
[44:38.900 --> 44:39.900]  There's dinosaurs in there.
[44:39.900 --> 44:43.820]  I'm not complaining.
[44:43.820 --> 44:50.940]  I really want to know how this is compared to Let's Build a Zoo, but I think this is
[44:50.940 --> 44:55.700]  an RPG rather than a management game, which makes it more different.
[44:55.700 --> 44:57.820]  Yeah, which is interesting.
[44:57.820 --> 44:59.820]  It makes me want to play it more.
[44:59.820 --> 45:07.140]  Oh, I don't know, but I'm exhausted just talking about all of these, man.
[45:07.140 --> 45:14.700]  In the really difficult part, this is no offense to any of these games, like I said,
[45:14.700 --> 45:21.300]  I don't even remember half of them, apparently I was interested in Super Zoo or whatever,
[45:21.300 --> 45:27.940]  that Maneko's Night Market exists, and I just, who cares, it's Maneko's Night Market,
[45:27.940 --> 45:34.940]  and then in my mind, the list is Maneko's Night Market, one bullet point, maybe Story
[45:34.940 --> 45:38.660]  of Seasons, another bullet point, and then everything else, third bullet point.
[45:38.660 --> 45:41.220]  Yeah, so here's a problem for you, right?
[45:41.220 --> 45:44.820]  You can't choose Maneko's Night Market, and you can't choose Story of Seasons, A Wonderful
[45:44.820 --> 45:50.780]  Life, what are you most excited for?
[45:50.780 --> 45:53.140]  Maybe Super Zoo Story, question mark!
[45:53.140 --> 45:56.580]  Well, it's the thing, it's really hard to pick one out, isn't it?
[45:56.580 --> 45:57.580]  Yeah.
[45:57.580 --> 46:06.340]  I have to look at, I remember Chloe, that seems familiar, hold on.
[46:06.340 --> 46:09.620]  I can't even really remember that one.
[46:09.620 --> 46:13.700]  I know we talked about it, I just don't remember what it's like.
[46:13.700 --> 46:17.740]  Consumed by a mysterious curse, restore a once lush forest and its inhabitants to their
[46:17.740 --> 46:23.880]  natural state in this action adventure puzzle, no, action adventure tale.
[46:23.880 --> 46:29.780]  It's fast paced combat puzzles and the beauty of nature captured in handcrafted pixel art.
[46:29.780 --> 46:30.780]  It looks nice.
[46:30.780 --> 46:31.780]  It does look nice.
[46:31.780 --> 46:34.400]  Oh, this is the problem, they all look nice!
[46:34.400 --> 46:39.600]  This is my point, right, like, I legitimately, I would struggle to pick out one, right, because
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.160]  then you go, well maybe it's Maneko, but then you go, but no, Snacko, like, I've been looking
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.520]  forward to Snacko for years, and then, you know, there's obviously, I'm really excited
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.600]  for Disney Dreamlight Valley to finally release in 1.0, and then of course there's Coral Island,
[46:52.600 --> 46:58.320]  like I had so much fun with that, I need more of that, and it's just like, but then Harvest
[46:58.320 --> 47:03.800]  Moon and the Winds of Anthos could legitimately be really good, or it could be terrible, like
[47:03.800 --> 47:08.720]  who knows, there's paleo pines, obviously, there's Fae Farm which looks fun, there's
[47:08.720 --> 47:12.800]  obviously story of seasons award, like, I just don't know where to start.
[47:12.800 --> 47:20.520]  Here's a simple question I ask myself, do any of these, again, putting Maneko and story
[47:20.520 --> 47:25.840]  of seasons to the side, do any of these games let you farm with your dinosaurs?
[47:25.840 --> 47:27.480]  There's only one that I see.
[47:27.480 --> 47:31.600]  Yeah, but do any of the others let you play as a cat?
[47:31.600 --> 47:35.960]  Are there other than Maneko that let you play as a, well, I mean, Maneko's not a cat, Snacko,
[47:35.960 --> 47:38.480]  oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, duh, okay.
[47:38.480 --> 47:43.300]  No, Maneko, Maneko, Maneko, you grow, you farm cats, and we're still not sure whether
[47:43.300 --> 47:45.800]  you eat the cats or not.
[47:45.800 --> 47:53.360]  That'll only increase it for me.
[47:53.360 --> 48:00.720]  But what is Critter Crops and Meat Light, I don't know these games, there's too many
[48:00.720 --> 48:01.720]  games out.
[48:01.720 --> 48:06.880]  I don't know what my point is about this section, there's lots of games, what are we most excited
[48:06.880 --> 48:07.880]  about?
[48:07.880 --> 48:08.880]  Lots of them.
[48:08.880 --> 48:15.780]  Oh, Critter Crops, I remember this game, that's a very pretty art style, wow, okay, the point
[48:15.780 --> 48:21.140]  of this section is to remind you all these games that we might be interested in playing.
[48:21.140 --> 48:29.500]  I don't know what Meat Light is still looking at it, but so, out of these, again, putting
[48:29.500 --> 48:36.660]  Maneko and Story Seasons to the side, the clear, the odds are favoring them, right?
[48:36.660 --> 48:42.940]  I think, the difficulty for me is I don't know how many of these games I'll actually
[48:42.940 --> 48:43.940]  get around to.
[48:43.940 --> 48:46.100]  There's a lot of games coming out.
[48:46.100 --> 48:52.020]  Out of the ones other than Maneko and Story Seasons, Paleo Pines is like a lock for me.
[48:52.020 --> 48:56.740]  I will play this, most likely this year.
[48:56.740 --> 49:01.780]  That for sure, there's some other ones, like I said, I'll probably get Smooshy, I'm interested
[49:01.780 --> 49:12.180]  in Homestead Arcana, Critter Crops looks cute, they're on my list but not as locked down
[49:12.180 --> 49:13.180]  yet.
[49:13.180 --> 49:21.520]  Obviously, we've been invested in Manekos for years and Story of Seasons has decades
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.820]  of nostalgia or whatever, I know what to expect.
[49:25.820 --> 49:31.540]  Having so many games, it's so easy to get lost and remember what each one's gonna be,
[49:31.540 --> 49:39.340]  so it's hard to feel as excited for them, and again, nothing on them, it's like Roots
[49:39.340 --> 49:40.500]  of Pacha, right?
[49:40.500 --> 49:47.000]  Like you said, I don't think either of us expected for me to enjoy it that much.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.980]  I'm sure a lot of these games will probably vary quality.
[49:51.980 --> 50:00.680]  It's very possible, but it's just hard to say from looking right now at the future, so
[50:00.680 --> 50:04.420]  Paleo Pines is the only big one I'm really gunning for right now.
[50:04.420 --> 50:14.020]  I think I could probably narrow it down to five, I feel like I'm going to put Harvest
[50:14.020 --> 50:16.900]  Moon and Winds of Anthos into that, not because I think it'll be game of the year, but in
[50:16.900 --> 50:23.140]  terms of most anticipated, I'm really looking forward to playing that, even if it ends up
[50:23.140 --> 50:25.140]  being terrible.
[50:25.140 --> 50:28.880]  And then we've got Snacko, which we don't even know is definitely coming out this year,
[50:28.880 --> 50:31.460]  that's one of the ones I'm leaning on and may well be delayed.
[50:31.460 --> 50:39.860]  We've got Mica, and then it's really hard to get the fifth one, because there's so many
[50:39.860 --> 50:41.460]  that I'm looking forward to.
[50:41.460 --> 50:46.460]  I don't think I put Fehfar, I'm in it.
[50:46.460 --> 50:52.180]  I'm looking forward to it, but I didn't even put Rune Factory 3 Special on the list for
[50:52.180 --> 50:53.180]  some reason.
[50:53.180 --> 50:57.180]  Oh yeah, come on, but it's on the list, right?
[50:57.180 --> 50:59.780]  I'm not on my list, I didn't read it out.
[50:59.780 --> 51:01.820]  But it's on the list, sure, sure.
[51:01.820 --> 51:06.300]  Like, Disney Dreamlight Valley, maybe.
[51:06.300 --> 51:07.860]  My sister's into that one.
[51:07.860 --> 51:09.500]  Okay, I'll go with five.
[51:09.500 --> 51:12.980]  And then Portal Island, and Lance, oh, I just, argh!
[51:12.980 --> 51:15.700]  Alright, I'll try it, I'll try to go narrow five.
[51:15.700 --> 51:24.460]  My five picks, if I can only pick five, of course, Mineko, Mica, Paleopines, Story of
[51:24.460 --> 51:30.020]  Seasons, and Critter Crops.
[51:30.020 --> 51:32.180]  Okay, there, I did it.
[51:32.180 --> 51:35.740]  I think I need to extend to ten.
[51:35.740 --> 51:37.340]  There's a lot of good games coming out.
[51:37.340 --> 51:41.540]  Yeah, well that's the thing, it's not like, this is what we were talking about with Johnny,
[51:41.540 --> 51:45.500]  in our last episode, like, there are so many games and it's exhausting, but the problem
[51:45.500 --> 51:48.660]  is that they're all so good.
[51:48.660 --> 51:50.140]  Yeah.
[51:50.140 --> 51:52.980]  Like...
[51:52.980 --> 51:56.260]  This is, what is it, there's a term for this, embarrassment of riches?
[51:56.260 --> 51:57.260]  Is that what it's called?
[51:57.260 --> 51:58.260]  I think so.
[51:58.260 --> 51:59.260]  Yeah.
[51:59.260 --> 52:00.260]  Yeah.
[52:00.260 --> 52:01.260]  Well.
[52:01.260 --> 52:08.140]  You remember when you started this podcast, there was, some people had, maybe not doubts,
[52:08.140 --> 52:11.900]  but there was some uncertainty as to whether you'd have enough stuff to cover.
[52:11.900 --> 52:15.460]  Oh, there were so many people who were like, oh, you're never gonna have enough to cover.
[52:15.460 --> 52:20.140]  And I was like, I mean, first of all, this is why I said farming games, not just Stardew
[52:20.140 --> 52:28.420]  Valley, right, which is a good call, I think, but maybe it's too broad.
[52:28.420 --> 52:34.220]  I mean, it's just bizarre that we've had more games released so far this year, in the first
[52:34.220 --> 52:39.660]  half of this year, than any of the last three, in fact, any previous year, right, because
[52:39.660 --> 52:45.420]  even if you go, like, any year you go back to, there are fewer games, fewer cottagecore
[52:45.420 --> 52:50.140]  games that released, unless there's a huge list of them that I'm missing, that I'm not
[52:50.140 --> 52:54.660]  aware of, right, like, if you look at, like, the list of games that I know of that came
[52:54.660 --> 53:02.780]  out between 2010 and 2015, that is 12, between 2005 and 2009, that is 15, right, like, there's,
[53:02.780 --> 53:10.380]  there's not all of the games that I know of before 2005, right, like, it's, it's absolutely
[53:10.380 --> 53:14.100]  crazy to me that there are so many games coming out.
[53:14.100 --> 53:19.060]  I, yeah, well, okay, I think, hmm, yeah, so when you look at it that way, it's not just
[53:19.060 --> 53:24.220]  COVID being over, it's definitely something else, I think, and we've talked about this
[53:24.220 --> 53:31.100]  before, like, this is an explosion of this cottagecore, quote unquote, whatever that
[53:31.100 --> 53:43.580]  means, field, I think it has a lot to do with the aging, I would say, of the population
[53:43.580 --> 53:50.240]  playing these games, because, now, I could be wrong, I don't have any hard data on this,
[53:50.240 --> 53:55.500]  this is just the general feel from my own social circles and what I see on the internet,
[53:55.500 --> 54:02.660]  a lot of the people who enjoy these games are, I don't feel like they're kids, necessarily,
[54:02.660 --> 54:08.740]  right, like, I'm not saying kids don't play them, but I feel the people who anticipate
[54:08.740 --> 54:16.940]  them the most or are invested in these are adults around our age, again, who played maybe
[54:16.940 --> 54:24.460]  A Wonderful Life when they were younger, whatever, and just with this, how chaotic life has gotten
[54:24.460 --> 54:31.260]  for so many people like you and me, I think cottagecore is a really, serves a really good
[54:31.260 --> 54:37.900]  escape, and that's why it's really grown, and a lot of developers have realized how
[54:37.940 --> 54:39.180]  many people enjoy that.
[54:39.180 --> 54:44.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I'd agree, I also wouldn't say the kids don't play these games, but I would
[54:44.740 --> 54:50.060]  say they play them less, and I think that, like, if a kid is going to play a cottagecore game this
[54:50.060 --> 54:54.100]  year, it's probably going to be Disney's Dreamland Valley, right, like, that's the kid-focused one,
[54:54.100 --> 54:56.660]  that's what Disney are trying to do.
[54:56.660 --> 55:01.140]  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's Disney, right?
[55:01.140 --> 55:04.460]  I think they're trying to get a lock on that, right, that's what they're doing, they're going
[55:04.460 --> 55:08.300]  for the kids and, obviously, the nostalgic millennials.
[55:08.300 --> 55:12.940]  Yeah, yeah, um...
[55:12.940 --> 55:16.780]  Anyway, like, I just, we could spend forever just, like, talking about how many, how there's
[55:16.780 --> 55:22.540]  too many games, but I think the point is, there are lots of games to be excited about,
[55:22.540 --> 55:26.820]  and there's probably a game that anybody would be excited about, like, there's a game for
[55:26.820 --> 55:28.140]  everybody here, I think.
[55:28.140 --> 55:30.140]  Yeah, there is.
[55:30.140 --> 55:32.940]  Don't sound so excited about it.
[55:32.940 --> 55:34.940]  It's too much.
[55:34.940 --> 55:39.100]  Kevin, where can people find you on the internet?
[55:39.100 --> 55:44.380]  They can find me at KoopaPrez on Twitter, if you want to see me retweeting other funnier
[55:44.380 --> 55:46.780]  people.
[55:46.780 --> 55:53.260]  You can find me at Spriter Square to see my art stuff, and hey, hey, for once, I'm actually
[55:53.260 --> 55:58.300]  updating it now, maybe not like last week, but I have been active there again, because
[55:58.300 --> 56:01.660]  when you're unemployed, you have more time to do these things.
[56:02.220 --> 56:03.500]  Go commission, Kevin.
[56:03.500 --> 56:05.260]  Go commission for your pixel art.
[56:05.260 --> 56:06.860]  Thank you, I appreciate that.
[56:06.860 --> 56:09.340]  Where do people find you, Al?
[56:09.340 --> 56:15.100]  You can find me on Twitter or on Mastodon.Scott, with the username TheScottBot.
[56:15.100 --> 56:19.540]  You can also find the podcast on Twitter, at THS Pod.
[56:19.540 --> 56:24.060]  You can find links to everything we discussed, oh my word, that's going to take me a long
[56:24.060 --> 56:28.500]  time to write up all these links, because I mentioned every game that's coming out this
[56:28.500 --> 56:29.500]  year.
[56:30.220 --> 56:35.220]  Just put a Google doc and put the link, you don't need a link to every game.
[56:35.220 --> 56:36.220]  We'll see.
[56:36.220 --> 56:37.220]  Maybe the good ones.
[56:37.220 --> 56:39.340]  Maybe our top five.
[56:39.340 --> 56:47.220]  And links to all our other things, including a feedback form, and a link to our Patreon,
[56:47.220 --> 56:55.220]  where you can give me money and get access to the slack, and also our bonus podcast episodes.
[56:55.220 --> 56:58.540]  We're going to do one on the Direct.
[56:58.540 --> 57:02.820]  Hey Al, you know how we just said there's too many games?
[57:02.820 --> 57:05.180]  Yeah, let's talk about some more games.
[57:05.180 --> 57:10.620]  What if I told you there are more games?
[57:10.620 --> 57:13.800]  Here are thoughts on the new Nintendo games coming up.
[57:13.800 --> 57:15.740]  It's good, that's my thoughts.
[57:15.740 --> 57:20.820]  We went from zero games coming out after Pikmin 4, to six games coming out, I think?
[57:20.820 --> 57:21.820]  I don't...
[57:21.820 --> 57:22.820]  Too many!
[57:22.820 --> 57:23.820]  Stop it!
[57:23.820 --> 57:24.820]  Stop it!
[57:24.820 --> 57:25.820]  You stop it, gaming industry!
[57:25.820 --> 57:27.820]  Give me a year to catch up!
[57:27.820 --> 57:31.300]  Uh, cool, I think that's everything.
[57:31.300 --> 57:32.820]  Thank you, Kevin, for joining me.
[57:32.820 --> 57:33.820]  Thank you, Al.
[57:33.820 --> 57:39.820]  And thank you, listeners, for listening, and until next time, have a good harvest!
[57:39.820 --> 57:40.820]  Have a good harvest!
[57:40.820 --> 57:42.820]  I'm two of them, I guess.
[57:42.820 --> 57:43.820]  Woo!
[57:43.820 --> 57:50.380]  The harvest season is created by Al McKinley, with support from our patrons, including our
[57:50.380 --> 57:54.220]  pro farmers, Kevin, Stuart, and Alisa.
[57:54.220 --> 57:58.860]  Our art is done by Micah the Brave, and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
