# Transcript

[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Thank you.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Cody.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm Kevin.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  And we're here today to talk about Cottagecore Games.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  Ooh, not Wildflowers this time, I promise you.
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  Not. We have Kevin on an episode and it's not about Wildflowers, y'all.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  Reset the clock. How many?
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  Al's got the little flippy calendar clock saying X many days since the Wildflowers episode.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  X many days since Kevin... I'm glad you're enjoying it so much.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  I actually haven't listened to the episodes.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  But you recently interviewed a voice actor, question mark?
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  Yes, the voice for Tara, the main character.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  That is amazing.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  It was so fun.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  A game having a whole voice acting cast is pretty amazing.
[01:21.000 --> 01:23.000]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  Valerie is her name.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  For people who didn't listen, I suggest you go back and listen.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  She was an absolute delight.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  For people who played the game, she's a lot like Tara.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  She's sweet and bubbly.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.000]  That's great.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  But anyways, that is last episode.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  In this episode, we are talking about Roots of Pacha.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.000]  That's the Stone Dew Valley.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  Stone Dew Valley.
[01:57.000 --> 02:04.000]  I definitely have suggested it to people by calling it Stone Age Stardew.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  I think is the way that I've called it.
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  Yes, Stone Age Stardew.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  In a recent episode, we talked about what makes a Stardew clone.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  I do think that this is similar to a Stardew clone,
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  but it has a decent amount that's unique.
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  I actually really enjoy that.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  We will certainly get into that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  Before that, we have a very little bit of news.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  But before that, Kevin, what have you been up to?
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  For that, transcripts are available on the website as per always.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  You're right.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  No, that's fine.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  But anyways, thank you.
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  What have I been up to?
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  A lot of the same as always.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  May is a busy month for me.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  I'm just sticking with the usuals.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  Wildflowers continues to deliver.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  Roots of Pacha. Hey, I've been playing that game. Surprise.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  Pokemon Unite has an Eevee event going on.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Umbreon and Leafeon are coming out.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  That means you can finally have a team of five Eevees,
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  a full team of Eevees in the game, which just sounds hilarious.
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.000]  I did. I was laughing the other day,
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  because I think I was listening to It's Super Effective,
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  and they were talking about how the Umbreon and another one got added to it.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  But there was three Pokemon added in that update,
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  and it was Umbreon, Leafeon, and Inteleon.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  Yeah, the secret Eevee evolution.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  I didn't even think about that.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  Inteleon and Eevee confirmed.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  Stealth Eevee.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  It's like they told an intern,
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  oh, we're having an Eevee event, so add a bunch of the Eons.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  And someone was like, okay.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  I'm envisioning an Eevee family photo,
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  and Inteleon just taped over a Flareon.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  I was like, that one's fine.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  So that's been fun.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  Yeah, Unite's been good.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  They're not actually in the game as of yet.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  At least not, because I think they might be in the beta server or whatever.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  But it continues to be fun.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  Marvel Snap is, you know, Marvel Snap.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  Other than that, I did happen to see the Mirio movie.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  Have you seen that?
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  I sure did.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  That was a good movie.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  I like the movie.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  I like when they did the thing.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  It was, it sure was a movie.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  Okay, look, when I talk about movies, right,
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  I just by default, like if we're talking about this kind of movie,
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  I'm not putting it next to Schindler's List.
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  Like I'm talking, this is dumb, turn your brain off popcorn movie.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  Right, so like it's, you know, it has its limitations.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  But looking at its peers, it's I enjoyed it.
[05:04.000 --> 05:07.000]  I know Jack Black was good.
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  That's the main thing.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  Okay, that's pretty much all that matters, though.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.000]  His not spoiling, but his story.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  Like, yeah, it was just not it was not what I expected.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  But it's so funny because like I was shocked and then I was like,
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  oh, it's Jack Black.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  Okay, it's fine.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Okay, so there's two, whatever.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  There's two things I have.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Well, one, I agree with you.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  Yes, like Jack Black that just played perfectly into Jack Black
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  and his strengths.
[05:37.000 --> 05:43.000]  But two, like a lot of that does kind of stick with the Marius
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  quote unquote script lore, whatever you want to call it.
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.000]  Right.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  It's goofy and canon and absurd.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  But you know, it's fine.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  It was great.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  But yeah, so that's that's all I've been up to really.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  What about you, Cody?
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  What have you been up to?
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  Um, my research.
[06:00.000 --> 06:04.000]  So I am doing my comprehensive exam next month.
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  And basically what that is, is you present what you are planning to
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  do for your day for your doctorate to your committee.
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  And you say, here, this is what I'm going to do.
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  This is why it's important to do.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  This is how I would do it.
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  This is why I'm qualified to do it.
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  And then to basically like build up your final few years.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  And then they say, yeah, looks good or nope, you're not good enough.
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  If you fail your comps, you do get another shot.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  They give you like suggestions of how to revise it.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  So it's not like I would just fail out.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  Right.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  And I don't expect to fail.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  When I met with my committee a few months ago and told them like I gave
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  them a rundown, they were all like, this is a really good.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  Like this is a really good group of projects that you're doing.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  And it looks really good.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  So I've been working on that, but also, you know, putting stuff out to trap
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  insects, um, starting my forest insect community surveys, which is super fun.
[07:03.000 --> 07:10.000]  Um, I also started a new job, so, uh, hilariously to no one's surprise.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  Um, doctoral students are not really paid enough.
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  Oh, I haven't heard.
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  Yeah.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  And we were, they, the department was going to give us a, a boost to our stipends.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  However, um, there was recently a fairly large budget cut across my entire university.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  And so they're not able to do that anymore.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  Um, and so I've been finding like alternate revenue sources.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  And so I started working at a coffee shop, same for fun.
[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  Um, but the biggest thing that I've been playing is Roots of Pacha.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  Um, not just because of the podcast, but just like, it's, it's just genuinely a good time.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  Like even after, even after we talk about it today and it's quote unquote off my plate,
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  um, whatever that means, uh, I'm still going to continue to play it.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  I am too.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  I'm enjoying it.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  I'm definitely not like I've put, Oh gosh, I probably should have checked how many hours
[08:07.000 --> 08:08.000]  I've put into this game.
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.000]  And hilariously, I don't think Steam is on this computer is going to show me because
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  because of reasons that we will get it because of reasons.
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  Um, uh, one note I want to add, uh, uh, our friend Kelly, the guest host on the podcast
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  every now and then I also got her into Roots of Pacha and she's been playing nonstop.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  She's farther ahead than I am.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Um, oh, it is.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  If I click on it's steam page, it goes away.
[08:40.000 --> 08:49.000]  Um, it says I'm at like 27 hours, but I don't know how I think I've played a little bit
[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  more than that.
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  Um, I think this, um, but, uh, I wonder why it has updated.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  Yeah.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  So let's, let's just get through the first little tiny bit of news before we, um, before
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  we jump into that barrel of fish.
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.000]  Uh, so our first bit of news is about ooblets.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  There is now a plushie.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  So this is the first ever ooblets plushie and you can sign up for it now.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  Um, and there's going to be a link in the show notes and this is also, um, at ooblets.com.
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  It looks like it's a Shrumbo.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  So it's a little mushroom dude.
[09:24.000 --> 09:25.000]  Yup.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.000]  Not, not a toad.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  Um, not to be confused with the movie.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  You thought he was a toad?
[09:30.000 --> 09:31.000]  No, no.
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.000]  Okay.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  So he has a similar face.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  I'm just saying.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.000]  It's a little mushroom.
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  Um, but, um, from boat, man, what a name from boat.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  Um, it's a cute plushie.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  I'll say that.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  Um, oh, it's through fan gamer.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  Okay.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  Yeah.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  They do good stuff.
[09:48.000 --> 09:49.000]  Um, yeah.
[09:49.000 --> 09:50.000]  Click on the link.
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.000]  You can see it through the ooblets newsletter, probably on the fan gamer site.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  You can see it.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  Um, Oh, there's a, is this recent?
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  There's an update to the game.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.000]  Yup.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  I just saw that there's a sneaky second spring time update.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  So, um, this was, uh, it's just another update that they have.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  So it looks like they have some bug fixes.
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  They've added some ways, uh, some places that you can put your Glennie globes.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Um, there's a new bookshelf on a sideboard that you can just put your Glennie globes
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  in.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  I'm assuming these are just like, they look like little snow globes.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.000]  They're really cute.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  Yeah.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  Um, and they've just fixed a couple of other bug fix issues.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  Um, and, uh, the spring time event that is currently going on in the game ends on May
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  31st.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  So, um, I think once this podcast goes out, it's like a week.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  You have left.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  So, um, but yeah, it's very cute.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  Little plush.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  Uh, I do recall when this came out, um, some people in our discord were like, or sorry,
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  Slack or Slack.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  We're like, this is very cute, but I want this other, this other ooblet.
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.000]  Oh, so they're trying to get your sitting cutie ooblets here.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  Yeah.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  Pretty much a whole new, uh, your cutie patootie ooblets.
[11:08.000 --> 11:09.000]  That's what they'd call them.
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  Something like that.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Yeah.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  So one of those names there.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  I still haven't played it.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  I haven't either, but just a shrumbo like ooblets.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  I know.
[11:23.000 --> 11:31.000]  It just, it sounds like the fake names that people come up to kind of, you know, mimic
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  fake game garble, jargon and garbledy gook.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  Um, but anyways, uh, all, all that aside, uh, there you go ooblets people and get your
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  shrumbo, get your update.
[11:43.000 --> 11:51.000]  Um, so the next piece of news actually, apparently it came, it came out, uh, that this news popped
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.000]  two hours after we recorded last week.
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  Um, so do you want to talk about this guy?
[11:59.000 --> 12:00.000]  Yeah.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  So normally I try to come up with a witty transition, but no, this news is our transition.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Um, because it's about this game called roots of Pacha.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  I don't know if you've heard of it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  You know, I think I've heard of it.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  Yeah.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  Okay.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  So this is awkward because I enjoy this game.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  I'm going to give it a lot of praise and talk about why I'm enjoying it.
[12:21.000 --> 12:28.000]  And you, dear listener, you may think, Oh, maybe I do want to try it and mosey on down
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  to the steam page.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  And, Oh, Oh, there's no, there's no roots of Pacha there.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  You might see roots of Pacha steam anymore.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  Oh boy.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  Um, okay.
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.000]  So yeah, that's the, well, that's the, I guess the main news that it's been TD listed.
[12:43.000 --> 12:48.000]  The reasons why is it's a little spicy rum on this podcast.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Yeah.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  Legit drum.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  Yeah.
[12:51.000 --> 13:01.000]  So in short, at the core of it, there is a dispute between the developer and the publisher
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  contract dispute.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  Um, first the developer, uh, was it dry dock studios?
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  Is that the one for this?
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  Yeah.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  You know, dry dock is wildflowers.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  Okay.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  Um, switch your brain.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  We're not talking about wildflowers anymore.
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  I'm pretty sure.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  Okay.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Soda den.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  Yes, it is soda den.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Um, who, um, I tried digging for details.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  There aren't many, right?
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  So there's any speculation speculation.
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  There's the main source of information are two tweets, one from soda den on the official
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  roots of Pacha, uh, Twitter account.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  Um, they are trying to resolve the issue with Crotevo, the publisher company.
[13:44.000 --> 13:49.000]  Um, they have a dispute in to use their quote.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  Uh, they've been engaged in a dispute with Crotevo over the rights to roots of Pacha.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  Uh, there's no details given if it's monetary IP or whatever.
[13:58.000 --> 14:06.000]  Um, but, uh, because of this, uh, soda den says they weren't able to resolve the issues
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  yet.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  So Crotevo went to valve and, uh, authorized them to remove roots of Pacha, uh, from steam
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  without soda den's knowledge or consent.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  Um, uh, that all, so that's mostly the info from them.
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  Um, they also say they are still working on the game and they are hoping to actually introduce
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  a roadmap with, uh, updates for next month.
[14:29.000 --> 14:39.000]  Um, now Crotevo, uh, responded quote unquote, more or less, um, with another tweet soon
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  after actually in the same Twitter thread.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  Ooh, that's dramatic.
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  Um, yeah, they, they literally Crotevo didn't do their own PO.
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.000]  I mean, it was, was their own post, but they did it as a, as a reply to the roots of Pacha
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  soda den team.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  Um, and then they, uh, quote tweeted themselves or retweeted themselves or whatever, but it's
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  basically just like a reply.
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  Yeah.
[15:06.000 --> 15:12.000]  Um, and so they're say, uh, from their perspective, uh, they've been collaborating with soda den
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  for three years.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  Um, and the game launched on April 25th up to that point.
[15:17.000 --> 15:25.000]  And then on April 27th, just two days after the release, um, they received a message from
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  the soda den people, uh, and they were clay again, I'm going to use their quote here informing
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  us.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  They were claiming to unilaterally rescind the contract we had worked under for three
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  years, treating it as void.
[15:39.000 --> 15:48.000]  Um, uh, they say that disregards their work and agreed upon revenue sharing terms.
[15:48.000 --> 15:56.000]  Um, and then shortly after they sorta then removed Partivo's access to the steam page.
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  Um, and that's when supposedly they reached out to valve to remove the game from steam.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Um, they bow and then got generic stuff.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  It says per valve policy.
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  If there is a dispute between parties, they remove the page until the dispute is resolved.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  True.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  True.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  But somebody had to let them know.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Right.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  Yeah.
[16:18.000 --> 16:23.000]  So I don't know if it was, you know, I wonder if it was something like the critical people
[16:23.000 --> 16:30.000]  reached out to vowel, like the steam, um, it and was like, Hey, our password's not working
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.000]  anymore or something like that.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  And then Val was like, Oh, shenanigans.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  So possibly.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  Yeah.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  So there's really, Oh, sorry.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  Continue what you're no, no, just, just, yeah.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  I mean, this is okay.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  So that's roughly the facts.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  These two tweets, um, here we're getting to speculation territory.
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.000]  You might be right.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  Um, it could have been valve who took notice.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  It could have been critical tipping them off.
[16:52.000 --> 16:53.000]  I don't know.
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000]  Um, uh, it's, this is a messy, messy issue, right?
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.000]  Because so one thing I looked up, um, trying to get through the details I could, um, uh,
[17:05.000 --> 17:09.000]  not necessarily maybe this specific thing, but at least some of the context and whatnot.
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.000]  So to then appears to be very small, um, roots of ponchos, their first and only game, from
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  what I understand.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  It was started by a pair of brothers.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  I don't know how big the team is currently.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  Um, and generally speaking, I tried to side with little developers like that.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  Right.
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  Um, maybe they didn't understand the contract.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  Maybe they were just unhappy with it.
[17:30.000 --> 17:31.000]  I don't know.
[17:31.000 --> 17:37.000]  But Oh, the way Cretivo has framed it, how they, uh, uh, so did an approach the issue
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  of, of just saying, we're not, you know, paraphrasing here in my own words at the tone
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  it came across, like, we're just not going to agree to the contract.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  It's no, I don't know if that's the best move.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  That's, that's a bold move.
[17:50.000 --> 17:58.000]  Um, I don't, and again, I don't know obviously without the specifics, the, what the arguments
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  about dispute, whatever.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  I don't know who's in the right here.
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.000]  Could be blamed both sides.
[18:03.000 --> 18:05.000]  Cretivo could be a little unfair.
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  I don't know.
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  Um, on that note, actually, I had fun.
[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  There was a Reddit thread regarding this issue.
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  Uh, there's back and forth.
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  Some people say Cretivo has had unfair contracts in the past.
[18:18.000 --> 18:25.000]  And then there's been words from other developers who worked from Cretivo that have said, no,
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  it's actually fine that this is a lot of standard stuff.
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  Um, again, no one knows the actual specifics to the roots of Pacha.
[18:34.000 --> 18:42.000]  So did in case, um, and it's, yeah, so it's, it's unclear, uncertain.
[18:42.000 --> 18:52.000]  Um, and when we're going to get it back, if question mark, I, I imagine as publisher,
[18:52.000 --> 18:53.000]  again, this is speculation.
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  I know expert in this, but from what I have read and heard, they might have rights to
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  get another developer if need be to finish the game or stuff they were planning.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  I don't 100% know.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  Again, that's, that's kind of, uh, amateur investigating.
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  Um, all right, Cody, I think I've given the gist.
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.000]  What's, what's your thoughts?
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.000]  Give me the story.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  Yeah.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  I mean, I think that there's just not a lot of information here.
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  Um, I think that both of the teams are handling it well, you know, like being, they, they
[19:25.000 --> 19:34.000]  posted their, their respective, um, statements with the details that they wanted to provide.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  And they are, you know, going to try and resolve the issue.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  Um, roots of Pacha folks said that they're going to continue to work on it.
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  Um, while it's, even though, uh, it's not currently up on steam anymore, though, if
[19:48.000 --> 19:54.000]  you've already purchased it on steam, you can play it, um, purchased it and downloaded
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  it.
[19:55.000 --> 20:01.000]  So even, you know, after this happened, this happened on May 13th, um, I've still played
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  the game multiple times since then.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  I haven't had any issues.
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  Um, I think it might limit our ability.
[20:07.000 --> 20:13.000]  Like, I don't know how, if they do any bugs or any patch fixes or anything, like, I don't
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  know if they can push those while this is happening.
[20:16.000 --> 20:22.000]  Um, or if it's just that this, the page went down and no one can purchase it right anymore.
[20:22.000 --> 20:33.000]  Um, but I mean, I just, I, I, I can see both sides and, um, I just hope that it gets resolved
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  in a way that both parties feel okay.
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.000]  You know, like that's, no one's going to get the, a raw, a raw deal or something.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  Um, I mean, that's really all I, all I, yeah.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  I mean, ultimately that's all we can do, right?
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  Like, yeah, we're just going off to tweets.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  We don't know.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  We just want, I just want more roots of Pacha.
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.000]  It will be interesting.
[20:55.000 --> 21:04.000]  So Cretivo is also the, the, not the developer, but the publisher of, um, of above snakes.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Ooh.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  So Cretivo has a good number of titles in their publishing house.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  So it'll be really interesting.
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  So cause above snakes is coming out, um, in about a week, about nine days, six days, whatever.
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  Some I don't remember words are hard, uh, on the 25th of May.
[21:24.000 --> 21:30.000]  And so, um, since that's, you know, coming out, uh, we'll see if there's a similar issue
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  and if it's something that might be Cretivo based or if it's something that, um, that is,
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  was just a miscommunication between a developer and a publisher.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  Yeah.
[21:43.000 --> 21:50.000]  I'm just imagining we do an above snakes episode and, and the news drops right before too.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  Um, but no, um, yeah, I don't know.
[21:54.000 --> 21:55.000]  I just, yeah.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  Hope it gets resolved soon.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  Like the weirdest awkward part is that, uh, well in, you know, unless things have been
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  resolved by the time this episode actually drops that people can't get it right.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  Like that sucks cause I really recommend this game.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  Yeah.
[22:10.000 --> 22:15.000]  I've been repping it to people, um, and saying how great it is and, and telling people like
[22:15.000 --> 22:22.000]  customers come up and I tell them that I'm playing it, um, and recommend it and stuff.
[22:22.000 --> 22:29.000]  And, and I can say, definitely keep your eye out for when it's available again.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  I'll definitely, um, like when it, when the issue is resolved and it's back up on the
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  steam page, I'll retweet it.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  I'm sure the podcast will as well.
[22:37.000 --> 22:43.000]  So yeah, if we, if we recommend it and you're not, and it's not, it's not available yet,
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.000]  just keep an eye out.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  Um, and we'll let you know when it is available for sure.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  Yeah.
[22:47.000 --> 22:54.000]  Um, that all that, you know, that, uh, unfun intro let's, uh, let's, let's get into the
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  game.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Let's talk about what is fun.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  The game.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  Yeah.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  Um, okay.
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  So I think it's been clear, but let's, let's say clearly do you, what, what's your overall
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.000]  opinion on the game?
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  Yeah.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  Um, my overall opinion is very positive.
[23:08.000 --> 23:15.000]  Um, I think there's parts of the game that are less developed or less like, especially,
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  so I will say like the romance side of it.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  Um, I don't really see a benefit to getting to know people.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  Um, I don't really see, I mean, I've, I go, and then it's, it's also kind of difficult
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  to know what they're going to like.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  Yeah.
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  So that part is, uh, in my opinion, a little weak.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  Um, but I also, I'm just also not the type of human that normally goes around and talks
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  to everybody.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  So this was my issue in stardew as well as I just went for the car, went for like a rando
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  character that I was like, Ooh, an emo boy that narrows it down to exactly who I am.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  And then the next time I went, Ooh, the artist lady.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  Um, so yeah, uh, that was a little weaker, but other than that, I mean, it's, it's an
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  amazing game.
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  I'm having a really good time playing it.
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.000]  It's got, um, I haven't been really bored yet.
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  I'm still, still trying to clear out, um, parts of the map.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  And, uh, I guess like as you are playing other parts of the map become available to you,
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  like even past after you've unlocked the four directions, like some of those areas become
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  bigger as well.
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  So that's really cool.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  Um, that hasn't happened for me yet, but yeah, so that's my, my gist.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  Oh, what about you?
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  What are you recommend it?
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.000]  But yeah, I do.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Um, right.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  Like I'm, it's a game.
[24:40.000 --> 24:44.000]  I think I enjoy more as I play it more.
[24:44.000 --> 24:51.000]  Um, because my first react, like my knee jerk reaction day one, boy, that's a stardew valley.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  My younger, my younger brother Calvin, I was like playing and he walked away.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  I was like, Oh, are you playing stardew?
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  Um, no.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  Yeah.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  Um, because, uh, well, yeah.
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.000]  Um, uh, but that said, um, it learn, I don't know if it learns the lessons, but it does,
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  it takes the good things from stardew.
[25:13.000 --> 25:20.000]  It does, it does well with the template and the things it does on its own or differently
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  are, are fun and nice.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  And it, you, the progression, I think in the game is really good overall.
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  Um, it's smooth and feels good.
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  Um, and, and yeah, and as I get more things, I'll see more things.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  I enjoy it more and more.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  Yeah.
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  Um, so let's, let's get into the little, some of these specifics, let's start with the farming
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.000]  um, true to our roots here, uh, true to our roots Apache.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  Uh, um, okay.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  So, uh, the farming, well, you, if you played stardew valley, then you know how to farm
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  in this game.
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.000]  Um, the biggest difference, um, and which I find interesting.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  Um, right.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  So this being the stone age, we're literally inventing like everything.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  Right.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  Um, so that that's, there's no store, there's no one who's done all this stuff.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  Right.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  There's no seed shop at first.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  Um, you have to go and gather crops.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  You have to go find them in the wild.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  Um, I will say the, the story of it is that your, your group of people came to this area
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  and, and were, um, gosh, how would you say this?
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  Um, the spirits like said to, to stay in this area, like there was a reason they were like,
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  this is where we should be.
[26:40.000 --> 26:46.000]  Um, so they traveled, um, over, you know, it showed like a lot of different, like there
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  was like a desert and, uh, stuff like that.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  When you first like start up the game, it shows that you guys travel pretty far.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  Um, and then you get to this area and, and your shaman, um, I think it is how he reversed
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  himself.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  He, um, says, this is, this is it, this is where we're going to stop and this is where
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  we're going to settle.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  Um, and so you're starting from the ground, ground up, like you, um, literally, like,
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.000]  uh, you all have, you know, uh, living structures and you actually are there.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  Yeah.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  Your hearts are there and you pretty much start out with, you start out living in someone
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  else's living structure, um, grandparents quite.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  Yeah.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  Yes.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  I think that is the situation is there.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  Your parents passed away when you were younger.
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  Um, and so these people took you in as, um, as your like adoptive grandparents and so
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  you live with them.
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  Um, but then when you want an animal companion, uh, they're like, your grandma's allergic,
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  so you gotta get your own place.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  Um, and so you can get your own place, but basically you are building from the ground
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  up.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  And the thing that I love about this game so much is that that's, that's so different
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  in my opinion from other games, um, from other games that I've played is that even if you
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.000]  did nothing, like you could literally wake up and go back to sleep immediately.
[28:15.000 --> 28:23.000]  The, the community still continues growing and building like they do their own stuff.
[28:23.000 --> 28:31.000]  Um, and you kind of are just a part of it, but like, it's not, even though they're so
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  there, when you first start out, there's, you're only in one area and you can see that
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  there are definitely clearly like you're blocked from four other areas.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  Um, you don't do anything.
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  There's no, there's no like you need to build 400, give 400 wood to dude, man, to, to have
[28:48.000 --> 28:52.000]  him sometimes, but sometimes, but, but for the most part, no, I mean, for the most part
[28:52.000 --> 28:56.000]  they just do it themselves and then they're just like, we, we opened this pathway and
[28:56.000 --> 29:02.000]  then other people came through and, um, or we did this thing and now you can, gosh, I'm
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  trying to remember.
[29:03.000 --> 29:10.000]  Oh, I think the sundial, like we built a sundial and now you can know how time works, you know,
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  stuff like that.
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  And it, it's stuff that you don't have to do anything.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  The game will do that by itself.
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  And I love that.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  Um,
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  yeah.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  Yeah.
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  You bring up a good point that I wanted to make that almost forgot about.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  Right.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  Like you're saying, right.
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  It's very much the plan.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  The whole focus is the plan.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  Um, I, you're not a newcomer to a town.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  You're part of this group already.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  You, I mean, you, the play are meeting everyone for the first time.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  So they give you a little info box, but you, the character know everyone already.
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000]  Um, and that's really different from pretty much every other cottage core game.
[29:46.000 --> 29:49.000]  Um, and everyone already has their roles.
[29:49.000 --> 29:54.000]  Here's the, the artist, here's the builder, the tool person, whatever.
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Um, and they all do their parts.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  Um, of course your role is the farmer.
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  Right.
[30:01.000 --> 30:06.000]  So that's why you have to go around finding wild crops and dardoo farming them and all
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.000]  that good stuff.
[30:07.000 --> 30:08.000]  Yeah.
[30:08.000 --> 30:15.000]  So, um, each season has, um, different crops that, um, different wild like crops that are
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  growing.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000]  And when you go to these crops and find them, so say you find the tomatoes, you, you're
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.000]  not harvesting tomatoes, you're harvesting the seed.
[30:24.000 --> 30:29.000]  And so this is really cool because you basically get all the seeds you ever need.
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  Um, you just have to know where the plant is growing.
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  Um, a day, a certain amount respond every day or two or whatever.
[30:37.000 --> 30:45.000]  Oh, so that way, like, so for me, for example, I I've made little plots of six of each plant.
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  Um, so I just need six seeds to get going.
[30:49.000 --> 30:52.000]  And so I'll, I'll start three of them.
[30:52.000 --> 30:56.000]  And the next day I'll go check that plant again and hope that two more of them are,
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  I can collect seed from two more of them.
[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  And then I just keep doing that and then keep making sure, like, just run around the map
[31:03.000 --> 31:07.000]  and make sure that my seed, seed bag, I think is what it's called.
[31:07.000 --> 31:08.000]  Yeah.
[31:08.000 --> 31:09.000]  Yeah.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  There's, there's two things I like.
[31:12.000 --> 31:20.000]  Well, it's a double edged sword in a sense, um, because on the one hand you have to encourage
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  you to actually go out and explore the map, um, which I think is great.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  Um, and you become familiar with all the spots and stuff.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  Um, it's, it's a very natural way of doing that.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.000]  And it's great.
[31:30.000 --> 31:38.000]  Um, the, oh, and, oh, and one thing like, as you farm, like your crops quote unquote improve,
[31:38.000 --> 31:44.000]  and there's a little, uh, your adopted grandpa, like he starts farming the seed so you can start buying them.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  We'll, we'll explain that in a second.
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  It's a little weird.
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  Um, but so you can, there's other ways you can do it.
[31:50.000 --> 31:58.000]  Um, but, uh, primarily I think at least I've been just out and foraging and gathering the seeds just because it's so, uh, it just fits.
[31:58.000 --> 31:59.000]  It works so well.
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  Um, the only downside to this is if you don't scrape, sometimes you can miss crops.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  I found corn like on the last day of fall.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  Oh, yeah.
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  Yeah.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  Um, I think there's one prop I missed.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  I'm at the end of the year, so I've like been through all the seasons and whatnot.
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  Um, and there's still one crop I missed, but, but I bet I know what it is.
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  It's probably the, did you find the Chili's?
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.000]  Oh yeah.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  I found the Chili's.
[32:26.000 --> 32:27.000]  Oh, I think it's wheat.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  Oh, I don't know.
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  I have to double check.
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  No, I found the, I found those pretty late.
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.000]  I will say that.
[32:33.000 --> 32:34.000]  I think I found them late.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  That was the last one.
[32:35.000 --> 32:43.000]  I thought I had all of the fall crops and then I, you can look at the seed bag, like in the inventory section.
[32:44.000 --> 32:51.000]  Um, and it shows you like empty, like, uh, not filled in spaces for all of the like possible crops there are.
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.000]  And I saw one that had the false sign next to it.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  And I was like, who is that?
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  I was like, I haven't seen that.
[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  So I went searching for it and I ended up finding it.
[33:00.000 --> 33:01.000]  So, yeah.
[33:01.000 --> 33:10.000]  And, and the corn is funny because I was able to get some from, uh, the trading guy, um, and I got some, but I could never find it.
[33:10.000 --> 33:12.000]  It's a year two crop or something?
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.000]  No.
[33:13.000 --> 33:18.000]  Um, uh, Oh, while we're at it, I didn't, I, you can grow fruit trees.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.000]  I was, because that's like a achievement thing or it's, it's on your to-do list.
[33:22.000 --> 33:23.000]  Time to learn how to grow fruit trees.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  I didn't realize you just buy them.
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  I couldn't figure out how to buy them.
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.000]  Yeah.
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  You can't, you don't, when you harvest from fruit trees in the wild, you don't get, uh, seed.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  You just get the fruit.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.000]  Lessons learned.
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  Lessons learned.
[33:40.000 --> 33:41.000]  Yeah.
[33:41.000 --> 33:47.000]  But all the, you know, all that, I think this is a good example though, because even though I call these downsides, it doesn't feel unfair.
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  Um, like everything, everything still works.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  Um, it doesn't feel like necessarily from lack of clarity, just, you know, needing to explore a little more because this game is very much about exploring.
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.000]  Um, okay.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  Um, let's see here.
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.000]  Animals.
[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  Well, that's again, a lot of your staples, but the only difference is, again, there's no rancher.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  You're not buying your animals.
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  You have to go out into the wild and tame them yourself.
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  Um, you can get, there's actually a good variety of stone age-esque animals.
[34:18.000 --> 34:25.000]  There's llamas and boars and Buffalo and, uh, ostriches and all sorts.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  I don't even remember.
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  Um, you can shear some for wool.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  You can milk your goats.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  Rabbits.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.000]  Yeah.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  You can get, there are some that are just for pets, right?
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  Like rabbits.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  Oh, I have a pet mammoth.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  Oh, mammoth.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  Yes.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  Yeah.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  Even better.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  You, unfortunately you can only get the baby mammoths.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  Um, but I have a pet baby mammoth.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  I want to get a big one.
[34:45.000 --> 34:46.000]  It just never grows up.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  No, no, they don't let it.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  I'm not going to let a big one.
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  Big one.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  They're so they look so nice.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  What do you have a pet?
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  Yeah.
[34:59.000 --> 35:00.000]  I have a rabbit.
[35:00.000 --> 35:01.000]  Um, and I did it.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  I grew my herb.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  Not grew.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  I, I don't, companion.
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  Companion.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  I don't, I don't know what, what the verb is that I'm looking for here, but, um, I had
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  a rabbit as my companion for until it was like fully, um, fully loved me.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  Like all, all of the, all the, all the hearts.
[35:20.000 --> 35:24.000]  Um, and then I kicked it to the curb and now that's right.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Now I have a lion.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  Yeah.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  Now we're talking, but, um, yeah.
[35:32.000 --> 35:39.000]  Um, but, uh, well, one of my favorite things though, is because you don't, again, you're
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  not buying them.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  You just, and they're available year round.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.000]  I'm pretty sure you can just start right away collecting eggs and wool or whatever.
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.000]  Well, you have the progress to develop the tools or whatever, but pretty much from the
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  right off the bat, you can start doing all your animal stuff.
[35:55.000 --> 35:56.000]  Yeah.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  Um, including a mount.
[35:58.000 --> 36:02.000]  Um, and there are lots of different animals you can ride, which is nice.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  So I think it's a great little personal touch.
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  What are you writing?
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  Cody?
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  I'm writing an ibex.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  I have a white, I think it's called a cookies and cream ibex.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  So it's white with like black spots on it.
[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  Um, it's the only one that I've tamed that has a base speed of, of two, two arrows.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  Oh, um, everything else only has one.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  So I want, I wanted the zoomy zooms.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  Oh, I didn't even realize they could have their own speeds day.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  Yeah.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  So if you, if you inspect any animal that you have, it'll show you like how much it
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  likes you.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  And then, um, some of the, like all of the ones that you could possibly ride, it shows,
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  um, their production value.
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  Um, so how, how often they produce or how much they produce, I guess.
[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  Um, I think it also has like whether or not they are, they're reproducible.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  And then, um, the like speed stat.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  So it says like what the speed is.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  I think there's four arrows is the max speed.
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.000]  And what you basically do is, um, I think you actually have to like breed them together.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  So you have to breed, like you have to breed the good ones, the good ones together.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  And then, but I haven't done hilarious.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.000]  I haven't done any breeding.
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.000]  Hilariously the animals that I have, um, that I've, so I have two ibex and two boars and
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  I got females on all.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.000]  That's funny.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  I just got a whole female.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And so I have to kick two of them out and, and, um, find some boys.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  That's cool.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  But, uh, I'm riding a boar.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  I saw that boar and was like, yeah, I'm going to ride that.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  Um, because that's not your usual farm animal.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  Um, the Buffalo is pretty cool though.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  Um, I want an alpaca.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.000]  I want to ride an alpaca.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  They're cute.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  They don't call them alpacas.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  They call them like guanaros or guanacos or something like that.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  Uh, which is another type of, yeah, guanaco.
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  Um, uh, which is pretty much a llama.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  Yeah.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  Yeah.
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  Um, but yeah, so I think the animal taming is well done.
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.000]  The wild, the crop gathering, all the, all the farming mechanics I think are well done.
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  Um, just the base stardew, but with the nice stone age twist works really well here.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  Um, so let's talk about another unique mechanic here.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  The prosperity mechanic.
[38:33.000 --> 38:41.000]  Um, as Alex said, this game has a GDP, which I didn't think about it, but yeah, no, that's what it is.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  That is what it is.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  Uh, yeah.
[38:43.000 --> 38:52.000]  So there is a collection basket and pretty much from the back, the start of the game, they they're tasked with, okay, here's our collection basket.
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  We all put stuff in here to help the clan grow and it's, and there's two quote unquote currencies.
[38:59.000 --> 39:11.000]  Um, there is contribution, which is your individual contribution, and that is more or less money that you can spend with some of the other people to trade things and whatnot.
[39:11.000 --> 39:19.000]  Um, and just like stardew or any other cottage core game, different, you know, fish will sell whatever different prices and whatnot.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  Um, the nice thing is it never closed, right?
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  It's not a shop.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  You don't like, Oh, darn five o'clock and hand sells anymore.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  No, you just get at the end of the day, all your money.
[39:27.000 --> 39:34.000]  Um, and then, uh, the next or the other currency or whatever measure is called prosperity.
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  Now this is the sum total of everyone's contributions, right?
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  So you can bump it up.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  But as you were saying earlier, Cody, even if you don't contribute anything, you can not contribute anything for a week and nobody cares or says anything.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  At least I say that I haven't tried that far, but I haven't tried, but yeah, I don't know if anyone will say that.
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  But regardless, the prosperity goes up by itself X amount of time.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  I think the more you contribute, it does encourage the growth of it.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  Um, that's just a loose observation.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  I have no hard data or confirmation on that.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  Um, but what's nice about the prosperity.
[40:10.000 --> 40:16.000]  It's so you reach benchmark numbers, like every day at the end of day, you say, okay, here's the clan's next goal.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  We're going to build, um, I don't know, an art station.
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  Uh, we're going to build, some of them are just cosmetic, like here's a fishing spot is what mine are going for.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:27.000 --> 40:35.000]  Um, and so again, you can kind of speed it up by contributing a whole bunch or just wait it out and eventually they'll start working on it.
[40:35.000 --> 40:43.000]  Um, and it's, I think it's really cool because it ties, I think the game strength is in the setting, right?
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  Like that's the premise and it's really does it well because you really feel that sense of progression of going from nothing.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  And okay, we're all working together.
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  We're all contributing and we're all building up these little things.
[40:53.000 --> 41:05.000]  And before you know it, your re hut village starts to feel, feel like an actual village with different buildings and nice little touches and stuff like that.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Um, I, I really like it.
[41:07.000 --> 41:16.000]  I love a lot of the little things that they do too, because, so one of them, there's a, one of the, um, adults, I'm not going to remember her name.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  One of the adults can't remember any names in this game.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  I actually, I remember, so I remember Jizu.
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  Um, she is the clover, so she makes clothing.
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  Um, they all have, they all have really weird names, but yeah, we talk about that later.
[41:32.000 --> 41:42.000]  Um, but the one who's like the wolf tamer or wolf, wolf mom, wolf mom, wolf mom.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  You can tell cause she has a wolf skin.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  Yeah, she has a wolf hat, but then she also has three wolves that just like live with her.
[41:50.000 --> 41:59.000]  And at one point she's like, like one of the goals is my wolves want a pond to play in.
[41:59.000 --> 42:06.000]  So you build your, the, the group is like, yep, we're going to build a pond for the wolves.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  And it's just like, so cute.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  I just love little things like that.
[42:11.000 --> 42:23.000]  Like learning about that, you know, and then like you said, the art, um, art station, uh, one of the artist ladies like comes to you and it's like, I would really like to do this.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  And so you help out and they build it.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  Um, and it's, it's really nice.
[42:29.000 --> 42:39.000]  And it's just like, it's, I've, I've, it didn't until I played this game and I saw, you know, the, the game kind of do its own thing autonomously.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  Like even if you're doing nothing, um, I've never realized that games don't normally have that.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  Like gay, like think of, you know, Animal Crossing.
[42:49.000 --> 42:59.000]  If you weren't out there digging, like making the place beautiful or, uh, catching things and building the museum, no one else is going to do it.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  Yup, yup.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  If you don't go out and do it, the museum's just going to be dead forever.
[43:05.000 --> 43:12.000]  Um, there are all of these other animals that could theoretically, uh, contribute. They don't.
[43:12.000 --> 43:19.000]  Um, and so it was, it was really cool to have this mechanic in the game of, you know, full contributions.
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  Yeah.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  Stardew Valley.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  No character can experience growth until you talk to them.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  Oh my gosh.
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  Your lives will continue to be sad.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  And static.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  And static until you step in.
[43:34.000 --> 43:35.000]  Yeah, pretty much.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  Um, but yeah, no.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  Um, yeah.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  And I totally agree with you.
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.000]  And I think, again, it adds to that feeling of this is a game about the clan, not about you per se.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  Um, and it's really enjoyable in my opinion.
[43:52.000 --> 43:59.000]  Um, like even everyone even gathers around, like there's a big like community hut, they go up to hearth or whatever.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  Everyone gets there on the rainy days and just hangs out.
[44:01.000 --> 44:02.000]  Oh, I love it.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  Yeah.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  Um, okay, let's see here.
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.000]  Um, so I've wrote down a list. I don't know if this is the best order.
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.000]  Um, but let's talk about, um,
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  I think this next, the next thing on the list is a good one.
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  The mini game.
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.000]  Okay. Yeah.
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  So like any other cottage core, there's little mechanics, right?
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  The fishing mechanic, right?
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  How are you going to, how did your game approach that?
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.000]  Yeah.
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  And this game actually does little tiny micro mini games.
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  Mm hmm.
[44:30.000 --> 44:39.000]  Um, and I, I don't know about you Cody, but I thought these were actually kind of unique and, and yeah, fun might be a little bit of a stretch.
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.000]  Again, they're tiny little things, but they're, it's more engaging to me than just trying to push a at the right time or whatever.
[44:45.000 --> 44:54.000]  Um, I tell you, I tell you what the, the fishing mini game in this game did not want me to make me want to throw something across the room.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  Um, like Stardew.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  Yes.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  Yes.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  Yes.
[45:00.000 --> 45:07.000]  There are times in Stardew's fishing that I am just like, Oh my gosh, I spitefully just want to get this fish, but then it, it escapes.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  And then you're like, well, it's gone forever.
[45:10.000 --> 45:11.000]  Oh my gosh.
[45:11.000 --> 45:12.000]  And you wasted so much time.
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  Yeah.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.000]  And you wasted so much time.
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  I'm pretty sure when you're fishing in this game, it pauses.
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.000]  I have to tell, I know during most of the mini games, I don't know about fishing.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.000]  Okay.
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.000]  Uh, regardless.
[45:24.000 --> 45:31.000]  Um, so yeah, so how it works is so pretty much all the mini games, a big circle will appear that your mini game circle on the screen.
[45:31.000 --> 45:32.000]  Right.
[45:32.000 --> 45:41.000]  And for the fishing one, this circle boat looks like a pond and you see the fish shadows and you actually have to move your cursor to kind of follow the fish.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  Like as it's swimming, it's not moving fast.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  You're just kind of trying to follow it.
[45:45.000 --> 45:46.000]  And there's a little bar that goes up.
[45:46.000 --> 45:47.000]  Right.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  Um, and once the bar fills up, you click the button and you catch it.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  Um, there'll be times when like the fish is noticing you and you have to back off or whatever.
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.000]  And like, they're trying to evoke this feeling of like stone age fishing where they don't have fishing rods.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  So they're like trying to stock the fish in the water.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  Yeah.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  Like spear fishing.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  Like, yes, thank you.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  Yes.
[46:06.000 --> 46:14.000]  Like you have your spear overhead and you're following the fish and you have to kind of like understand the fishes, how the fish moves, um, before you can.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  And then like what it's going to do before you can, you know, strike.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  So, yeah.
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  Yeah.
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  Yeah.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  I like that mini game a lot.
[46:24.000 --> 46:31.000]  I mean, like, just in the terms of fishing mini games, like, oh my, it's so nice.
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  It's not, not super reaction heavy, not this, not whatever on a start you tried to do.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  Um, oh gosh, it's so nice.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  Um, but yeah, let's see here.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  So that's the fishing mini game, but there's, there's a few other mini games.
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  Um, the animal one, for instance, they call it a tuning in the game.
[46:50.000 --> 46:56.000]  Um, and to tame the animals, you have to serenade them with music, basically.
[46:56.000 --> 47:12.000]  Um, and the mini game is just, it's a simple, uh, rhythm game where they're, there's rings and they're heading towards the middle and you push, you know, you time right guitar hero like, um, and you just match the beat or whatever.
[47:12.000 --> 47:13.000]  It's not super hard.
[47:13.000 --> 47:14.000]  It's enjoyable.
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  Um, and you just, you have to do it a few times to get the animals to like you.
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  Um, but I, I, I thought that was a fun little way of doing it.
[47:22.000 --> 47:23.000]  Yeah.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  Um, there are a handful of other mini games throughout the whole game because there's festivals and celebrations.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.000]  Right.
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  And there's mini games.
[47:31.000 --> 47:32.000]  There's a tug of war.
[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  There's a, um, winter, there's a snowball fight for instance.
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  Oh my gosh.
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  I haven't gotten a winter.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  I guess we should have mentioned where we were.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  Oh, oh yeah.
[47:44.000 --> 47:51.000]  Um, yeah, there's a snowball fight and they all had their little rules and, and controls and whatnot, but it's all in the similar vein.
[47:51.000 --> 47:59.000]  Um, I will say though, there are some where it is actually just guitar hero with, with the four lines and, and hitting the arrows at the right place.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  Um, where is that?
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  I've done it most.
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  I'm trying to think.
[48:05.000 --> 48:14.000]  Um, I know a lot of the, uh, like if you do the story, talk to people and do their stories, some of the musicians, they want to play some music with you.
[48:14.000 --> 48:21.000]  I want to say there's another celebration that does it, but I can't, I can't remember, but it's actually just guitar hero.
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  It was, it was just amusing to see more than anything.
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.000]  Um, okay.
[48:25.000 --> 48:30.000]  Oh, oh, uh, there are two more that I forgot to write here on the list.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  Uh, uh,
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  Oh yeah.
[48:32.000 --> 48:38.000]  I will say the, the like ones at the, um, at the festivals.
[48:38.000 --> 48:47.000]  Um, I really enjoyed, like I actually at one of the festivals, I can't remember all, what all we were supposed to be doing.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  One of them was like a dart throwing or something.
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  And then there was a spear throwing.
[48:51.000 --> 48:52.000]  Yeah.
[48:52.000 --> 49:00.000]  So I genuinely enjoyed the, like it sometimes it, you know, in Stardew, I'd get to a festival and like, I'm going to skip this game.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  I hate this game.
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  I'm going to skip this, but like, I'll do this, this other one.
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.000]  I like specifically at one point talked to someone and they were like, Oh, do you want to start the end?
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  Like this is going to end the, the, the festival or whatever.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.000]  And I was like, Nope, Nope.
[49:13.000 --> 49:14.000]  I'm not ready yet.
[49:14.000 --> 49:22.000]  Um, they're just really, they're really ingenuity and they're really fun and they, and they're true to the story.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  So yeah, they feel like they're representing the activity.
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  Well, there's a game they call bones.
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  It's just jacks.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  You bounce the ball and pick up all the things.
[49:31.000 --> 49:32.000]  Yeah.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  Um, it's, yeah, I don't, I don't think I can't think of one that I dislike.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  Right.
[49:37.000 --> 49:38.000]  Again, they're all micro mini.
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.000]  It's not like I'm dedicating a whole game to this or whatever, but I've enjoyed them all.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  Bones gets frustrating when there's a lot, cause you can only go so fast.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  You get a lot.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  Like real jacks.
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  Yeah.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  Um, uh, okay.
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  The big, probably the biggest one, because you do it every other week racing, you can actually race your mount with the other villagers.
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.000]  Um, that one, I don't think they explained the controls well.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  Yeah.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  When you first start, like I talked to Kelly, same thing.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  She screwed it up first time I did too.
[50:09.000 --> 50:16.000]  Um, they need to fix that, but basically you're just, it auto boost or I don't remember, but you're dodging.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  Yeah.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.000]  We were going left to right.
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.000]  You're going up and down to dodge things and you have a sprint button that you have to hold, not press to activate it.
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  Um, but it's pretty, it's pretty fun.
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.000]  It's actually somewhat challenging because the Mount can move pretty dang fast.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  And some of the courses have a lot of obstacles and whatnot.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  Um, but it's, it's a fun little distraction and totally optional pretty much.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  Um, you, if you do win most of the mini games, you get rewards of some kind.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Um, so that's, that's fun.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  I got spaghetti one time I won.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  Yeah.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  There you go.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  Um, so yeah, I really liked the racing.
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.000]  And, uh, and then just one, one last little one.
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  It's not even really a game, but there's a cave painting festival and you actually Ms.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Like paint, whatever you want on the walls.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  I loved it.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  I was going to say you probably loved it.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  Cause you're a background.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  Yeah.
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.000]  So I couldn't figure out what the heck to do.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  And so I made this derpy little design and I just put it on.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  I was like, screw it.
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  Like I'm not, I'm not an artistic human.
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  I'm not a creative human.
[51:20.000 --> 51:25.000]  Um, so that wasn't for me, but I totally couldn't imagine you just having a blast.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  There's like multiple walls.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  I went to everything.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  Yeah.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  I just went to one wall through on a little thing and then it was like, okay, I'm done.
[51:33.000 --> 51:38.000]  I had, I did the, I did like a big tree, a sunflower.
[51:38.000 --> 51:48.000]  Um, but yeah, so all in all, like good job to roots Apache for making these mini games
[51:49.000 --> 51:50.000]  fun and enjoyable.
[51:50.000 --> 51:57.000]  Um, uh, but, uh, leaping off cave painting, let's talk about the caves.
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.000]  Um, because every cottage or star do like has its version of the mines.
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  And this one was interesting because there's no combat.
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.000]  Um, which is funny because you'd expect more combat in the game where you have
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  Spears and you try fighting to survive.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  Um, but, uh, yeah, it said it's, it's very much quote unquote puzzle-based.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  Some of them are puzzles.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  Most of the time you're just smashing rocks.
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  You have to smash enough rocks to open a door.
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  Um, what are your, what are your thoughts on the caves?
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  I'm trying to remember how they like said it.
[52:28.000 --> 52:37.000]  They, they say that, um, you need to prove to the, the spirits that you're strong
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  enough to advance.
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.000]  And so you basically just, I mean, I guess that's kind of like stardew, right?
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  Like you have to break a bunch of rocks and then eventually you like find the
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  hole that goes down.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  Um, same thing.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.000]  Um, you just break enough rocks and then the opening will happen there every now
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  and then there's one that you have to, you know, use your acts to like cut,
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  cut your way into it.
[52:59.000 --> 53:03.000]  Um, and you get resources first.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  You just get stone and then you can find Flint and then you get obsidian.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  And I think the next one you get is bronze, but I haven't found it yet.
[53:09.000 --> 53:16.000]  Um, and then as you're progressing through, um, there are these like totems
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  that you put, um, offerings down to.
[53:21.000 --> 53:25.000]  And as you're going through, there's, there are like little cave painting
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  things that kind of tell you what the totem might want.
[53:28.000 --> 53:36.000]  Um, and so like one of them is an owl totem and I think it just wants fish.
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  And so when you give it fish, it like, so you bring like a couple of fish to
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  the totem, um, and then you get the power of the owl.
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  And so then there are these little owl stations and you can use those to become
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.000]  an owl and like fly to another area, to a new area.
[53:55.000 --> 54:02.000]  Um, so far I found the horse totem, but I have not been able to figure like I
[54:02.000 --> 54:07.000]  had to Google what I wanted, um, because based on the cave painting thing, I was
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  like, I think I'm doing this right.
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  I don't know what's going on, but I Googled it and I, I know what I need to do now.
[54:13.000 --> 54:19.000]  Um, and then I've also found a monkey, um, spot on the floor, but I have not
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  found the monkey totem yet.
[54:21.000 --> 54:27.000]  So, um, but it's, it's, there's these cute little, like, you know, fun puzzles.
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.000]  Sometimes it's really dark and you have to pull out your torch.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Um, it's a maze.
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  Yeah, it becomes a maze and you have to kind of figure out where you're going.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  Um, what do you think of the puzzles?
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  Uh, I like them generally.
[54:41.000 --> 54:41.000]  Right.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  So my issue with Stardew combat is that's not it's focused.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  So it's always pretty simplistic.
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  And if I get combat in a game, I'd like a little more, maybe, maybe that's
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  like my best way of putting it right.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  I don't always like the very simplistic combat that you get
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  in these mines or whatever.
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  Um, so I thought these, this was a fun change of pace.
[55:03.000 --> 55:08.000]  Um, I have actually completed the case except for the horse totem.
[55:08.000 --> 55:14.000]  Um, but the, I think some of the puzzles towards the end do
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  get genuinely challenging.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  Um, especially the last one, the totem powers are pretty situational,
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  except the last one, the last one actually is very interesting.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  I found that interesting.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  Um, but, uh, I, all in all, I liked it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:37.000]  Um, and one thing I liked is the aesthetic of the caves because the
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  deeper you go changes, you get into a jungle area and like another area.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  Um, I, so I liked the design of the caves.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  I like spending time in there.
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  Um, oh, and one of the, uh, biggest, biggest differences.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  Well, I guess Stardew technically has it, but there's quick travel, right?
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  Because these caves, it's not vertical going down every floor.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  It's all one giant network of caves, all on one level.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  And so you have a map and shows you the rooms and there's certain
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  quick travel points that you unlock.
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  Um, and it's, it's really cool to find those and then just, you know,
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  you don't have to go through the whole cave again, you can just
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  warp to this point and do whatever.
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  I've never actually looked at the map in the cave.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  Oh no!
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  I should probably do that.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  It would help in the caves.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  It shows you where the next door is going to be.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  Yeah, cause I don't, I just have been looking cause so in the first
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  area, all of the doors have this like little pedestal next to them.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  And so I was always just looking for that.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  And then, well, sure.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  Yeah.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  That kind of thing.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  But yeah, I mean, there's definitely some rooms that have multiple doors.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  And so if you don't look at the map.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  Oh, that's so funny.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  Didn't Al just do that in a game too?
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  He didn't.
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.000]  I'm sure he did.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  That sounds like, I don't know.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  I think he didn't open a map.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  Like didn't know something had a map.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  I think it was a game that he did with Bev and they told him.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  Coral Island.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  It was Coral Island.
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  Oh yeah.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  Under the ocean.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  Yeah.
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  The ocean thing.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  But luckily it didn't like, I didn't even think about it.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  Like I'm pretty navigational.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  Like I'm good with that.
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  So it didn't bother me.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  Yeah.
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  No, it's not hard or complex, but it's just nice to see.
[57:24.000 --> 57:27.000]  So yeah, that is the caves.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  I don't think much else to add to that.
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  As you said, you get your resources from there as usual to advance stuff throughout.
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  So you do have to do them a little to upgrade stuff.
[57:39.000 --> 57:47.000]  So I guess the one thing that we could say really quick here is that the caves are in the forest.
[57:47.000 --> 57:57.000]  So there's the basic area where your clan lives and like where the clan, your houses are and stuff.
[57:57.000 --> 58:02.000]  And then there's the forest, the Savannah, the beach and the jungle.
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  Yeah.
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  Let's talk about that.
[58:04.000 --> 58:05.000]  This is good.
[58:05.000 --> 58:06.000]  Yeah.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  Yeah.
[58:07.000 --> 58:11.000]  And so the jungle doesn't for me right now, it doesn't really have much.
[58:11.000 --> 58:23.000]  It just has I mean, I guess sometimes it has some seeds, but right now it just has the pyramid, which is kind of the community center of of this game.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  So it's kind of where you have these like overarching achievements that you're trying to get.
[58:27.000 --> 58:41.000]  And every time you you complete one, you can go and it adds to the pyramid and you get some type of jewel piece of jewelry that you can then use.
[58:41.000 --> 58:47.000]  And it gives you some types of some type of buff, like one of them that I just caught.
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  It was like the ring of the buzz or something like that.
[58:49.000 --> 58:52.000]  And it was it literally gives you like more honey.
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  That's good.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  That's cool.
[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  Of course.
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  So that's the jungle.
[59:01.000 --> 59:05.000]  The Savannah is kind of I mean, it's a Savannah.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  So that's where the biggest area is.
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  It is a gigantic area.
[59:09.000 --> 59:12.000]  And a lot of it is just wheat.
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  We need grass or grass.
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  It's grass grass.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  It is, but you've got to scrape those sides to find those resources, find that corn, find that.
[59:23.000 --> 59:27.000]  I want to note both corn and chili were in the Savannah.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  Yeah, because it's big.
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  Most of the most of the animals, I think, are there, too.
[59:34.000 --> 59:43.000]  Well, there's the ostriches, the the guanacos, the mammoths, the buffalo and the lions.
[59:43.000 --> 59:54.000]  Yeah, the forest has the wolves, the boars, the bunnies and the ibex.
[59:54.000 --> 59:59.000]  And that that area definitely has more to it than I can go to.
[59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  I think I can I think there's like going to be more of it more to it eventually.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  But it's pretty straightforward.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  I mean, it's just a forest next to next to a river.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  Yeah, there's also the beach south of your village.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  It's just a beach. There's that one's kind of barren.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  Yeah, it doesn't have any animals per se, but it has it has like one or two crops per se.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  And maybe has like a prickly pear.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  The sea will see with some crops. It's just a gatherable.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  But yeah, the prickly pear and the what's the other one?
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Kale. Kale.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Yes. Kale is what it's called.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Yeah, there is one thing to note, though, and that I think that's where the beach probably is best.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Every location has different fishing spots and fish you can fish up.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  So and depending on the seasons and all that stuff.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  So, yeah, there the beach is good for fishing.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Right. And just it gets another use.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Wow. I want to talk about that one. I think it's more late game. But anyways.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  But yeah. So the setting, I think it's smaller than your average. Smaller than Stardew for sure.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Right. Like I'd say comparable to maybe the base Stardew without the island and all the other stuff that came out later.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  And because of the crops, you have to go out and gather. You learn it pretty well.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  I think the map works overall. I really like it.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Yeah, I think it's it's nice. And there's like all of the gatherables each size my cat food.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  It's OK. Yeah. Each location has their own gatherables pretty much. Yeah.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Last, but certainly not least, but actually least in this game.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Kind of.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  It hurts.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  The character.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Oh, OK. Oh, there's a wiki. There is a wiki. I've seen it.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  So there's two. How do I you know, I'm just going to be upfront.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  The characters are pretty are pretty boring in this one. Yeah.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  It's it's tough because they're not awful.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  Yeah, but they just don't stand out from each other that much. Everyone's pretty cordial and polite and friendly.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Right. Like, yeah, they say, OK, here's the music person.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Here's the whatever person.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  And so, you know, you learn and you talk to them, you learn about them.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Some of them have actually decent backstories if you get to know them. What's his name?
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Jag the fire guy. He has a crazy backstory, actually.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  But it doesn't help that because of the setting, they gave them kind of fictional Stone Age names that are kind of impossible to remember.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  Yeah. Like there's Fox and Jag and Jarek.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  And then you have. I have it up now. There's Era, Frere, Garak, Ebon, Illaoi, Gelrod, Juk, Mana, Krak, Took, Val.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Like those are the types of names.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  Yep. And then you have Ron, who's just like it's like and Ron's thing is making brewskies.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  And he's got like he's got like a like a really long stache.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  Yeah, stache and beard. So he feels like a regular character in this game.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Good old Ron. It looks like he'd fit in right in the south.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  Yep. He looks like he belongs in the bar in Stardew. But but anyways.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  So the overall point, right. Like I don't like the characters, but they're huge.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  They need a little more meat on those bones character writing wise. Right.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  I think part of it is I don't think that I've been thinking about it. Like why is it not working?
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  I think part of it is maybe the art. It's not dynamic enough.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  I know it's like Stardew is not super dynamic art either, but at least there's a bit more emotions at times.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  You know, be a little more over the top.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Like all the portraits are pretty much static, except for like eyes changing and the occasional blushing.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Excuse me. So.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Yeah, they're they're kind of weak. Have you grown attached to anyone at all, Cody?
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  Yeah. So I think there's one character that I have five flowers with their flowers.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  So if they are a romanceable character, their their little flowers are pink.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  And if they are non romanceable, their little flowers, the flowers like show you how much you know them.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  And how much you've interacted with them and everything. And non romanceables are going to be yellow.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  And I actually hear, oh, you an apology.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  One of the conversations we had, you said that the romanceable characters were really weak and that all of the ones that were that,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  you know, are interesting and are characters that you might want to romance are like married ones.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Yeah, the married ones are the unavailable ones or what have you. And I was like, no, there's some good ones.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  And after I was like, no, you're you're silly.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  I played the game again and realized that the characters that I was thinking of are not romance.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  So because I wanted I was I really liked Oka who's wolf mom.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  Wolf mom's the best. I wanted to date her.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  And then I really liked Reese, who's the artist Reese is also taken.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  And then I was like, OK, but what about Acre, who's the cool lady also taken.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000]  It's like, what the heck.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  And then from the ones that are available as romanceable characters here in the Pachang clan,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  they say there's era who I genuinely don't remember this.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  You know, the little kid.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  No, you're era era.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  She enters the new lands of the Pachang clan on the second of summer in year one with Nari and Selk.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Oh, oh, her. Oh, yeah.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  Oh, gosh. Didn't really.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Yeah, I don't know. She she's just she's just blah.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  Is she really? She likes spicy food.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Yeah, that's it. I don't know.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  There's rare. He's the fisher guy and he's just like not very confident and he's like a little shy.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  Oh, he's got a back story that I just learned about his back story. Oh, man.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Oh, no. Do you want me to tell you or do you want to find out on your own?
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  OK, that was that was one.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  I didn't expect that. I really like Garak.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  Garak is who I'm currently going for. Garak is kind of like the thinker of the clan.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  And he's so bad. Always off on his own.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  I feel so bad because they give you an introduction like to every character when you talk to them for the first time.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  And Garak is like, he's the one who thinks it just it just sounded so goofy.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  But no, he is he's a smart cookie. He's thinking of science before science is invented.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Also, he does the the Gangnam Style horsey dance.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  Yep. I I tweeted Roots of Pacha and I was like, does Garak does Gangnam Style?
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  They were like, yep. And he ends it with he ends it with I call that Garak style whenever he dances.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  Yvonne, who she seems like the pretty girl, like, I don't know.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  And she's always talking about Gelrod, who's like her brother.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  Oh, OK. So I thought that they were not OK.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  My bad. No. OK.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  Yvonne, she seems like the pretty girl because she's blonde and pigtails and whatnot.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  But so here's the thing. Gelrod is basically Gaston.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  No one no one makes music like Gelrod. No one hunts like Gelrod.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Right. Yeah. And then Yvonne's is this guy's little sister.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  So she's just forever in his shadow. And that's her whole deal.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  I like Yvonne. She's she's not blonde bitsy. She's you know, she's she's got some stuff.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  She's also a mad drummer. Sick. Yeah.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  There's Eloise, who she is. She kind of helps the heel.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  She's apprentice healer, so she's with the elder who is kind of like she helps the healer, the elder who is the healer.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  But pretty and I like kind of started talking to her. But then she pretty frequently when once you start talking to her,
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  she talks about Frere a lot and she like says that she used to be friends with Frere and how much she likes Frere.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  Like not like likes, loves her, loves Frere, but like she just like mentions him a lot.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  And so it's like Stardew where they kind of have partners, you know, take them.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  And so I was like, OK, I'll just let you do your thing.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  And so I was like, I'm not going to stop it, stop it, interrupt it.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  No, I can't have her. I'm going to go for Garak.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  And then there's Juk, who Juk, I don't know how I say he's also a clothing maker.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  And yeah, that's that's his thing.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  And then Mana, who again, this is someone I forgot. Oh, she's the son of the son of the leader.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  Sorry, daughter of the leader. And she's girl scout super cadet.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  She's going to be the leader one day. There are other clans, like as you open up areas, there are other clans as well.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  And there's one romanceable person from the beach clan and two from the Savannah clan.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  But they're all pretty. They're all pretty.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  OK, so I don't I don't know. I don't think it's it's frustrating because I don't think they're mad because they're not interesting.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  I just haven't had a reason to talk to unless like you of your own volition go and talk to them.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Yes. No, absolutely. And so that's like I'm sure that they all have amazing backstories and all and or tragic backstories.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And they probably all have their own personalities and stuff, but like some of these people I just have not have had no reason to talk to them.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  Yeah, no, no, that's that's super fair. I am notoriously a person who enjoys characters.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  Like I think characters are my favorite thing of almost any media. Right.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  So I, I go out of my way because I like to learn about the characters and meet them and whatnot.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  So I think they're a little weak and like I said in the writing and stuff like that, they're not bad, they're not awful.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  They just need to stand out from each other a little more.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  Again, this is just armchair game writing or whatever.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  But yeah, I don't dislike any of the well, some of them I think are meant to be dislike like Joe Rodden.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  But but it's fine. It's not bad, but it's it could just use a little more.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And it's tough, too, because of the setting. Right. Like doesn't have the convenience of stardew where you can have people with different jobs and varied histories and whatnot.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Everyone's kind of all going through the same thing in the clan.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  So, yeah, you know, so I feel a little for that.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  But who knows? I mean, they're like I mentioned, they're updating you. Right.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  And I hope this is one of the areas they'll definitely update.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  I think the biggest thing for me is that they don't they so every now and then a character has an idea and you go to them and you like help them develop their idea.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  And it's always the non romanceable characters that have the ideas if I'm pretty much.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Yeah, like for the most part. And so you other than so.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I mean, I've you know, on the day to day talking to people, I'm talking to a lot of the non romanceable characters that and that's why, like, you know, I was excited about because I was like, oh, like, I really love acre.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Like when you dance with her, she says something like work hard, but party hard to or something or play hard. Yeah.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  And it's just like, oh, that's so funny because she's such a hard worker and she's always like, OK, like, I'm going to get back to work or whatever.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  Like if you talk to her. So I want to say, well, go ahead. You finish your thought.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  How is it? OK. I have to give a little story here.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Like when I first played Stardew, the first person you meet is Robin or the lady who sells you your place and those are upgrades, if I recall.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Right. And I felt like, oh, I like this lady. I heard you can date people. I think I want to date her.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  And then I find out I can't date her. The very first person I took interesting.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  Yeah. In this game, Acre is one of the first people you talk to.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  And guess what? Oh, I like I want to date her.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And no, no, I can't once. So even there, they replicated this Stardew feeling.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Can't rock the boat.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Not yet, Al. Not yet. Not yet.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Yeah, Wolf Mom's the best. She's just flat out the best.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  I do really like Tuke as well. Sorry, Tuke is from the Mograni clan and he is he's just a himbo.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  He's a himbo. He looks like handsome Squidward or Giga Chad.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  He is super Giga Chad, but or yeah, like the handsome Squidward with the with the five o'clock shadow.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Yeah, he is just so sweet and like doesn't really.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  There's not a thought between those eyes, but he is a sweetheart.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  Tuke's very amusing. He likes baby animals. He's like, oh, I'm tough, but nobody can see that I have this baby pig that I love.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  But yeah, like as you you basically become friends with them from talking to them after knowing them for enough time,
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  you can dance with them and they all have their own individual dances.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  You can give them gifts as well. But the problem that I have come come to is someone like they they have no way of knowing what gift they want.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And I guess Stardew is this way as well. Like, yeah, there's no way to know what someone's going to like or what they're not going to like.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Well, there kind of is as well. You have to talk to characters and they'll tell you what other ones like.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  But no, in general, I know what you mean. There's no way to keep track.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  There's no in-game thing. It keeps a record of what you give.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. If you go to their profile and apparently Stardew has done this now.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  OK, good. So I think it's just from Stardew. But yeah, if you give a gift and it and then you can go to the profile and takes a record, you gave this gift and this was their response.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  Yeah. You can just trial and error.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  Derek will say if he doesn't like it, he says, I don't see the point of this or something like that.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Like this has no use. And then if he likes it, he'll say something like this is somewhat interesting.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  And I found that with food, he says this is somewhat interesting a lot.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  So I don't know what the heck you want. I because I've given him gatherables and he's always like meh.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  Yeah. One thing I picked at the wiki to look up the likes and dislikes for a few of them.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  It's kind of all over the place. It's it's hard to tell. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like, well, OK.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  Like it's an error. There's a girl like spicy food. Well, you give her something spicy.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  She'll probably like it. But yeah. Acre, for instance, likes metals because she works with them or whatever.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  But by and large, I agree that it's kind of all over the place and it's it's kind of gets in check or or whatever.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  So I guess we've talked about romanceable characters. I think I have maybe four or five flowers with Garrick.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  And that's my top. What about you? Have you have you romanced?
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  I am romancing three people at once. Oh my God. Which is more than I have done in my real life.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  Come by. So what does that mean, your romance? Like, do you get to a point where you're actually dating them?
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Yes. So once you hit, I think it's like six flowers, you can do what's called a hangout with them.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  And they'll say like, OK, do you want a date? And you can say yes or no.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  Yeah. And then you said yes to three different people. Yes, I did. Oh, my God.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  We never I never said we were exclusive with anyone who didn't define the relationship.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  You're over there breaking hearts. My goodness. I'm actually who is it?
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  Well, I'm doing because I'm feeling I'm out. I need. So Ebon was the first one I got to know.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  And she's the farthest along. What's your name?
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Mana, the village leader. She's kind of cool. So I talked to her and bless you.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  Valla is her name, I believe. Well, she is two sister from the Savannah tribe.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  She has heterochromia. So, yeah, very cool.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  Love that here for that. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  Even like in her little overworld sprite, you can clearly see the heterochromia.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  Yeah, she and and and yeah. So then I'm getting to know them. I do.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  I'm still deciding which one. One warning, though.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  So if you max out the hearts like I have with Ebon, they'll ask if you want to hang out.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  And I thought it was just another cut scene. And no, turns out that's the marriage scene.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  Either you accept the proposal or they break up with them.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  So I had to restart that date that day because I was like, oh, I'm not ready for this commitment.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Yeah. Yeah. You don't propose as you do in so many other podcast.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  There's no ring that you give. It's you hit that that mark and and you dive right in.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  I yeah, I haven't taken that step yet. I made my final decision.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  But it's yeah. I mean, like I said, I'm someone who enjoys characters, right?
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  So even as many as some of these characters have been,
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  I have gotten to know them well enough to enjoy them a good bit.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  So I'm having fun and yeah.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  But yeah, I guess that's all I really have to say on characters.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  Yeah. I mean, and the game. And yeah, I think we say that pretty much covers everything without spoiling things.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  Yeah. So yeah, I mean, final thoughts.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  Definitely recommend it. And we will keep you posted. Yeah.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  If you have already got it, we will keep you posted on when it is available.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  Yes. And I hope it's soon. And if not, I.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Yeah, I just said I'll be kind and curious and say I hope it's soon so people can buy off the steam page and are not forced to experience it.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  Because right now they don't have any other way. Like it's not like, oh, it's also on switch or oh, it's all.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  No, that's one thing I'm wondering, because I know they were planning for console releases and I don't know how slash when this will affect that.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  I mean, it's I think I believe it's the same. Yeah, I'm sure it is.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  So stay tuned, everyone. Yeah.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  But until then, just yeah.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  Roots of Pacha is good. When you can get it, get it. It's a solid, solid buy.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  All right. And so where can people find you on the Internet, Cody?
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  I am on Twitter at Cody Mathis. Just my name.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  I'm also on Instagram at Hiking Beagle Beagle with BEE Beagle.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  I have a beagle and I study bees. Yeah.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  What about you, Kev? They can find me at Cooper Press to see me retweet other funnier, more insightful people or at Spriter Squared, where I have I have been making it.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000]  I just haven't been posting it, but I won't get to that.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  You can also follow the podcast at THS Pod on Twitter.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Al's at Scott, but he probably retweets everything there, too.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  You can go to harvest season dot club to see show notes, transcripts, links where you can also provide feedback and all these places.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  Ask us questions. Give comments. We like to hear about them. We had fun with that mailbag episode. Give us more ammo.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  So much fun. Give us more questions. And and they don't have to be thought provoking questions.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  And you could also say, like, I would like my question to be anonymous or something like if you have a goofy question.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Yes. Like is a hot dog a sandwich or something like this?
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  Just say please read this anonymously and we will do so.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  Even stories. It doesn't have to be a question. That's true.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  You want to talk about your experience with I don't know.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  Tell us about I can't think of an example. Whatever. Tell us your funny story about how how you're dating three people at once.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  And we'd love to hear about it and talk about it on the show.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  And then aside from all that, you can also find us at Patreon dot com slash THS pod, where you can get access to one.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  Our Slack, a lovely community where you can have like more real time chats and fun conversations like some of the ones we brought up today that Cody mentioned.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  And you can also get access to our bonus podcast, The Green House, where we have all sorts of non cottagecore content.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  Guess what? Cody and Al are talking about Eurovision because that's the thing that's going on.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  And that's Eurovision time, baby. Yeah.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  So go listen to that. I actually haven't listened to that one.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  I need to go to because I remember like, thank you. I did it with you the very first time and that was a really, really good one.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  So we did it two years ago. And in that way, I had never listened to Eurovision before, didn't even know what Eurovision was.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  And so that episode on the greenhouse and if you were if you do subscribe at Patreon dot com slash THS pod, you'll get access to all of the greenhouses.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  So you can go back and listen to the two years ago greenhouse where he explains Eurovision to me and has me watch Eurovision.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  Yeah. And most of those episodes are not news heavy, so they are just as good as they are as they were two years ago.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  And then so last year we just did our reaction.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  So we we said like what what what bands we liked, what who we wanted to win.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  And then we did a reaction to the actual like finalist same this year.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  So we about two weeks ago to a couple or three weeks ago, we recorded one that was like, this is who we like.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  This is what's going on. And we did that before the semifinals.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  And then after the finals and after the winner was announced, we did a reaction podcast where we talked about that and how upset we were.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  So it's only that's it.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  Good. So all right. Thank you, Kevin, for joining me for this.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  And thanks for playing this game with me. It was super fun. It was super fun. Thank you, Cody, as well.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  Thank you, Al, for giving us the reins for this episode.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  I hope I hope he enjoys this episode. He said he's actually going to listen to us to see if he plays the game or not.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  So we'll play the game.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  But until next time, dearest listeners, have a good harvest.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  Whoo. Whoo. We did it.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  You.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  Boop.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  I'm going to hit record.
