[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  [Theme Music]
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.140]  Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al and my
[00:37.140 --> 00:46.880]  name is Bev and we're here today to talk about farming, no cottagecore games. Apparently
[00:46.880 --> 00:52.320]  that is just like muscle memory for my brain now because it's been going on for so long.
[00:52.320 --> 00:56.960]  I was actually thinking while I was doing that intro, how do people with multiple podcasts
[00:56.960 --> 01:02.360]  do it? I don't know. How do they remember which podcast they're introing? Maybe like
[01:02.360 --> 01:07.120]  they I don't know if they just had like some sort of routine that gets it into like into
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.840]  the specific podcast. Yeah yeah like this is this is the thing I do before this podcast
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.080]  and it's like you juggle or something yeah yeah that would work. There's a friend in
[01:17.080 --> 01:23.880]  my D&D group who like she had like a Scottish character like a Scottish dwarf and every
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.960]  time she she couldn't do the accent unless she did like this little like song beforehand
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.360]  so she would do the song and then just like talk in a Scottish accent for like the rest
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.600]  of the day. But she could not get started without it so yeah just some sort of routine
[01:39.600 --> 01:46.200]  I guess that triggers it. Yeah I I mean I'm going to guess that the accent was probably
[01:46.200 --> 01:51.800]  not great anyway. I don't know I thought it was pretty great but yeah but how do you what
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.000]  do you what do you think about Shrek's accent that's the real question? Uh I mean I don't
[01:56.000 --> 02:05.160]  know no I could no it's not okay I mean it's Shrek. I mean I'm not saying it would be Shrek
[02:05.160 --> 02:09.200]  but I think that's a good indication of whether people think something is a good Scottish
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.800]  accent or not and if they think that Shrek is a good Scottish accent then they don't
[02:12.800 --> 02:16.880]  know what a Scottish accent is. I guess I don't know I watch a lot of Outlander so I
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.880]  feel like I have a better representation maybe. I have heard of that I have no idea what it
[02:22.880 --> 02:30.440]  is. Okay I would recommend it's a if you like like historical fiction it's essentially someone
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.760]  going back in time to like the I don't know seven goodness I don't even know like what
[02:34.760 --> 02:40.860]  1700s maybe in the Scottish Highlands. Oh my word like they've actually got like proper
[02:40.860 --> 02:50.280]  Scots in this as well. Mm-hmm I'm gonna watch it. Probably not. Okay. Interesting mm-hmm
[02:50.280 --> 02:57.160]  it's Lionsgate. Mm-hmm yeah so it's like behind a payroll there's the first like three seasons
[02:57.160 --> 03:04.700]  I think are at least the US like Netflix but not all of them. I mean basically basically
[03:04.700 --> 03:11.120]  nothing's on Netflix anymore other than Netflix stuff mm-hmm where is it it is on yeah it's
[03:11.120 --> 03:17.320]  on well they're calling it stars now but that's one of those it's one of those Amazon Prime
[03:17.320 --> 03:21.360]  channels that you have to have Amazon Prime and then you also have to pay for this extra
[03:21.360 --> 03:28.120]  channel on top. Right yep I hate it. Alright let's move away from subscriptions please
[03:28.120 --> 03:40.160]  I'm all tied out. Alright this is a podcast about Cottagecore games. Uh-huh. We this episode
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.960]  we're gonna talk about Cult of the Lamb this is our second harvest on Cult of the Lamb
[03:45.960 --> 03:51.840]  the previous episode will be in the show notes if you want to listen to that first by Kevin
[03:51.840 --> 03:59.320]  and Kelly mm-hmm but me and Bev had some thoughts and it's been a while since I we decided to
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.960]  do this so I can't remember what my thoughts were but I'm sure they'll come back. Uh-huh
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.680]  I it's yeah it's also been a while but I did start up playing it today so I can revisit
[04:09.680 --> 04:16.400]  this world and try to create some thoughts. Yeah I talked a little bit about it in the
[04:16.400 --> 04:23.280]  game of the year episode as well but mm-hmm anyway. Before that oh I need to say this
[04:23.280 --> 04:28.840]  I need to get into the habit of saying this right up front. Transcripts for the podcast
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.360]  are now available in the show notes and on the website and they say it's best to say
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.920]  it as early in the podcast as possible for obvious reasons so there you go. Beautiful.
[04:37.920 --> 04:42.600]  So we're gonna talk about Cult of the Lamb before that we're gonna have some news but
[04:42.600 --> 04:48.200]  first of all Bev what have you been playing? I've been playing a lot of Stardew ever since
[04:48.200 --> 04:56.400]  I saw that concerned ape treat for the seven years I've just been immersed and I think
[04:56.400 --> 05:03.440]  I'm finally going to reach like one point the 1.5 update finally so I'm excited to reach
[05:03.440 --> 05:08.060]  this new venture in this game that I haven't actually played yet. Did you do a new save
[05:08.060 --> 05:13.680]  or are you on top of one of your old ones? I did a new one. Wow mm-hmm fair enough mm-hmm
[05:13.680 --> 05:19.760]  how about you what are you been playing? I have been playing a couple of things so I've
[05:19.760 --> 05:26.080]  been playing Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity I think it's called the newer one whatever
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.480]  I've just slowly been playing through that I think I talked about that in the last episode
[05:29.480 --> 05:34.320]  that I did so yeah I've just been slowly playing through that I'm not sure when I'll finish
[05:34.320 --> 05:40.600]  it I'll probably take a break this week because the new Kirby game just arrived at my house
[05:40.600 --> 05:48.440]  so I'm gonna play that. Exciting. Yeah yeah very exciting I've also been playing the Bloom
[05:48.440 --> 05:55.680]  update which I'll talk about more in the news soon bear with and I've also been playing
[05:55.680 --> 06:02.640]  the new Mario Kart levels and I actually I had not I hadn't actually finished playing
[06:02.640 --> 06:06.240]  the previous ones because I can't remember when they must have been like just before
[06:06.240 --> 06:09.720]  Christmas or something so it was just really busy with lots of other things so I ended
[06:09.720 --> 06:16.340]  up not not three starting them so I've been doing that and then moving on to the new ones
[06:16.340 --> 06:22.240]  as well so yeah. Is this Mario Party 8? Yes. Okay so I was gonna say a new one I haven't
[06:22.240 --> 06:28.900]  heard of a new one coming out. No but it's interesting because so they say so when they
[06:28.900 --> 06:33.640]  announced this DLC they announced at the beginning of last year or middle middle of the beginning
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.840]  of last year sometime early last year and they said they were going to be six waves
[06:38.840 --> 06:47.000]  over basically two years so up till the end of this year and then that kind of string
[06:47.000 --> 06:54.660]  that that text on the DLC has kind of has been deleted so that's interesting and people
[06:54.660 --> 07:00.440]  are leading to believe to think that that means there's going to be more it possibly
[07:00.440 --> 07:04.600]  could mean that this is not all going to be done by the end of this year I would be surprised
[07:04.600 --> 07:09.200]  if that was the case right because like there's only two more waves to go and not managing
[07:09.200 --> 07:14.840]  to do two more waves this year would be surprising so I'm also probably leaning towards the idea
[07:14.840 --> 07:21.260]  that there's possibly more coming but also adding to that speculation in this DLC pack
[07:21.260 --> 07:31.240]  sorry wave need to use the right terminology this DLC waves are transient why would you
[07:31.240 --> 07:36.080]  use wave when you've got when you want people to continue playing things don't use terminology
[07:36.080 --> 07:43.740]  about transient things well it like the well waves always sure they're like transient but
[07:43.740 --> 07:48.240]  there's always a wave after the wave yeah but that's that's well exactly so it makes
[07:48.240 --> 07:56.000]  it worse right I don't know it's gonna be infinite infinite number of waves right like
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.360]  you never stop the waves and they're all transient and I just it doesn't feel like the right
[08:00.360 --> 08:04.420]  terminology they would want to use for this thing come on I mean they haven't come out
[08:04.420 --> 08:08.960]  with a Mario Kart like 9 so I think that is what they're doing is just trying to like
[08:08.960 --> 08:14.160]  string this game out for as long as possible before they come up with a new one oh who
[08:14.160 --> 08:24.340]  knows who knows so the other the other speculation is in this wave they released Birdo as a playable
[08:24.340 --> 08:31.180]  character in the game hmm which Birdo has been available in previous games and fun fact
[08:31.180 --> 08:37.240]  I don't know whether you're aware of this Bev Birdo the only canonically trans character
[08:37.240 --> 08:45.180]  in Mario what I did not know this yeah okay was confirmed canonically as trans in something
[08:45.180 --> 08:56.460]  like 1993 wow obviously obviously the terminology is not great so you have to bear in mind that
[08:56.460 --> 09:02.340]  this was the early 90s I'm still incredibly progressive to have a trans character in a
[09:02.340 --> 09:10.440]  video game coming out of like Japan well yeah yeah yeah that's a good point okay my new
[09:10.440 --> 09:17.240]  favorite character is now Birdo Birdo also you can get in all nine colors that you can
[09:17.240 --> 09:21.540]  get the Yoshi's in which is fun I've been playing as the light blue Birdo I just okay
[09:21.540 --> 09:29.980]  just because it's fun but in the game on the character selection screen they didn't just
[09:29.980 --> 09:36.220]  add Birdo they also added I think it was five question marks as well so the speculation
[09:36.220 --> 09:41.820]  is that there are five more characters coming to the game that sounds about right now if
[09:41.820 --> 09:46.420]  they were to do let's say for example the two more waves that they were planning to
[09:46.420 --> 09:51.460]  do this year they do them this year and there's also a character in them that would leave
[09:51.460 --> 09:57.500]  three characters left to come which if they were to do another year the same as they have
[09:57.500 --> 10:03.140]  been doing these two years that would be another three waves so all of that speculation to
[10:03.140 --> 10:08.540]  come would imply possibly theoretically that there would be three more waves coming next
[10:08.540 --> 10:15.860]  year that's a lot considering this game came out in well how many years has it been now
[10:15.860 --> 10:22.060]  so I was actually looking at this the other day I love to look at these things I mean
[10:22.060 --> 10:28.680]  first of all right the the game is insane like the amount of sales is just quite insane
[10:28.680 --> 10:35.860]  right so if you look at the sales right the set up until recently the best-selling Mario
[10:35.860 --> 10:44.500]  Kart game was Mario Kart Wii right okay and Mario Kart Wii sold in total 37 million copies
[10:44.500 --> 10:55.160]  which is a lot for a video game right that made it in the top like 15 I think best-selling
[10:55.160 --> 11:03.620]  video games okay wow okay roughly and it's obviously these things are not static so certainly
[11:03.620 --> 11:09.580]  until recently it was in the top 15 best-selling video games of all it's currently the 16 okay
[11:09.580 --> 11:18.700]  Mario Kart 8 so ignoring 8 so just the switch version has sold 52 million copies okay 52
[11:18.700 --> 11:30.100]  million copies making a revenue of 2 billion dollars oh my goodness that's a lot I can
[11:30.100 --> 11:35.740]  see why it's okay it's much more on the switch because I feel like this people are people
[11:35.740 --> 11:41.380]  like this which much more than people liked the Wii this is Wii not DS Wii oh sorry well
[11:41.380 --> 11:48.540]  it's also on the DS so isn't it not Mario Kart Wii Mario Kart Wii was just on the Wii
[11:48.540 --> 11:55.840]  well no Mario Kart 8 that was on the Wii U okay well never mind I don't know I'm tired
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.780]  I'm gonna blame you on that so if you if you include if you combine the two Mario Kart
[11:59.780 --> 12:04.420]  8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe right because they're basically the same game it's just that they
[12:04.420 --> 12:09.940]  have now added more content like the only recently until last year Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
[12:09.940 --> 12:14.980]  was just Mario Kart 8 with the DLC right it was the exact same game everything else
[12:14.980 --> 12:18.940]  was exactly the same it was just on the switch so if you include if you combine the two of
[12:18.940 --> 12:27.100]  them they have sold 60 million copies oh my goodness in total Mario Kart have sold 166
[12:27.100 --> 12:35.620]  million copies in total so Mario Kart 8 and Deluxe have together it's over a third of
[12:35.620 --> 12:42.780]  all Mario Kart sales that's pretty okay so I could definitely see why they they're they
[12:42.780 --> 12:48.380]  are making waves and trying to prolong this as long as possible absolutely they sold four
[12:48.380 --> 12:55.420]  million copies in the last quarter of last year oh goodness Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U
[12:55.420 --> 13:02.980]  only sold 8 million copies so half of what they sold on that game in the last quarter
[13:02.980 --> 13:09.580]  of last year the the first Mario Kart only sold 8 million copies the second Mario Kart
[13:09.580 --> 13:15.860]  sold 10 million copies the GBA version which is the third one sold 6 million copies right
[13:15.860 --> 13:21.860]  like it's just it's absolutely insane the numbers on this I can't I just I cannot get
[13:21.860 --> 13:29.980]  over how absolutely crazy it is anyway we were talking about dates Mario Kart Wii came
[13:29.980 --> 13:35.740]  out in 2008 Mario Kart 7 which was the 3DS version came out okay that's what I was thinking
[13:35.740 --> 13:43.940]  of 2011 so there was three years between Wii and 7 and Mario Kart 8 which was the Wii U
[13:43.940 --> 13:50.940]  the first version of this was on the Wii U was 2014 so between Wii and 8 that was six
[13:50.940 --> 13:56.940]  years okay and that was 2014 nine years ago so it's been nine years since my oh my goodness
[13:56.940 --> 14:02.860]  nine years okay next year will be 10 years maybe they're waiting for that 10 years maybe
[14:02.860 --> 14:07.260]  they're like intentionally pushing it back I would not be surprised I think at this point
[14:07.260 --> 14:12.060]  they're just waiting for the next console whatever that is are we look are we like looking
[14:12.060 --> 14:18.320]  at a console yeah of course like would that just be the switch pro no I mean I don't I
[14:18.320 --> 14:22.180]  think at this point they're not doing a switch pro yeah I think they've done their their
[14:22.180 --> 14:26.540]  stuff right they've done the the OLED that I think that's all they're doing I don't think
[14:26.540 --> 14:30.620]  they're doing any more than that but fine let me get them let me get the dates out again
[14:30.620 --> 14:37.260]  shall I I did these I did this before but I can't remember exactly what it was but I'm
[14:37.260 --> 14:46.380]  pretty sure that this is the like second longest between consoles Nintendo consoles now the
[14:46.380 --> 14:53.220]  it depends how you count them I'm basically counting Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, DS, 3DS
[14:53.220 --> 15:03.260]  and NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii, Wii U, Switch right so I'm counting kind of those
[15:03.260 --> 15:08.260]  gaps yeah I think the only gaps the only gaps that were bigger than the current gap are
[15:08.260 --> 15:15.340]  NES to SNES and Gameboy to Gameboy Advance okay the Wii U came out in 2017 and it was
[15:15.340 --> 15:20.260]  five years until the Switch came out the Wii came out in 2006 it was six years until the
[15:20.260 --> 15:25.460]  Wii U came out okay well there's a pattern here because the SNES the NES to the SNES
[15:25.460 --> 15:30.900]  so you just added super in front of it and Gameboy and Gameboy Advance they just added
[15:30.900 --> 15:37.100]  advance to the end of that and Wii, Wii U yeah yeah yeah I know but but what I will
[15:37.100 --> 15:41.380]  say is those ones tend to be less successful uh-huh I don't think they'll just do like
[15:41.380 --> 15:46.420]  a Switch 2 or I think well they might they might they might jump onto the branding but
[15:46.420 --> 15:51.740]  like I think Switch 2 would be better than like Switch U or something like that because
[15:51.740 --> 15:57.580]  the problem is like Wii U and Gameboy Advance they kind of sound like they don't sound like
[15:57.580 --> 16:01.980]  new consoles they sound like uh like the problem that we use people always thought it was just
[16:01.980 --> 16:07.220]  an accessory for the Wii right not a new console in and of itself so they just add super in
[16:07.220 --> 16:13.580]  front of Switch and it'll just be SN I guess no no no wow yeah yeah that's not gonna be
[16:13.580 --> 16:23.460]  great no I'm sorry did you hear that as it came out your mouth yes I did no no please
[16:23.460 --> 16:35.340]  Nintendo that feels like something Nintendo would do I know I'm scared now cuz I I feel
[16:35.340 --> 16:39.420]  like the biggest complaints I was just performance for a switch I could definitely see them working
[16:39.420 --> 16:45.580]  hard to that's really yeah there's nothing else right now like people like oh what but
[16:45.580 --> 16:48.860]  this what but that right but that's not really something that's kind of widely accepted like
[16:48.860 --> 16:52.940]  it's it's it's performance people just want it to be more performance maybe they like
[16:52.940 --> 16:57.700]  some people want 4k I don't know if we're gonna get 4k I don't really care right like
[16:57.700 --> 17:04.860]  does it really matter if Mario Kart's in 4k or 1080p yeah just want it to be more performant
[17:04.860 --> 17:11.500]  mm-hmm can you imagine scarlet and violet on a more powerful console yeah I want it
[17:11.500 --> 17:21.660]  I want it anyway um is have I talked about everything yeah that's all that's what we've
[17:21.660 --> 17:28.380]  been playing uh-huh should we talk about some news yes let's do it otherwise we're gonna
[17:28.380 --> 17:40.340]  be the Nintendo yeah Nintendo power mm-hmm so we had the playdate update last week which
[17:40.340 --> 17:44.100]  announced a number of things and one of the things that they announced was that there's
[17:44.100 --> 17:53.660]  a new update of my favorite game on the playdate bloom bloom 1.1 is out now the main thing
[17:53.660 --> 18:01.280]  is some new story and new flowers but there's a couple of other cool things for example
[18:01.280 --> 18:06.740]  they have like lo-fi beats mode so you know that you know I'm talking about the kind of
[18:06.740 --> 18:12.540]  youtube videos of the person studying with the music they basically implement and implemented
[18:12.540 --> 18:17.300]  that into the game they called it simple mode and you're just in the game and you just press
[18:17.300 --> 18:23.520]  the the button and you go to simple mode and it just plays that music or chill mode sorry
[18:23.520 --> 18:31.380]  okay I was gonna say like how how is it a mode like are you just changing the soundtrack
[18:31.380 --> 18:37.020]  to why call it a mode and so I guess it's not it takes you out of the game essentially
[18:37.020 --> 18:41.700]  and it puts you into like the screen just shows what you see in those youtube videos
[18:41.700 --> 18:45.740]  okay so the idea is that it's meant to just be like oh I'm not playing the game just now
[18:45.740 --> 18:53.740]  but I like the music you turn it on it's a music player now basically yeah okay interesting
[18:53.740 --> 19:00.340]  I I don't I feel like it's not worth that battery well the screen's not changing right
[19:00.340 --> 19:04.260]  I suppose but it's still wasting like it's a tiny little thing and you're just playing
[19:04.260 --> 19:09.740]  music well look it'll be great it'll be great once you got the stereo dock on yeah I'm very
[19:09.740 --> 19:17.300]  excited for that mm-hmm okay I want this game but I don't think it's worth buying a playdate
[19:17.300 --> 19:24.980]  for yet au contraire it is absolutely worth buying a playdate just for this game this
[19:24.980 --> 19:32.380]  game does not cost ten dollars this car this game costs ten dollars plus a playdate that's
[19:32.380 --> 19:39.460]  so if we're going by like the assumption that every dollar is worth like an hour worth of
[19:39.460 --> 19:46.520]  gameplay that's like 280 hours of gameplay I mean I don't so I don't subscribe to that
[19:46.520 --> 19:51.100]  I I strongly disagree with that theory I don't think that you should I do not think the game
[19:51.100 --> 19:55.460]  should be ranked based on how many hours they have because that's how we end up in a situation
[19:55.460 --> 20:00.660]  where games end up having pointless stuff in them yeah I completely I understand that
[20:00.660 --> 20:04.940]  like I my only argument is maybe like the sixty eighty dollar games that are like you
[20:04.940 --> 20:15.980]  know ten hours long no well I don't know like if mmm I'm on the fence like I see I see the
[20:15.980 --> 20:23.500]  point of it and at the same time I want games to be cheaper for like that level of like
[20:23.500 --> 20:28.420]  gameplay I think it depends on what you get out of the game right and I think my point
[20:28.420 --> 20:37.260]  is like personally I would rather the game was shorter and more concise and better than
[20:37.260 --> 20:42.740]  you know takes me 200 hours to get through I don't want to have to spend that long in
[20:42.740 --> 20:52.180]  a game it just it feels pointless to me it's not fun well that depends on the game like
[20:52.180 --> 20:58.760]  I can look at your Pokemon scarlet violet hours and say you know this was probably worth
[20:58.760 --> 21:05.740]  the sixty dollars that Nintendo was was was you know charging for that so it's it's not
[21:05.740 --> 21:11.380]  so much about like the length of the game maybe but maybe more so replayability even
[21:11.380 --> 21:17.380]  like it I don't I'm also really tired of 200 plus hour games I don't have enough time I'm
[21:17.380 --> 21:20.840]  not like a full-time streamer I don't have time to play these games and complete them
[21:20.840 --> 21:27.940]  the way that I would like to but if you have like a really nice short game that is fantastic
[21:27.940 --> 21:34.540]  to play again over and over like you know maybe like turnip boy means evades tax evasion
[21:34.540 --> 21:43.060]  or I haven't played this but a slow hike like those games have like a lot of replayability
[21:43.060 --> 21:48.420]  and they're done very well and I feel like they probably would be worth you know maybe
[21:48.420 --> 21:54.040]  twice as much as they're being charged for so I think I find this I find it a funny idea
[21:54.040 --> 21:59.660]  the the concept of replayability right because like every game is replayable right other
[21:59.660 --> 22:05.500]  the other than say for example detective games where once you've figured out it's not fun
[22:05.500 --> 22:14.140]  anymore right I the idea of this game is replayable like I don't surely it's just about whether
[22:14.140 --> 22:20.500]  you want to replay it or not right like I very rarely replay games so Pokemon is basically
[22:20.500 --> 22:27.140]  my exception right Pokemon is the game that I will infinitely play and I will put insane
[22:27.140 --> 22:40.300]  amounts of hours into right like that is my exception and possibly no so I think so no
[22:40.300 --> 22:44.640]  I keep going back to Mario Kart to finish the new stuff because I enjoyed completing
[22:44.640 --> 22:49.420]  the new stuff but I don't go and play Mario Kart if I've or if there's nothing that I've
[22:49.420 --> 22:55.900]  not completed so I would the only time other times I would play Mario Kart is when I'm
[22:55.900 --> 23:00.980]  a gathering of people and we want to play something right so party games are different
[23:00.980 --> 23:05.300]  yes right we I don't think we can compare party games and single-player game I don't
[23:05.300 --> 23:10.620]  think that makes any sense well I mean it has that level we play like like if you just
[23:10.620 --> 23:14.780]  depending on how you define replayability like even if it is only a party game you are
[23:14.780 --> 23:21.620]  playing it again like replaying it sure but like that's the point uh-huh I feel like we're
[23:21.620 --> 23:28.500]  just hard we're just arguing semantics now I know yeah we are I don't know where I dove
[23:28.500 --> 23:34.580]  into this hole and I want how to get out of it I want game stories to be shorter I and
[23:34.580 --> 23:38.780]  that's all I was saying okay I don't know how we got to that point well because because
[23:38.780 --> 23:44.540]  you're saying the play date is worth it's worth buying just for bloom and I don't want
[23:44.540 --> 23:53.740]  to drop to this one game obviously obviously I'm joking uh-huh right bloom is a fantastic
[23:53.740 --> 23:58.660]  game and I think that if you can afford a play date mm-hmm and you have that sort of
[23:58.660 --> 24:03.260]  money to just drop on something like that which I understand most people do not then
[24:03.260 --> 24:07.460]  it's worth it okay if you don't have that sort of money then it's absolutely not worth
[24:07.460 --> 24:16.340]  it okay all right I'm happy with this yeah I am very much enjoying it the all the other
[24:16.340 --> 24:21.620]  fun it's like they've got lots of other other random little things like in your phone you
[24:21.620 --> 24:27.940]  have you can now change the background you and there's like loads of little cute pictures
[24:27.940 --> 24:33.300]  of like the two the main character and her girlfriend like and you just like rotate it's
[24:33.300 --> 24:38.940]  so cute who do you have as what is your current background then I mean it's just it's one
[24:38.940 --> 24:43.100]  of those pictures of it's okay I think there's some other I think there's like some flower
[24:43.100 --> 24:47.940]  ones as well but I just find one that I liked I will leave a screenshot in the show notes
[24:47.940 --> 24:53.380]  for people beautiful of the background that I chose that I thought was particularly cute
[24:53.380 --> 25:04.540]  to have all right go play bloom ooblets 1.1 localization update is out now so if you if
[25:04.540 --> 25:08.900]  you speak French German or Spanish and you don't speak English you're not listening to
[25:08.900 --> 25:15.900]  this podcast unless you're bilingual sure if you would if you're bilingual and you would
[25:15.900 --> 25:21.780]  prefer to play the game in your native language go do it now or if maybe you're like me and
[25:21.780 --> 25:27.100]  you want to practice a second language go play this game now his game is really the
[25:27.100 --> 25:34.020]  best way to do that like that feels yes no like I've struggled in the past with Pokemon
[25:34.020 --> 25:38.080]  so I've I've learned I can't do that with a new game I should at least play it once
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.700]  before before trying to play in Spanish but I've spent a lot of hours in ooblets and it
[25:44.700 --> 25:49.380]  would be very interesting to see how they translated all their like quirky little sayings
[25:49.380 --> 25:59.900]  into Spanish so now I'm very intrigued the the update did cause a big bug that basically
[25:59.900 --> 26:05.100]  meant the game crashed anytime you tried to open it but that's fixed so that's all good
[26:05.100 --> 26:09.540]  I am really intrigued as to how like that because it sounds like it happened for most
[26:09.540 --> 26:15.700]  people so there's obviously something that they forgot to test that basically happened
[26:15.700 --> 26:22.180]  for everybody I am fascinated as to how that happened but anyway I don't know whether we'll
[26:22.180 --> 26:27.940]  ever know I guess not unless they talk about it in one of their news they have been reasonably
[26:27.940 --> 26:33.740]  open about things so who knows at verdant village I've not talked about this a huge
[26:33.740 --> 26:40.160]  man on the podcast but it's a game that's in early access they're rewriting it in a
[26:40.160 --> 26:45.280]  different game engine so realistically there's going to be almost no updates for the next
[26:45.280 --> 26:52.560]  like year or two probably they don't have a time frame they said that they won't update
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.960]  until it's got close to feature parity of what they currently have and I don't know
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.780]  about the two engines whether there's it's easy to put things between them my like gripe
[27:03.780 --> 27:17.540]  about this update is that they have a tldr but it's in the middle it's also like it's
[27:17.540 --> 27:23.540]  not really a tldr it's tldr for some of it yeah for the tldr game is made in construct
[27:23.540 --> 27:28.900]  3 construct 3 has many issues in my opinion that cause weird bugs and other issues uh-huh
[27:28.900 --> 27:33.120]  okay but you're missing the big part which is we're going to rewrite and not construct
[27:33.120 --> 27:41.660]  3 yeah yeah oh yeah it's it's a little a little bizarre but you know it's fine it's fine um
[27:41.660 --> 27:46.660]  I you know it's a lot of information in there so I you know I generally appreciate when
[27:46.660 --> 27:52.660]  devs are more you know forthcoming than not um so I mean you don't have to read it if
[27:52.660 --> 27:59.980]  you don't want to so it's fine and we have a couple new games um so the first one is
[27:59.980 --> 28:07.180]  before the green moon a science fiction farming simulator game set in a small community at
[28:07.180 --> 28:12.620]  the base of a space elevator during the days and seasons leading up to your departure for
[28:12.620 --> 28:19.780]  the moon this one looks I don't know like I like the landscape style but I don't think
[28:19.780 --> 28:31.340]  I like the like character styles I yeah so I don't like to be too harsh on indie games
[28:31.340 --> 28:37.260]  uh-huh but I'm not a huge fan of any of these graphics mm-hmm there is like a green like
[28:37.260 --> 28:45.100]  overall like vibe to this and I guess I like that it's on brand with green boom I guess
[28:45.100 --> 28:51.220]  yeah the green moon is it's I mean this is very definitely not on earth like the moon
[28:51.220 --> 29:00.060]  I mean it looks like a brain right it's like wrinkly and all very interesting um I don't
[29:00.060 --> 29:06.780]  yeah I oh just everything about these everything about this graph these graphics just makes
[29:06.780 --> 29:14.780]  me feel uncomfortable it feels very like gamecube like graphics I feel like yeah oh that's what
[29:14.780 --> 29:18.900]  they're doing isn't it yeah I've talked about this on the podcast before but we don't need
[29:18.900 --> 29:26.540]  nostalgia for every everything right we don't need nostalgia for the bad 3d graphics of
[29:26.540 --> 29:32.420]  the early 2000s we just don't need it don't bring us back there mm-hmm I will say at the
[29:32.420 --> 29:37.180]  like comparing this to like verdant village at the very least this looks like a completely
[29:37.180 --> 29:44.260]  new like concept from I think what I've seen where I spurred it village like I open it
[29:44.260 --> 29:51.260]  up and I thought it was stardew so I will even though we're not like huge fans of this
[29:51.260 --> 29:55.860]  style I will say at least they're not they're trying something different and not just what
[29:55.860 --> 30:01.500]  creating what looks different to you other than just the back story well I mean just
[30:01.500 --> 30:06.940]  like the the overall style of it like none of these buildings look like anything I've
[30:06.940 --> 30:12.180]  seen before although I haven't like played many yeah even this like landscape shop like
[30:12.180 --> 30:17.220]  the trees like it looks like a completely new world okay yeah no that's fair because
[30:17.220 --> 30:22.860]  like um just like concept wise and gameplay wise it looks very similar to most farming
[30:22.860 --> 30:28.420]  games the only thing I can really see is that it says they've got wet and dry seasons which
[30:28.420 --> 30:33.500]  would be slightly different from the four standard seasons that we get which I actually
[30:33.500 --> 30:39.140]  might like to play with because I spent some time like sitting abroad in a place that had
[30:39.140 --> 30:44.420]  wet and dry seasons and I think the place I grew up in like in Florida South Florida
[30:44.420 --> 30:52.220]  was mostly wet and dry seasons because there was just no winter so I I like that I'll take
[30:52.220 --> 30:57.900]  it yeah whereas I mean it's an interesting concept to me the idea of a wet and dry season
[30:57.900 --> 31:04.420]  because like in Scotland we have the the wet warm season the wet cold season and the kind
[31:04.420 --> 31:16.540]  of the other wet seasons uh-huh um the other new game is season a letter to the future
[31:16.540 --> 31:27.500]  this looks beautiful yes so I will say that is true I will say the name is terrible yes
[31:27.500 --> 31:35.700]  I I was very confused by a letter to the future like what but what what does that mean is
[31:35.700 --> 31:40.260]  it gonna be time travel uh well that's that's what you're that's what you're intrigued by
[31:40.260 --> 31:46.860]  right that's what gets you into the I suppose is it though like a question shouldn't be
[31:46.860 --> 31:53.220]  a hug I think it's a I think it's a time capsule thing rather than a time travel thing you
[31:53.220 --> 31:59.380]  are collecting memory so maybe they are going towards that but they could have just said
[31:59.380 --> 32:05.220]  time capsules I don't know well the time capsule is a letter to the future right it is but
[32:05.220 --> 32:12.540]  that and what we do now of the point sure and what we do now that is a letter to the
[32:12.540 --> 32:18.180]  future I think it's met I think it's a metaphor for okay okay and how we can affect the future
[32:18.180 --> 32:22.980]  generations by what we do now okay so maybe just call it a letter to the future don't
[32:22.980 --> 32:29.300]  put season in front of eggs yeah I don't know I don't know why they've done that and seasons
[32:29.300 --> 32:37.300]  all caps like that's another choice that I don't understand in a different font this
[32:37.300 --> 32:44.660]  appears to be on PlayStation and steam and epic I haven't actually looked too much into
[32:44.660 --> 32:50.980]  this mm-hmm I meant to do that I mean I I love the introduction to the characters in
[32:50.980 --> 32:55.940]  this small like video of them where they're just showing like candid shots of each of
[32:55.940 --> 33:03.420]  them just staring at the camera hmm I don't know so it feels it feels very cinematic leave
[33:03.420 --> 33:08.020]  home for the first time to collect memories before a mysterious cataclysm washes everything
[33:08.020 --> 33:13.480]  away ride record meet people and unravel the strange world around you immerse yourself
[33:13.480 --> 33:20.300]  in the world of season a third-person meditative exploration game another word for cottage
[33:20.300 --> 33:27.060]  core I guess meditative I mean I mean our new name there is definitely no farming in
[33:27.060 --> 33:30.380]  this while they say that they don't say anything about farming but it definitely feels cottage
[33:30.380 --> 33:37.980]  core to me it does it looks yeah yeah the whole vibe feels very like you're trying well
[33:37.980 --> 33:42.060]  I mean you're exploring so you're not necessarily like building a cottage core life but yeah
[33:42.060 --> 33:48.380]  the graphics are very breath of the wildest mm-hmm but I mean it's done fine I don't it's
[33:48.380 --> 33:53.300]  quite nice looking I like the shot of like the keepsakes to like the just the way that
[33:53.300 --> 34:04.260]  they've portrayed a collage or scrapbook it's very very neat yeah definitely mm-hmm all
[34:04.260 --> 34:09.060]  right so that I that's out now I don't know if I said that and before the green moon is
[34:09.060 --> 34:15.940]  coming out this year something okay all right so that's the news we are going to talk about
[34:15.940 --> 34:22.820]  cult of the lamb so as I mentioned before we have done an episode on cult of the lamb
[34:22.820 --> 34:29.220]  already mm-hmm Kevin and Kelly did that last year sometime maybe November something like
[34:29.220 --> 34:38.220]  that sounds about right but as always happens other people had opinions on the game and
[34:38.220 --> 34:44.980]  Bev has played it and I have played it and people were very surprised on the game of
[34:44.980 --> 34:50.300]  the year episode that this was one of my top games of the year mm-hmm and I think that's
[34:50.300 --> 34:59.460]  probably because it is a roguelite game mm-hmm so let me just address this because I think
[34:59.460 --> 35:04.600]  some people may have been put off the game by being called a roguelite uh-huh and I understand
[35:04.600 --> 35:12.220]  I hate roguelikes I'm not a fan of roguelites to me roguelites are like roguelikes but less
[35:12.220 --> 35:21.580]  bad right like they still have some of the annoyances of a roguelike but less of it because
[35:21.580 --> 35:25.220]  you don't lose everything all the time mm-hmm because you get to keep some of the stuff
[35:25.220 --> 35:28.700]  you don't lose everything it's not like you just play it and then at the end you have
[35:28.700 --> 35:33.420]  if you die you have to restart mm-hmm so I'm not a huge fan of them even the roguelites
[35:33.420 --> 35:38.620]  because I I just I find that even though you're like building stuff up around like between
[35:38.620 --> 35:44.700]  the runs I still feel like it's not satisfying to go oh sorry you have to go back even if
[35:44.700 --> 35:48.940]  you're more powerful and you have more weapons and that sort of stuff I still I'm like I
[35:48.940 --> 35:53.140]  want I want somewhere in it I want to restart somewhere in it right I don't want to have
[35:53.140 --> 35:57.660]  to go all the way back to the beginning and that's what annoys me mm-hmm but let me tell
[35:57.660 --> 36:04.300]  you cult of the lamp has done it really well it has so mm-hmm your base is always fine
[36:04.300 --> 36:08.860]  right like you never like your base is never reset right there's no risk of that your your
[36:08.860 --> 36:14.620]  village your villagers they're all fine you can lose stuff but not like through the village
[36:14.620 --> 36:19.100]  there's risk in the village but it's not like it's not like you die in a run and therefore
[36:19.100 --> 36:23.300]  half of your village disappear that's not a thing that happens yeah you can lose things
[36:23.300 --> 36:28.460]  in the village but it's through you not dealing with things properly that's that's how you
[36:28.460 --> 36:36.500]  can lose things and how it happens is so you go out from your village to do one of the
[36:36.500 --> 36:39.720]  the runs which is basically you go through a bunch of dungeon you go through a bunch
[36:39.720 --> 36:46.580]  of dungeon areas to get stuff and you know sometimes to like get new followers sometimes
[36:46.580 --> 36:52.800]  to do certain things for the demon blah blah blah blah blah and if you die during that
[36:52.800 --> 36:59.700]  run you then lose some of the stuff that you got on that run and that's all you really
[36:59.700 --> 37:05.380]  lose when you die yep and so i'm fine with that like that that to me makes sense right
[37:05.380 --> 37:10.700]  because you're going out into the wilderness to dangerous place and you're doing stuff
[37:10.700 --> 37:14.300]  and if you die and you're brought back to life you don't get to keep everything that
[37:14.300 --> 37:20.300]  you were getting in that thing but you don't then lose other stuff and it's not like there's
[37:20.300 --> 37:23.560]  also like once once you've done that one it's like you don't really care about the runs
[37:23.560 --> 37:27.180]  it's not like here's a level and you've got tight 10 levels and you have to get through
[37:27.180 --> 37:32.820]  all 10 10 levels it's like different random orientations of dungeons put together and
[37:32.820 --> 37:37.660]  different things that can happen through it like it's so much better than any roguelike
[37:37.660 --> 37:43.340]  or roguelite yes i have played i feel like i'm gonna go on a limb here and say this game
[37:43.340 --> 37:52.860]  is not a rogue light it is a stardew level-esque type of game because you have like your base
[37:52.860 --> 37:59.900]  that you're you know contributing continuing to upgrade and upkeep and you know you have
[37:59.900 --> 38:04.860]  other places to explore within this world but then you go into the mines or the dungeons
[38:04.860 --> 38:09.020]  in this case for additional resources that you can't get anywhere else other than the
[38:09.020 --> 38:14.700]  mines maybe this is why you like this yeah i mean possibly like i don't i don't really
[38:14.700 --> 38:19.940]  want to get into the the genre discussion right but no i don't generally calls this
[38:19.940 --> 38:27.460]  a roguelite um yes and and and i would agree that like it's not like other roguelites but
[38:27.460 --> 38:34.340]  like i mean what are even what even are genres i think my point is like don't get put off
[38:34.340 --> 38:40.740]  by people calling this a roguelite if you don't like roguelikes and road lights it is
[38:40.740 --> 38:49.180]  it is not like that no yes exactly so and the loss that you get makes perfect sense
[38:49.180 --> 38:54.780]  and i'm completely fine with that like i've funnily enough i like ironically enough this
[38:54.780 --> 39:01.620]  podcast was the one that introduced me to roguelites via atomic grabs oh that is an
[39:01.620 --> 39:05.760]  example of one that i absolutely hate right because it's like sure you're building like
[39:05.760 --> 39:12.060]  stuff up between your runs but like the idea that i'm gonna die and then i lose my farm
[39:12.060 --> 39:17.540]  is just so incredibly frustrating to me that i hated it so much we did that together didn't
[39:17.540 --> 39:26.820]  we yes we did i hated that game with an absolute passion uh-huh i so like i enjoyed it but
[39:26.820 --> 39:31.220]  i what i feel like that game could have done better it was having that base like that place
[39:31.220 --> 39:38.060]  you come to between runs where you pick your character whatever having that be more interactive
[39:38.060 --> 39:43.620]  and that's really where like where cult of the lamb excels is having the capability of
[39:43.620 --> 39:48.420]  saying i don't feel like doing a roguelite right now i that's gonna stress me out i just
[39:48.420 --> 39:55.660]  want to farm and take care of my villagers and have fun that way which is great i think
[39:55.660 --> 40:01.260]  and i feel like most of the mechanics in this game are just really nice and like not stressful
[40:01.260 --> 40:07.860]  or like even the fishing one is fine like it's actually enjoyable to to do fishing so
[40:07.860 --> 40:12.060]  i just feel like a lot of these components like every small little component in this
[40:12.060 --> 40:18.540]  game they just did so well um yeah so you were you were comparing it to stardew and
[40:18.540 --> 40:25.300]  i think that's fair um in terms of that combat i will say the combat in this game so much
[40:25.300 --> 40:31.900]  better than stardew yes so much better like the stardew one isn't bad but it's not good
[40:31.900 --> 40:39.120]  it's fine um but you don't really feel like you have a huge like it's basically like hit
[40:39.120 --> 40:46.180]  the button at the right time right like there's not any real strategy to it um sure there
[40:46.180 --> 40:50.300]  are different weapons and stuff like that but it's not amazing whereas this i think
[40:50.300 --> 40:55.280]  is like a legitimately good combat and i'm very picky on combat there are very few games
[40:55.280 --> 41:02.380]  that i actively like the combat in this is definitely one of them and i at least for
[41:02.380 --> 41:06.780]  in terms of combat i tend to prefer like the really fast like like melee weapons because
[41:06.780 --> 41:12.940]  i'm just spamming buttons and not really like paying attention to the combat but yeah for
[41:12.940 --> 41:17.060]  like the first time ever i've enjoyed playing a hammer or an axe something that's heavy
[41:17.060 --> 41:23.300]  to swing because it just feels i don't know it's so easy it just feels like it just flows
[41:23.300 --> 41:28.820]  so naturally to be using any weapon in this game um so i definitely agree that it's just
[41:28.820 --> 41:36.060]  fantastic um and now i'm wondering why it wasn't on the top like three of my game of
[41:36.060 --> 41:42.660]  the year and i don't remember where it was a couple months ago um but it was just so
[41:42.660 --> 41:49.060]  good i love it and yeah and it's just so silly too i think that's the thing like it just
[41:49.060 --> 41:57.100]  it takes such a ridiculous concept and makes it ridiculous it's not serious at all oh absolutely
[41:57.100 --> 42:04.220]  yeah and and this is the thing in like i love i love ridiculousness um but it's like ridiculousness
[42:04.220 --> 42:13.820]  in a very cute way like like it just the con the idea of like the cutest lamb right in
[42:13.820 --> 42:20.300]  the world right like it's so well designed like and then it is like standing at the front
[42:20.300 --> 42:25.020]  of like uh a church like brainwashing people
[42:25.020 --> 42:37.580]  yeah or yeah exactly like i just i cannot i cannot elaborate too enough on how ridiculous
[42:37.580 --> 42:44.060]  that is just that everything about it is so ridiculous um the character design is really
[42:44.060 --> 42:51.740]  good they're all pretty simple but they're all really good um the i also like how obviously
[42:51.740 --> 42:55.660]  i mean this is my dream game right because there's automation everywhere right like you
[42:55.660 --> 43:00.860]  you you can do all the automation right from the start because you can you can basically
[43:00.860 --> 43:04.900]  i mean it takes a little bit yeah you have to go through some tutorials to unlock everything
[43:04.900 --> 43:09.740]  but basically from very early on in the game you can get your villagers to do things for
[43:09.740 --> 43:13.420]  you yeah and you don't have to do them and that's that's perfect for me i love it's great
[43:13.420 --> 43:25.540]  you just want to i want to be a cult leader um we got an episode title um and and but
[43:25.540 --> 43:29.980]  it's not like oh then you know you never get any more automation because obviously the
[43:29.980 --> 43:34.020]  more villagers you get the more you can do so you still have to do some things for yourself
[43:34.020 --> 43:37.300]  at the beginning right it's not like oh i'm never going to do any farming no you you'll
[43:37.300 --> 43:41.180]  have to do some farming because well first of all you don't start with very many villagers
[43:41.180 --> 43:45.060]  obviously you start with one right that's how a cult works well actually i don't know
[43:45.060 --> 43:50.820]  i've never been in a cult is it how a cult works i don't know you have to start somewhere
[43:50.820 --> 43:56.220]  you do you do but also like would you ever be the first person to join a cult i mean
[43:56.220 --> 44:03.780]  but i think you do that how would that work i feel like you don't know it's a cult yet
[44:03.780 --> 44:11.060]  if you're the first i don't know i don't know that it is yet this is a pretty obvious cult
[44:11.060 --> 44:17.180]  right like this is not a subtle cult this is yes but this is also very extreme on the
[44:17.180 --> 44:23.740]  very extreme ends of things like you don't sell it like just murdering and like sacrificing
[44:23.740 --> 44:33.860]  people or giving them poop to feed i find cults fascinating and i just like the idea
[44:33.860 --> 44:37.940]  of like how did they start is fascinating because like most of the stuff you find out
[44:37.940 --> 44:42.660]  about cults are how they end which are almost always tragic or how they are in the middle
[44:42.660 --> 44:48.420]  which is again almost always just so tragic and you know people are taken advantage of
[44:48.420 --> 44:53.360]  and abused in so many different ways yeah i just fascinated as to how they start like
[44:53.360 --> 44:58.980]  how do i just like i guess i could see one example of like where one cult will start
[44:58.980 --> 45:05.260]  with like a group of people because they witness something miraculous maybe yeah um like thinking
[45:05.260 --> 45:09.740]  like we've we've been watching we watching game of thrones lately so you know watching
[45:09.740 --> 45:14.980]  denarius target and walk out of the fire might be the start of the cult where they're just
[45:14.980 --> 45:21.700]  worshiper as a fire god or something yeah sure and i guess there's other other cases
[45:21.700 --> 45:32.340]  like the you know the spoilers for the last of us um the the the cult oh yeah um the seraphites
[45:32.340 --> 45:36.540]  i don't know that's what they're called seraphites is that what they're called i don't know if
[45:36.540 --> 45:40.980]  they actually said that in the tv show or not not well i don't think they've gone that
[45:40.980 --> 45:45.220]  far like we're only in part one in this tv show okay well there's there's definitely
[45:45.220 --> 45:51.660]  a cult in the first we've had a cult in the atv show with the that was the last episode
[45:51.660 --> 45:56.220]  okay but that wasn't the seraphites like that's a completely different group i don't see it
[45:56.220 --> 46:02.820]  was them i didn't say it was them you're the one that said it was them i did okay i said
[46:02.820 --> 46:09.580]  the cult the cult well that's assuming like that there's only one cult in the last okay
[46:09.580 --> 46:15.640]  i haven't played the game i'm watching the tv show all i'm saying is we just had an episode
[46:15.640 --> 46:21.080]  with a cult okay right this is my point yes um and i can see how that happened because
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.420]  obviously it was the end of the world and they were looking for someone to save them
[46:24.420 --> 46:32.700]  right like but like these examples are not really normal no but cults still happen all
[46:32.700 --> 46:36.780]  the time yes and i'm just fascinated just how that they start out like i can see how
[46:36.780 --> 46:40.220]  someone could be convinced because there's this massive group that all believe something
[46:40.220 --> 46:46.860]  and they convince you in but like oh yeah there's one dude one dude is trying to convince
[46:46.860 --> 46:52.860]  you to come live in his commune with you like i don't know that sounds a little bit sketchy
[46:52.860 --> 46:58.860]  like well i feel like a commune am i thinking you don't start off with a commune is that
[46:58.860 --> 47:04.860]  what you're saying yeah yeah i feel like communes are fine like i've i've had past roommates
[47:04.860 --> 47:09.100]  who've lived in communes and they've oh sure sure i'm not saying the concept of a commune
[47:09.100 --> 47:14.300]  is creepy but i'm saying like it's when it's when someone's like trying to convince you
[47:14.300 --> 47:20.700]  oh yeah we're just worshiping or like revolving around exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah i think
[47:20.700 --> 47:27.540]  i think that these alternate ways of of doing society and cult communities is good but yeah
[47:27.540 --> 47:32.740]  that there are red flags and when there's a commune of one person that's a red flag
[47:32.740 --> 47:38.820]  yes but then maybe maybe with cults maybe with cults the commune comes end game maybe
[47:38.820 --> 47:42.300]  that's not early maybe that's part of the problem point why are we talking about cults
[47:42.300 --> 47:48.580]  so much oh yeah we're talking about cult of alarm this is a bizarre episode i mean another
[47:48.580 --> 47:58.100]  way to start a call is to die and then have like the one who waits sure sure i mean i'm
[47:58.100 --> 48:02.420]  going to be honest if someone raises me from the dead probably going to do whatever they
[48:02.420 --> 48:07.500]  say yeah i don't think in some cases you don't have a choice that's true that's true like
[48:07.500 --> 48:16.600]  yeah um in uh daredevil with the hand raising electro i mean electro was brainwashed then
[48:16.600 --> 48:22.700]  you know basically had no choice i'm also thinking of carnival row where they do something
[48:22.700 --> 48:32.980]  similar but it's like like creepy more zombie like i think more zombie like um what was
[48:32.980 --> 48:39.860]  my point that it's just fantastic well no it is i mean yes no cults are not fantastic
[48:39.860 --> 48:45.300]  no the game is fantastic the game is yes i feel like like i'm sure it would be just as
[48:45.300 --> 48:50.140]  good if they did take themselves seriously but i don't i don't think it would have been
[48:50.140 --> 48:57.740]  as popular maybe if they weren't just so outrageously ridiculous yeah i don't i don't know if it
[48:57.740 --> 49:02.460]  would have been as good yeah like i think it depends how you do it like if you're if
[49:02.460 --> 49:09.980]  you're doing the whole right we're take would be we're taking it seriously but like in a
[49:09.980 --> 49:16.220]  like this is the joke kind of way but like we we never give up on that like no no i'm
[49:16.220 --> 49:21.020]  100 serious but like really they're not but they're they're selling the fact that they're
[49:21.020 --> 49:25.340]  serious like that could be funny yeah but if it was like oh this is this is meant to
[49:25.340 --> 49:29.860]  be serious wink wink nudge nudge then i think it becomes not yeah right it just then becomes
[49:29.860 --> 49:36.620]  a bit kind of like sad yeah and it would also be very weird if they were trying to be serious
[49:36.620 --> 49:44.580]  and it was very cutesy at the same time i mean let's i think we can all agree the ridiculousness
[49:44.580 --> 49:49.420]  cutesy version of it is the best version yes yes so they they made some good calls with
[49:49.420 --> 49:56.980]  it and i love that they're continuing to update it um yeah like they had was it that new oh
[49:56.980 --> 50:03.780]  goodness i saw their like update this past week i think where they had like a new um
[50:03.780 --> 50:10.460]  a new housing type where multiple people could live in in one interesting uh it hasn't been
[50:10.460 --> 50:15.780]  updated yet it looks like this oh this came out february 23rd um so maybe not that new
[50:15.780 --> 50:20.260]  oh that's pretty that's pretty new that's like two weeks ago is it i don't know time's
[50:20.260 --> 50:28.340]  weird it feels like yeah literally literally two literally two weeks ago was the 25th of
[50:28.340 --> 50:36.020]  february um so i i i just that just reminded me of like i think there's so much about this
[50:36.020 --> 50:39.500]  game where you're just like i love how ridiculous that is and i know we've talked about this
[50:39.500 --> 50:43.380]  but like i just you were reminded because of the the housing i love how you start off
[50:43.380 --> 50:48.420]  this game and like they just sleep on the floor and they're like i'd really like something
[50:48.420 --> 50:55.620]  better than sleeping on the floor and you're like okay have a have a sleeping bag and they're
[50:55.620 --> 51:00.420]  like oh thank you so much i'm so glad you gave me a sleeping bag and then like the next
[51:00.420 --> 51:06.940]  thing you do is you build your like church building and see they built this ridiculously
[51:06.940 --> 51:13.820]  large ornate church building and they're still sleeping outside and sleeping bags the weather
[51:13.820 --> 51:22.180]  must just be very good there because they just don't care it's just it's it's very funny
[51:22.180 --> 51:28.500]  uh-huh i like even then like their best upgrade like this upgrade comes with i think housing
[51:28.500 --> 51:34.540]  that can be shared that won't like disintegrate over time but they still have roommates like
[51:34.540 --> 51:40.020]  this is not that great i was saying it's great for the cult leader but not great for the
[51:40.020 --> 51:44.340]  followers yeah i i don't need to i don't need to keep fixing up your housing yeah
[51:44.340 --> 51:52.740]  oh they're also coming up with a perfect landlord housing a kitchen so someone can cook for
[51:52.740 --> 51:59.320]  you as well nice uh-huh so even more automation to come it looks like i love it i love it
[51:59.320 --> 52:06.540]  more automation give me more have you got a lot of decorating in this game of course
[52:06.540 --> 52:13.020]  i haven't come on babe well come on babe how long have we known each other i know but there's
[52:13.020 --> 52:17.700]  some but there's some things in here that have actual purpose even though they're more
[52:17.700 --> 52:28.260]  decorative than anything really yeah oh they also have organized farming coming so you
[52:28.260 --> 52:34.260]  could put like little signs next to your pots and the villagers will put only like specific
[52:34.260 --> 52:40.220]  seeds there which sounds amazing nice huh even more automation uh-huh well that's not
[52:40.220 --> 52:44.780]  it's not automated it's not but it's like organization it allows you to organize the
[52:44.780 --> 52:51.940]  automation because they already plan things automatically is there anything you don't
[52:51.940 --> 53:01.140]  like about the game i i feel like there aren't a lot of them and i personally didn't experience
[53:01.140 --> 53:07.740]  a lot of like issues or glitches with the game but i have noticed i i have it on steam
[53:07.740 --> 53:12.500]  um okay yeah mostly playing on steam death i think i think most of the bugs have been
[53:12.500 --> 53:20.480]  on switch i did notice one today though where i had a dissenting follower and i successfully
[53:20.480 --> 53:31.220]  re-educated him as as we do um and his eyes didn't change it was still like red and angry
[53:31.220 --> 53:35.700]  so i was very confused like are you actually dissenting or are you not so i put him back
[53:35.700 --> 53:41.300]  in prison and he's like i i'm not dissenting but he still had the eye so i don't know it
[53:41.300 --> 53:47.200]  was weird but it went away after a while um so that was an interesting like bug he just
[53:47.200 --> 53:53.320]  had some irritated eyes uh-huh uh-huh what are some things you don't like about this
[53:53.320 --> 53:57.420]  game al that's a good question and i probably should have thought about that because i answered
[53:57.420 --> 54:03.380]  asked the question initially um i mean a lot of the things that i mean most of the things
[54:03.380 --> 54:08.420]  that i'm not a huge fan of the game are like small things and are mostly things that they're
[54:08.420 --> 54:14.180]  fixing right so like as you say like the cooking like the fact that you had to manually do
[54:14.180 --> 54:18.180]  the cooking all the time was just a bit annoying it's like you can you can automate almost
[54:18.180 --> 54:23.300]  everything but you still have to go in and manually cook um and so being able to to get
[54:23.300 --> 54:27.460]  a villager to do that it just makes sense right it's just a continuation of that system
[54:27.460 --> 54:33.220]  that they built which i like um i don't think as i don't think there's anything huge i think
[54:33.220 --> 54:38.220]  the thing is right like if you if there was anything huge it would be the concept of the
[54:38.220 --> 54:42.080]  game yeah but i like the concept of the game and as we've discussed i like the combat i
[54:42.080 --> 54:46.480]  like the farming i like the the i like how the runs work i think it's actually really
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.060]  clever i actually think it's better than stardew in that aspect of things because you were
[54:51.060 --> 54:54.020]  like oh it's kind of like stardew where if you go into the mine you can then lose yeah
[54:54.020 --> 55:01.300]  sure but in this game you can only lose what you get on the run yes where's stardew if
[55:01.300 --> 55:05.460]  you forget that you've got something in your pocket and you go with it you could lose that
[55:05.460 --> 55:10.020]  well technically that's all you have gold what do you mean i mean it's in your pocket
[55:10.020 --> 55:15.220]  so you have it you have the capability of taking them out of your pockets sure sure
[55:15.220 --> 55:21.300]  but like in this game you don't really you don't you have that stuff you don't have pockets
[55:21.300 --> 55:27.060]  to go in in in the dungeons with exactly so so you can't accidentally take something in
[55:27.060 --> 55:30.460]  and lose it uh-huh that's my point uh-huh you're only losing what you're gaining which
[55:30.460 --> 55:36.940]  makes which is better yes for sure and uh okay i two things that i want to say before
[55:36.940 --> 55:45.440]  i forget um i love that the dungeon crawls are so short like at longest i think it was
[55:45.440 --> 55:51.660]  45 minutes and that was maybe when i was doing like like i've already beaten the one one
[55:51.660 --> 55:59.860]  of the four and continued on um yeah so it it's so refreshing after playing hades because
[55:59.860 --> 56:07.100]  i love hades but it takes like an hour and a half to do a full run and it's a stretch
[56:07.100 --> 56:17.500]  um and uh i did just think of one thing that i do not like uh in fact and that is that
[56:17.500 --> 56:24.460]  my cult goes like haywire when i'm on my runs i come back and everything is like on fire
[56:24.460 --> 56:31.880]  not not not actually on fire but you know my loyalty or what is it um is it loyalty
[56:31.880 --> 56:39.660]  yes my my loyalty is like zero and everyone's starving and getting sick everywhere i'm like
[56:39.660 --> 56:45.500]  can you just please take care of yourself for like two days so they are very dumb they
[56:45.500 --> 56:51.140]  really are very dumb um and i know like some late game stuff or you know some upgrades
[56:51.140 --> 56:59.020]  help with that but it it feels like more frustrating i guess to do because it makes me not want
[56:59.020 --> 57:03.980]  to go out and collect stuff and do the dungeons and um move forward with the plot or you know
[57:03.980 --> 57:08.340]  the story because i want to come back and everything's on fire like i know i can put
[57:08.340 --> 57:13.180]  out the fire very quickly but it's still slightly annoying to have to do that every time yeah
[57:13.180 --> 57:18.400]  yeah yeah yeah yeah that's fair um they are it would be nice if you could like maybe even
[57:18.400 --> 57:23.560]  if you had to work towards that like say you you had to like you had to build a school
[57:23.560 --> 57:29.620]  or something or like some way to like make it education in some way that would be different
[57:29.620 --> 57:36.700]  um yeah and i think they've tried to address some of this like i have i just built a janitor
[57:36.700 --> 57:45.620]  like place um but i don't really have seen anyone working it i'm still going around cleaning
[57:45.620 --> 57:50.160]  it up so i'm hoping i i don't know maybe i just haven't figured it out yet or i haven't
[57:50.160 --> 57:55.860]  assigned someone yet um when i should be able to assign them like when there's actually
[57:55.860 --> 58:02.780]  something on the ground that needs to be cleaned up um yeah so yeah ooh what is your cult name
[58:02.780 --> 58:12.020]  oh it's never like i am bad have we not talked about naming things before bev i'm bad at
[58:12.020 --> 58:20.260]  naming things i'm also bad um so i have a name that i name every single farm and every
[58:20.260 --> 58:25.920]  single anything that is like the place that i'm playing um it's the same name as the name
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.100]  of my house so i'm not really going to share it okay um but yeah it's just it's just my
[58:30.100 --> 58:35.360]  standard name that i use for everything i also struggle with this um like literally
[58:35.360 --> 58:39.700]  the past like two weeks while i've been playing stardew every time i got a new chicken or
[58:39.700 --> 58:45.140]  animal i asked my partner for names like i can't i can't name it and i know they come
[58:45.140 --> 58:49.940]  with their own names but it still feels like i have to name them um but i named oh no i
[58:49.940 --> 58:54.060]  just go i i always give them the same the name they came with like oh yeah if i get
[58:54.060 --> 58:57.580]  the option not to name them i am not naming them i have not named them here because it
[58:57.580 --> 59:03.620]  feels like they like they die too quickly for me to care about them well i think this
[59:03.620 --> 59:07.520]  one has a like a random button as well that you can choose like yeah which is fun which
[59:07.520 --> 59:11.280]  i loved in stardew and i love in this it's great everything that makes you name something
[59:11.280 --> 59:16.180]  should have a random button i do love that yeah sorry continue your cult name it's cult
[59:16.180 --> 59:27.300]  of the bevatron oh dear um so i am quite proud of that um name i think it's fun i don't i
[59:27.300 --> 59:34.040]  don't know what to say bevatron is a real thing did you know i i did not hold on let
[59:34.040 --> 59:40.580]  me go there's there's a wiki page on a bevatron it's a particle accelerator yes it is so it's
[59:40.580 --> 59:53.020]  like my i i'm i'm adopting it specifically a weak focusing proton synchro and ta on six
[59:53.020 --> 01:00:04.940]  proton synchro synchro time secret on that sounds right drawn synchro tron synchro tron
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:12.500]  all righty i mean uh-huh i'm gonna be honest i don't understand what it does so it makes
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.820]  sense that i wouldn't be able to say the name i don't know i just think it's a it's a i
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.740]  i thought it was a made-up word because someone like i think jokingly called me that to make
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.580]  me sound like a cyborg i guess and and then i google it and i found out that it was an
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:34.780]  actual thing and i loved it well there you go uh-huh okay i think that's that's that's
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:43.060]  our cue to start wrapping up yeah uh good fun thank you for i mean i don't think we
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:48.880]  have much more to add just i don't think so because like um i don't think we would disagree
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:55.700]  with the original episode and we would agree that people should play this for sure for
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:01.040]  sure especially now that they fix a lot of the issues the early on issues and they're
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.860]  continuing to give uh you know content updates and they have that really cool twitch feature
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.280]  that makes it more interactive when you know people are streaming so i think it's just
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:19.740]  fantastic all around um and you know if i had a second choice or a second top three
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:28.180]  i think it would have been in there uh come december last december
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:35.260]  all right thank you bev for joining me um thank you listeners for listening bev where
