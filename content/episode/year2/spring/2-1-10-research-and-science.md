# Transcript

[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  Hello, farmers! This is Cody. Just a quick update about this episode.
[00:03.920 --> 00:07.280]  Your girl hecked up and messed up the Zoom recording.
[00:07.280 --> 00:11.520]  Uh, so we usually, a little bit of background, we usually do local recording
[00:11.520 --> 00:15.280]  and Zoom recording as a backup. My local recording failed so we had to
[00:15.280 --> 00:19.040]  use the Zoom recording and I messed up some of the settings so
[00:19.040 --> 00:21.840]  we actually only have one Zoom recording instead of like one for me and one for
[00:21.840 --> 00:25.600]  Bev, which means that we have to use that one.
[00:25.600 --> 00:28.480]  Uh, and which is sad because Bev's recording,
[00:28.480 --> 00:32.800]  local recording, was perfect and beautiful but we can't use it anymore
[00:32.800 --> 00:35.920]  and it is not their fault. It is my fault.
[00:35.920 --> 00:39.600]  So, uh, if you notice that the audio quality is not as good
[00:39.600 --> 00:45.680]  in this episode, um, my bad. I learned my lesson and I won it again.
[00:45.680 --> 00:49.840]  Um, but this does not take away from the fact that Bev and I had
[00:49.840 --> 01:05.760]  a super fun time talking about today's episode and I hope you enjoy it.
[01:19.840 --> 01:27.280]  Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of
[01:27.280 --> 01:32.800]  the harvest season. My name is Cody and my name is Bev and we're here today
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.760]  to talk about cottagecore games.
[01:37.760 --> 01:49.680]  Hello. How are you? I am just tired of my life with these games.
[01:49.680 --> 01:52.880]  I want the cottagecore life to just be my life,
[01:52.880 --> 02:00.240]  but yeah. Why did February just like fly by though? I don't understand at all.
[02:00.240 --> 02:06.560]  Like, how's it March? I don't, I don't, I don't know. Yeah, I feel attacked.
[02:06.560 --> 02:15.760]  Um, so today our episode is, um, not what Al told us to do.
[02:17.200 --> 02:21.280]  Uh, it's actually not what we originally were going to do. So
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.520]  basically, um, there's a new game coming out that we've talked about on the pod
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.520]  before called research story and Bev and I have done research before
[02:29.520 --> 02:32.720]  and so we were like, we would like to be on that podcast please.
[02:32.720 --> 02:39.520]  Um, and so we both got the game and, uh, like a week ago and we just
[02:39.520 --> 02:42.560]  haven't really had, I personally haven't really had time to
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.120]  play with it, uh, as much as I would have liked to, um, on the pod.
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.880]  So I was just like, like, I don't feel like I would do it justice if we tried to
[02:50.880 --> 02:55.680]  cover it today. So, uh, we came up with some last minute
[02:55.680 --> 03:05.280]  ideas, uh, and we are going with our idea. Not Al's, not Al's idea.
[03:05.280 --> 03:11.760]  Um, so our idea was to talk, uh, since we are talking about research story,
[03:11.760 --> 03:15.280]  which is a game where you research, where you do research, we were thinking
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.000]  about talking about our research that we've done in our
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.440]  lives before and how we could gamify it to be
[03:23.440 --> 03:27.360]  a, like, cottage core game. Um, because I think
[03:27.360 --> 03:32.640]  it's a big struggle of mine that anytime I see a game that has, like, research or
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.160]  science or whatever, I get grumpy because I'm like, they're not doing it
[03:36.160 --> 03:39.440]  the right way. They're gonna do it so wrong.
[03:39.440 --> 03:46.400]  Yeah, and so, um, so yeah, I wanted to
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.680]  do it, tell people how to do it. I don't know,
[03:49.680 --> 03:55.440]  just, like, dream up my, my, my research game. Um, and I think, Bev, you actually
[03:55.440 --> 03:58.720]  had mentioned this idea and then I immediately was like, we're doing it,
[03:58.720 --> 04:03.440]  we're doing it. So, yeah, we'll talk about that.
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.960]  Um, and then we'll also talk about some news,
[04:06.960 --> 04:10.560]  but before that, uh, Bev, what are you up to?
[04:10.560 --> 04:14.320]  I have been playing a lot of Stardew lately,
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.800]  uh, ever since I saw, like, Concerned Ape's tweet about it being, I think, the
[04:18.800 --> 04:22.320]  seventh, like, year anniversary. I'm like, I
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.600]  should get back into it and then I've been completely sucked in for the past
[04:25.600 --> 04:28.560]  week. Like, all of my free time has just been
[04:28.560 --> 04:32.800]  devoted to Stardew, but it's not good. I don't care.
[04:32.800 --> 04:37.680]  What are you, like, are you prioritizing a certain thing this time around or
[04:37.680 --> 04:42.320]  doing anything? I would like to finish it. Okay, have you not ever done that?
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.760]  No, I've always been, like, so, like, like,
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.680]  so prescriptive and wanting to get everything done in the first two years
[04:49.680 --> 04:54.560]  and I think I burned myself out and I haven't quite, like, gotten to the
[04:54.560 --> 04:59.120]  point where I need to ask for Grandpa's affection yet
[04:59.120 --> 05:04.000]  or whatever. Um, and I haven't actually gotten to, like, the 1.5 stuff,
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.560]  um, that came out, so I, I want to, one, finish, I said, I guess,
[05:10.560 --> 05:15.360]  essentially the game, get to part, uh, you know, year two, end of year two,
[05:15.360 --> 05:22.240]  and also, uh, try all the 1.5 stuff. Yeah. Uh, do you ever get credits? Like,
[05:22.240 --> 05:26.240]  is there a way to get credits? What do you mean by credits? Like, so,
[05:26.240 --> 05:28.560]  like, when you play, like, a Pokemon game or something,
[05:28.560 --> 05:31.120]  like, eventually at some point you hit credits.
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.000]  Oh, in Stardew. Um, yeah, I feel like I would imagine it would be
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.160]  after, after year two. Okay, like, you, like, after your
[05:40.160 --> 05:45.520]  grandfather gives you love and affection or something. For getting
[05:45.520 --> 05:50.800]  always tried too, yeah, apparently. Yeah, okay, just never, I've never
[05:50.800 --> 05:55.840]  gotten it that, that far. Um, I always am perpetually getting
[05:55.840 --> 05:59.360]  distracted, so. Uh-huh, exactly, and starting new farms is, like,
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.760]  also my issue. Like, I think I have over, like, probably 400 hours in
[06:03.760 --> 06:08.160]  this thing, but I don't have to be in the game, so here we are.
[06:08.160 --> 06:11.200]  I do that with Skyrim all the time, like, I'll start it, and then I'll
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.840]  get really into it for, like, two weeks straight, and I'll get really
[06:13.840 --> 06:18.560]  far, and then I won't play it for months, and then when I get, when I
[06:18.560 --> 06:21.040]  try to play it again, I'm like, I don't remember what I was doing, so
[06:21.040 --> 06:25.600]  I'm just gonna start over, and I have over a thousand hours.
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.680]  Yeah, love that dirty, though, because it's essentially my journey.
[06:33.680 --> 06:43.840]  Yeah, um, I have been reading a lot, um, so, oh, I like to read
[06:43.840 --> 06:48.480]  fantasy books, so I read, I'm reading books by Robin Hobb, which is,
[06:48.480 --> 06:53.840]  she's my favorite author, um, I'm reading books by, uh, N.K.
[06:53.840 --> 07:00.000]  Jemisin, I read, uh, our mutual friend, Brittany Morris, um, I read
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.080]  one of, uh, her books, called The Cost of Knowing, I tried to read, um,
[07:04.080 --> 07:06.400]  books by Black authors during Black History Month, so.
[07:07.520 --> 07:10.320]  I didn't realize she had come out with another book already.
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.440]  Yeah, so, instead of, so, her first book was Slay, um, so good, yeah,
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.520]  um, and then the second one was, is called The Cost of Knowing, so
[07:19.520 --> 07:22.800]  that Slay was kind of about, like, a coming-of-age story of a, of a
[07:22.800 --> 07:28.800]  Black girl who designs kind of a Ready Player One style video game,
[07:28.800 --> 07:35.120]  um, super fun, super awesome, and then The Cost of Knowing is about
[07:35.120 --> 07:40.560]  a coming-of-age story about, um, a Black teenager, uh, uh, boy at this
[07:40.560 --> 07:45.280]  time, and it's about, like, he has this ability to see the future, and
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.520]  then he sees the death of someone that's very close to him, so, um,
[07:49.520 --> 07:53.840]  and it's about, like, him trying to kind of come to terms with it,
[07:53.840 --> 07:58.080]  but also kind of prevent it, but also it's like, you can't prevent it,
[07:58.080 --> 08:04.720]  like, you can't prevent it, um, yeah, for games, like, I've been
[08:04.720 --> 08:09.040]  playing Pokemon Go, um, and I picked up Arceus again, and I tried
[08:09.040 --> 08:14.160]  to get credits, I finally beat, uh, a difficult part at the end of the
[08:14.160 --> 08:16.640]  game, where if you've played Arceus, you know what I'm talking about,
[08:17.200 --> 08:22.240]  and, and then there's another thing you have to do after that, and I
[08:22.240 --> 08:25.840]  didn't know that, like, I literally thought that this thing was, like,
[08:25.840 --> 08:28.400]  the thing that was stopping me from beating the game, and then there
[08:28.400 --> 08:29.920]  was a different, there's a different thing you have to do.
[08:29.920 --> 08:32.720]  I don't know if I have beat in the game, and I don't know what you're
[08:32.720 --> 08:33.440]  doing.
[08:33.440 --> 08:34.400]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[08:35.040 --> 08:35.920]  Maybe I have.
[08:36.640 --> 08:39.120]  No, actually, I don't think so, because I'm thinking, I'm thinking
[08:39.120 --> 08:41.360]  of Brilliant Diamond Pearl, like, I...
[08:41.360 --> 08:43.360]  Oh, yeah, no, Arceus.
[08:43.360 --> 08:46.720]  Okay, then maybe I can have a beat in it, what am I doing?
[08:46.720 --> 08:48.720]  I need to go back to it at some point.
[08:48.720 --> 08:54.560]  It's so good, it just, like, scratches the itch of collecting, and,
[08:54.560 --> 08:57.040]  I don't know, my favorite part of Pokemon is catching, and trying
[08:57.040 --> 08:59.760]  to catch them all, and trying to catch different types, and,
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.080]  excuse me, see the, see the Pokemon do different things, and that,
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.360]  it really does it, so.
[09:05.360 --> 09:07.360]  And that's what we've been playing and reading.
[09:08.240 --> 09:08.560]  Hey.
[09:11.360 --> 09:14.560]  Okay, so next up, we have some news.
[09:16.160 --> 09:19.040]  First piece of news is about Lonesome Village.
[09:19.040 --> 09:29.440]  This is the Mexican, not director, Mexican developer that, you're,
[09:29.440 --> 09:31.360]  like, a little coyote?
[09:31.360 --> 09:31.920]  Little fox?
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.400]  I think it's coyote.
[09:34.400 --> 09:34.900]  Okay.
[09:35.760 --> 09:37.040]  If I recall correctly.
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.640]  Yeah, and they are porting the game to iPhone and iPad.
[09:42.640 --> 09:50.400]  Which is, I guess, exciting if you want it on your phone and iPad.
[09:53.520 --> 09:55.520]  I think you can get it on Steam now.
[09:56.160 --> 09:56.480]  Yeah.
[09:56.480 --> 09:57.360]  Like, it's out.
[09:58.880 --> 10:03.200]  But if you want it on your iPhone or your iPad, she do be coming.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.640]  I don't think they said when.
[10:06.640 --> 10:08.400]  I think they just were like, she happening.
[10:09.680 --> 10:11.440]  Nope, release date yet to be announced.
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.680]  Okay, I feel like I personally don't enjoy playing games on iPhone or iPad,
[10:15.680 --> 10:20.000]  but I know some folks only have access to a phone to play stuff on.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.600]  So I am excited for them.
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.160]  And actually, I might actually tell this person that I'm thinking of about this game,
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.960]  because they're also, I think, Hispanic origin, so they might actually enjoy it.
[10:32.960 --> 10:33.520]  There you go.
[10:34.080 --> 10:37.360]  Visiting this world in Lonesome Village.
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.120]  Mm hmm. Yeah, I like playing.
[10:41.120 --> 10:45.200]  I like mobile games, but specifically the ones that are meant to be mobile games,
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.120]  like things like RPGs.
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.240]  Like, I just don't anything that requires me to use a phone like a controller.
[10:52.240 --> 10:54.160]  I'm like, no, no, I'm out.
[10:56.240 --> 10:58.160]  So I have to move anywhere.
[10:58.160 --> 10:58.720]  No, thank you.
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.960]  Yeah, but it's there for someone.
[11:04.960 --> 11:08.000]  So Lonesome Village, keep your eyes posted.
[11:10.160 --> 11:12.800]  Lens Island, which is a game that you and I've covered,
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.400]  has controller support coming, finally.
[11:18.400 --> 11:25.760]  And I saw the tweet and I retweeted or tagged Al and Kevin in it,
[11:25.760 --> 11:27.280]  because I thought they'd be excited.
[11:27.280 --> 11:31.360]  And Al was just like, guess who doesn't read the show notes before?
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.680]  And I was like, this is like four days ago.
[11:33.680 --> 11:37.600]  And I'm like, I was excited to tell you this.
[11:37.600 --> 11:40.240]  And then you just like clap back at me.
[11:42.640 --> 11:46.880]  I thought we uploaded the news, like in the show notes, like last night.
[11:46.880 --> 11:49.360]  I'm pretty sure he messaged me asking.
[11:49.360 --> 11:50.880]  Oh, my gosh.
[11:50.880 --> 11:52.640]  I don't even know what he's talking about.
[11:52.640 --> 11:55.120]  Al, Al, Al, Al.
[11:55.120 --> 11:56.800]  Yeah, no.
[11:56.800 --> 12:01.120]  So this is something that I know Kevin had said that he was waiting for.
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.280]  And we like controller support here.
[12:05.280 --> 12:06.080]  We do.
[12:06.080 --> 12:07.920]  It helps for accessibility.
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.360]  I'm excited to get back into this with controller support.
[12:12.880 --> 12:15.920]  I have not played it, I think, since we last covered it.
[12:15.920 --> 12:18.240]  And I know there's been a whole bunch of changes.
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.920]  And I think having the controller support might be what brings me back in at this point.
[12:25.280 --> 12:28.320]  And someone had said, someone on the Twitter,
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.240]  on the Twitter, on the tweet said,
[12:33.440 --> 12:36.080]  so would that mean Steam Deck compatibility?
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.200]  And the developer said that after the controller support update playing on Steam Deck,
[12:41.200 --> 12:43.120]  we'll have improved functionality.
[12:44.240 --> 12:47.120]  So it still won't technically be supported for the Steam Deck,
[12:47.120 --> 12:51.200]  but it will have better functionality on the Steam Deck.
[12:51.920 --> 12:55.600]  And they're hoping to have full compatibility in the future.
[12:55.600 --> 12:56.960]  So yeah.
[12:56.960 --> 12:59.600]  So I'm assuming it essentially works fine.
[12:59.600 --> 13:02.400]  It was just like whatever Steam requirements are for
[13:03.280 --> 13:06.160]  Steam Deck optimization or whatever it needs.
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.040]  They just added a few more things that I probably don't care about.
[13:10.800 --> 13:14.160]  Yeah, it just looks so good.
[13:14.160 --> 13:15.360]  I need to jump back into it.
[13:15.360 --> 13:16.080]  I know.
[13:16.080 --> 13:16.880]  It's so good.
[13:19.360 --> 13:23.680]  Speaking of games that you and I like and fight over sometimes,
[13:23.680 --> 13:31.200]  uh, Coral Island, when Al was like,
[13:31.200 --> 13:32.720]  who wants to be in the Coral Island episode?
[13:32.720 --> 13:33.360]  We were both like,
[13:36.080 --> 13:38.640]  like the beginning of when Al was like, you guys do it?
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.680]  Like, I'm stepping back.
[13:42.160 --> 13:44.800]  I think we're also like that with Lens Island too.
[13:44.800 --> 13:45.300]  Yeah.
[13:45.760 --> 13:48.880]  And then Kevin and I were like that with Bear and Breakfast.
[13:50.080 --> 13:51.920]  Just like, we want to do it.
[13:51.920 --> 13:54.640]  And so, and also research story now.
[13:54.640 --> 13:57.040]  So there's a theme here.
[13:57.040 --> 13:57.760]  Coral Island.
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.000]  The Coral Island Spring update is coming in March.
[14:05.360 --> 14:07.520]  There will be a bunch of new content.
[14:09.840 --> 14:11.360]  You can, it adds a solar panel.
[14:11.920 --> 14:12.480]  Just go on.
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.120]  New outdoor decor, new indoor decor,
[14:17.120 --> 14:19.600]  a new tree planting festival,
[14:19.600 --> 14:26.240]  um, which is awesome that, uh, you go to an area that was devastated by logging and you replant.
[14:27.200 --> 14:29.120]  It's very on brand for Coral Island.
[14:30.640 --> 14:32.640]  Um, yeah, it just looks really cute.
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.800]  Um, on top of that, there is a bunch of accessibility improvements, which I love.
[14:41.360 --> 14:46.960]  Um, so they said that there's support for dyslexic font for Latin characters.
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.760]  Um, there is, you can increase or decrease the font sizes depending on your need.
[14:51.760 --> 14:55.440]  And there are three different, uh, colorblindness filters.
[14:55.440 --> 15:01.840]  Now, um, I'm going to ruin these deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia.
[15:02.720 --> 15:06.880]  Um, so I think that's depending on what your colorblindness is.
[15:06.880 --> 15:13.040]  Um, those are the three modes that's supposed to like help enhance the game or make the game.
[15:13.040 --> 15:20.720]  Um, I depending on what kind of colorblindness you have, um, like it's these three different modes.
[15:20.720 --> 15:27.120]  Um, and then they also said custom key bindings, which is awesome.
[15:27.120 --> 15:31.440]  Like I've never, I don't think I've ever seen a game do dyslexic font.
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.440]  In fact, I didn't know that was the thing until I read it.
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.760]  Um, and I am just love, love, love.
[15:39.760 --> 15:45.360]  Uh, I think I've seen maybe one or two other games that have colorblind modes, but it's just,
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.000]  I feel like that needs to be more mainstreamed at this point.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.240]  Um, with all the new, like new games coming out, like just having that actual level of accessibility.
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.040]  I bring in a lot of people.
[15:59.040 --> 16:01.280]  Um, so I'm, I'm really excited.
[16:01.280 --> 16:02.960]  Like rural Islander was doing this.
[16:02.960 --> 16:03.440]  Hey, good.
[16:03.440 --> 16:04.880]  I was like, we haven't covered this yet.
[16:04.880 --> 16:05.360]  Right.
[16:05.360 --> 16:06.000]  Cause like,
[16:06.000 --> 16:11.200]  Uh, right now it has you and Al's name on it.
[16:11.200 --> 16:12.080]  So I'm gonna wait.
[16:12.080 --> 16:13.920]  Which one has a core Island?
[16:13.920 --> 16:14.560]  Yeah, this game.
[16:15.440 --> 16:15.940]  Okay.
[16:17.120 --> 16:19.280]  I was like, I was wondering, have you covered it?
[16:19.280 --> 16:20.560]  No, I was sitting here.
[16:20.560 --> 16:22.080]  I was like, wait, this is out already.
[16:22.080 --> 16:28.560]  Why like, we know why haven't we, what am I doing sitting on this game?
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.360]  Wait, what are we supposed to be doing?
[16:33.360 --> 16:37.920]  Oh, wait, it doesn't have a date yet.
[16:38.480 --> 16:38.980]  Okay.
[16:39.760 --> 16:40.800]  And Alice name on it.
[16:40.800 --> 16:42.720]  We're going to have to kick out on earth.
[16:42.720 --> 16:43.920]  Get you a problem.
[16:43.920 --> 16:46.080]  The problem is that it's just windows.
[16:46.080 --> 16:47.440]  So this is the problem.
[16:47.440 --> 16:52.400]  Y'all I only have my PC is my desktop and it's in a room.
[16:52.400 --> 16:54.400]  I never go in anyway.
[16:55.600 --> 16:57.760]  Um, I mean, I'm going to be playing research story on it.
[16:57.760 --> 17:07.440]  So next piece of news, uh, ages of Kataria, um, is delayed
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.440]  until 2024, specifically Q1 2024.
[17:12.240 --> 17:19.440]  Um, I am not sure if this game has been talking about, um, I don't
[17:19.440 --> 17:23.200]  also, but I will say that I've personally not looked into it
[17:23.200 --> 17:25.120]  yet until just now.
[17:25.120 --> 17:28.160]  And I love the look of it.
[17:28.160 --> 17:28.660]  Yeah.
[17:29.040 --> 17:29.540]  Same.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.720]  It's very cute.
[17:31.440 --> 17:31.940]  Yeah.
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.000]  Um, the whole vibe aesthetic looks really cute.
[17:36.000 --> 17:37.600]  Of the animals are really cute.
[17:37.600 --> 17:39.600]  Um, I like the concept.
[17:39.600 --> 17:43.440]  Like it's like an age of empires game, but you actually care more
[17:43.440 --> 17:44.960]  about what your people are doing.
[17:46.960 --> 17:50.800]  Like your, your characters like age over time and you get to see
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.520]  them and you collect your little souls in a tree, apparently.
[17:53.520 --> 17:57.840]  Um, I'm feeling like I actually might've already talked about this
[17:57.840 --> 18:01.280]  in a previous episode and I already covered it.
[18:01.280 --> 18:01.760]  I forgot.
[18:01.760 --> 18:02.960]  My memory is terrible.
[18:02.960 --> 18:04.800]  I'll confirm this.
[18:06.800 --> 18:10.240]  Um, yeah, no, I, it looks really cute.
[18:10.240 --> 18:13.200]  You manage your villagers, uh, there's a spirit tree.
[18:13.200 --> 18:16.240]  There are elves and the elves are like plant people.
[18:16.240 --> 18:21.520]  Um, so you can choose whether your village is humans or elves.
[18:21.520 --> 18:23.920]  Um, and the elves also are like different colors.
[18:23.920 --> 18:28.080]  Uh, I'm a little confused by that.
[18:28.080 --> 18:30.160]  Like, why, why do you have to choose?
[18:30.160 --> 18:31.440]  Why can't you just have both?
[18:31.440 --> 18:36.560]  And I've seen that it's like based off of real world, like time.
[18:37.440 --> 18:40.240]  And that's why I think maybe I've talked about this already.
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.000]  Cause I feel like I'm not excited by it being real world world.
[18:44.000 --> 18:44.500]  Yeah.
[18:44.500 --> 18:47.200]  Um, but whatever, it's very cute.
[18:47.200 --> 18:49.760]  Uh, I love the gist of it for the most part.
[18:49.760 --> 18:53.280]  So I will, I don't, I don't have money right now to bag it,
[18:53.280 --> 18:55.280]  but I will probably get it at some point.
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.560]  So, I mean, I think that the reason you choose between either humans or
[19:00.560 --> 19:03.360]  elves is because you're supposed, you're wanting your village to grow.
[19:03.360 --> 19:09.920]  And I think since the elves are made of plants, I have the feeling that
[19:09.920 --> 19:14.080]  if you had both and then they all pair off that eventually you're not
[19:14.080 --> 19:15.600]  going to have a village anymore.
[19:15.600 --> 19:18.640]  Um, but that would be a super cute idea.
[19:18.640 --> 19:22.560]  If like you could make like a second village or something, and then
[19:22.560 --> 19:25.840]  maybe like an elf comes over and like falls in love with a human and
[19:25.840 --> 19:30.560]  then like, and they can totally like live it, but babies are, are a
[19:30.560 --> 19:35.360]  thing that need to happen and if they're plant, but I guess it's also a game.
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.000]  Well, they could make it happen.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.560]  They have to reproduce somehow.
[19:40.560 --> 19:42.880]  Otherwise, how, how do they exist?
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.520]  Um, we have questions.
[19:47.520 --> 19:49.120]  We have a lot of questions.
[19:51.760 --> 19:52.960]  Oh my goodness.
[19:53.840 --> 19:57.680]  Also, if that's also like the question of, are they the same species?
[19:57.680 --> 20:01.200]  Cause can they actually humans and elves, can they procreate?
[20:01.200 --> 20:02.400]  I don't think they can.
[20:02.400 --> 20:05.520]  But is there any concern with having them both in a one village?
[20:07.680 --> 20:12.560]  I mean, so they, I don't think that they can procreate,
[20:12.560 --> 20:15.040]  but I think that they would probably still have the capability
[20:15.040 --> 20:16.720]  to fall in love and choose each other.
[20:16.720 --> 20:16.960]  Right.
[20:18.320 --> 20:18.640]  Yeah.
[20:19.200 --> 20:21.520]  Cause like, is it going to be drama about that?
[20:21.520 --> 20:23.520]  That's what I want.
[20:23.520 --> 20:24.560]  This is what I want now.
[20:26.080 --> 20:27.120]  Cause that's what I'm saying.
[20:27.120 --> 20:31.520]  It's like, what if they all like, all the humans are like, screw humans.
[20:31.520 --> 20:34.240]  Like I'm going to date an elf and the elves do the same thing.
[20:34.240 --> 20:35.360]  And then your villages.
[20:35.360 --> 20:35.680]  Okay.
[20:35.680 --> 20:36.640]  I understand that.
[20:36.640 --> 20:37.280]  I understand.
[20:37.280 --> 20:39.920]  Your village just is gone.
[20:39.920 --> 20:40.960]  How they procreate.
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.240]  Like if they're, if they're plants, they could theoretically holiday themselves.
[20:46.240 --> 20:50.640]  What if the elves last like so much longer than the humans.
[20:51.680 --> 20:55.040]  And so then the human passes, but the elves.
[20:55.040 --> 20:56.640]  Oh my God.
[20:56.640 --> 20:57.600]  I want this.
[20:57.600 --> 20:59.360]  This is the story.
[20:59.360 --> 21:01.360]  This is not what this game is going to be about.
[21:01.360 --> 21:05.520]  But okay.
[21:05.520 --> 21:07.120]  This is what I want now.
[21:08.240 --> 21:09.600]  Above snakes.
[21:09.600 --> 21:18.400]  According to their latest update, it's finished quote unquote whatever that means.
[21:18.400 --> 21:20.000]  They're just focusing on bug fixes.
[21:20.800 --> 21:26.000]  Looks like they're still I don't know if it's, I think they were still on, on, on track for
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  their release in early 2023.
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.000]  Also, whatever that means, because early 2023 is fast ending.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.760]  Yeah, as we, as we mentioned, retired in February, where did it go?
[21:41.760 --> 21:45.440]  I feel like March is like the end of like early 2023.
[21:45.440 --> 21:50.320]  Like that's officially been a quarter, a whole quarter of a year done.
[21:50.320 --> 21:56.240]  So if it's not coming out in the next month and this month, I don't believe in early 2023.
[21:56.240 --> 21:57.920]  Then but we'll see.
[21:57.920 --> 21:58.720]  We'll see.
[21:58.720 --> 22:05.280]  There's apparently a prologue coming soon, which we can download for free, I guess.
[22:05.280 --> 22:08.800]  I guess it's going to be kind of like a demo, I'm assuming.
[22:08.800 --> 22:12.800]  Yeah, it looks like it covers about the first hour of gameplay.
[22:12.800 --> 22:14.720]  So why don't we just call it a demo?
[22:15.360 --> 22:16.400]  But it's a demo.
[22:17.120 --> 22:17.600]  I wonder.
[22:17.600 --> 22:24.160]  So I wonder if, so I know that like if you have a demo of a game, so like Apico, for
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.920]  example, if you downloaded the demo and then played the game, you could not continue your
[22:29.920 --> 22:30.720]  demo game.
[22:31.760 --> 22:33.840]  You had to start a new game.
[22:33.840 --> 22:35.840]  And a lot of people, which just makes sense.
[22:35.840 --> 22:36.960]  It was a demo version.
[22:36.960 --> 22:39.040]  It was like a completely different version of the game.
[22:39.040 --> 22:42.800]  They don't like, it didn't have everything.
[22:42.800 --> 22:46.640]  But I wonder if because they're calling this prologue, like you, yeah.
[22:46.640 --> 22:47.520]  Oh, it says that.
[22:48.480 --> 22:50.560]  Oh, see if I will carry over to the full game.
[22:50.560 --> 22:51.440]  So yeah, that's.
[22:51.440 --> 22:58.800]  Yeah, so instead of you having to like start over, you can play this first bit, be introduced
[22:58.800 --> 23:03.600]  to the game for free, and then your save file will carry over.
[23:03.600 --> 23:04.160]  Yep.
[23:04.160 --> 23:08.160]  But it sounds like a DLC or like a whole different thing.
[23:08.160 --> 23:09.840]  It's a pre-LC.
[23:10.400 --> 23:11.440]  It's, oh my goodness.
[23:13.120 --> 23:17.600]  Is this early release, like early access, just a different way to call it that?
[23:17.600 --> 23:20.240]  Because they did have early access in their Kickstarter.
[23:20.240 --> 23:24.160]  So I'm confused.
[23:24.160 --> 23:25.680]  Yeah, I'll define this.
[23:27.040 --> 23:28.480]  What does prologue mean?
[23:29.360 --> 23:32.000]  I mean, that's what I think it means is that, yeah.
[23:34.160 --> 23:38.560]  They're going to PAX East, which is super interesting.
[23:38.560 --> 23:41.840]  Actually, no, no, I am not going, no.
[23:43.120 --> 23:46.080]  I saw it and I was like, oh, I could go to PAX East.
[23:46.080 --> 23:50.400]  Because that's the first time that we met, I think.
[23:50.400 --> 23:51.040]  Was it PAX East?
[23:51.040 --> 23:54.880]  No, because I got sick and I couldn't make it out.
[23:54.880 --> 23:55.200]  Right.
[23:55.200 --> 23:57.200]  It was Kelly that I roomed with.
[23:57.200 --> 23:59.200]  Kelly and I think Mia and Nick.
[23:59.200 --> 23:59.600]  Yeah.
[23:59.600 --> 24:01.040]  All the other slackers.
[24:01.040 --> 24:02.000]  Yeah, you weren't there.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.840]  Oh, and then we went camping afterwards.
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.400]  Okay.
[24:04.400 --> 24:04.720]  Yes.
[24:04.720 --> 24:05.760]  So that made up for it.
[24:06.800 --> 24:09.360]  I think it's still going back to Above Snakes.
[24:09.360 --> 24:14.000]  I think it's still on track because they had, they were Kickstarter.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.920]  They had a pre-alpha and alpha beta, and they still say early 2023.
[24:17.920 --> 24:18.420]  Okay.
[24:19.600 --> 24:22.800]  And it says we have internally decided on a release date.
[24:24.080 --> 24:28.160]  Then they're going to say what it is the next update.
[24:28.720 --> 24:29.040]  Okay.
[24:29.040 --> 24:30.640]  So there's going to be announcement.
[24:30.640 --> 24:32.800]  This is the announcement about the announcement.
[24:32.800 --> 24:33.840]  This is the announcement.
[24:33.840 --> 24:34.340]  Correct.
[24:35.200 --> 24:35.700]  Okay.
[24:36.320 --> 24:41.200]  I mean, we know we love that in at harvest season.
[24:42.560 --> 24:42.960]  Yeah.
[24:42.960 --> 24:44.320]  Should you almost say Harvest Moon?
[24:44.880 --> 24:46.400]  No, no.
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.760]  I almost heard Harvest Moon.
[24:48.560 --> 24:51.120]  I mean, also, I don't know what I was going to say.
[24:53.280 --> 24:53.780]  Okay.
[24:54.480 --> 24:55.360]  Last piece of news.
[24:55.360 --> 24:55.920]  We've got this.
[24:55.920 --> 24:56.800]  We can do this.
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.440]  We do this.
[24:58.960 --> 25:00.560]  So this, I think, is a new game.
[25:01.120 --> 25:03.280]  It's called Enchanted.
[25:03.280 --> 25:09.520]  So it's like Enchanted, but it's an inn, like a cozy inn that you go and stop and stay at.
[25:10.160 --> 25:10.800]  Enchanted.
[25:10.800 --> 25:15.920]  And the steam thing says, quote, run a magical inn with friends.
[25:15.920 --> 25:17.280]  I'm going to butcher this name.
[25:18.240 --> 25:23.920]  Ja rules family in question mark has been stolen by an evil wizard landlord.
[25:23.920 --> 25:26.400]  Team up with friends to reclaim your family's legacy.
[25:26.400 --> 25:32.800]  Manage your in brew potions, fish cook and fight in this hectic and heartfelt magical
[25:32.800 --> 25:41.200]  adventure and play solo or play solo or co-op for one to four players.
[25:41.200 --> 25:46.080]  I feel like they should say play solo or co-op for two to four other players.
[25:46.640 --> 25:50.160]  Like, I don't know, but you can't co-op by.
[25:50.160 --> 25:53.280]  I mean, no, no, you can't co-op by yourself.
[25:55.440 --> 25:55.940]  So, yeah.
[25:55.940 --> 26:02.180]  So at first it looks like another, like, witch game.
[26:03.060 --> 26:04.900]  There's like a little cauldron and stuff.
[26:06.500 --> 26:10.020]  But then it very quickly became chaos.
[26:10.020 --> 26:12.020]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[26:12.580 --> 26:16.420]  Like, we were talking about this before we started recording, and it's like our ADHD
[26:16.420 --> 26:19.060]  brains can't understand what's going on.
[26:19.060 --> 26:21.940]  It's just there's too many colors, too many things.
[26:21.940 --> 26:24.180]  A lot of colors in this.
[26:24.180 --> 26:30.900]  So you said you were into it because it's an Australian goodness.
[26:30.900 --> 26:31.540]  What was it?
[26:32.420 --> 26:39.940]  It's a fantasy universe inspired by indigest, indigen, indigen, indigen, indigenous.
[26:39.940 --> 26:41.300]  Yes, thank you.
[26:41.300 --> 26:42.100]  Australian tails.
[26:44.100 --> 26:46.580]  I'm a struggle boss today.
[26:46.580 --> 26:47.220]  It's all good.
[26:48.980 --> 26:49.460]  Yeah.
[26:49.460 --> 26:58.100]  So I mean, it looks like you cook things and you update your in, you run it, and you decorate
[26:58.100 --> 26:58.260]  it.
[26:58.260 --> 27:05.300]  You're trying to satisfy, quote, the infamous food critic with capitals.
[27:06.180 --> 27:07.380]  No, I don't like that.
[27:07.380 --> 27:09.220]  Surprised it doesn't have a trademark after it.
[27:09.860 --> 27:10.500]  Oh, my gosh.
[27:10.500 --> 27:13.540]  Purchase upgrades from your local were's wolf.
[27:13.540 --> 27:19.620]  Oh, a wolf that you get were's from.
[27:19.620 --> 27:24.020]  See, I think I just needed to take the trailer was a lot all at once.
[27:24.820 --> 27:31.460]  These little golden gems did not like the famous food critic, but where's wolf?
[27:31.460 --> 27:32.420]  I am here for.
[27:32.420 --> 27:34.820]  You got to overcome any of the wizard burglars.
[27:34.820 --> 27:36.820]  There's a cat bird.
[27:36.820 --> 27:37.700]  That's one word.
[27:37.700 --> 27:43.300]  And I don't know what that means, but it looks like it's a species of cat burglar.
[27:43.300 --> 27:44.900]  Oh, my gosh.
[27:46.020 --> 27:46.420]  Yeah.
[27:46.420 --> 27:49.700]  So Al had said that this was out now.
[27:50.580 --> 27:51.700]  And it's not.
[27:51.700 --> 27:52.420]  It's not, Al.
[27:57.700 --> 28:01.540]  You can purchase it, pre-purchase it, pre-order it.
[28:02.420 --> 28:06.980]  Well, how, you know, however you want to call it, you can buy it now, which is 50% off.
[28:06.980 --> 28:07.940]  So go for it.
[28:07.940 --> 28:10.660]  If you're going to get it, I will say it is.
[28:10.660 --> 28:12.660]  It sounded like you said 50% off.
[28:12.660 --> 28:15.620]  So I'm going to 50 15 15.
[28:16.420 --> 28:16.980]  Thank you.
[28:16.980 --> 28:21.700]  One five established words are not my strong suit and I'm recording a podcast.
[28:21.700 --> 28:30.180]  So so yeah, if you buy it before before the release date, which is March 28th, you can
[28:30.180 --> 28:32.180]  get that 15% off.
[28:32.180 --> 28:35.780]  My brain's trying to do math right now.
[28:37.780 --> 28:38.900]  You save three dollars.
[28:40.900 --> 28:42.340]  You save three dollars.
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.620]  Three American dollars.
[28:43.620 --> 28:47.380]  I was just like, is this is that it is it is.
[28:49.220 --> 28:51.540]  So that is enchanted.
[28:52.980 --> 28:53.780]  It's a clever name.
[28:53.780 --> 28:54.980]  I'll give it that.
[28:54.980 --> 28:55.300]  Yeah.
[28:55.300 --> 29:02.740]  Okay.
[29:02.740 --> 29:03.540]  Oh, my brain.
[29:05.380 --> 29:12.260]  So let's go to our main topic, which is I wrote how to gamify science and research accurately.
[29:13.620 --> 29:14.340]  The important bit.
[29:14.340 --> 29:15.220]  Act it is.
[29:15.220 --> 29:22.900]  Yeah, because so this kind of like I said, Bev, they brought up the game, the idea first
[29:22.900 --> 29:26.340]  of talking about, like, research that we've done before and then how we can gamify it.
[29:26.340 --> 29:37.620]  But this also ties into this gripe that I have about bees, bees, specifically bees and
[29:37.620 --> 29:41.300]  bees and games, because there was a game that came out recently or not came out, but like
[29:41.300 --> 29:43.380]  it was talked about on the podcast recently.
[29:43.380 --> 29:45.540]  Gosh, I can't remember what Honeyman sir, I think.
[29:46.740 --> 29:49.700]  And someone was like, Oh, Cody's going to love it because it's a big game.
[29:49.700 --> 29:52.100]  And I'm like over here, like, see things.
[29:52.100 --> 29:57.300]  Just like screaming in the background.
[29:57.300 --> 29:59.460]  Yeah, because it completely depends.
[29:59.460 --> 30:06.900]  Like, so for one, I think that there's a lot of there's a lot of honeybee stuff in the
[30:06.900 --> 30:08.260]  media nowadays.
[30:09.620 --> 30:11.620]  And I don't really study honeybees.
[30:11.620 --> 30:14.260]  I study specifically anything else.
[30:14.260 --> 30:24.500]  And so there's like this built up ire over years of me telling people that I study bees
[30:24.500 --> 30:27.140]  and then them asking me, Oh, do you have a hive?
[30:27.140 --> 30:31.460]  Oh, how can I have a hive?
[30:31.460 --> 30:33.460]  And me being like, I don't do that.
[30:34.340 --> 30:36.580]  Go watch a YouTube video on how to do it.
[30:36.580 --> 30:38.420]  Yeah, I don't do that.
[30:38.420 --> 30:39.380]  I can't tell you.
[30:39.380 --> 30:44.420]  I can't tell you anything about that.
[30:44.420 --> 30:56.020]  And so it's this like, if the game either only has honeybees in it, or if all it has
[30:56.020 --> 31:01.460]  is a big round thing, and it spits out honey.
[31:03.140 --> 31:05.700]  I'm not gonna be one over.
[31:06.500 --> 31:07.940]  There has to be more.
[31:07.940 --> 31:17.060]  But if it's like a game where you can have, you plant flowers and you plant bees and butterflies
[31:17.060 --> 31:20.900]  and stuff, and then there's a benefit to that, I'm all for that.
[31:22.260 --> 31:23.060]  It's just different.
[31:23.060 --> 31:27.140]  Or like Apico, they have the solitary bees update.
[31:27.140 --> 31:32.100]  So that talked all about solitary bees and butterflies, which is amazing completely.
[31:32.100 --> 31:39.700]  Like, even though it's a game that started out only about beekeeping, it's not just that.
[31:39.700 --> 31:40.500]  So that's amazing.
[31:41.220 --> 31:42.020]  It is.
[31:42.020 --> 31:42.900]  They did it right.
[31:42.900 --> 31:44.260]  Apico is amazing.
[31:44.260 --> 31:44.820]  Yeah.
[31:44.820 --> 31:46.660]  And so whatever.
[31:46.660 --> 31:47.060]  I'm sorry.
[31:48.420 --> 31:49.380]  It's all good.
[31:49.380 --> 31:54.020]  And so part of me is sitting here like, okay, what do I want from people?
[31:54.020 --> 32:00.580]  Because right now all I'm doing is getting mad and saying you're not doing it correctly.
[32:00.580 --> 32:02.500]  But then I don't like in my brain.
[32:03.940 --> 32:12.020]  And then I don't say how it should be done, which is kind of also the like, how do you
[32:12.020 --> 32:13.540]  gamify science and research?
[32:13.540 --> 32:15.060]  Like, how do you do this?
[32:16.420 --> 32:21.540]  And sometimes I feel like people don't, you know, of course, Elle from the developer of
[32:21.540 --> 32:27.780]  Apico is the exception to this, but most people don't do their research.
[32:27.780 --> 32:31.620]  And so that's all they do is just make like a thing that spits out honey.
[32:33.620 --> 32:38.100]  I mean, if you do your research, like if you were looking like how to conserve wild native
[32:38.100 --> 32:43.460]  bees, you would learn about the diversity of bees and you would learn about how they
[32:43.460 --> 32:45.380]  need more than just like most.
[32:45.380 --> 32:47.060]  Most of them don't use hives.
[32:47.060 --> 32:48.340]  Most of them aren't social.
[32:49.700 --> 32:54.260]  There are only so in North America, for example, there's 4000 species of native bees.
[32:55.300 --> 32:56.340]  None of those are the honeybee.
[32:56.340 --> 32:58.580]  Honeybee is not native to North America.
[32:58.580 --> 33:00.900]  And only what is it?
[33:00.900 --> 33:06.500]  Like 9% of bees are social and live in like a colony or a hive environment.
[33:08.740 --> 33:11.380]  The other 91% are solitary.
[33:12.180 --> 33:13.220]  And nobody understands.
[33:14.100 --> 33:14.660]  Yeah.
[33:14.660 --> 33:20.580]  So nobody understands like their life history, what they do, how they do it.
[33:20.580 --> 33:28.740]  And I feel like a game would be an amazing avenue to teach people how to do it or to
[33:28.740 --> 33:32.420]  teach people about plant pollinator networks or whatever.
[33:34.420 --> 33:40.580]  So I guess that's gonna be part of part of why we're talking about what we're talking
[33:40.580 --> 33:49.060]  about today is like trying to just like advance the or advocate for the use of doing your
[33:49.060 --> 33:55.780]  research about plants that you might be using or insects or wildlife that you might be using.
[33:55.780 --> 34:04.100]  Like, if you have someplace, if you have a game that is set in the forest, try and figure
[34:04.100 --> 34:08.980]  out what forest insects actually are or what forest birds there actually would be.
[34:11.540 --> 34:12.980]  I feel like movies don't do this either.
[34:12.980 --> 34:16.500]  Movies don't do a really bad version of this, too, because there's been a lot of movies.
[34:16.500 --> 34:24.180]  I also listen to, like, I also go birding and know a decent amount of bird songs, and
[34:24.180 --> 34:29.620]  I'll be watching a movie and it'll be in, like, a desert and there's a beautiful sand
[34:29.620 --> 34:33.460]  dune in front of you and the sun is hitting it just right.
[34:33.460 --> 34:35.620]  And it's just really like, you can feel the heat.
[34:35.620 --> 34:42.260]  And then I hear a red-tailed hawk and I'm like, I am taken out.
[34:42.260 --> 34:42.740]  No.
[34:42.740 --> 34:43.300]  Yep.
[34:43.300 --> 34:48.180]  Yeah, I've had that moment before with, like, tropical birds calls.
[34:48.180 --> 34:49.860]  Like, I only know about bird calls.
[34:50.740 --> 34:56.740]  And I've heard like a Montezuma like goodness, I'm forgetting the name or pendant.
[34:56.740 --> 34:57.060]  I can't.
[34:57.060 --> 34:59.140]  There was also another name I couldn't pronounce.
[34:59.140 --> 34:59.460]  No.
[34:59.460 --> 35:03.940]  And I was like, that is not where this bird is found.
[35:04.660 --> 35:07.780]  I completely like thrown off and distracted by that.
[35:07.780 --> 35:09.620]  So, yeah, I agreed.
[35:09.620 --> 35:14.420]  Or, like, watching a movie that's set in California and I hear a cardinal.
[35:15.060 --> 35:19.060]  And now that I've lived in the Northeast and I know what a cardinal sounds like, I'm like,
[35:19.060 --> 35:21.220]  nope, that's not out there.
[35:21.220 --> 35:22.420]  So I don't know.
[35:22.420 --> 35:30.500]  Just advocating for even if your game is not about science or insects or anything like
[35:30.500 --> 35:34.500]  that, or about research, like, even if the game isn't about conducting research, do your
[35:34.500 --> 35:34.980]  homework.
[35:34.980 --> 35:42.100]  Either contact someone, like, honestly, like, Elle, when Elle reached out to me and was
[35:42.100 --> 35:45.940]  like, Hey, would you be willing to consult on the solitary bees update?
[35:45.940 --> 35:49.700]  I was like, Yeah, I don't even don't even need money.
[35:49.700 --> 35:51.780]  Like, don't need money.
[35:51.780 --> 35:52.980]  We'll still pay for the game.
[35:53.540 --> 35:56.020]  Like, I would love to play this game.
[35:57.700 --> 36:04.340]  And I feel like a lot of other like if you're making a game about birding or bird watching
[36:04.340 --> 36:10.260]  or something like that, like bird watchers or ornithologists would be all about it.
[36:10.260 --> 36:13.140]  Yeah, it would be so excited to see like wingspan.
[36:13.140 --> 36:19.620]  Like, I am in love with this board game because they actually took the time to like, you know,
[36:19.620 --> 36:23.380]  do the homework and make it realistic and about birds.
[36:24.500 --> 36:31.060]  And it's just like any opportunity that is like an educational like there's so many opportunities
[36:31.060 --> 36:39.460]  just to educate people without even trying to, you know, like having a like neat like
[36:39.460 --> 36:46.420]  I don't I can't work with words today of having having a like locality that has like actual
[36:46.420 --> 36:50.980]  local plants and actual local flora and fauna like that is huge.
[36:50.980 --> 36:54.500]  And it means a lot to the people who live there and can recognize it.
[36:54.500 --> 37:01.460]  So just taking that extra like effort is noticed by people and we need to, I think,
[37:01.460 --> 37:04.420]  celebrate it more often and encourage people to do it because I want it.
[37:05.620 --> 37:06.180]  Yup.
[37:06.180 --> 37:14.580]  So I guess do you want to talk about research that you have conducted in your life and how
[37:14.580 --> 37:15.780]  it could be gamified?
[37:16.420 --> 37:24.420]  I feel like research is such a good opportunity for like farming games and like, you know,
[37:24.420 --> 37:28.340]  like cards, core games because there's a lot of like repetition to it.
[37:29.540 --> 37:32.100]  At least it can be a lot of repetition to it.
[37:32.100 --> 37:38.740]  And a lot of it is like kind of the same like vibe of it can be mindless but relaxing while
[37:38.740 --> 37:39.700]  you're working on it.
[37:40.660 --> 37:43.700]  So I'm honestly surprised that I haven't seen it more often.
[37:43.700 --> 37:49.300]  And I feel like any game that has like a research component to it, I'm very excited about.
[37:49.300 --> 37:55.140]  Like the Arceus, which has you being a field researcher, essentially.
[37:55.140 --> 38:01.620]  And same thing with, I think, Scarlet and Violet, where you're literally creating volumes
[38:01.620 --> 38:09.380]  of data that you've harvested collected based off of your observations.
[38:09.380 --> 38:10.820]  So I love that.
[38:10.820 --> 38:13.300]  And I've already gone on a tangent.
[38:15.460 --> 38:18.900]  The only thing I was going to interject was please use the word harvested because that'll
[38:18.900 --> 38:24.260]  make it more likely that Al will approve of the talk because we're using the word harvested.
[38:24.260 --> 38:26.500]  How many times can we use the word harvest?
[38:26.500 --> 38:27.300]  Oh, okay.
[38:27.300 --> 38:28.660]  Well, I'll use it more.
[38:30.100 --> 38:32.020]  You harvest the data, Al.
[38:32.660 --> 38:33.160]  Uh-huh.
[38:34.180 --> 38:39.140]  So I guess a lot of the research I haven't done, mind you, I haven't done research since
[38:39.140 --> 38:40.980]  like college.
[38:42.020 --> 38:45.060]  So most of my research took place during that time.
[38:45.060 --> 38:53.060]  But my two, I think, main biggest projects were related to collecting fecal matter from
[38:53.060 --> 38:54.820]  owl monkeys in Argentina.
[38:54.820 --> 38:56.340]  That was a lot of fun.
[38:58.180 --> 39:06.820]  And I also did a clay wizard study in Costa Rica, where I studied like predation rates
[39:07.460 --> 39:11.620]  in two different types of forest, primary and secondary forest.
[39:11.620 --> 39:15.300]  So both of those are different.
[39:15.300 --> 39:18.100]  But I enjoyed both for different reasons.
[39:20.660 --> 39:21.220]  I don't know.
[39:21.220 --> 39:22.500]  Should I like?
[39:23.060 --> 39:23.380]  Yeah.
[39:23.380 --> 39:26.980]  So like for the monkey one, like what were you guys looking at?
[39:27.780 --> 39:34.500]  So this group of monkeys were very unique in that they were both diurnal and nocturnal.
[39:34.500 --> 39:40.660]  So it was like a small group of monkeys that lived on essentially a farmland.
[39:41.700 --> 39:46.260]  And they've been studying those sets of monkeys for a very long time.
[39:47.460 --> 39:49.220]  Part of that was just behavioral.
[39:49.780 --> 39:52.660]  They are monogamous monkeys.
[39:54.740 --> 39:55.300]  Oh, goodness.
[39:55.300 --> 39:55.700]  What else?
[39:56.260 --> 39:57.860]  I know they analyze like hormones.
[39:57.860 --> 40:00.340]  So that's why we were collecting fecal matter for it.
[40:00.340 --> 40:08.660]  And I specifically was looking at changes in daytime patterns over time to see if it
[40:09.220 --> 40:12.260]  has adjusted with changing climate and whatnot.
[40:12.260 --> 40:13.700]  Essentially found that, yes, it had.
[40:14.980 --> 40:17.460]  But there's so many different projects around them.
[40:18.580 --> 40:24.420]  I don't recall what they did specifically with the hormones, but just witnessing, I
[40:24.420 --> 40:28.580]  think, some of the more behavior aspects, seeing like the dynamics between them, because
[40:28.580 --> 40:34.260]  they can have some like there were monogamous, but there would be instances where someone
[40:34.260 --> 40:35.940]  would come in like breaking the family.
[40:38.180 --> 40:39.780]  So there would be some drama.
[40:39.780 --> 40:40.280]  Yeah.
[40:41.300 --> 40:42.740]  Which was entertaining.
[40:42.740 --> 40:44.580]  I didn't actually know there was a time.
[40:44.580 --> 40:49.780]  I think I did see that happen once, but also just very entertaining because it's like a
[40:49.780 --> 40:53.780]  little like soap, like soap, drama, whatever.
[40:53.780 --> 40:54.280]  Yeah.
[40:54.280 --> 40:56.760]  Okay.
[40:56.760 --> 41:03.240]  So for that one, what you would like, like if it were to be a game, like how would you
[41:03.240 --> 41:04.280]  make it into a game?
[41:05.240 --> 41:06.280]  The collecting.
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.000]  So the collecting the poop, the poop, the fecal matter, whatever you want to call it
[41:11.000 --> 41:20.520]  was interesting because we had to specifically identify it with a specific individual specimen.
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.520]  So I think that's part of where the challenge could come into play.
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.720]  The best time to collect the poop was when they were right, like right waking up.
[41:30.520 --> 41:35.960]  They tend to sleep together in like little huddles where their tails will intertwine.
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.280]  It's very cute, but makes poop identification a little harder.
[41:40.280 --> 41:40.780]  Yeah.
[41:41.400 --> 41:47.000]  So I feel like having them make like it could be like a little mini game where they would
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.440]  like run around underneath underneath the monkeys and we're trying to catch the poop
[41:52.440 --> 41:59.000]  and be like, okay, I'm 50% sure this came from dilemma or like Dionysus.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.120]  They all started with Ds.
[42:00.120 --> 42:00.620]  We need people.
[42:02.120 --> 42:07.800]  That's so cute that like I imagine like a game where like you're saying like, so they're
[42:07.800 --> 42:15.560]  running in the treetops above you pooping and you have like three buckets that you're
[42:15.560 --> 42:22.600]  carrying and like depending on which one did the deed like as it's falling, you have to
[42:22.600 --> 42:23.640]  put up that bucket.
[42:25.320 --> 42:28.760]  And so you have like these three buckets and you're like, oh crap, I need to switch to
[42:29.400 --> 42:30.920]  the Dionysus bucket.
[42:32.520 --> 42:33.080]  Okay.
[42:33.080 --> 42:34.760]  Yeah, I would definitely play that.
[42:34.760 --> 42:35.720]  I haven't had a lot of fun.
[42:36.440 --> 42:38.920]  And like my brain goes to like all aspects of it.
[42:38.920 --> 42:46.680]  So then you would take it back to the lab and you would do the enzyme immunoassay that
[42:46.680 --> 42:54.280]  would get out the hormones so you could like gamify all of that somehow.
[42:54.920 --> 42:55.480]  Exactly.
[42:55.480 --> 43:00.760]  And I have like I can even see like a collections like a thing where you collect certain number
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.280]  of samples would unlock a different discovery or something.
[43:04.280 --> 43:12.840]  I could even see an aspect of it where you're playing as the monkey itself and you're courting
[43:13.720 --> 43:19.800]  the other monkey so you can have a romance component of it if it's switched from perspective,
[43:19.800 --> 43:20.440]  I guess.
[43:20.440 --> 43:21.160]  Yeah.
[43:21.160 --> 43:25.560]  Or you were just a monkey that was also doing research on your own species.
[43:25.560 --> 43:34.440]  Oh, one of the monkeys develops sentience and goes down below can communicate between.
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.800]  And this would have a component that Al would enjoy because you have the capability of breaking
[43:39.800 --> 43:40.360]  up couples.
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.120]  That's all I can get.
[43:46.120 --> 43:47.800]  I couldn't get over that episode.
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.160]  And then like, I also, whenever I think of research, because the other, the other thing
[43:55.160 --> 44:01.080]  about games is that they, they can teach you a lot about like what actually happens in
[44:01.080 --> 44:07.640]  real life, like the, the reality of it, or you can learn skills that you could then use.
[44:08.440 --> 44:13.480]  So my thought was like, you could have, you could then after you've collected enough samples,
[44:14.040 --> 44:19.720]  if you're trying to ask like a question, then you could run the stats.
[44:19.720 --> 44:26.680]  And I get like, it could be like a simplified version where you just say like, what is this?
[44:26.680 --> 44:29.480]  What is your variables?
[44:29.480 --> 44:30.840]  What is your dependent variable?
[44:30.840 --> 44:32.040]  What is your independent variable?
[44:32.040 --> 44:34.840]  And like, what are you, what is the question that you're asking?
[44:34.840 --> 44:37.800]  And then it would like run a program, like an R or something.
[44:37.800 --> 44:38.360]  Yeah.
[44:38.360 --> 44:45.080]  But like, you don't have to like do your own coding, but it would literally like be built
[44:45.080 --> 44:50.120]  into the game where it's like, this is like, you just give it answer.
[44:50.120 --> 44:55.480]  Like, this is what I, the information that I want is like, or are, is the stress levels
[44:55.480 --> 45:02.120]  between Dionysus and whatever, did they change before they broke up?
[45:04.920 --> 45:09.560]  We have all of this poop from before the breakup and a couple from after the breakup.
[45:09.560 --> 45:12.760]  And like, did the stress hormone levels change?
[45:12.760 --> 45:19.080]  I can also make a pitch for not like, not having the relationship aspect be the OWLs.
[45:19.080 --> 45:22.680]  Cause obviously like, you know, you could do that, but you could also do it from the
[45:22.680 --> 45:25.720]  researcher perspective because you're, you're stuck.
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.840]  Like this specific project, we were stuck on a farm that didn't have any like plumbing
[45:30.840 --> 45:33.800]  or anything for seven to 10 days at a time, usually.
[45:35.400 --> 45:41.400]  So like, we got very close, very, you know, personal and, you know, relationships.
[45:41.400 --> 45:47.880]  Relationships naturally start and, you know, can deteriorate our group, unfortunately,
[45:47.880 --> 45:49.800]  and not get, we had a lot of drama.
[45:50.920 --> 45:52.040]  So, yeah.
[45:53.400 --> 45:58.600]  So having like that aspect of it being like play out because you just spent a lot of time
[45:58.600 --> 46:00.200]  with the people that you're researching with.
[46:01.320 --> 46:04.840]  So there's, there's, I feel like there's a whole bunch of stuff you can do with stories
[46:05.400 --> 46:06.120]  with that alone.
[46:07.400 --> 46:07.900]  Yeah.
[46:07.900 --> 46:14.380]  Yeah, I'm trying to think, like, do you want to talk about your other one and, or should
[46:14.380 --> 46:15.580]  I talk about one of mine?
[46:15.580 --> 46:16.300]  You go for it.
[46:16.300 --> 46:16.800]  Okay.
[46:17.580 --> 46:22.700]  So I have two that I figured I could talk about as that, that we could like gamify.
[46:23.500 --> 46:25.580]  So I've done a lot of research.
[46:25.580 --> 46:29.340]  I've done research on deer and elk looking at camera traps.
[46:29.340 --> 46:36.140]  I've done research collecting frogs for surveys and doing like recording their, their little
[46:36.140 --> 46:38.620]  croaks.
[46:38.620 --> 46:47.180]  I've done research looking at the nesting habits of tree swallows and violet green swallows.
[46:47.180 --> 46:52.380]  But I think the two that I would want that I think would have the broadest applicability
[46:52.380 --> 46:59.580]  of a game would be like a point count style game.
[46:59.580 --> 47:07.980]  So I did a surveys, we went and did these surveys around these snags.
[47:07.980 --> 47:10.940]  So these are trees that have been dead for 25 years.
[47:10.940 --> 47:14.060]  Like they, they cut these trees 25 years ago.
[47:14.860 --> 47:19.580]  Like they topped them, which is just, they went 50 feet up and just was like, and so
[47:19.580 --> 47:22.540]  this tree just goes up and then goes nowhere and it's dead.
[47:22.540 --> 47:33.900]  And the whole point is to let it be a dead tree that wildlife could then use and see
[47:33.900 --> 47:37.260]  how it gets used by wildlife.
[47:37.260 --> 47:41.740]  So they did a survey like five years after something like that.
[47:42.460 --> 47:47.100]  They did a survey five years after to see how the trees have been used.
[47:47.100 --> 47:50.540]  Like, were there any cavities that were made by any birds?
[47:50.540 --> 47:55.020]  And then we went back, it was like 25 years later and we did the same thing.
[47:55.020 --> 48:00.220]  So we did these, like, you get to the tree, you look up and down, you see, is anyone using
[48:00.220 --> 48:02.060]  the tree and you record that.
[48:02.060 --> 48:05.980]  And then we would do these point counts where we sit for 15 minutes.
[48:06.620 --> 48:10.540]  I think it was like seven minutes on either side of the tree or something like that.
[48:10.540 --> 48:14.460]  And you just listen and you see if you hear any birds.
[48:15.020 --> 48:16.060]  So that's one of them.
[48:16.060 --> 48:22.060]  So that's one of them and then the other thing that we could, the other research project
[48:22.060 --> 48:25.260]  that I've done, I guess it's not like a specific research project.
[48:25.260 --> 48:31.340]  I've done a lot of research projects with bees and specifically looking at bees in forests
[48:31.340 --> 48:36.060]  and trying to see if there's certain habitat characteristics within forests that are good
[48:36.060 --> 48:37.020]  for bees.
[48:37.020 --> 48:43.820]  So this consists of doing a survey for bees, doing a survey for flowers and then catching
[48:43.820 --> 48:47.180]  some bees so that we can identify them.
[48:47.180 --> 48:50.220]  Because bees are so freaking small, they fly super fast.
[48:50.220 --> 48:51.260]  We can't identify them.
[48:51.260 --> 48:54.860]  As I mentioned earlier, there's over 4,000 species across North America.
[48:55.900 --> 48:59.020]  Each state has usually around four or 500.
[48:59.740 --> 49:01.500]  Pennsylvania has like 437.
[49:03.500 --> 49:08.700]  So you're not going to be able, unless it's like the biggest bumblebee and she lands on
[49:08.700 --> 49:11.180]  your finger in front of you and flashes all of her colors.
[49:11.180 --> 49:17.260]  You're not going to see and know from a visual survey who you're seeing.
[49:17.260 --> 49:20.460]  So we catch them and then we identify them and stuff.
[49:20.460 --> 49:27.580]  So for the point count research, I could see a super simple game and it could be, it doesn't
[49:27.580 --> 49:30.140]  even have to be like a research aspect game.
[49:30.140 --> 49:34.860]  It could just be a birding game because people loved bird and it could be a game that teaches
[49:34.860 --> 49:35.580]  you bird song.
[49:36.540 --> 49:38.380]  I would love that.
[49:38.380 --> 49:42.060]  I would be all over that because I want to learn more bird calls.
[49:42.060 --> 49:45.820]  But how do I go about doing it?
[49:45.820 --> 49:46.540]  Yeah.
[49:46.540 --> 49:50.940]  And so, I mean, if you're wanting to learn bird song right now, there's a website called
[49:50.940 --> 49:51.900]  Lark Wire.
[49:54.940 --> 49:59.820]  You can do like the, there's like a free version or whatever, but it's super limited.
[49:59.820 --> 50:01.740]  And I think it like kicks you out eventually.
[50:01.740 --> 50:07.260]  But you can pay, it's only like 20 bucks and it gives you like all of the birds of North
[50:07.260 --> 50:13.180]  America and you, it then basically provides you with these like flashcards.
[50:13.180 --> 50:19.660]  And so it gives you like four or five birds at a time and you click each bird until you
[50:19.660 --> 50:21.260]  think you have the sound down.
[50:21.260 --> 50:25.660]  You're like, you're gonna be like, yeah, I know which song goes to which bird.
[50:25.660 --> 50:29.500]  And then you tell it that you want to take a test and then it just gives you, it's like
[50:29.500 --> 50:33.100]  plays one of those birds and then you have to choose one.
[50:33.100 --> 50:36.700]  And then it's either like, yeah, you got it or no, you need to try again.
[50:36.700 --> 50:40.060]  And it just does that until you've gotten enough correctly.
[50:40.700 --> 50:41.500]  Amazing.
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.100]  I want this right now.
[50:43.100 --> 50:48.860]  And they're advertising themselves as a complete game-based learning system for mastering bird
[50:48.860 --> 50:50.540]  sounds and visual identification.
[50:50.540 --> 50:56.460]  And I love you, Cody, for telling me about this because I'm going to be obsessed.
[50:57.020 --> 50:59.740]  Yeah, I really like Lark Wire.
[50:59.740 --> 51:10.140]  I am pretty sure I have it for my, I have it for PC, not for Mac, which is sad.
[51:10.140 --> 51:14.860]  And there's an app where you can get on the iPhone.
[51:15.740 --> 51:16.620]  Amazing.
[51:16.620 --> 51:20.860]  Still sad because I need to, yeah, super good.
[51:22.220 --> 51:27.660]  But I mean, something that's like where you are a like, not an NPC, but like you're a
[51:27.660 --> 51:31.980]  character walking through a forest and you could have like the first few times that you
[51:31.980 --> 51:37.420]  go, you go with a, uh, an expert and, or you pay the expert.
[51:38.540 --> 51:39.020]  Okay.
[51:39.020 --> 51:44.140]  So it'd also be really cool if there's some way in the game for you to get money and then
[51:44.140 --> 51:50.620]  you can use the money to go on guided tours and then you could be like, I know what this
[51:50.620 --> 51:51.180]  is.
[51:51.180 --> 51:52.140]  I love that.
[51:52.140 --> 51:57.740]  So you're essentially like almost, I could see you maybe like being like working on a
[51:57.740 --> 51:59.180]  visitor center, essentially.
[51:59.740 --> 52:04.780]  And you could, your, your, your job is essentially being like a park ranger.
[52:04.780 --> 52:06.300]  I need this game right now.
[52:06.300 --> 52:06.860]  Right.
[52:06.860 --> 52:07.260]  Right.
[52:07.260 --> 52:11.500]  And you're like, you know, curating like different, like relationships with the people
[52:11.500 --> 52:14.220]  you're working with and the people, your customers.
[52:14.220 --> 52:14.860]  Yeah.
[52:14.860 --> 52:18.700]  Your income is essentially how well you can identify the birds.
[52:19.340 --> 52:20.140]  Oh my gosh.
[52:20.140 --> 52:25.020]  And then, yeah, you can have like, maybe, maybe with that one, then you could like invite
[52:25.980 --> 52:31.180]  birders that are more experienced and then they can, and like you go with them on these
[52:31.180 --> 52:32.220]  walks with people.
[52:33.100 --> 52:33.580]  Yeah.
[52:33.580 --> 52:37.420]  And then like, you get to learn and then you can take people on walks and be like, oh,
[52:37.420 --> 52:38.460]  did you hear that?
[52:38.460 --> 52:40.700]  It's the stellar Shay.
[52:40.700 --> 52:41.660]  Oh, did you hear that?
[52:41.660 --> 52:45.420]  Oh, look, you see this hole in the way that it is and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[52:45.420 --> 52:48.620]  Like this is, it's probably this kind of bird cause it's this size.
[52:48.620 --> 52:50.300]  Uh huh.
[52:50.300 --> 52:57.900]  It would be amazing if it was like IRL, like, like famous, like, or, I can't, ornithologist.
[52:57.900 --> 52:58.620]  Ornithologist.
[52:58.620 --> 52:58.940]  Yeah.
[52:58.940 --> 52:59.440]  Yes.
[52:59.820 --> 53:05.100]  Like there's like different like tiers and levels where you have to be able to successfully
[53:05.100 --> 53:09.980]  identify a certain number before you can have like the prestige or whatever, to be able
[53:09.980 --> 53:13.660]  to ask for tutoring from one specific person.
[53:13.660 --> 53:15.020]  That would be really cool.
[53:15.020 --> 53:15.740]  Right.
[53:15.740 --> 53:21.740]  And I feel like people would play it not just for the like run a nature center, but also
[53:21.740 --> 53:23.420]  from the, I want to learn birds.
[53:24.060 --> 53:24.780]  Yeah.
[53:24.780 --> 53:25.260]  Yeah.
[53:25.260 --> 53:26.700]  I want to learn.
[53:26.700 --> 53:31.500]  I would pay like larkware money right now so I can learn it.
[53:31.500 --> 53:35.820]  But if I could do so in a way that it's fun, I'm here for it.
[53:36.540 --> 53:42.140]  And I mean, imagine like there are so many opportunities for downloadable content because
[53:43.340 --> 53:45.100]  you so many birds.
[53:45.100 --> 53:45.980]  There's so many birds.
[53:45.980 --> 53:51.340]  And you could have like, like, you're the first time that the game comes out, it's spring.
[53:52.220 --> 53:58.700]  And then you have the like summer season and then you have the fall migration season and
[53:58.700 --> 54:07.740]  then amazing or another DLC that you could have is like, go to a different visitor center
[54:07.740 --> 54:10.140]  in like a different state to try and help them.
[54:10.860 --> 54:13.740]  And there's completely different birds like some of the birds are gonna be the same,
[54:13.740 --> 54:15.740]  but some of the birds are gonna be different.
[54:15.740 --> 54:18.220]  Like you could have quest lines essentially.
[54:18.220 --> 54:18.860]  Yeah.
[54:18.860 --> 54:25.740]  For different visitor centers around the nation as you become more and more like famous for
[54:25.740 --> 54:28.140]  your birding skills, I guess.
[54:28.140 --> 54:34.540]  I can imagine a quest where like a visitor just went on a hike in your area and comes
[54:34.540 --> 54:36.540]  to you and is like, Hey, I saw this.
[54:36.540 --> 54:38.540]  I saw a bird that looked like this.
[54:38.540 --> 54:43.820]  And you can show like you, you have like a journal that you've been curating with everything
[54:43.820 --> 54:45.900]  that you know, and you can be like, is it this one?
[54:45.900 --> 54:47.980]  And if they're like, no, it was a little bit different than that.
[54:47.980 --> 54:52.140]  Because if like, if you're wrong, if you guessed incorrectly or something, and then maybe if
[54:52.140 --> 54:56.220]  you guessed incorrectly, like three times, then they're like, you know, I just it's not
[54:56.220 --> 54:58.460]  in your book, you haven't seen it yet.
[54:58.460 --> 55:01.740]  And then you know that you need to go wherever they were.
[55:01.740 --> 55:05.500]  And you need to find that bird because it's a bird you've not seen yet.
[55:06.300 --> 55:07.180]  I love this.
[55:07.180 --> 55:08.700]  I love this.
[55:08.700 --> 55:09.500]  I love this.
[55:09.500 --> 55:15.260]  And I feel like this this idea could be turned into like, you can like you can change it
[55:15.260 --> 55:20.780]  to plants like change it to from a visual from a like an auditory like identification
[55:20.780 --> 55:26.300]  change it to a visual identification for different flowers or grasses.
[55:26.300 --> 55:31.820]  And I hear grasses are like the worst like the the hardest things to identify.
[55:31.820 --> 55:32.320]  Yeah.
[55:32.320 --> 55:37.280]  But you know, do trees because that could be a lot easier.
[55:37.280 --> 55:38.160]  I want this.
[55:38.160 --> 55:39.200]  I want this.
[55:39.200 --> 55:40.240]  I want this.
[55:40.240 --> 55:41.840]  I can supply the content.
[55:41.840 --> 55:42.880]  Yep, game devs.
[55:45.920 --> 55:48.880]  I can't make a game, but I could supply a lot of content.
[55:48.880 --> 55:54.320]  I want to learn coding so I can make a game for this reason because I have an idea of
[55:54.320 --> 55:59.520]  essentially gamifying something else like wastewater treatment plants that I feel like
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.560]  there's there's capability of making that gamified.
[56:04.560 --> 56:05.440]  Please talk.
[56:05.440 --> 56:05.920]  Tell us.
[56:05.920 --> 56:06.560]  Tell us more.
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.240]  Well, I haven't obviously put in a lot of like thought into it, but essentially you're
[56:12.240 --> 56:16.400]  wastewater operator and you're running a treatment plant and you have to learn how to, you know,
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.840]  run the system, learn all the different parts, the intake, you know, clarifiers, what have
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.440]  you, and also learn like the different like levels, like optimal levels for running the
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.920]  plant, you know, different like oxygen or pH or what have you.
[56:31.920 --> 56:35.760]  What do the bugs, the bugs of the bacteria, that's like just a colloquial thing in the
[56:35.760 --> 56:36.480]  industry.
[56:36.480 --> 56:39.520]  Like what do the bugs particularly like in this treatment plant?
[56:40.960 --> 56:47.360]  And like there could be like storm surges or like usually during storms there's a lot
[56:47.360 --> 56:51.200]  of like I and I or inflow and I forget what the other I's say.
[56:52.400 --> 56:56.480]  But like a whole bunch of water comes in all of a sudden and can like, you know, shock
[56:56.480 --> 57:01.120]  your system because you have too much water now or someone dumped like a can of paint
[57:01.120 --> 57:02.960]  into, you know, their sewer.
[57:03.840 --> 57:10.000]  So there's challenges that I could see being involved with how to make sure your wastewater
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  treatment plant is operating great.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.840]  So you're not polluting the waters.
[57:14.640 --> 57:20.960]  I could see that being a whole game where like it's just about water and clean water
[57:20.960 --> 57:27.120]  and cleaning water like in different areas and you start like your base camp is the wastewater
[57:27.840 --> 57:28.640]  place.
[57:28.640 --> 57:33.840]  But then you might also get like phone calls of people being like, hey, this stream is
[57:33.840 --> 57:34.400]  hacked up.
[57:36.800 --> 57:40.480]  And then you could go out to the stream and be like, yep, she is hacked up.
[57:40.480 --> 57:47.520]  And then you can do some like tests that you've learned about in your wastewater treatment
[57:47.520 --> 57:48.000]  place.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.880]  And I might be butchering this, I'm sorry.
[57:50.880 --> 57:52.000]  You know better than I do.
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.600]  I think you're fine.
[57:53.600 --> 58:00.320]  But like wait and then you could say like, oh, here's how this water is polluted and
[58:00.320 --> 58:02.240]  here's what we need to do to fix it.
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.720]  And then you could like higher copper levels or whatever.
[58:06.240 --> 58:11.200]  Or like a lot of place a lot of places out here in Pennsylvania have acid mine drainage.
[58:11.200 --> 58:17.280]  So like talking about that or talking about, you know, streams that don't have enough oxygen.
[58:17.280 --> 58:22.880]  And so there's a lot of algae or something, you know, there's a lot so much you can do
[58:22.880 --> 58:23.360]  with this.
[58:23.360 --> 58:31.840]  Yeah, so much just like you just a game about water quality and the ways that you can improve
[58:31.840 --> 58:37.760]  water quality and the way the water that we use, aka the water treatment plant or the
[58:37.760 --> 58:45.120]  water that's in natural areas that we that gets messed up by us also exactly.
[58:45.120 --> 58:54.240]  I think I can recall actually one one someone I think partner with AWWA, which is American
[58:54.240 --> 58:58.400]  American Water Works Association Works Association.
[58:58.400 --> 58:59.280]  I think so.
[58:59.280 --> 59:04.000]  I'm going to say I think I'm pretty sure they came out with an app that I discovered like
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.120]  last September or something.
[59:05.120 --> 59:08.560]  So I have to go back and look at it and it seemed like a city builder, but there's so
[59:08.560 --> 59:12.960]  much you can do in the world of water, like infrastructure or even water quality.
[59:12.960 --> 59:18.720]  And I am specifically like I want to create a water quality game because there is a need
[59:18.720 --> 59:24.880]  for more like for a workforce need like 50 over 50 percent of the people are within retiring
[59:24.880 --> 59:25.840]  age at this point.
[59:25.840 --> 59:31.360]  So like our water infrastructure is it's very important and if everyone's like all the
[59:31.360 --> 59:36.160]  knowledge is retiring, then like who's going to make sure we get we have clean water to
[59:36.160 --> 59:38.960]  drink and, you know, excrete.
[59:38.960 --> 59:42.400]  Yeah, we use it every day.
[59:42.400 --> 59:43.400]  Uh-huh.
[59:43.400 --> 59:44.400]  Uh-huh.
[59:44.400 --> 59:45.400]  But I digress.
[59:45.400 --> 59:48.160]  No, I think that's a really good like the rest of this.
[59:48.160 --> 59:51.840]  That was one of the things I was going to ask about for me, because from your perspective,
[59:51.840 --> 59:58.000]  because I know that you do work with water in this game, like I just work with bees that
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:08.760]  I don't know, it's I always like I always think about a zombie apocalypse situation.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:15.920]  I had a story in my mind of of being a wastewater treatment plant in a zombie apocalypse.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920]  Yes, you need it.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]  You need it.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.600]  Because that's the thing is like so it is you are very high value in a waste in a zombie
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.600]  apocalypse.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.600]  I am not.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.200]  I mean, you could identify like I think I feel like plants and like birds and stuff
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:37.880]  that I can't and that that is not going to do you find edible things like know what's
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.840]  poisonous and what's not.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.800]  I know a little bit of that, but like because most of the time it's it's insects.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:52.580]  It's like this do you want to know what kind of bee this is in an apocalypse situation?
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:59.580]  People are going to be like, we need food to be like, but you just learn how to like
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.880]  grow like how many plants like 500.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880]  That's true.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880]  I did.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880]  I did plant.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.880]  I did 500 plants.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.120]  Your skills are definitely transferable to apocalypse.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120]  Okay.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.000]  I feel like we're I don't know what our topic is, but I am enjoying this conversation.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.240]  No, no, no.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:23.640]  I think it's now I'm envisioning a game that's about a zombie apocalypse and you're a waste
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.640]  for a dream.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640]  Yes.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.640]  Yes.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640]  Yes.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640]  Game devs come to us.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.080]  What else do you pitch ideas?
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.520]  What else do you need?
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:39.280]  Like what someone who's a hunter someone who knows like like you said like a forager knows
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:44.480]  what to forage and what to eat and what's not like a carpenter who can build things.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:51.200]  Probably a blacksmith, but like honestly, he knows the the art of blacksmith thing at
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.200]  this age.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.200]  Yeah.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.920]  It's a bit advanced at this point.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.720]  Okay.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.720]  And then my last idea, my last idea is the bees.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:12.760]  So I would love a game that is all about kind of restoring like a prairie or restoring an
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:19.880]  area that you know used to have a good amount of bees or a good like healthy like insect
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.540]  population in general.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.340]  But it doesn't anymore.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:30.840]  And you know, so you would have to look, you'd have to do a survey in that area, but also
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.760]  in like the area surrounding that area to see, okay, there's like what bees exist here
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:43.680]  now and what do they need that could improve their lives?
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.560]  Like do you have just bumblebees?
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.320]  And so you just need to create more like cavities for them.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:57.040]  Do you have small carpenter bees which are called the genus Ceratina?
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:04.980]  So does that mean that you need to make sure that you leave grass and like reeds and sticks
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:10.280]  that they can go down into and create little nests in and make sure that you don't disturb
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280]  those?
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.080]  Like because some areas people are like, you know, burn the area so that all of this vegetation
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.080]  can come back up.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:22.720]  But what if like there were a ton of little baby Ceratina and all that grass that you
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.460]  just burned?
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:30.000]  So but so it would be the game would be about like recording what is there now.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.920]  So doing some type of survey and getting the information of what is there now.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:44.400]  And it's honestly, it's like Zoo Tycoon because in Zoo Tycoon you're given some animals at
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.240]  first and you have to be like, okay, what does this thing need?
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.320]  And then you have to like and you have some areas that you like build for them.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.800]  So you'd be like, okay, I need to make sure that this area has this for this thing, this
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.160]  for this thing, and this for this thing.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:06.880]  And then you would look at what's like in the area, say that someone has built a pollinator
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.720]  meadow very close, but not the poll.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.000]  There are pollinators that are using that that are not using your meadow.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.640]  You can kind of do like a brief survey there, see what's there and then say, oh, the reason
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.400]  that the bees from this meadow aren't coming over here, over to my like area that I'm trying
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.960]  to recover is because I don't have enough bare ground, like they need sand.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:39.880]  So it'd be like all about kind of building like a natural area for these insects and
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.920]  kind of like in Zoo Tycoon after a while, you're so well, you're so good at what you're
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.640]  doing that they'll give you endangered things.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:53.440]  They'll be like, okay, you can have this now.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.280]  So maybe like throughout the game, like every now and then you'd see something that was
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:04.920]  new and you'd be like, okay, this like, why is this here and how do I make it stay?
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.080]  For a lot of the butterflies, it would be about planting larval host plants.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.200]  So milkweed, for example, that's how you get monarchs.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:18.620]  Or you could look and be like, oh, man, like, I really want this one butterfly.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.240]  It needs lupins.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:26.560]  And so then you would plant lupins, like lupin flowers, and then you could possibly get that
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560]  butterfly.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.360]  So it would be all about that and creating that.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.480]  But also about like the, you know, identification.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.600]  I don't know how to like do like an identification minigame where you go and you collect like
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.680]  one and then you have like a 3D model and it's like, how many?
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.080]  I can't even think of an easy way to say this.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.800]  How many submarginal cells does it have on the wing?
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.080]  How many does it have an aureole?
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.960]  Like does it have, which is like a little footy, footy pad in between its tarsal claws
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.600]  that helps it grip things.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]  Does it have that?
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.900]  Does it like how many stripes on this back?
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:05.900]  What color is it?
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.800]  Like all of these things are things that I use to identify bees all the time.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:15.000]  Having like a little 3D minigame of like, okay, here's your thing.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  Count the segments.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.900]  Yeah, count the antenna, count the antenna segments, like manipulate the specimen.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.900]  And so you can count the antenna segments.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.900]  Do this, do that.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.900]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.900]  I think it'd be so cool.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:33.000]  Even if they only had like a hundred, like five, like a very small number because of
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.040]  the work to animate all these different species.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:43.760]  See, the cool thing is that like, there are some things that like, I think there's a Cincinnati
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:52.840]  or Cleveland zoo, like one of those actually has a 3D images of 3D microscopic images of
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.480]  insects that you can use.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:01.120]  That's so your work is already like halfway done, you can just use those models.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.560]  I love this.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.600]  And like, honestly, this is, this is how identification works.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.040]  Like you, you like take note of different qualities and then you like X out like, okay,
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.920]  it can't be the species because it only has like this number of like segments or I'm thinking
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.760]  more specifically of plants and trees.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.760]  Yeah.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.160]  I mean, you could do it for plants too.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.720]  Like you could see like, okay, what plants are here?
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.380]  Like you could have like a clicker, that's a bee clicker that like is so you'll only
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:32.240]  click bees and then you'd have one that's like a, like another mode that you're like,
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.200]  I want to know what plant this is.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.960]  Like what plant do I need to plant here?
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.340]  What, what do I need to do?
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.120]  And then you could be looking at the herbarium specimen.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:45.960]  Cody, I feel like we need to like quit our jobs and learn coding so that we can create
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:46.960]  these games ourselves.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.880]  You know what would be funny is if we made these games and we were so proud of ourselves
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.160]  and then like two people bought it.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.480]  It would be us.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.040]  Like, I could see so many like farming games already have components of these.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.760]  Like you already make like Zoo Tycoon has this, like, like planting Pacific flowers
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:14.720]  to track different types of honey and stardew.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:20.720]  So like there's elements and Slime Rancher, I also thought of Slime Rancher, I think I
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:26.760]  believe you could create different dens or creature like things or whatever they're called
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.480]  for different types of slimes.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:32.280]  So like these, this is all there, but we could make it so it's real.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:37.920]  So people can like actually learn from these game mechanics that already exist.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:38.920]  Yeah.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.680]  You could also do a protein lipid, not protein lipid, well, I mean, you can do that too,
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.580]  but a pollinator plant pollinator networks.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:54.440]  So you could catch like a little bee and scrape off her pollen, like just the pollen that
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:00.340]  she has on her at that moment and then do a palynology, which is looking at the pollen
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:05.600]  under a microscope to see what kind of pollen she had, because then, you know, if like,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.040]  for example, if you had a super rare bee and you're like, okay, what is, what does this
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]  bee using?
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.720]  Like, what is she collecting pollen on?
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.520]  And then you could do this, you could get her pollen and see, and then you'd be like,
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.840]  okay, she really wants this echinacea.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.760]  I need to plant a million more of this echinacea.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760]  Yeah.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.760]  Because that's what she wants.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.920]  And that's the kind of stuff that I can do.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.360]  Like this is stuff that I do.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:37.920]  Looking and seeing what bees prefer in a habitat, seeing if they like, do they like more shrubs?
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.120]  Do they like more bare ground?
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.720]  Do they like more of X, Y, Z?
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:47.720]  And then make, like, once I figure out, you know, who likes what and what's the best for,
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:56.740]  you know, for all parts, then I try and educate people about what to do on their properties.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.680]  Like change this one thing, like, hey, your property is all ferns.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.880]  That's not great.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:09.400]  It looks really pretty for a little bit of the of the year, but it's not great for bees.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.360]  It's not great for a lot of insects.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.700]  So maybe have a part of it that isn't just ferns, you know, something like that.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.700]  So yeah,
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.800]  There's so much you could do so much.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.840]  And like, I'm now like envisioning like a way to like gamify like chemistry, like mixing
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:32.520]  potions is essentially what like you do for chemistry.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:39.040]  There's just different methods and like, create a little game of like minigame for like titration
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040]  or something.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040]  I don't know.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.680]  We there's, there's so many things we could do.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.680]  Yeah.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.920]  There are options, that is for sure.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920]  Uh huh.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.240]  Uh, yeah, I mean, so that's pretty much all I really am.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.240]  Uh huh.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.960]  I mean, I can come up with like, I feel like a million more ideas and some of it from just
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.080]  like the work that I've done.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.880]  Like even like I worked at a smell, taste and scent like smell and taste center and
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.080]  like you could do like little samples on people's tongues and make a minigame of like making
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:17.360]  sure you put the right drop on the right part of the tongue for a taste sample.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  Yeah.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360]  It's bananas.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.360]  Uh huh.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360]  Thanks.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  Thanks so much.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]  Thanks so much.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:29.720]  And like people love playing games, but I just want passive, like education.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720]  Yeah.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.120]  This is what I want.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.480]  I don't have time to take a course, but I want to be able to play games and have fun
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.480]  and also learn.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:45.320]  Yeah, I want to be sitting on my couch pretending that I'm owning a visitor center in a state
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.960]  park and then go to that state park and be like, I know all of this.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960]  Right?
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960]  Right.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960]  Exactly.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.960]  I learned this.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.640]  Like I learned about this bird in this game.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:06.880]  So game devs hire us or alternatively, uh, Yosemite or Yellowstone or whatever hire us
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:18.040]  as the, cause I mean, it would just take someone who is like a naturalist or a forester, like
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]  you said.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.760]  Um, what did you say?
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.600]  A park ranger, someone who knows the area, like that's who you just need to talk to.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:30.800]  Like what are, what are the, what is the flora and fauna of the area and like, it is their
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.800]  job essentially.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.800]  It is.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.800]  It's literally their job.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]  Yeah.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800]  This is their job.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.040]  They're happy to.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.040]  Cool.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:45.840]  Well, Bev, where can listeners find you on the, on the websites and the interwebs?
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:55.800]  I am pretty much everywhere at, uh, bevgranger711, oh, so P-E-V-G-R-A-N-G-E-R, 7-1-1, um, Twitter,
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:00.600]  Instagram, uh, Macedon, what have you, um, how about you, Cody?
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:11.040]  I am on, uh, Instagram at hikingbeagle, uh, beagle is B-E-E-G-A-N-G-E.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.400]  Someone recently said that I should do that recently and I was like, yeah, yeah, I should.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.160]  I think it was during the last time we talked, cause I remember you talking about that.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:29.240]  I was like, yeah, uh, so I did it and, um, and then, uh, Twitter at Cody Mathis, just
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.600]  my name, um, I am not on Macedon yet.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.160]  If, if Twitter shuts down, I'm just going to be gone.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.160]  I don't have enough time.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.720]  I am slowly trying to migrate, but it's very slow.
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.720]  Yeah.
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.680]  Um, you can find the podcast, um, on Twitter at THSPOD.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.400]  If you want to give us any feedback, um, or see the show notes or anything, so you can
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.480]  see links of the stuff that we've talked about.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.680]  Um, that is all at harvestseason.club.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:04.800]  Um, I know that recently we were talking about how we want more feedback or more questions.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:12.100]  Like if people send in questions, uh, for us to talk about, then situations like this
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.680]  where we were like, well, wait, what do we, what do we talk about?
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.260]  We would have like a back, like a backlog of questions available.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:25.600]  So to give answers to what you want to know, or even ideas, if you have like ideas like
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.400]  our, like we just talked about today, I do want to know people's ideas of how, like,
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:37.340]  if you are a, if you're a researcher, if you're not a researcher, if you are a, if you work
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:42.280]  at an Amazon factory, I don't even know how would you game a fire job?
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:49.120]  Um, you can follow the podcast, uh, on Patreon at patreon.com slash THSPOD.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.720]  Um, yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.240]  Thank you Bev for joining me.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240]  Thank you.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.200]  This is so much fun.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:05.720]  And tune in for part two, where we actually discuss research, story of the game, the actual
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:15.200]  game that we both have and downloaded to play more of, and hopefully we'll be able to critique
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:25.040]  like how well they did it now that we've laid all this out there, um, and maybe, maybe from
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.000]  playing the game, we'll have more ideas.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  I think so.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Okay.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:40.240]  Well, until next time, have a good harvest.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.360]  The Harvest Season is created by Al McKinley with support from our patrons, including our
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.600]  pro farmers, Kevin and Stuart.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:54.560]  Our art is done by Micah the Brave and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.680]  Feel free to visit our website, harvest season.club for show notes and links to things we discussed
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:02.400]  in this episode.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:14.320]  Um, I mean, I'm going to be playing research story on it, so yeah, I struggle with that
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.680]  a little bit because I am exclusively playing PC games on my steam deck at this point.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:26.520]  I found a way to make that work with research story so far, but it is, I, I look forward
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:31.840]  to controller compatibility in the future because it is not as fun to play with.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:38.800]  That's a peeking behind the curtain for people who might want to listen to research story
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800]  later.
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.480]  You're giving away the secrets already.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]  Oh my goodness.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.880]  I mean, who knows by the time we cover it, who knows what's going to happen?
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.880]  Yeah.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.440]  So much could have changed by that.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.440]  I don't know.
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.440]  I'll cut this.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:22.160]  He's not going to, he's going to spitefully keep it in.
