[00:50.080 --> 00:52.560]  oh man this is going to be a dreadful episode to level
[00:53.920 --> 00:58.000]  it's okay every time i get loud i move away from the mic isn't that we're supposed to do
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.040]  yeah okay sure i'm being a good noodle hi cody how you doing i'm good i
[01:06.080 --> 01:14.800]  passed my comps whoo that means that i have no more tests no more anything for at least two
[01:14.800 --> 01:20.240]  years and that they've acknowledged that i'm a good noodle and then i can get the stuff done
[01:20.240 --> 01:25.680]  oh so this isn't the phd finished no this is the middle this is basically me like showing so i
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.800]  basically in my program comps is show your committee what you're planning to do and they
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.640]  ask you a heck ton of questions to make sure that you understand what you're doing yeah um and ask
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.280]  you a ton of questions to like make sure that you are a good a good noodle so some people if you do
[01:47.280 --> 01:53.520]  not pass your comps they'll just say hey just get a master's instead like you're not at the level
[01:54.160 --> 02:00.160]  to be able to get a phd um but i am at that level and they said that i did a great job
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.760]  and that i am all set and if i do everything the way that i've outlined it in my proposal
[02:06.640 --> 02:11.440]  i will pass with flying colors yeah so now they can leave me alone and i can get stuff done for
[02:11.440 --> 02:17.120]  the next two years and i don't have to prove myself anymore so this is when the real work
[02:17.120 --> 02:22.560]  begins that's what you're saying yeah this is when i like nose to the grindstone but it's working
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.360]  with a lot of specimens and i really like working with mine how are you uh i am i'm doing doing
[02:27.360 --> 02:33.120]  all right yeah um at least i currently am uh who knows what i'll be like in two months when this
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.880]  episode comes out yeah when this episode comes out you'll be in the middle of vacation right
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.720]  your holiday and no i'll actually this one this one's coming out when i'm when i'm back
[02:41.440 --> 02:47.040]  but i didn't really want to record and release an episode in two days so that's fair that's fair
[02:47.360 --> 02:53.920]  uh yeah so i mean that's good that's uh i'm you know current owl not currently recording but
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.120]  current in the in the time that this is out is probably very hopefully but also very like
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.320]  uh i'm not ready to come back to work yet great uh uh we forgot to mention that transcripts are
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.520]  available in the show notes and on the website um you're trying to take over my job a little bit
[03:11.920 --> 03:19.360]  a little bit uh this um we've just i hope you enjoyed fishing month and fishing month is now
[03:19.360 --> 03:26.800]  over but i thought i would end my holiday with an episode um which is i'm calling game of the
[03:26.800 --> 03:34.720]  podcast year so every year we do a game of the year episode um but because this is a farming game
[03:35.440 --> 03:42.000]  what's the word i'm looking for podcast and the games that we generally play
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.000]  generally have years that last the four months and then each season of this podcast
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.840]  is 26 episodes and is a month well not a month a season we have had well now this is we've actually
[03:55.840 --> 04:01.520]  had five seasons but when i thought this up we had had four seasons therefore a full year therefore
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.200]  we're going to talk about our favorite game of the podcast year as in in this case four years
[04:07.200 --> 04:13.600]  man that was so much more complicated than it needed to be okay so basically like in 2019 when
[04:13.600 --> 04:20.160]  the episode when the podcast started that would have been spring yeah 2020 was summer yeah very
[04:20.160 --> 04:27.120]  bad summer 2021 would have been fall and then 2022 would have been winter so we are now in 2023 so it
[04:27.120 --> 04:36.160]  is now time for us to look back on the last quote year but it's actually four years and it's not
[04:36.160 --> 04:42.320]  actually the last year it's delayed it's delayed by nearly eight months well we needed some time
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.720]  to like think about it you know let's not pretend like we would be thinking about it
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.080]  we went what games do we like these games great
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.800]  we will talk about that in a few minutes
[04:56.640 --> 05:02.960]  um oh my word i need a holiday so this episode has no news because obviously we are recording
[05:02.960 --> 05:07.840]  out of time because i'm on holiday uh it's not quite two months because we delayed the recording
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.720]  it's like a month and a half so about a month and a half out of date so if we've not mentioned any
[05:12.720 --> 05:17.680]  ridiculously interesting news don't worry it will be in the next episode the next episode will be
[05:17.680 --> 05:24.400]  a live not live episode it'll be an in-time episode we'll cover some news in the next
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.320]  that's all we'll cover the next episode will just be news right i'm not i'm not doing anything else
[05:28.320 --> 05:36.640]  for life i cannot believe that that one game producer did that one thing it's news that's
[05:36.640 --> 05:44.000]  gonna happen so we're just gonna talk about that except first of all cody what have you been up to
[05:44.960 --> 05:51.440]  annoying the crap out of you man what have you had been up to i have had been up to um
[05:52.560 --> 06:03.600]  so back it back in june the now recording but the months ago um i uh defended or oh my gosh
[06:03.600 --> 06:08.400]  passed my comms which i already talked about and now i'm like nose to the grindstones i'm
[06:08.400 --> 06:13.520]  going to be doing a lot of specimen work um but also that kind of like frees up time to
[06:13.520 --> 06:20.000]  play video games which i'm super excited about so i just got game pass so i want to play uh
[06:20.000 --> 06:25.360]  farming simulator i want to play disney dreamlight valley there's another game that like it popped up
[06:25.360 --> 06:28.720]  it was like will you suggest this game for you and i was like oh yeah i want to play that but i
[06:28.720 --> 06:33.360]  can't remember for the life of me right now also remember remember this episode is coming out after
[06:33.360 --> 06:38.320]  all the other episodes so you can refer to episodes that will have already been out by
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.320]  this point okay so you can talk about the fact that you're doing a film farming simulator one
[06:42.320 --> 06:45.760]  yet because it's already happened that's i mean that's the only one i mean i wanted to i want to
[06:45.760 --> 06:50.320]  talk about disney dreamlight valley but we'll wait for that for one for the 1.0 release which
[06:50.320 --> 06:55.040]  was at some point in the maybe that'll be one of the news items we talk about next week
[06:57.520 --> 07:01.360]  and then we can have that on the thing so we could do a second harvest of disney dreamlight valley
[07:01.360 --> 07:09.440]  and i'll have played that um yeah that that's oh i got i really got into this tetris game on my phone
[07:10.560 --> 07:16.800]  that i mentioned um i think in the last episode it's literally just the tetris game like it's
[07:16.800 --> 07:24.000]  just called like tetris um oh by by the tetris company like there's there's no it's not it's
[07:24.000 --> 07:30.000]  not like a second hand thing or whatever but you can earn points that you can then put towards like
[07:30.000 --> 07:36.720]  in real life rewards the rewards are really like few and far between so it's it's like this one
[07:36.720 --> 07:45.120]  high-end restaurant lets you have free beignets for 20 000 points or something and it takes you
[07:45.120 --> 07:49.600]  like four days to get 20 000 points if you're like playing or even longer than that probably
[07:49.600 --> 07:56.720]  i've been playing for like two weeks and i only have like 30 000 but al if i save up a million
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.520]  points i could go to on a cruise to alaska for free we're not talking about a real
[08:03.520 --> 08:09.440]  cruise it's a real cruise it's a real life cruise but i have to save up a million points
[08:10.240 --> 08:13.840]  and after playing for two weeks straight and getting all the points i can get every single
[08:13.840 --> 08:20.560]  day i'm at like 30 000 points i mean that doesn't that feels achievable like is there a time limit
[08:20.560 --> 08:28.000]  for this like that feels like a dangerous thing for them to do the alaskan cruise is um you have
[08:28.000 --> 08:35.040]  to like submit you have to like redeem it or whatever by august mid-august okay but i think
[08:35.040 --> 08:39.280]  like they just have another they'll just have another one after that i'm pretty sure i put
[08:39.280 --> 08:48.640]  an entry in to win a two-person trip on a cruise to the middle east or the caribbean or whatever
[08:48.640 --> 08:54.480]  i don't remember what how they phrase it but i just put like one entry in so it wasn't like
[08:54.480 --> 09:00.240]  a guaranteed thing but it's a you read all the rules for it and everything it's like two days
[09:00.240 --> 09:06.320]  or two people for eight days and it's everything it just feels like the time that pepsi had a
[09:06.320 --> 09:13.760]  competition to win a fighter jet and then they got into a whole bunch of legal trouble because
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.160]  they never thought anybody would ever actually manage to get that many points so someone sued
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.000]  them over because they wouldn't get them a jet yeah i also remember there was a radio station
[09:24.640 --> 09:32.320]  uh doing when i was like 11 there's a radio station doing this like do x amount of things
[09:32.320 --> 09:38.320]  or like earn i don't remember something like like collect box tops or collect straws or something
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.600]  yeah really dumb the radio station was trying to get people to do and it said oh if you do that
[09:43.600 --> 09:53.360]  then you get um you get a toyota and someone did it and she like went hard on it for like a month
[09:53.360 --> 10:00.480]  to win this thing and they gave her a toy of the star wars character yoda close enough it
[10:00.480 --> 10:09.600]  was a toyota yeah and she sued them she got a car um but yeah i mean it says on it on the thing it
[10:09.600 --> 10:20.400]  says it's a norwegian norwegian cruise lines trip to uh to alaska so i don't think i'm gonna i
[10:20.400 --> 10:26.400]  i'm mostly memeing like i don't think i'll ever get it um yeah do we need to do we need to talk
[10:26.400 --> 10:32.880]  about the environmental impact of cruises maybe yeah i have one trip for the norwegian cruise
[10:32.880 --> 10:39.200]  line middle east cruise giveaway you go to dubai and it's a seven day cruise for two
[10:39.200 --> 10:45.840]  plus airfare to get there a cruise to dubai oh that's very different there's an overnight
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.400]  stay in abu dhabi yeah i mean this is the one that you only have to pay a thousand to like win
[10:50.400 --> 10:55.920]  an entry to get it where's the other which means you're not winning correct like i'm not expecting
[10:55.920 --> 11:01.600]  to win that one but i could but there's another there's like the one that you can actually just
[11:01.600 --> 11:09.840]  straight up buy oh i gotta like scroll all the way over oh you can win for like 45 you can get
[11:09.840 --> 11:16.960]  like half off a night at a hotel um i'm being blind i can't see i can't see dubai on the map
[11:16.960 --> 11:27.440]  it must why am i why am i blind i can see saudi abra uh-huh oh that's why
[11:27.440 --> 11:36.960]  it's a new e oh such an idiot right oh yeah i can get one complimentary night at mandalay bay
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.360]  where does the cruise go from the dubai one yeah this is the news people really want it
[11:44.160 --> 11:52.000]  well yeah what is this episode um during your overnight stay in abu dhabi explore blah blah
[11:52.320 --> 11:59.920]  we go to you go to barain it wants me to go to a website okay it doesn't matter i just it's like
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.760]  that would be a lot like depending on where it goes from that could be a very long cruise because
[12:05.760 --> 12:13.440]  it's like it's only seven days okay yeah you must be flying set sail out of dubai on december 13th
[12:13.440 --> 12:20.240]  right okay from dubai from dubai and then probably goes back i don't know but like it goes you stop
[12:20.240 --> 12:26.720]  in abidabi you stop in barain you stop in daman um this is just right just riding the persian
[12:26.720 --> 12:32.480]  persian golf then yeah just a norwegian cruise line cruise i've never been on a cruise neither
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.360]  have i and i might i might win you know what i'm gonna rub this in your face al i'm not really
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.560]  sure you would be rubbing it in my face because i don't like boats anyway anything else you've been
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.400]  up to no just i mean not i'm just gonna be playing i'll probably not even be playing this tetris game
[12:48.400 --> 12:54.160]  anymore in two months let's be honest what have you been up to alec where where are you what's
[12:54.160 --> 12:58.240]  your vacation have you talked about that on the pod yet oh it's just my usual going to the hell of
[12:58.240 --> 13:05.200]  man um you have like a house on that uh no i i don't know it's really complicated so there's
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.640]  a charity that i do stuff for they own a building that they use for a bunch of things and we stay
[13:10.640 --> 13:17.680]  there so i i no i'm not i'm not that kind of rich that's not that complicated and it was really
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.840]  complicated and i was like that's pretty easy i said i simplified it okay i mean that's it makes
[13:21.840 --> 13:27.280]  sense um yeah i've not been i mean as of recording i've not been playing much because my switch is
[13:27.280 --> 13:32.320]  still with nintendo getting fixed oh yeah and listeners will be fed up hearing that because
[13:32.320 --> 13:39.120]  i feel like i've said that about seven times in the last two weeks um but uh hopefully by the
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.320]  time you're listening to this i'll have it you'll have it back i just oh yes that's the one that
[13:44.320 --> 13:51.920]  had all your pokemon saves on it right it is yeah yeah i just yesterday ordered nope today
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.920]  i just today ordered uh story seasons a wonderful life so that should be coming in the next couple
[13:57.920 --> 14:04.240]  days and i'm sure i'll play it in a couple of weeks and i also i had a voucher for a shop
[14:04.960 --> 14:13.280]  and ordered pigmen four so i will have that by the time this comes out and i just got
[14:14.480 --> 14:20.400]  one lonely outpost uh so i might be playing that who knows we'll see what i actually end up playing
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.800]  um i also want to play the original harvest moon at some point because that is now on switch as
[14:24.800 --> 14:31.840]  well yeah so cool well uh other than that just being kind of watching some stuff and and doing
[14:31.840 --> 14:36.480]  some stuff and yeah nothing in particular this is the problem with doing so many podcasts in a
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.760]  couple of weeks is there's not much to to say about what i've been up to because people heard
[14:41.840 --> 14:50.160]  it either one week ago or six weeks ago depending on which because yeah i'm about to record
[14:51.200 --> 14:55.280]  another podcast and i'm going to probably talk about my comp song it's fine at least there so
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.240]  that that is a good chunk away from each other right like next week compared to a month and a
[15:00.240 --> 15:06.080]  half away so i think i think we'll be good with that um awesome should we talk about our game of
[15:06.080 --> 15:12.320]  the podcast year okay so just to summarize what's happening again so there there have been
[15:12.320 --> 15:20.720]  excluding the current year 2023 there were four years of the podcast up till now 2019 2020 2021
[15:20.720 --> 15:28.320]  and 2022 and we are going to decide amongst us what the game of the podcast year is basically
[15:28.320 --> 15:34.320]  the game of those four years um so i'm not going to read out the whole list but what i did just
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.400]  realizes should probably read out the four individual game of the years that we that we
[15:38.400 --> 15:42.400]  gave i say we were you actually involved in any of those you were involved at least one of them
[15:42.400 --> 15:50.400]  i was involved in one of them and you guys snubbed apico uh we did um at that point so 2019 um we
[15:50.400 --> 15:56.320]  gave doraemon story of seasons the game of year and 2020 we gave summer and mara game of the year
[15:56.320 --> 16:04.240]  in 2021 we gave oh yeah that was the that was the one that we gave spirit fairer too even though
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.120]  it came out the year before um because it came out really late in the year so that's why i was
[16:09.120 --> 16:17.040]  excusing that and in 2020 we gave ooblets the game of the year so yeah um i mean any any the
[16:17.040 --> 16:25.840]  rule basically is any game that came out in those four years and i don't i was allowing early access
[16:25.840 --> 16:31.040]  but not demos but i believe there's only three games that came out in early access that haven't
[16:31.040 --> 16:36.800]  then also released their 1.0 since then because obviously four years is a long time um and all
[16:36.800 --> 16:44.320]  three of them released last year so yeah i guess let's shall we alternate for what we what we want
[16:44.320 --> 16:50.320]  because we've both chosen our top five ish do we want to alternate do you want to go first
[16:51.280 --> 16:59.680]  yeah um i will start off top with apico um and i'm not biased here
[17:01.920 --> 17:05.680]  i just really like do you get to choose a game that you're in does that count
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.440]  i wasn't in the original and to be honest i haven't played the part where i'm in yet
[17:13.440 --> 17:19.600]  i've still not had the time um but it's just such a cute little game and i always really like when
[17:19.600 --> 17:28.160]  a developer has used real like real world stuff and real science to try and um educate and empower
[17:28.160 --> 17:35.040]  people um and l did an amazing job with that with apico um and the game it was another really good
[17:35.840 --> 17:40.480]  the game is also a really good example of community feedback and a developer working with
[17:40.640 --> 17:47.120]  feedback and a developer working with the community because um not only uh
[17:48.560 --> 17:54.640]  of l meeting me and then asking me about solitary views and then coming up with a whole
[17:54.640 --> 17:59.360]  you know uh dlc that has that or i guess it's not a dlc because you don't well
[17:59.920 --> 18:07.680]  you don't have to pay for it it's just let's not do that debate um but like not only that of you
[18:07.680 --> 18:14.320]  know him reaching out to people that that study things and and working with his community in that
[18:14.320 --> 18:20.480]  way but also like if someone has an issue and they talk about it on the discord um he's really
[18:20.480 --> 18:27.680]  receptive to that as well so um i really like apica that was one of my top five just for uh
[18:28.320 --> 18:35.120]  yeah for it being a good game fun game a good a good developer a good community yeah no i i it's
[18:35.120 --> 18:42.720]  not on my list um purely because that's not my it's not my favorite kind of game um but it
[18:42.720 --> 18:49.600]  definitely has the quality um and definitely it has the care put into it um that is absolutely
[18:49.600 --> 18:57.600]  all true and i totally understand why you would choose that yeah where are you l uh my let's start
[18:57.600 --> 19:05.120]  off with summer and mara okay um so i i mean this was this was the game of year in 2020 and
[19:05.120 --> 19:12.400]  i i think it has held up pretty well um it's not a perfect game by any means um there were some
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.800]  kind of issues but the the kind of the love and care throughout the game felt like it was really
[19:18.800 --> 19:25.360]  there um it just felt like it was such a happy game it really it covered well happy sad game
[19:25.360 --> 19:33.520]  right um it really felt like it covered the feelings of cottagecore for me and the um it
[19:33.520 --> 19:39.360]  was a lovely balance of exploration but not too explorationary right you didn't feel like the
[19:39.360 --> 19:45.120]  world was too massive to explore everything um that i really like when you've got here's a big
[19:45.120 --> 19:50.400]  world and it's a bunch of islands because that is very clearly like oh i know i've explored
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.480]  everything because i've been to every island and i know that i've looked on everywhere on every
[19:54.480 --> 20:01.360]  island whereas a massive world that isn't islands you're like oh where have i been like you know
[20:01.360 --> 20:06.320]  down what paths have i been you know what mountains have i been into what caves etc
[20:06.320 --> 20:12.080]  whereas the the island aspect of things really works well so i think it was the first farming
[20:12.080 --> 20:16.640]  exploration game that i actually liked because the balance of all that was really well done cool
[20:17.520 --> 20:22.160]  yes you're a newbie at a farming game so yeah sure
[20:27.040 --> 20:30.880]  compared to people who started playing uh like a wonderful life yeah
[20:30.880 --> 20:36.480]  but i mean it was 2017 so it wasn't like two years ago it was when the podcast started sure
[20:37.120 --> 20:45.200]  yeah no i've i've not been i've not gotten into that game yet so i can't what's next uh i will do
[20:46.080 --> 20:53.840]  one of the ones that is on both of our lists uh animal crossing new horizon this is one of the
[20:53.840 --> 21:01.920]  ones one of the first ones that you guys talked about and that it was just so long awaited um it
[21:01.920 --> 21:09.120]  had been a long time since it felt like a long i actually got a switch specifically for new horizons
[21:09.680 --> 21:20.000]  um yeah i was pretty stoked um and i played pretty regularly for like three or four months
[21:21.440 --> 21:28.560]  um but i oh no it came out in 2020 didn't it yeah i got my i got my switch for it in 2019
[21:28.560 --> 21:32.720]  because i thought it was going to come out in the in the winter it was it was meant to be delayed
[21:32.720 --> 21:42.720]  yeah um but yeah so it's that was a really fun game um you know the classic you're a villager
[21:42.720 --> 21:53.600]  and you've got um other animals living on your farm or on your um island and uh some of the new
[21:53.600 --> 21:58.000]  i really love some of the new characters that they put in i love i can't i can never remember her
[21:58.000 --> 22:05.280]  name but i call her bisexual galaxy bear um oh um judy yeah yeah yeah judy i like judy and i like
[22:05.280 --> 22:13.280]  raymond uh david bowie cat so um i still am on the quest for david bowie cat i have not found him
[22:13.280 --> 22:19.600]  judy's on my island you know just ended up buying the uh no the amiibo card trying to find him
[22:20.400 --> 22:26.800]  um playing it on hard mode but i think my favorite thing about new horizons compared to other games
[22:26.800 --> 22:34.400]  was the that museum felt so immersive especially like the fossil collection and like it's like
[22:34.400 --> 22:40.720]  you're walking through the evolutionary history i really enjoyed that it's funny because like you
[22:40.720 --> 22:46.000]  see you can you can look back at many of these games and go like that's the point where this
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.560]  thing became a standard right and so many of those things come from stardew valley right like um
[22:53.360 --> 22:58.480]  the idea of having a museum in the first place right like that it wasn't standard until like
[22:58.480 --> 23:03.920]  the stardew made that the standard um i'm not saying nothing had it before but i feel like
[23:03.920 --> 23:09.120]  that was the point where everything had to have a had to have a museum i'm not saying it was good
[23:09.120 --> 23:14.560]  it definitely wasn't a good museum it was a terrible museum but in terms of like find a
[23:14.560 --> 23:19.920]  farming game after that that doesn't have a museum but anyway that's not the point the point isn't
[23:20.160 --> 23:24.160]  specific to that right like there's loads of things that stardew did there like that is kind
[23:24.160 --> 23:32.480]  of when this became standard um like sprinklers for example um and i think animal crossings museum
[23:33.040 --> 23:39.280]  was that for good museums shall we say so it was the point where people went oh this can be
[23:40.400 --> 23:47.200]  good this can be enjoyable this can be fancy um and it's just kind of like the it's the thing
[23:47.840 --> 23:54.560]  to do in farming games now is to make your fancy museum you know um and like coral island took
[23:54.560 --> 24:02.080]  that to a new level by having two different ones um like it's just it's it it's almost like nobody
[24:02.080 --> 24:06.480]  ever thought that it would be something that you could put some time and effort into curating
[24:07.120 --> 24:11.600]  ironically considering that's the point of a museum i do think the first museum the first
[24:11.600 --> 24:18.080]  animal crossing which was released in 2001 uh had a museum and they did it really well and then
[24:18.080 --> 24:24.000]  they've up increased it and stuff but yeah i do think that like what you're saying like i don't
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.800]  think that because animal crossing had it everyone started having museums i do think stardew valley
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.880]  was probably the the freak yeah yeah and i think i think new horizons was the point where it was
[24:34.880 --> 24:41.360]  like it can now be like fancy right and yeah an attraction in and of itself and not just a
[24:41.360 --> 24:47.200]  checklist essentially yeah new leaf it was okay a new leaf especially the aquarium side of it
[24:47.840 --> 24:55.760]  um but the fossil side always just felt like not very immersive and sometimes the insects
[24:55.760 --> 25:02.080]  but it really does a new horizon yeah yeah yeah do you know what i was um a bit surprised didn't
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.360]  become a standard after new horizons because i know we're we're still only we're only three
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.600]  years since it but i feel like we we're seeing things now as impacted by it quite a bit um
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.360]  terraforming i feel like that's become not it's not become common there's a few games that have
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.880]  it but it's not very common i mean maybe because it's complicated and difficult right i did talk
[25:24.880 --> 25:32.320]  about it with bev on a episode a long time ago a couple months ago now um i think it was garden
[25:32.320 --> 25:38.720]  galaxy it has some terraforming aspects to it i mean that's a whole concept yeah yeah it was one
[25:38.720 --> 25:44.320]  of those things like i saw it in that game and i was like oh wow like this is this is a lot like
[25:44.320 --> 25:50.400]  animal crossing um but not a lot of people do it like like you're saying um little wood has it
[25:50.400 --> 25:54.880]  really finicky little wood has it and a couple of other games that are coming out in the next
[25:54.880 --> 26:01.120]  couple of years have it but it's yeah there's not it's not standard by any means um but yeah i think
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.040]  despite everybody's kind of issues with it is still definitely one of the best games of the
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.880]  last four years um definitely um i don't think i i as you say it was on my list as well i don't
[26:12.880 --> 26:19.520]  think i would say i i wouldn't be arguing for it to be the top yeah um i purely because like it
[26:19.520 --> 26:25.600]  never there was just always something about it that meant that i was feeling it was lacking
[26:25.600 --> 26:29.920]  and i don't think it was the character stuff that a lot of people had and i totally understand that
[26:29.920 --> 26:35.520]  issue i i still can't figure out what it was but there was still something about it that made me
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.320]  just not as enthusiastic about it as some of the other games on this list yeah it's an all right
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.440]  game though it's something that i go back and play it every now and then because i am missing
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.520]  yeah yeah yeah i mean i i wish i could go back but it's just not my style of playing games yeah
[26:51.520 --> 26:56.560]  but um i look forward to you know when the next game comes out seeing the you know when we saw
[26:56.560 --> 27:03.440]  with new leaf where it was like oh my grandma's had like three thousand hours on new leaf or
[27:03.440 --> 27:09.200]  whatever um seeing that with new horizons yeah and and of course the big thing about it was that it
[27:09.200 --> 27:17.200]  was just popular right like in terms of sales it was insane we all there was a plague and we all
[27:20.400 --> 27:25.840]  like it was literally like right after the world shut down the animal crossing like within a week
[27:25.840 --> 27:31.360]  animal crossing came out and so but it's everyone it's yeah i mean and obviously a lot of that is to
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.720]  do with that but i don't think it can be entirely due to that because if you think like the numbers
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.680]  are just insane right so the total number of sales of animal crossing games is 77 million
[27:41.680 --> 27:51.280]  right 77 million total new horizons 42 million yeah right like it's just it's it that's more
[27:51.280 --> 27:57.680]  than half that's significantly more than half of all animal crossing sales are the new or that one
[27:57.680 --> 28:05.280]  game it was three times as many sales as new leaf right like it's just it's yes absolutely the the
[28:06.240 --> 28:09.760]  released on literally the week that lots of countries shut down
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.880]  like it literally it could not be any closer right it came out on the 20th of march 2020
[28:16.880 --> 28:22.800]  the last day i ever worked in an office was the 13th of march 2020 yeah exactly a week before it
[28:22.800 --> 28:29.200]  right like obviously that has a massive thing but it i think it just did so much perfect and also
[28:29.200 --> 28:35.760]  the fact that it was on the switch right like the switch in and of itself has caused many games to
[28:35.760 --> 28:41.280]  be popular all right that's that one what's your next one i will choose the other one that we've
[28:41.280 --> 28:51.680]  both put on our lists and that is spirit fairer my heart so with this game i struggle to point out
[28:51.680 --> 29:00.160]  faults um yeah i mean that how i've said so much about spirit fader over the years it's
[29:00.160 --> 29:08.000]  hard to say more it is as close to a perfect game as you can get um i mean some people won't like
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.200]  it but if you don't like it it's because you don't like that kind of game no you know it's not
[29:14.080 --> 29:22.320]  i do it's really hard to explain how good a game spirit fairer is yeah right like it is
[29:22.320 --> 29:30.000]  both heart-wrenching and heartwarming at the same time the controls are great the platforming is
[29:30.000 --> 29:37.680]  good the the boat is just such a fun place to to move around it does the beautiful thing of
[29:37.680 --> 29:42.800]  you're exploring but you're exploring with your house so there's like almost no stakes for
[29:42.800 --> 29:47.920]  anything you can just go to bed right like the worst the furthest away you are from your boat
[29:47.920 --> 29:52.240]  is when you're on an island and you're at the far end of the island right like there's just there's
[29:52.240 --> 29:59.040]  so much about this the characters are great the art is great every single mechanic is is at least
[29:59.040 --> 30:05.840]  good if not great um and even the ones that are frustrating are frustrating by design right to
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.440]  give you a little bit of a challenge there's there's always some small level of stakes but
[30:11.440 --> 30:16.160]  never a huge amount of stakes like with cooking if you leave it too long it burns but you have
[30:16.160 --> 30:23.440]  to live it quite a long time yeah so it's like everything is just like slightly the fishing as
[30:23.440 --> 30:30.320]  will have been discussed in the previous episode is an incredibly good fishing mini game everything
[30:30.320 --> 30:38.640]  about it is just such a good game the fishing at first for me was a little frustrating um because
[30:38.640 --> 30:44.320]  you have to like you tap like some of the fish are really hard to catch and i would break the
[30:44.320 --> 30:48.240]  line every single time and i didn't know what i was doing wrong but then i googled it because
[30:48.240 --> 30:52.160]  i was like i've tried this so many times and every single time i met yeah okay there we go we've got
[30:52.160 --> 30:58.960]  the flaw the flaw is no no the flaw is that they didn't explain it properly the flaw is buck
[31:01.280 --> 31:06.880]  my one problem well i also don't really like but but the thing is right it's not about whether you
[31:06.880 --> 31:10.400]  like the characters or not because the the characters are doing something even if you
[31:10.400 --> 31:16.800]  don't like them yeah right i guess i just don't really like like i've found all the other
[31:16.800 --> 31:21.520]  characters i was so invested in their story and so invested in helping them and with buck i'm like
[31:21.520 --> 31:27.760]  okay shut up how late how late did you get buck like the last i i couldn't even find him for a
[31:27.840 --> 31:33.760]  while that's that i think i've generally found that the people characters that people like least
[31:33.760 --> 31:39.040]  are the ones they get later on yeah and you just at that point you're just like i just i'm at the
[31:39.040 --> 31:44.160]  point where i just want to finish the game um and i think yeah so like i was the same i can't even
[31:44.160 --> 31:49.360]  remember who was that i had last the other flaw is that my heart hurt a lot that's not a flaw
[31:49.360 --> 31:56.560]  that's a that's a that's a feature that's the thing like there are not many games that make
[31:56.560 --> 32:06.320]  me cry i love right it's a feature i want it like listed in the features there's farming there's
[32:06.320 --> 32:15.840]  animals you can cry not in the game like you you really like in real life cry um yeah my poor
[32:15.840 --> 32:23.200]  roommate she was concerned for my mental health because the other thing is i'd get like sucked in
[32:23.200 --> 32:28.080]  and i'd play for like eight hours straight and then she'd come downstairs and i would just be
[32:28.080 --> 32:32.160]  bawling because someone just i just took someone to the ever door
[32:34.240 --> 32:41.280]  just like maybe that's enough and i was like i'm sad so yeah yeah no i agree like i can't
[32:41.280 --> 32:48.000]  i really can't it's the the quote-unquote flaws are really just being nitpicky yeah no absolutely
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.040]  yeah and i don't want people to say that that um bring up all that there are obviously flaws
[32:53.040 --> 32:57.200]  i'm not actually trying to say it's a flawless game it's not no game is perfect i really can't
[32:57.200 --> 33:03.920]  think they're all they're all really small yeah you know it's a it's like oh i didn't like the
[33:03.920 --> 33:07.440]  wood chopping game yeah of course you didn't it's meant to be annoying yeah
[33:08.960 --> 33:13.840]  they're meant to be different it's yeah you try making 10 different mini games
[33:14.320 --> 33:21.440]  yeah and having them all be unique yeah like they didn't none of them really felt the same
[33:22.480 --> 33:29.840]  yeah um okay well that's hard to follow but um should i left that to last that's the problem
[33:30.960 --> 33:38.400]  um gosh okay so it's time to make a decision come on i already made the decision it was
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.960]  so but so i'll mention i guess i'll leave an honorable mention for the end so i i will mention
[33:45.600 --> 33:52.080]  maybe you should have done that at the beginning my next my next in my top five is lens island
[33:53.040 --> 34:00.960]  interesting this is one that i covered with bev um before it was in 1.0 and when i covered it
[34:00.960 --> 34:08.160]  it was pretty sparse like there wasn't a lot going on in the game so yeah lens island um played it
[34:08.160 --> 34:14.720]  with bev uh played it before it was fully released and so there's actually a lot that
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.600]  i haven't played that i see um that i've seen like on their twitter and stuff and every single time
[34:19.600 --> 34:26.160]  i'm like oh i need to go back to that game and play it um but even playing the limited not limited
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.560]  edition like it is special but like the no i know what you mean the the early access the early access
[34:32.560 --> 34:39.200]  game that was limited in features uh was just really fun and it was a fun little exploration
[34:39.920 --> 34:44.080]  like you explored the island this it was only a small island at the time they have way more
[34:44.080 --> 34:49.040]  that you can explore now you can kind of build up your house which a lot of people got really crazy
[34:49.040 --> 34:59.360]  it with um and then build up like your um you can get like a really good sword and then you can go
[34:59.360 --> 35:06.800]  into the mines and the mines uh there's like some crazy spawners that reminded me a lot of gauntlet
[35:06.800 --> 35:13.680]  i don't know if you ever played gauntlet um but it's a game that used to be like a arcade style
[35:13.680 --> 35:20.160]  like literally stand up and like have like an arcade machine um where there's four classes
[35:20.160 --> 35:26.000]  there's these like spawners that spawn monsters until you destroy the spawner also happens in
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.640]  minecraft but the way that they did it reminded and like a lot of the um visuals of the game
[35:32.640 --> 35:40.880]  reminded me a lot of gauntlet which was very nostalgic for me um they didn't have too much
[35:40.880 --> 35:46.080]  farming i think they have more of it now but it was just kind of a cool little exploration game and
[35:46.080 --> 35:52.640]  um and i just really enjoyed it and i really want to get back into it but when looking at the list
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.720]  of the the four lists from these games from these years that we did um i was like oh man i love that
[35:58.720 --> 36:04.560]  game and that's a game that i want to continue playing that's why it's on my top yeah cool you
[36:04.560 --> 36:11.200]  you never played it right i've i i still haven't played it no um it's it's it's still on my list
[36:11.200 --> 36:16.160]  to play at some point i tried picking up at one point and it didn't really when i got my steam
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.360]  deck and i didn't really support the steam deck at that point um so i was just a bit in there um
[36:21.360 --> 36:27.120]  so it yeah it's on my list to play at some point but uh yeah not yet cool what's your um
[36:28.320 --> 36:35.520]  i'm gonna go for ooblets next ooblets i understand why some people don't like
[36:36.720 --> 36:43.520]  the silly names i understand all right you don't need to you don't you don't need to tell me again
[36:43.520 --> 36:47.600]  at the end after this episode listeners right i know but i know something you don't like the
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.720]  silly silly there are silly names i know i know but what i will say is they make it abundantly
[36:54.720 --> 37:03.440]  clear that there are silly names yeah it is its whole thing is silly names so if you go into that
[37:03.440 --> 37:10.880]  game not expecting silly names i'm sorry did you read anything so um i i i love ooblets so much
[37:10.880 --> 37:20.320]  it's so adorable and just like it's just pure ridiculousness
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.840]  and fun and there's nothing else it's not spirit failure it doesn't bring you in with the fun and
[37:27.840 --> 37:32.640]  then shoot you right in the heart no yeah the story is not complicated the story is not
[37:33.520 --> 37:40.560]  convoluted the story doesn't tug at your heartstrings um it is as i discussed on the
[37:40.560 --> 37:44.720]  last ooblets episode with johnny it is an anti-capitalist story but that's about it
[37:44.720 --> 37:50.480]  it is only just an anti-capitalist story right like it that is the most it goes to is oh this
[37:50.480 --> 37:58.880]  corporation's bad right like that that's it um but everything about it is fun right like the
[37:59.440 --> 38:06.080]  characters are fun the the ooblets themselves are fun the battles are fun
[38:06.080 --> 38:14.080]  the farming is fun the animations are ridiculous and fun how i i like the names the names are
[38:14.080 --> 38:20.640]  ridiculous and stupid and fun right like i think everything about it is just about being stupid
[38:20.640 --> 38:31.040]  and silly and fun and i like it yeah i um i haven't played it but it's definitely i know
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.600]  it was yeah um i think i was waiting for it to come to switch and then when it
[38:38.160 --> 38:46.560]  finally came to switch i was broke so um yeah that was my issue there
[38:47.520 --> 38:55.120]  uh but hopefully here in the next few months um after i get another roommate i'll be able to
[38:55.120 --> 39:02.000]  afford things again and be able to play it because i knew i know we need to second harvest it we've
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.040]  already second harvested third harvest second second harvest in fact have we just done two
[39:07.040 --> 39:13.680]  or have we done three yeah okay just two wait no three no it is three because we did early access
[39:13.760 --> 39:18.560]  we did 1.0 and then we did a second harvest oh my gosh story of season friends of mineral town

[40:12.640 --> 40:19.760]  well yeah okay so my honorable mention is alba um a wildlife tale a wildlife adventure
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.600]  wildlife adventure thank you where you play as a young girl named alba who um is running around
[40:25.600 --> 40:31.680]  on an island and you are helping the wildlife on the island and you're taking pictures of all of
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.240]  them but basically there's a wildlife refuge and um it is currently run down but you go around and
[40:38.240 --> 40:45.280]  you build it up better and you document the wildlife on your um island and you end up um
[40:46.560 --> 40:54.400]  stopping your evil mayor person or whomever it is i can't remember um from creating a skyscraper
[40:55.040 --> 41:02.880]  a hotel um because they were going to tear down the wildlife refuge and make a and build a hotel
[41:02.880 --> 41:09.680]  and you and your friend stop that from happening uh it was just a really cute game a fun game i was
[41:09.680 --> 41:17.200]  able to beat it in like two days i played it on arcade apple arcade um and i mean it's visually
[41:17.200 --> 41:23.120]  gorgeous it was had a lot of really good animals in it um i think my biggest qualms i would have
[41:23.120 --> 41:29.200]  liked insects but whatever i get it um but it was just a really fun game and i super recommend it if
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.320]  you have um apple arcade or um so that was my honorable mention do you want me to do my fifth
[41:34.320 --> 41:38.240]  one or do you well i'm gonna i've got to talk about alba as well don't i right like it's great
[41:38.240 --> 41:42.960]  game played it you played it as well oh absolutely but we don't do the episode together we probably
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.560]  did yes it's a great game and it was definitely it was definitely one of my one of the top games
[41:48.560 --> 41:54.160]  of 2020 it was really good yeah i was gonna say that was a long time ago it was it was 2020 i
[41:54.160 --> 42:03.120]  really liked it um it was a fun short game like it wasn't very long which i like um but yeah it
[42:03.120 --> 42:11.440]  definitely felt like the story this story was pretty uh easy to predict let's not pretend
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.280]  but it was still fun um it's a cliched story but cliches exist for a reason
[42:19.840 --> 42:28.160]  yeah yeah no it was fun the gameplay was fun it was good to have like as far as i can tell
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.440]  it was reasonably accurate in what it was showing you and telling you in terms of the animals um
[42:34.160 --> 42:41.680]  yeah yeah good game i agree thank you thank you for telling me my opinion is correct
[42:41.680 --> 42:43.440]  is why i was on my honorable mention
[42:45.840 --> 42:50.640]  uh so you want to do your last one and i'll do my last one uh yeah my last one is duriam on
[42:50.640 --> 42:56.880]  story of seasons not the second one the first one very specifically didn't like the second
[42:56.880 --> 43:02.160]  one as much but you played the first one you did that one with or you did this one with mica right
[43:02.800 --> 43:09.040]  uh so the first one i think it was me and rachel and mica i think all three of us were on that one
[43:09.760 --> 43:16.080]  and the second one it was me and mica um yeah no i really like it i think it's a very i think it
[43:16.080 --> 43:22.720]  brought a lot of interesting ideas to farming games that i hadn't seen elsewhere and i think
[43:22.720 --> 43:29.040]  places other games need to look at it more for inspiration i think the things that i was doing
[43:29.040 --> 43:34.000]  that are different are things that other games should be doing and i think maybe just enough
[43:34.000 --> 43:39.280]  people haven't played it i don't know um i still find it odd that we got a second game in this
[43:39.280 --> 43:48.720]  series um yeah it's a good game i like it um gorgeous looking fun little weird crossover
[43:49.360 --> 43:56.880]  loads of really interesting mechanics that were new to farming games yeah fun i did not yeah i
[43:56.880 --> 44:03.440]  feel like most people didn't thank you i even played i even played the japanese only demo of it
[44:04.640 --> 44:05.280]  because why not
[44:07.920 --> 44:13.680]  what's your last one translations oh let me tell you playing a game through my phone screen because
[44:13.680 --> 44:22.320]  i'm using google translate not the best way to play a play a game yep uh would not do that uh
[44:23.360 --> 44:32.800]  my last one is uh bear and breakfast so this is um the one that came out last year where you are
[44:32.800 --> 44:38.880]  a bear and you run a bed and breakfast and you end up running like a couple different ones and
[44:38.880 --> 44:46.160]  it's really it was just such a cute game so like heartwarming we played it right on release um and
[44:46.160 --> 44:51.360]  i only got to play it for a couple days because um we wanted to record like pretty close after release
[44:51.360 --> 44:58.560]  or maybe maybe it might have been one that i procrastinated on let me actually redact that
[44:58.560 --> 45:07.600]  um but it was really fun um and it's such a beautiful game uh it's kind of like a management
[45:07.600 --> 45:13.120]  game where you have um you know people come in and they want specific room types and so you
[45:13.120 --> 45:17.840]  want to make sure that you have what they want um and if you're not wearing pants people get
[45:17.840 --> 45:21.440]  scared of you and they run away because they recognize that you're a bear but if you put
[45:21.440 --> 45:28.080]  pants on that's all you have to do is put pants on it's like clark canon superman yeah
[45:29.120 --> 45:34.480]  and then they're like ah a bear oh wait no i hate a human that's just a hairy human who's got pants
[45:34.480 --> 45:40.480]  on um amazing it was a very and like some a lot of the characters were really fun uh that's a
[45:40.480 --> 45:48.400]  game that i didn't get to play as much as i would would have liked um so i i'm going to for sure
[45:48.400 --> 45:52.800]  especially now that i have more time and now that my computer room doesn't have it probably
[45:52.800 --> 45:58.560]  not for the next month though if you have game pass yeah i am looking at all the game like i'm
[45:58.560 --> 46:06.400]  currently going through all of the games that i could play i could i've already played hollow
[46:06.400 --> 46:13.600]  knight record the podcast first record what podcast first this podcast oh the farming
[46:13.600 --> 46:16.160]  simulator one right the one we're currently talking on
[46:20.560 --> 46:26.800]  you just mentioned game pass and i was like yeah okay well what what which of the
[46:28.320 --> 46:35.200]  which of your top five is like would you say is your top one al well i think i think it's clear
[46:35.200 --> 46:39.440]  what our combined top one would be don't you yeah i think it's going to be spirit fader right
[46:39.920 --> 46:47.840]  fair like the only the only two games that we both chose were spirit fair and animal crossing
[46:47.840 --> 46:52.720]  and i think both of us said that animal crossing is definitely in the top five but not the top one
[46:52.720 --> 46:59.440]  therefore it has to be spirit yeah the other thing is all of my other games i like have not finished
[46:59.440 --> 47:05.040]  but spirit fair i could not put it down like yeah even though i mean i've got i've already got
[47:05.040 --> 47:11.360]  credits um but i'm 100 it so i still have some things that i need to do but part of me is like
[47:11.360 --> 47:17.600]  putting it off because i don't want it to be over like i might create a new save and do it all again
[47:17.600 --> 47:24.400]  honestly i mean i think there's a lot of replay value in that i know that when so me and kelly
[47:24.400 --> 47:28.240]  did the first spirit fader episode i know that when i asked her to do it she was like oh yeah
[47:28.240 --> 47:33.200]  and just like replayed the whole game to do it and then we did the dlc one and she replayed it all
[47:33.200 --> 47:39.120]  again to do all the dlc content as well i don't have the time and patience for that so i just
[47:39.120 --> 47:45.360]  had the one save but yeah i can totally see the replay value in that um and if it's something that
[47:45.360 --> 47:49.600]  you enjoyed and you enjoy replaying some things then i think it's it's definitely a game you could
[47:49.600 --> 47:59.680]  do that with it's just so good it is and i think nothing comes quite close to it in that kind of
[47:59.680 --> 48:03.680]  thing like it depends what you're looking for if you're looking if you're not looking for a game
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.640]  to make you cry right if you're like i do not want a game to make me cry i just want to forget about
[48:08.640 --> 48:13.280]  everything right like maybe you've you've had a bunch of death and you don't want to think about
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.000]  that you you want it then absolutely is not the game for you you know go play animal crossing
[48:18.720 --> 48:25.520]  right like there are so many games that ignore that sort of stuff but i think more and more often
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.240]  and i'm going to put this out there and say that i feel like this was a thing that stardew started
[48:30.240 --> 48:40.400]  as well is that it's not just that farming games are just mindless things for mar mindless farming
[48:40.400 --> 48:49.600]  simulators they are touching parts of humanity that it's hard to deal with and um i feel like
[48:49.600 --> 48:56.080]  stardew was the first one that really did that with you know lars in particular in in stardew
[48:56.080 --> 49:01.280]  um i don't i can't think of a game that has touched something as difficult as
[49:01.280 --> 49:07.200]  a homeless person who really wants to continue being homeless so you know like you mean linus
[49:07.200 --> 49:14.480]  oh sorry linus not lars yeah oh names it's all good but yeah no it's it's it's hard it can be
[49:14.480 --> 49:20.640]  really difficult for some games to get to like a personal level on that way with with characters
[49:20.640 --> 49:28.320]  especially games like this that are like cottage core games are usually tend to seem more like
[49:28.320 --> 49:36.160]  cutesy exactly more more like like you're saying like surface level but yeah blindness is an oof
[49:36.160 --> 49:41.280]  yeah and i feel like that was the first thing that in in cottagecore games it was like yeah
[49:41.280 --> 49:47.280]  you can you can do this you know and i think the difference with spirit fairer is you could play
[49:48.320 --> 49:53.520]  thousand hours in stardew and never see that story yeah you can't do that in spirit fader
[49:53.520 --> 50:00.240]  you know you'll see all of the story if you keep playing yeah yeah you can't avoid it no even if
[50:00.240 --> 50:08.080]  you want to even if you don't want to even if you think you're just gonna have a party and then
[50:08.080 --> 50:16.320]  everything's gonna go on it's not good you can't fight careful no spoilers
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.960]  i'm not gonna say anything more but yeah oh that game that's good on so many levels like it's not
[50:26.960 --> 50:33.840]  just like oh it does this good no it does so many things yeah really well yeah i'm excited to see
[50:33.840 --> 50:39.840]  what they do um going forward like them as a i know that they have a game that like just came
[50:39.840 --> 50:46.320]  out it's not yet it's coming out next or yeah it was just sorry just just 33 immortals yeah
[50:47.200 --> 50:53.600]  it's i have no idea if i'm going to like that game or not it's so different i just it's utterly
[50:53.600 --> 51:01.280]  ridiculous yeah it's certainly i don't think gonna have the same story but yeah who knows what they'll
[51:01.280 --> 51:08.640]  do i i think the thing about the thing that makes spirit fader really click with the story is that
[51:09.360 --> 51:16.640]  almost all the stories are based on stories from the team like they are real stories
[51:16.640 --> 51:21.760]  yeah that's and that's why we can all relate to it so much i mean like you watch it
[51:22.480 --> 51:29.600]  and you're like oh my gosh this is you know this is uh alzheimer's and it's my grandma
[51:29.840 --> 51:36.000]  like or you know so it's just really difficult but yeah and if you and if you and if you haven't
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.840]  dealt with that yet you probably will yeah and then well and that's like and then this game can
[51:41.840 --> 51:50.720]  be cathartic because it can oh okay we're not going to get into it this isn't spoilers it's
[51:50.720 --> 51:56.160]  just such a good game 10 out of 10 recommend yeah agreed awesome congratulations spirit fader you
[51:56.160 --> 52:08.240]  are the first and what's the wording for this pop game of the podcast year winner for year one of
[52:08.240 --> 52:17.680]  the podcast when is your night so year two will be so 2023 spring 24 summer 25 no no no no no no
[52:17.680 --> 52:23.280]  no we sped it up because we're doing we're keeping the seasons the same number of episodes but we're
[52:23.280 --> 52:30.320]  doubling the number of episodes remember oh my god so the next podcast year will be at the end
[52:30.320 --> 52:37.840]  of 24 okay because we're just we're already in summer yeah well technically we're not as of
[52:37.840 --> 52:43.600]  recording because we're recording on the 28th of june so it's like we just today released the last
[52:43.600 --> 52:49.120]  episode of spring next week your episode cody farming simulator that's the first episode of
[52:49.120 --> 52:58.000]  summer not to be confused with the actual summer why did i do this i thought it was a clever funny
[52:58.000 --> 53:04.720]  cute idea it's just annoying it is clever i think it would be like more relevant if we say like
[53:04.720 --> 53:09.840]  welcome to spring day one or welcome to spring day two but that might also be yeah that's true
[53:09.840 --> 53:17.280]  i just ended up just doing it as like people can completely ignore it year one's spring day number
[53:17.280 --> 53:21.920]  five i bet there are listeners listening now who's like oh i didn't realize that was yeah
[53:24.320 --> 53:28.480]  thank you cody for joining me for this one of a kind episode probably
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.080]  it won't be one of a kind at the end of 2024 well because the thing is then we'll just be
[53:34.080 --> 53:38.560]  doing a game for two years rather than four years it's a very different thing that's true there's
[53:38.560 --> 53:43.360]  also too many games coming out this did cover a lot of games like the next one would just be
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.320]  what's gonna win game of the year the 2023 game of the year or the 2024 game of the year
[53:51.920 --> 53:55.200]  because i think half of the ones we mentioned were games of the year anyway

[54:45.120 --> 54:50.400]  not spiritfarer you better have a good reason why it's not spiritfarer and that reason is likely
[54:50.400 --> 54:55.200]  that you didn't get to play spiritfarer yeah that is prob that's the best because i don't think
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.240]  anyone who has played spiritfarer would disagree with it well if you disagree with cody and you

[56:10.080 --> 56:15.760]  the harvest season is created by al mckinley with support from our patrons including our pro farmers

[56:22.960 --> 56:25.680]  feel free to visit our website harvest season
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.840]  dot club for show notes and links to things we discussed in this episode
[56:38.640 --> 56:43.120]  it was very slow well because we're all we're both like
[56:44.960 --> 56:51.760]  um it's like it's the one point on the episode we both sound drunk well i feel like we have to like
[56:51.760 --> 56:57.200]  have a video that we can both like look at each other because we're doing it just based on audio
[56:57.200 --> 57:01.040]  well that wouldn't help either because it's still out of time i think the important thing is we just
[57:01.040 --> 57:04.960]  say it and i just like i always trim it and cut it and put it together so it always sounds like
[57:04.960 --> 57:11.680]  we said at the same time well this time we did it right you speed it up a little bit no promises
[57:13.600 --> 57:16.480]  if it sounded right for you it probably wasn't right for me
[57:16.480 --> 57:22.560]  anyway great thank you cody thank you have a good day almost exactly an hour
