# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Al,
(0:00:36) Codey: And my name is Codey.
(0:00:38) Al: and we are here today to talk about farming game,
(0:00:42) Al: cartridge core games, games, lots of all the games. So many games.
(0:00:45) Codey: Wholesome games that are snack related. Woo!
(0:00:51) Al: Sure. Before we get into it, transcripts are available on the show notes and on the website.
(0:00:57) Al: Go get them if you need them.
(0:01:00) Al: We are going to talk just... I mean it's basically all news, because we are recording this two hours after the wholesome snack came out.
(0:01:04) Codey: Yeah.
(0:01:09) Al: Which apparently is a short one, but it was half an hour long, so it wasn't particularly short, but there we are.
(0:01:14) Codey: Yeah, I wish there was a visual component because when you sit apparently it was a short one, my face was rude.
(0:01:22) Codey: I was like, "Mmm, no."
(0:01:25) Al: Yeah.
(0:01:27) Al: That's what they said. I mean, like, the direct in June was...
(0:01:30) Al: I know we're long, so like, sure fine, it's shorter, but shorter is not the same as short.
(0:01:37) Codey: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
(0:01:39) Al: Anyway, so we're going to talk about all that. There's a lot of other news as well, so I think we'll do all the other news first, and then we'll get into the wholesome snack stuff.
(0:01:43) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:01:47) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:01:48) Al: So we'll just, we'll take it as it goes. But first of all, Codey, what have you been up to?
(0:01:49) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:01:53) Codey: I have been playing, uh, Disney Dreamlight Valley.
(0:01:58) Codey: Um, yeah, I have also been playing, uh, that one thing, my Tetris game.
(0:02:07) Codey: Um, I'm pulling, I'm pulling it up right now.
(0:02:07) Al: Oh yeah. I was like, "What one thing?" Oh yes, that thing, the scam game.
(0:02:09) Codey: They had, they, yeah, my scam game.
(0:02:13) Codey: They have a thing going on right now.
(0:02:15) Codey: I don't know how long it's going on for, but, like, you earn five times points.
(0:02:19) Codey: Um, and so I'm actually at 887 million, or, sorry, 887,000 points.
(0:02:20) Al: Ooh.
(0:02:25) Codey: I am almost to a mill, I know, I'm almost to a million points.
(0:02:25) Al: Oh my word.
(0:02:28) Al: Get a cruise.
(0:02:29) Codey: I'm going, though, I will say, I will say the cruises that they have right now, um,
(0:02:31) Al: Where's the current cruise?
(0:02:35) Codey: Our two million points not one million points. So there are some there are some shifting baselines.
(0:02:38) Al: Oh, see, I see what's happening here.
(0:02:42) Al: They just keep jumping up the prices when people get close to it.
(0:02:47) Codey: Let me see. Oh yeah so for 13 oh no there's there's a five-day cruise to the Caribbean for 1500.
(0:02:47) Al: Sneaky.
(0:02:55) Al: Like 1.5 million, right?
(0:02:56) Codey: Uh you have so correct sorry one and a half million.
(0:03:00) Al: It's like 1,500! Oh my word! You can get a lot of cruises right now!
(0:03:04) Codey: No, and so yeah, it's a complimentary five day cruise.
(0:03:07) Codey: Uh, the cool thing about this one is that you leave Miami, Florida, you go, um, to Belize in Mexico, and then you go back to Miami, Florida.
(0:03:15) Codey: So some of these cruises, like, especially once to Alaska, like they take, they grab you in like Washington and then drop you off in Alaska.
(0:03:21) Codey: So you're going to still have to like find a way back, but that one does not.
(0:03:24) Al: Yeah, that's not ideal. Yeah, but you have to go to Florida.
(0:03:24) Codey: That one's pretty good.
(0:03:25) Codey: Um.
(0:03:34) Codey: Um yeah so um bustin butt on that game for sure. Um also pokemon go and I think those are oh and pigman bloom but those are pretty basic um standard games. I also have been uh I upgraded to game pass ultimate so I have the ability to play some other games. Oh I played one game
(0:03:59) Codey: that was like uh it like
(0:04:04) Codey: built bent the world like worked on perception gosh what the heck was it called I don't know it's like me only like four hours to beat but it was really good yeah I'm upset that I can't remember the subliminal super liminal something like that very good though yeah that's yep super liminal so I think That's what it's called. It was very good. There's
(0:04:12) Al: Yeah, nice. That's our Atlantic game I like.
(0:04:32) Codey: It's it
(0:04:34) Codey: Yeah, very good. And I because there are games on game pass that I want to play like Coral Island and Echo Snipe Market. There's like a bunch of games that are available, but I want to stay dedicated to Disney Dreamlight Valley for reasons.
(0:04:52) Al: Speaking of Carl Island, I have been playing Carl Island a lot. I've almost hit 100 hours on that game now. I've just finished year three in the game and now I'm taking a wee we break to play some other games, but yeah, yeah, it's not
(0:04:54) Codey: So yeah, what about you? What have you wanted to?
(0:05:07) Codey: Yeah, didn't you say like you're after your your you said you're gonna take a break after year three?
(0:05:22) Al: not. I mean, that gives you an idea of how much I like this game, because I don't, I think stardew is the only other game that I went, I went to like at least two years,
(0:05:32) Al: right? Like I don't, I don't do that often. It's because it's really hard to get through though to like actually sink a decent amount of time into these games. Um, this, this one just kept me going and I like how it kept me going the second time I came to it as well.
(0:05:47) Al: Right, it wasn't just like, I spent like what, 40 hours in the first time and I've
(0:05:52) Al: stunk in another 60 hours, right? So like, that's pretty good. Uh, you know, like it's impressive to, for me to spend that amount of time on a game, a game which I have not spent that long in is Coa and the Five Pirates. Uh, so I have finished that game, but it's a very nice short game. So it took me five hours. I've not like a hundred percented everything.
(0:06:15) Al: I think you could maybe add on like another two to three hours if you want to a hundred percent everything but I was pretty happy.
(0:06:22) Al: happy with it. So that's the 3D platformer from the Summer in Mara people. So it was good fun. We have an extra story in that world and a fun platforming game. The bosses in particular were very fun, some good challenges and different ways of doing things. So it's not just like the same thing over and over again. It really felt like each level they they kind of had crafted nicely.
(0:06:23) Codey: Mm-hmm. Okay.
(0:06:51) Al: So that was good.
(0:06:53) Al: I have just started a Highland song, because that came out yesterday.
(0:06:58) Al: That is a platformer based in the Scottish Highlands, but it also has some rhythm-based parts to it.
(0:07:09) Al: It's a really interesting game, and it's really hard to explain, but essentially it's a platformer,
(0:07:14) Al: but it's like an exploration platformer, kind of.
(0:07:19) Al: But it's also like a story game.
(0:07:21) Al: the I mean everything about this game is just gorgeous. Like I love how it looks, I love how it plays, I love the music,
(0:07:28) Al: like everything about it is just fantastic. And like real Scott,
(0:07:30) Codey: Okay, that's high praise, high praise it being about the Scottish Highlands and coming from a Scott, so.
(0:07:37) Al: and it's got real Scottish accents in it so.
(0:07:39) Codey: Mm-hmm, awesome.
(0:07:43) Al: And finally I've been playing the Beat Saber original soundtrack 6, so that just came out
(0:07:51) Al: tonight today I think
(0:07:52) Al: um so i've been playing that so that's got a dragon force song, a lindsay starling song,
(0:08:01) Al: a camellia song, and another song by someone I hadn't heard of but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
(0:08:07) Al: So now I just want more dragon force and more lindsay starling songs like they're both really fun to play to. The camellia one and the other one were good as well but we already have a camellia pack so like there's plenty of that I really want really want the others.
(0:08:23) Al: Um yeah lots. I so I play it on the quest 2, the meta quest 2.
(0:08:24) Codey: - What do you play that on?
(0:08:33) Al: At this point trying with all my might not to buy the meta quest 3, especially as they just released an update for beat saber on the quest 3 that gives it 120 frames per second on which is just wild because it's like the one thing that i'd not hugely a fact well the two things that i'm that I'm not a huge fan of with the Quest 2.
(0:08:52) Al: one, the cameras to put you in the augmented part of it are not great, right? You can kind of see the shapes and everything. You can figure out where you are, but you can't make out anything on it. And the Quest 3 has much better cameras. And sometimes it's a little bit like, "Oh, that wasn't quite the right kind of refresh rate, and I felt a little bit dizzy from that." So it doesn't happen very often, but it does happen enough to make me want to not have that.
(0:09:22) Al: So yeah, we'll see what happens.
(0:09:28) Codey: Cool.
(0:09:29) Al: What happens?
(0:09:30) Al: Making you sound like it's a surprise.
(0:09:31) Al: Oh no!
(0:09:32) Al: What happened?
(0:09:33) Al: Oops, I bought it.
(0:09:34) Codey: What? What could possibly...
(0:09:34) Al: How did that happen?
(0:09:35) Al: Shall we talk about some news, Codey?
(0:09:40) Codey: Let's do it.
(0:09:42) Al: Let's start off with Turnitboy Robsabank.
(0:09:45) Al: They have announced that their release date is the 18th of January.
(0:09:49) Al: Oh...
(0:09:50) Codey: I just want, so like the fact that they're making this turn up to all these illegal things
(0:09:58) Codey: I really want the next one to be turn it boy breaks up a marriage just for you Al
(0:10:04) Al: Why- _Laughter_
(0:10:06) Al: No! _Laughter_
(0:10:06) Codey: Like have you ever wanted to evade taxes? Have you ever wanted to rob a bank?
(0:10:08) Al: Right, no, no, no, no, no, no [Laughter]
(0:10:12) Al: I also don't, like, in real life, want to break up marriages, right?
(0:10:16) Al: Like, that's- _Laughter_
(0:10:18) Al: You're making it sound like I'm a homewrecker!
(0:10:22) Codey: You want to be a video game? You want the option.
(0:10:22) Al: I just- _Laughter_
(0:10:24) Al: In- in my- _Laughter_
(0:10:26) Al: In my farming games! _Laughter_
(0:10:28) Codey: No, I love, I just saw this title and I was like,
(0:10:32) Codey: they're making this poor turn up to all these things.
(0:10:37) Al: No one's making him do anything. He's choosing to do this. He is crazy.
(0:10:39) Codey: Yeah, he's a goofy goober.
(0:10:43) Codey: So, I mean, so you've played the first one.
(0:10:46) Codey: Does this seem, is this like a sequel?
(0:10:48) Codey: Like, do you get to continue on from the same?
(0:10:49) Al: Yeah.
(0:10:51) Al: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the sequel. Like it's a continuation of Turn It By Story.
(0:10:59) Al: I mean, it looks good. It looks like it takes kind of what was in the first game and adds some more other ideas like the first game didn't.
(0:11:07) Al: Have guns, for example.
(0:11:08) Codey: The picture of him, the logo when he's holding a gun.
(0:11:15) Codey: Oh my god.
(0:11:17) Al: I mean, nobody robs a bank with not a gun, right?
(0:11:20) Al: Like, that's kind of a requirement to rob a bank.
(0:11:22) Codey: I feel like people will rob banks in countries that don't allow guns without guns.
(0:11:27) Codey: There's gotta be like...
(0:11:29) Al: Yeah, they just get guns, right? Like, yeah, sure, guns are illegal. And, you know, this is not a political point, but it doesn't mean that there are no guns, right? Like, you can still get guns.
(0:11:41) Al: Like, do you think gun people, for countries that have no legal guns, still have zero guns, right?
(0:11:46) Al: If you're going to rob a bank, you can get a gun, right? It's harder to get it. Like, I'm not saying that gun controls don't work. They do. But it doesn't mean that literally nobody can ever get to gun and therefore you got to rob a bank with a knife, right? Like, which would be significantly harder.
(0:11:50) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:12:06) Codey: I feel like that would make-- that's like how you play this game on hard mode.
(0:12:10) Al: No guns.
(0:12:10) Codey: That should be what's hard mode. There's just no guns and you gotta rob the bank.
(0:12:15) Al: There are a lot of guns in this trailer. Lots of different guns. And also a spaceship at the end.
(0:12:18) Codey: There are. There are. There really are. Yeah, yeah, there's an alien at the end. I didn't know if like it was a character that you've already seen or something because, um, like they have the outline of the character. Yeah, they have the outline of the character and like you can see that it kind kind of has like maybe sunglasses on.
(0:12:29) Al: The alien, no.
(0:12:36) Codey: And I didn't know if there was maybe like a link to the previous game.
(0:12:38) Al: No, I don't recognize that character.
(0:12:41) Codey: Cool.
(0:12:42) Codey: Cool, cool, cool.
(0:12:43) Codey: How is the alien going to help?
(0:12:45) Codey: Are they going to give you more advanced guns?
(0:12:47) Codey: Is that how that works?
(0:12:49) Al: Oh, I did see a laser gun at one point.
(0:12:51) Codey: Are they, are they like also trying, they came from space to rob the exact same bank that you're trying to rob?
(0:12:58) Codey: Like are they competition?
(0:12:58) Al: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. This game's coming to Windows, Switch and Xbox,
(0:13:02) Codey: Uh.
(0:13:04) Al: and it's also coming to Game Pass. And there's a new trailer. There you go. Done. Right.
(0:13:06) Codey: Mm-hm, January 18th, next.
(0:13:10) Al: January 18th. Pixel Shire is no longer coming to Early Access and is releasing next year.
(0:13:16) Al: Cool. Great. No real comment on that. Good for you. It seems like an interesting thing to be like, "We're coming to Early Access," and then be like, "Aha! No, we're not." But
(0:13:16) Codey: Yep. Take your time.
(0:13:21) Codey: Good for her.
(0:13:27) Codey: Well, it's not that. It's not like a "ha ha, we pulled the rug from you."
(0:13:33) Codey: We were optimistic and life happens and that's okay. That's okay, Pixel Shire.
(0:13:36) Al: No, I think their point is they don't, I think what they're trying to say is they don't
(0:13:42) Codey: That is true. In the thing, they're like,
(0:13:45) Codey: we're not going to do early access.
(0:13:46) Codey: at all, we're just going to release 1.0 in the neck.
(0:13:49) Codey: I don't understand what the benefit of that is, but sure.
(0:13:52) Codey: Cool.
(0:13:52) Codey: You do you it's, it's your stuff.
(0:13:53) Al: We'll see what happens.
(0:13:58) Al: Botany Manor is releasing in Spring 2024 on Steam Switch, Xbox and Game Pass.
(0:14:05) Codey: Yeah and it is they mentioned it in the Twitter like someone asked if it's going to be steam deck verified and they said yeah not going to be on PlayStation that's another comment from someone on the Twitter Twitter post tweet
(0:14:17) Al: I mean, I feel like Steam Deck verification is just kind of a default for these things now,
(0:14:21) Al: like, if you're not supporting all the Steam Deck stuff, get out of here, go away. I don't want you.
(0:14:26) Codey: Okay, okay.
(0:14:28) Al: Right. Bare minimum. Bare minimum.
(0:14:28) Codey: Um, look, looks really cool, though.
(0:14:31) Codey: I don't know if we've talked about this game before, but I hadn't seen it and it looks really cool.
(0:14:35) Al: We've mentioned it somewhere, but yeah, it's like, you're running a botany.
(0:14:40) Codey: Um, a bot--a botany.
(0:14:40) Al: No, why is it a botany? Botanical gardens, I guess, would be. Is that what it is?
(0:14:44) Codey: You--you encounter a botanical garden place, like--
(0:14:46) Al: Please.
(0:14:49) Al: Running a botany.
(0:14:51) Codey: You're basically it seems like there's like there was a botanist's house. Maybe the botanist passed away
(0:14:56) Codey: She's like elsewhere on a vacation or something But like you come upon her house and then you kind of like using her notes try and find plants that are
(0:15:06) Codey: Lost like plants that might have died out somehow or they're just missing like they they're like this plant should exist And then it's like boom you can make it Looks really cool. I wonder if they're gonna teach you how to take care of real plants because your girl needs it I'm pretty sure this is I always want this. I'm pretty sure that this game
(0:15:22) Al: You're always wanting that, goodness me.
(0:15:27) Codey: Mmm, I should yeah, it's it's
(0:15:32) Codey: Per published published by white thorn games, which is the same game publisher that published a pico
(0:15:39) Codey: And I told the a pico people that I wanted this
(0:15:43) Codey: Also white thorn games is like based in like three hours for me very cool
(0:15:51) Codey: So cool excited we'll get it on game pass Yes.
(0:15:57) Al: Roots of Patcher have released their 1.1 update and are on Switch and PlayStation now.
(0:16:03) Al: Codey, is there anything I need to care about this update because I've still not played
(0:16:04) Codey: The update...
(0:16:08) Codey: I think that the update only adds stuff to...
(0:16:12) Codey: I don't think it's going to add anything that's going to make people that haven't played it want to play it.
(0:16:16) Codey: I think it's just a benefit if you've already played it before.
(0:16:20) Codey: So they include a new animal, which is called the Oryx. It's kind of like a bison-ish thing.
(0:16:24) Codey: You're able to sit down now.
(0:16:26) Codey: There's a new romanceable character.
(0:16:28) Codey: And oh, you do get the ability to break up with people.
(0:16:32) Codey: So like if you decided you want to date.
(0:16:34) Codey: someone and then you're like yeah then you actually can like go in and be like I think it's a like disband Union or something like that and then you can
(0:16:42) Al: Yeah, they don't have marriage because obviously that's a modern concept. They have unions instead.
(0:16:46) Codey: unions and so you can disband that and like go be with someone else and it said something like your the people will be upset but they'll get they'll get over it you can now harvest meat from traps and there are new cutscenes and other things so yeah they'll just get over it they'll be fine
(0:17:00) Al: They'll get over it who cares doesn't doesn't matter Bye!
(0:17:04) Codey: so yeah I think it's it's things that kind of enhance the world and the interactability and the choices that you can make which is really cool but I don't think like you're saying like someone who hasn't played it I don't think these are things that are gonna be like ooh you can that's gonna bring me to the game well now there's this cool update you can get an oryx you can ride an oryx I'm assuming you can write an oryx well it's it's a
(0:17:23) Al: I mean I do want to play it, I've just not done it yet. Too many games.
(0:17:29) Al: Whatever that is. Is that a real animal or is this a thing they've made up?
(0:17:34) Codey: an extinct animal but yes it was a real animal yeah it's like a bison so I said
(0:17:37) Al: Oh it's just like a cow with horns.
(0:17:42) Al: Interesting. What do I look like? Someone who knows what a bison is?
(0:17:47) Codey: known because your voice is not from America so there's a lot of bison here yeah skeleton what's crazy
(0:17:52) Al: Oh, the skeleton looks creepy.
(0:17:54) Al: I wanna ride the skeleton one.
(0:17:58) Al: Hey, oh yes, that's a bison, I recognize that.
(0:18:03) Al: Tch, tch, chia.
(0:18:04) Codey: chia mm-hmm
(0:18:06) Al: Tch, chia is out now.
(0:18:09) Al: Wait, no, we already knew that.
(0:18:10) Al: Why are you adding that?
(0:18:11) Al: They were already, they've been out for ages.
(0:18:15) Al: Goodness me, let me try that again.
(0:18:17) Codey: listeners behind the scenes I wrote that they're out now he just had it that they were they were releasing on Steam in March and I was like is this are they not out I Chia okay on Bye.
(0:18:22) Al: Tch, chia.
(0:18:28) Al: Right, tchia, tchia, which is already out on PlayStation
(0:18:35) Al: and in the Epic Game Store is coming on Steam in March.
(0:18:40) Al: Is that better?
(0:18:42) Codey: I wonder.
(0:18:43) Al: And they're adding a bunch of updates.
(0:18:48) Codey: The updates that are coming are an outfit perk system.
(0:18:50) Codey: So basically the items will now give you buffs,
(0:18:53) Codey: like outfit, like items that you wear.
(0:18:55) Codey: There's also new cosmetic items.
(0:18:58) Codey: The comment that I wrote is look like the clown that you are.
(0:19:02) Codey: Because you can look like a clown.
(0:19:06) Codey: Yeah, that's because I'm a clown.
(0:19:10) Codey: That's the joke.
(0:19:11) Codey: New soul melodies.
(0:19:11) Codey: So basically it's new ways to--
(0:19:12) Codey: interact with your environment.
(0:19:15) Codey: They-- in the trailer, they show that you use a soul melody and it like blows something up, which is really interesting.
(0:19:22) Codey: Yeah, that's-- that's that.
(0:19:25) Al: It's Windows only, by the way, it's not Mac. Sods.
(0:19:26) Codey: Thank you.
(0:19:27) Codey: I was about to look.
(0:19:30) Al: Bear and Breakfast are coming to PS4 and PS5.
(0:19:34) Al: I was funny when they say that it's like, is there a PS4 version that you can play on the PS5 or is it a PS4 version and a PS5 version?
(0:19:42) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:19:42) Al: I suspect it's a PS4 version that you can play on the PS5.
(0:19:45) Al: Anyway, whoever.
(0:19:46) Codey: Yeah
(0:19:48) Al: Just coming on the 12th of December next week.
(0:19:53) Codey: There's also a new trailer that they have that they put in it and that trailer was unnecessarily dramatic and I absolutely
(0:20:02) Al: It is completely in fitting with their entire social media.
(0:20:08) Codey: I love it. I want more. 10 out of 10 recommend that people watch it. And play that game.
(0:20:16) Al: You played it, didn't you? Yeah, you were on the on the app.
(0:20:18) Codey: It's a good game. I did.
(0:20:24) Al: Everdream Valley, which is already out on other things, is coming to Xbox on the 15th of December.
(0:20:26) Codey: it's coming thank you
(0:20:36) Al: It's funny because they say our Xbox One version and the comments are like, oh, what about the other consoles?
(0:20:42) Al: like that's what they mean is they've done what I would talking about with beer and breakfast right it's an xbox one version that works on xbox series x and s so they just they've worded it in a confusing way
(0:20:54) Codey: And the more important thing is the release date of December 15th is also the day that Twitter user MrRedEyes19 was planning on proposing to his girlfriend. And so he's saying that it'll be the perfect engagement gift and I need the tea. I need to know if he-- how that ends up.
(0:21:14) Al: It feels really risky to tweet that beforehand.
(0:21:16) Codey: Doesn't it though? What if she saw that? Like what if she--
(0:21:24) Al: There isn't a huge amount on their Twitter to, you know, suggest who they are, so.
(0:21:31) Codey: I need the tea though. I need the tea. I need to know if his girlfriend, or their girlfriend, if their girlfriend says yes and if she does, if they give her that game, or I need to know.
(0:21:49) Al: I got so confused there.
(0:21:52) Al: With your changing of what pronouns you were using, I just got so confused to say "see".
(0:21:55) Codey: Well, cause I don't know. They say girlfriend, but I'm not assuming they're genders.
(0:21:57) Al: No, no, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
(0:22:02) Codey: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to do that. I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
(0:22:02) Al: I agree with that, it was just because you changed halfway through,
(0:22:06) Al: I was like "what is, who's who now in this situation?"
(0:22:07) Codey: It was a self-correction. Speaking of self-corrections, Harvest Moon, the Winds of Anthos, is releasing a relaxed mode coming in an update.
(0:22:14) Al: Oh
(0:22:19) Codey: This update has, there's less stamina lost as you're maneuvering the world, and the days are longer.
(0:22:27) Codey: or longer so to me this like means that you are able to do more and there's it's like
(0:22:31) Codey: less on hard mode like and I get my question with that is does this address the concerns that folks had like did you play this game and was this a complaint that you had?
(0:22:33) Al: Yeah...
(0:22:37) Al: I mean...
(0:22:41) Al: It addresses one of the complaints, but it's like one out of like 50.
(0:22:45) Al: I mean part of my problem with this game is it just didn't even feel fun to play. Now,
(0:22:51) Al: the stamina loss when you're moving, yeah, I didn't enjoy that, right? It's one of these things where it's like, yeah sure,
(0:22:57) Al: that's more realistic, but not as fun, right? And the point is we're taking
(0:23:03) Al: things that are like real life and we're making them fun, right? Like I'm very much a...
(0:23:08) Al: I'd rather more fun than more realistic, and that's certainly the case there. So it is a welcome change.
(0:23:15) Al: I didn't particularly feel like the days were very short, so that doesn't really make much of a difference,
(0:23:20) Al: but I mean the game's still not gonna be fun to play, I don't think.
(0:23:24) Al: But each to their own.
(0:23:26) Al: I don't...
(0:23:26) Codey: Uh, is, is the introduction of pizza in the new DLC, uh, the new crops, fish and recipes pack available is, does that increase your funds?
(0:23:33) Al: So, I'm really fascinated by this, right? Because, like, some of these things are like,
(0:23:40) Al: "Oh, cool, they've added killer tomatoes, and they've added Nejog, and a bunch of new fish,
(0:23:47) Al: and pla- right, pizza seem- I mean, it feels like a kind of base game food, right? Like,
(0:23:54) Al: it seems like an odd one to leave for a DLC. I'm not, as some commenters are suggesting,
(0:24:01) Al: it should all be a free update because...
(0:24:03) Al: Stardew does that, right?
(0:24:06) Al: Like, I mean, let's not make Stardew the base for what you should be doing for your free updates.
(0:24:14) Al: They are definitely the extreme for that and you should not expect 10 years of free updates to a game.
(0:24:20) Al: Do not expect that, right?
(0:24:22) Al: Stardew is one person who can afford to do that now.
(0:24:28) Al: Most people can't do that, right?
(0:24:30) Al: Like, don't expect that.
(0:24:32) Codey: I do love one of the comments says, "Imagine making a pizza recipe deals."
(0:24:33) Al: The other stuff I can see why you would think that was an interesting thing to add, but pizza?
(0:24:44) Codey: You'd pay for that? You'd pay for all that stuff? You're gonna... okay, okay.
(0:24:44) Al: Why?
(0:24:45) Al: No, I'm not saying I would pay for it.
(0:24:49) Al: I'm not saying I would pay for it.
(0:24:50) Al: I'm saying I understand why they would add it as a paid update.
(0:24:54) Al: I do not understand why pizza is in a DLC.
(0:24:56) Codey: Yeah, I don't understand. I mean it seems like there's
(0:24:58) Al: Such a weird, weird thing.
(0:25:01) Codey: Depending on how I mean, do we have an amount for how much that DLC costs?
(0:25:05) Codey: because I wouldn't
(0:25:06) Al: I mean, whatever it is is too much
(0:25:08) Codey: Yeah
(0:25:13) Al: Give me a minute. Let me look let me look
(0:25:15) Codey: Yeah for it to just add like a more fish more flowers recipes and tomatoes that can kill you I'm assuming
(0:25:24) Codey: Just doesn't seem like you should have to be
(0:25:26) Codey: for that. Oh! That's not that bad.
(0:25:28) Al: Two dollars.
(0:25:33) Al: It is like, why why?
(0:25:36) Al: It's so odd.
(0:25:37) Al: It feels like they wanted to bump up the number of DLCs.
(0:25:43) Al: Because you can like bundle them all together, right?
(0:25:45) Al: Like or you can buy them separately, fine, whatever.
(0:25:47) Al: But like I just who's going, oh, yeah, I want to buy the the pizza DLC,
(0:25:54) Al: not the the animals DLC or like I want to buy them.
(0:25:58) Al: The game that added tool upgrades as a DLC, which I do think is a ridiculous thing to be in your DLC. That's definitely a base game thing. Don't add tool updates in your DLC.
(0:26:11) Al: That is bizarre. I don't know. I want to start. Can I can I stop talking about this game, please?
(0:26:14) Codey: What game? One Lonely Outpost?
(0:26:18) Al: I'm done with this game. This stupid game. One lonely outpost. This is an interesting,
(0:26:26) Al: small update. I don't know why we're talking about.
(0:26:28) Al: But there we are. They've added a new thing to the game and it no longer pretends to be an oven.
(0:26:29) Codey: It's funny.
(0:26:32) Codey: Well, so it wasn't...
(0:26:35) Codey: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
(0:26:37) Codey: I don't think that they're adding it now.
(0:26:40) Al: No, they did add it. The bit at the top is like, "Oh, hey, we fixed this in a patch on top of it."
(0:26:40) Codey: It's...
(0:26:45) Codey: Yeah, so they had something called, they had something called an unrefiner,
(0:26:45) Al: But if you read below, they're actually talking about it being brand new.
(0:26:50) Codey: which I'm assuming just like takes a thing and makes it its base thing.
(0:26:52) Al: Unrefined.
(0:26:55) Codey: So, but apparently you would place it in the world and it would just become an oven.
(0:26:56) Al: Yeah.
(0:26:58) Al: No it doesn't. Awesome. Stardew Valley. Codey, they added more dates for the Stardew Valley concert. And there's one in Edinburgh, which is my city, and I have tickets. I have bought tickets. I got tickets. Oh my word. Let me tell you, this was so stressful. The The concert sold out in 90...
(0:27:05) Codey: It doesn't do that anymore, yay.
(0:27:11) Codey: What? What?
(0:27:14) Codey: They did.
(0:27:16) Codey: And...
(0:27:18) Codey: And...
(0:27:20) Codey: Yay!
(0:27:24) Codey: Okay.
(0:27:28) Al: Nine minutes. The Edinburgh concert. Nine minutes.
(0:27:28) Codey: Okay.
(0:27:30) Codey: Okay.
(0:27:33) Al: That was so stressful, let me tell you.
(0:27:34) Codey: Yeah.
(0:27:37) Al: But I got it. I got it. And I got... I mean, they weren't the best tickets, right?
(0:27:41) Al: But they weren't what they called restricted view. They weren't restricted view. So...
(0:27:44) Codey: The worst tickets.
(0:27:48) Codey: They're not the best, but they're not the worst.
(0:27:51) Al: Exactly. So my word. And the Europe ticket... So they added a whole bunch more because it was
(0:27:58) Al: one in Europe. So there was one London show and that was the only one in Europe.
(0:27:58) Codey: Mm-hmm and that's sold out.
(0:28:02) Al: And they added... And it sold out within seconds.
(0:28:06) Codey: I wonder how many people like imagine if if you're someone from like Italy and you're like oh my god it's gonna be in London and then now you're seeing that there's one in Italy. Like are they gonna are they gonna riff on the London tickets and go to the Italy one? Who knows? I'm assuming these are all these are all gonna sell out these are all gonna sell out
(0:28:12) Al: Yeah. Yeah. And you book your tickets together. Yeah, I know. I know.
(0:28:22) Al: Oh, I suspect so. I suspect. They do ticket reselling.
(0:28:28) Al: Well, most of them already are sold out, so the four of the eight are already sold out, and two haven't gone on sale yet.
(0:28:34) Al: So... [LAUGHS]
(0:28:36) Al: But yeah, like, funnily enough, the only one in Scotland sold out within minutes, so... Yeah, I'm so glad I got there.
(0:28:45) Codey: Oh, the website is not loading.
(0:28:48) Al: Yeah, but they're now up to eight, so they had one Europe showing, and now they've got eight.
(0:28:52) Codey: Cool. Well, I'm excited that you get to go.
(0:28:52) Al: So I'm so super excited.
(0:28:55) Codey: Um...
(0:28:58) Al: To run, I was like, do you want to go to a video game concert?
(0:29:01) Al: And she was like, sure.
(0:29:02) Al: And I was like, yeah.
(0:29:08) Al: So, yeah, we're going to have a date, a musical date.
(0:29:12) Al: Because she's a big music person.
(0:29:15) Al: She's a music teacher and she has like a billion different instruments that she
(0:29:18) Al: plays, so she will appreciate the actual music part of it.
(0:29:21) Al: And I will appreciate the stardew part of it and.
(0:29:23) Codey: Right. That's awesome.
(0:29:25) Al: It'll be fun. Yeah.
(0:29:26) Codey: And they also have an update.
(0:29:28) Al: Well, yeah, so they roll.
(0:29:34) Al: As he continues to do, Concerned Ape has posted another random small tidbit from the upcoming 1.6 update, and this time, it's a big chest, sorry, a larger container for items.
(0:29:45) Codey: It's... it's called a big chest.
(0:29:47) Al: It's got a big chest.
(0:29:49) Codey: It's just called a big chest.
(0:29:53) Al: What I find funny is that is, well I mean one of the things I find funny, clearly, is...
(0:29:58) Al: It says, it's description is, "It can store almost twice as much as a regular chest."
(0:30:04) Al: What does "almost" mean in this situation?
(0:30:06) Codey: My favorite thing is the top comment says "Finally I won't need 2 million chests" and concern Dave said "Nope only 1 million."
(0:30:12) Al: Yeah. So yeah, like, is it going to be like two times the normal chest minus one? Or like,
(0:30:28) Al: I really like, what does it mean by almost? I need to know. I need to know, but we'll find out.
(0:30:30) Codey: Yeah, is it like one less?
(0:30:34) Al: Well, you need to find out. I suspect.
(0:30:36) Codey: I'm sure you will find out. I'm sure it will be double actually, but whatever
(0:30:42) Al: So I suspect that's funny wording. Anyway, Disney Dreamlight Valley.
(0:30:50) Al: I wrote all of this before the stuff came out, but it actually came out today, didn't it?
(0:30:53) Al: So I don't know if there's been any changes, but the, so I guess the, the 1.0 is out for Disney Dreamlight Valley came out today, including the Jack Skellington. So the Pumpkin King returns update is out now, so is no longer in early access and is therefore more expensive.
(0:31:12) Al: And the first DLC is also out, which is, like, okay, I've talked about this quite a bit. I don't have an issue with them releasing DLC for this game, but they really didn't think about the Optics well enough, right? So one, they announced the paid DLC on the same day they announced that the game was not going to be free. And two, they released the first paid DLC on the same day as the 1.0 release which just...
(0:31:30) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:31:42) Codey: Yep
(0:31:42) Al: Feels...
(0:31:43) Al: Mmm...
(0:31:46) Al: I don't know.
(0:31:46) Codey: Yep
(0:31:48) Al: Have you played it today?
(0:31:49) Codey: Nope Well, one thing that I'm curious about so like looking at the platforms it doesn't say that it's still available Oh, just kidding. It was initially planned
(0:31:59) Codey: Nope, I still don't know. I don't know if the game pass version is still available Like I don't know if it's still on game pass or if once it came out
(0:32:07) Codey: They just popped it off game pass now. It's that is unclear to me
(0:32:12) Codey: Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. It's in another room. Also, launching that game takes so long.
(0:32:12) Al: It does look like it's still on Game Pass.
(0:32:14) Al: Pass. Pass.
(0:32:16) Al: I mean, you could just try and launch the game.
(0:32:26) Al: It's still on the Game Pass website.
(0:32:26) Codey: Okay, cool. I don't know, that game takes so long to load. And I am horrified to see how much longer it is going to take to load today.
(0:32:28) Al: So, I'm guessing it's still there.
(0:32:38) Codey: Like, I literally, I literally...
(0:32:38) Al: Just don't just don't get the DLC. Oh is the DLC on game pass?
(0:32:42) Codey: Start the game... I'm not gonna pay for that.
(0:32:44) Codey: It literally... Oh, I guess I wouldn't...
(0:32:46) Codey: It literally... I start the game...
(0:32:49) Al: Do you want to start over there?
(0:32:53) Codey: ADHD.
(0:32:54) Codey: Um, I start the game from, like, my Xbox home screen.
(0:32:59) Codey: And then I walk, I go, like, play with my dog for, like, five minutes.
(0:33:02) Codey: And then I come back, and then I can click the button to, like, load my game save.
(0:33:07) Codey: And then I go play with my other dog for five minutes.
(0:33:10) Codey: and then I come back and finally can play.
(0:33:12) Codey: She do be slow and I have a wired connection so yike.
(0:33:16) Codey: Um, but yeah, so the DLC has a scramble coin, which is an in game board game that you can. I don't really know how you play it, but looks really cool.
(0:33:26) Codey: And you can collect figurines or yeah, so you collect like figurines of the care of your favorite characters and I'm assuming that they have different abilities.
(0:33:28) Al: Yes, it's a collectible
(0:33:31) Al: It looks really cool
(0:33:40) Al: Yeah, so I don't care about the game, right? The game, I could take it or leave it, but like,
(0:33:42) Codey: Okay.
(0:33:44) Al: another collecting thing? I am in. Did I get to collect the villagers in my village and as figurines? Perfect. Just what I need. Give me more collections, please. No, I'm not being sarcastic.
(0:33:52) Codey: Are you, are you being sarcastic?
(0:33:59) Al: This is literally what I do in games. I am a collector. I collect things. I like collections.
(0:34:02) Codey: My gosh, cuz also like I, not to get too, too into it, but this game,
(0:34:12) Codey: I like much, I much like this game.
(0:34:14) Codey: And my response to all of this news about the DLC,
(0:34:18) Codey: the minifigures as a pumpkin king update,
(0:34:22) Codey: like my comment was literally this game is too big, please Disney stop.
(0:34:28) Codey: Because like I already, man they're,
(0:34:30) Al: They're not stopping yet.
(0:34:31) Al: They've got four upcoming updates next year and two more parts of the DLC.
(0:34:34) Codey: They are not stopping, like because I started playing it in early access from Game Pass and it already was like.
(0:34:42) Codey: I need to redact my thoughts because I might be giving them elsewhere.
(0:34:54) Codey: So I need but.
(0:34:54) Al: If you want to hear more about that, maybe tune in in a future episode, maybe.
(0:34:56) Codey: Maybe do that.
(0:34:58) Codey: Maybe do that.
(0:35:01) Al: Look, I just I will say I will say one last thing.
(0:35:06) Al: Feel free not to respond to this.
(0:35:08) Al: But I think it's very clear that they want this to be the game that people play, right?
(0:35:12) Al: They want it to be, you know, a word of Warcraft or something like that.
(0:35:12) Codey: Mm-hmm yep yep
(0:35:18) Al: They want it to be the game that you play for years.
(0:35:23) Al: And we'll see you in a few years.
(0:35:24) Al: Whether they're successful or not, I mean, we know they're going to be successful with certain people, obviously. There are certain people who will buy and play literally every Disney thing imaginable, but. Also, Jack Skellington's in the game now, so.
(0:35:36) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:35:39) Codey: Correct.
(0:35:43) Codey: Yeah.
(0:35:45) Al: Speaking of DLC, Fae Farm have released DLC. Oh no, not have released, are releasing.
(0:35:48) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:35:54) Al: It's coming next week, on the 14th of December. And this is called Coasts of Crocea, which is a great name. And, so I'm confused because it's like, oh, here's a frog. And I'm like,
(0:36:11) Al: the frogs were already in the game. But then there's a big frog. The big frog was
(0:36:12) Codey: yeah. And it seems like the so this is the big frog opens like a portal in his mouth and then you go you jump into the mouth portal which gives me real
(0:36:27) Codey: oh I can't remember his name from Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
(0:36:34) Al: Oh, I did not like that game, so I don't know what you're talking about.
(0:36:34) Codey: Fish guy. I'd probably need to be way more specific than that. It's the
(0:36:42) Codey: job. I want to say like Jabba or something. Jabu Jabu. Oh I was close man. It's been a hot minute since I played that game. He I mean he's like a fish that swallowed the princess and you have to go into him and there's like a whole freaking like world inside of him that you have to explore like you're exploring his bowels and stuff. And I wonder if that's like what this is like this this frog has a mouth portal and the portal takes you to what is called the Crosts of croquia, which I'd still hate that name.
(0:37:12) Al: Can I just point out how amazing the phrase "mouth portal" is?
(0:37:20) Codey: Am I wrong? Are you going to look at me and you're going to tell me that I'm wrong?
(0:37:23) Codey: It's a mouth portal!
(0:37:24) Al: No! No I'm not! I just... I just... I just love hate the name. That's all I'm saying.
(0:37:30) Codey: Yeah. So yeah, it looks like there's just a bunch of new stuff for that.
(0:37:38) Al: Yeah, this feels a lot bigger than I was expecting the DLCs to be, right? Because it was like "here's the Deluxe Edition and it's gonna have three DLCs" and I was totally expecting it was stuff like that.
(0:37:49) Al: The Harvest Moon Winds of Anthos like "oh here's some new crops" no no it's "here's a whole new world to explore with a new story" so I mean that's cool. I really want to like this game, I really do.
(0:37:54) Codey: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
(0:37:59) Codey: Yeah?
(0:38:04) Codey: Yeah. Yikes.
(0:38:05) Al: I really do.
(0:38:07) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:38:09) Al: Anyway, if you're enjoying it, there you go, go get your DLC in a week.
(0:38:16) Al: And the final thing before the wholesome snack is the wholesome games bundle, because they did announce this before the snack, which is they've put together a wholesome and a humble bundle,
(0:38:20) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:38:28) Al: a humble bundle of wholesome games, which include four games that we have talked about on the podcast,
(0:38:34) Al: wildflowers, bed and breakfast, smishy come home.
(0:38:38) Al: And there's also Tinykin, which I believe is like Pikmin, Pikmin type game. Mailtime,
(0:38:48) Al: which when I looked at it just looked exactly like smishy come home. And Passpartout to the Lost Artist, which I hate that name on so many levels.
(0:39:03) Codey: Yeah.
(0:39:04) Codey: Um...
(0:39:08) Al: I mean, look, I'm saying if you have the money and there's at least one game on this bundle that you don't own, go buy the bundle. Go do it now. Because every single one of these games is more expensive than the price to get all of them.
(0:39:15) Codey: Yeah
(0:39:21) Codey: Yep, and each game has over an 85% or or higher positive rating on
(0:39:27) Codey: Steam so that like even the quote-unquote maybe possibly worst of these games is still super highly rated Like this is a really cute little little bundle that they've provided Um...
(0:39:40) Al: And all of the money goes to save the children who are doing very important work all over the world, especially currently in Gaza.
(0:39:51) Al: So you can go buy your games and give money to stop children dying. Crazy, crazy ideas.
(0:39:58) Codey: Yep, so if you've listened to our podcast and you've heard us talk about these games and you've been waiting to get it, what are you waiting for?
(0:40:08) Al: There's little if you don't buy these games now, you're not gonna buy them, right?
(0:40:11) Al: Just don't just admit that to yourself if you won't buy this seven game bundle for was that $18
(0:40:17) Al: You're not gonna buy any of these games. You just won't do it
(0:40:20) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:21) Al: So admit it to yourself or go buy it
(0:40:25) Codey: Yep, yep, yep.
(0:40:25) Al: If you don't have the money I'm really sorry that's very sad
(0:40:32) Al: All right, whoa that was quite a quite a quite a news section and the news is over so the wholesome snack just came out a few hours ago and we have watched through it and we have curated I was gonna say we've curated the things that we should care about this is like half the things in the snack Oh
(0:40:36) Codey: Quite a bunch. Mm-mm.
(0:40:38) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:40:40) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:40:52) Codey: The things that seem important to or relevant to this podcast with the with the respect of cottagecore games in mind.
(0:41:06) Codey: I will say that we will talk about the non cottagecore games that we are also excited about in a house that of the green variety may have.
(0:41:17) Codey: So, we will talk more in depth about that kind of stuff then.
(0:41:22) Codey: But, just the which which games seemed to strike the vibe of the pod?
(0:41:28) Codey: And which which ones do you think?
(0:41:30) Al: No, there were no, there were no which games.
(0:41:32) Codey: Wow, I said...
(0:41:33) Al: Not in this one.
(0:41:37) Codey: Which W-H-I-C-H games, not W-I-T-C-H games?
(0:41:43) Codey: You goob. Okay.
(0:41:45) Codey: So...
(0:41:45) Al: So I just before we go through these, we will have a link to the whole wholesome
(0:41:46) Codey: Thank you.
(0:41:50) Al: snack in the show notes, and also I will link each of the trailers for these games
(0:41:56) Al: individually.
(0:41:58) Al: All right.
(0:42:00) Al: So first up, we have a vivarium, which is about a world inside a terrarium.
(0:42:10) Codey: a vivarium.
(0:42:12) Al: Is a vivarium a thing or is that not just the name of the
(0:42:16) Codey: Terrariums are designed to raise plants and vivariums are designed primarily to be a habitat for an animal.
(0:42:23) Al: So they said it was a terrarium in the game.
(0:42:26) Codey: But the game is called vivarium.
(0:42:28) Al: Yeah, it says missing terrarium. So why is a terrarium or is it a vivarium? I'm so confused.
(0:42:33) Codey: Well, the game is called "vibarium."
(0:42:36) Al: Yeah, but in the trailer they said a missing terrarium. They use both words.
(0:42:39) Codey: And given that inside of the thing is animals, I'm presuming, I think it's a vibarium.
(0:42:50) Al: Oh wait, so wait, so a vivarium is a type of terrarium or a terrarium is a type of vivarium.
(0:42:56) Codey: Um, they are, they both do similar things or they're a type of, of areum.
(0:43:04) Al: Ah, a vivarium may be small enough to sit on a desk or table such as a terrarium or an aquarium.
(0:43:05) Codey: Um...
(0:43:14) Al: So terrariums are kinds of vivariums, but vivariums can be big.
(0:43:19) Al: Oh, so like yeah, these big ones you get like are building size, they are vivariums.
(0:43:20) Codey: Well, so the differences of vivarium will have animals in it, whereas a terrarium could be, so it houses plants.
(0:43:37) Codey: It could be a vivarium, but it doesn't have to be a vivarium.
(0:43:42) Codey: So an aquarium is a type of vivarium.
(0:43:44) Al: Anyway, this is both. This is both. That's the important thing.
(0:43:45) Codey: This is both.
(0:43:46) Codey: It has plants and animals.
(0:43:51) Al: So the semantics aside, I'm not really sure what this game is, but I feel like it's probably a Cottagecore game, but it's really hard to tell, because the trailer doesn't really tell as much.
(0:43:59) Codey: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the trailer doesn't really have much. Um, it has a lot of like,
(0:44:08) Codey: I really like the design style and the way that it's, it's, um, the way it looks, it looks like an anime almost. Um, like one of the characters literally looks like a Hayao Miyazaki character,
(0:44:21) Codey: 100%. Like he's got this big mustache and the way that he smiles looks like, um, the Boiler Man in and spirited away.
(0:44:29) Codey: So, if you like that kind of stuff, then this game basically is like, to me thus far from this trailer, looks like a little Hayao Miyazaki world inside of a vivarium that is inside of what possibly is an abandoned terrarium.
(0:44:45) Codey: Yeah, not entirely sure what all the gameplay within that is going to be.
(0:44:47) Al: And my question is, you being in a vivarium, is that going to affect anything? Or is that just like, because they said so, right? So like, if you're just in a world and, and nothing's kind of like, different about it because you happen to be this tiny little world, then that feels kind of pointless. So I guess we'll just have, but literally we saw no real game.
(0:45:17) Al: We just saw a few clips of your character walking around the world and that was it.
(0:45:22) Al: So we'll keep an eye on it, figure out whether it's actually a cottagecore game, figure out if there's actually any gameplay to it and whether it actually means anything. But I'm intrigued.
(0:45:34) Al: Communite. So I've talked about this before, but just for people who aren't aware, this This is a multiplayer city builder game, it's like an online game. And they have announced that you can get your own server for it. So previously it was just like one combined server, but you can, they have 30 servers that they're giving to people. So if you want to go get your own server, you might be able to do that.
(0:45:34) Codey: Yeah same
(0:46:04) Al: They've also added an update with new tiles and new animals and some new NPCs that you have to save from specific things.
(0:46:12) Codey: Yeah, and one of the things that they show is bees, um, so I'm, I'm intrigued.
(0:46:24) Codey: But the other thing, there was a panda, right?
(0:46:26) Al: Oh that's an adorable bee sprite.
(0:46:30) Codey: There's a panda that when you unlock it, it says, wow, I forgot to take care of myself.
(0:46:36) Codey: Thanks for helping me out.
(0:46:39) Codey: that like why I feel it's that am I a panda
(0:46:42) Codey: mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah basically like by saving them you're adding to the content that you can use to curate your game just real cool so yeah it looks really cute I guess like the mechanics are still kind of like I'm not really sure but it's something to keep on your on your horizon for sure
(0:46:44) Al: Oh, and unlocking, saving the NPCs gives you extra tails when you do that.
(0:47:12) Al: Lightyear Frontier have given us their early access release date, and that is in March.
(0:47:20) Al: Well, I say date, it's month. They've not given us the date, they've given us the month.
(0:47:26) Al: So if you want to be a mech farming on an outer space planet, which Codey doesn't, then
(0:47:35) Codey: Nope, I'm not the most interested in this, but that's not, I doesn't have to be, I don't have to be.
(0:47:49) Al: Yes, you do.
(0:47:49) Codey: The creatures look really cool.
(0:47:51) Codey: It's actually obligated to be a host of this podcast.
(0:47:54) Al: It's in your contract.
(0:47:56) Codey: I didn't, I didn't read that, I just signed it.
(0:48:00) Codey: The creatures of the world look really cool, like it's, it's one of those games that I,
(0:48:04) Codey: I would be excited to watch.
(0:48:05) Codey: Someone else play while I am doing other things, but not something that I would be interested in playing myself.
(0:48:08) Al: interesting. Yeah, yeah. I'm undecided. I'm undecided on this. Like, I think it could bring some interesting new ways, like new ways of doing farming in a farming game, because like so many are just like the exact same gameplay, which is fine, but also like it
(0:48:13) Codey: Speaking of.
(0:48:14) Codey: Yeah.
(0:48:17) Codey: What about you?
(0:48:17) Codey: Like does, does mech agriculture seem like tickle your fancy?
(0:48:38) Al: makes it hard to get excited about other games when it's just like, oh, the same thing again. So I'm intrigued to see what they're doing. Like you see little bits where they're like shooting water at the stuff and they're like using a vacuum on their mech suit to like zoom up, sucking all the harvest and stuff like that. So I think it could be interesting,
(0:49:00) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:49:03) Al: I don't know, we'll have to sleep. But one that I know 100%, I will.
(0:49:04) Codey: Okay.
(0:49:08) Codey: Yep.
(0:49:08) Al: We'll be playing is Gogotown, which I think everything about this game I love. Right.
(0:49:14) Al: We've talked about a few things like they have a chainsaw. They have like these ridiculous little like you've got a skateboard and there's like a mini scooter, a unicorn mini scooter.
(0:49:16) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:49:25) Al: And it's like all these things that I think are fantastic ideas and look really fun to play. Like I from the moment I saw this game months ago, I was like, I need
(0:49:27) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:49:38) Codey: Mm-hmm Yeah watching this trailer so it starts out There's a there's a wacky inflatable arm flailing tube man, which always gets my attention. You've got me I got I got it looks great, too
(0:49:49) Codey: Seems like it'd be really difficult to animate, but they did it flawlessly
(0:49:53) Codey: But also it just seems like what it what even is this game like it has so much stuff and the game that it reminds Me of when I watch the trailer is fortnight for whatever reason
(0:50:05) Al: Thank you.
(0:50:06) Codey: Like the idea of you like off.
(0:50:08) Codey: Doing your own thing, but then like you turn around and there's just like chaos happening around you seems really cool. The character design is crazy, like diverse.
(0:50:20) Codey: Um, there's just so many.
(0:50:22) Al: Yeah, the customization looks really good.
(0:50:25) Al: It's not even just like, oh, you can choose your eye color and stuff like that.
(0:50:29) Al: It's like you can choose how many eyes you have.
(0:50:30) Codey: Yeah, they have, I don't know if these are tiles that you can, you can buy, but starter farm starter fishing starter decorations, town decorations, expanded, I got to look at this expanded fit outs, whatever that is, basic housing.
(0:50:32) Al: Like they're not they're not.
(0:50:34) Al: There is.
(0:50:51) Codey: What, like, what is this? Yeah, like, like starter fishing and then you can fish. Yeah, like, what?
(0:50:52) Al: Yeah, those look like things you purchase to add to the town.
(0:50:57) Al: There's ghosts? I just saw some ghosts.
(0:51:00) Codey: But even, I mean, I am intrigued. And especially it being like a co-op with a bunch of people, like, I could totally. Yeah.
(0:51:08) Al: Yes, so that's the new news, is that they are doing another playtest, so they've done a number of different playtests, and they're doing a new one in February, which adds in couch co-op. So I don't know whether I would want to do this or not, because it just feels like I feel like I would just be constantly distracted by the madness happening on the other three screens. Yeah. Well, that's what they're doing.
(0:51:32) Codey: Yeah, like if you were split screen, yeah, correct, yeah.
(0:51:38) Al: All this is, it's couch co-op, not online co-op. So it's like you're seeing everybody on the same screen, and you're like, "I don't know what to look at, what to do. This is madness."
(0:51:48) Codey: Mm hmm. Yep, I.
(0:51:54) Codey: It seems like that's something that would be beneficial for like a family.
(0:51:57) Codey: Like it's going to increase the ability for families to play this game together
(0:52:01) Codey: and their play testing, which is great.
(0:52:02) Codey: But I think that I think the majority of the people that are going to play this game are going to do it online co-op, so.
(0:52:08) Al: Yeah, I'm not saying don't add couch co-op, I'm just saying, I'm not sure it's...
(0:52:12) Al: I don't think I could deal with it, personally.
(0:52:14) Codey: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:52:15) Codey: Looks really cool, though.
(0:52:18) Codey: Yeah, color me intrigued, for sure.
(0:52:22) Al: Hey, Codey. Codey. Codey.
(0:52:26) Al: Snacko's out in early access now.
(0:52:28) Codey: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
(0:52:31) Al: I can't.
(0:52:33) Al: I can't believe.
(0:52:35) Al: It's finally happened.
(0:52:38) Al: So I checked, I checked when.
(0:52:42) Al: So, oh, right.
(0:52:43) Al: OK, let me let me get my thoughts right.
(0:52:46) Al: So before this episode, I checked when
(0:52:50) Al: when I did the
(0:52:52) Al: interview with the Snacko developers. And it was January 2020. Pre-COVID was nearly four years ago was when we interviewed the Snacko devs. And that was when I played the first version that I played, which was like a really super early alpha version. And I loved the game back then. And I haven't played it since because I wasn't like, I didn't back to the, like, alpha or beta levels, I, um,
(0:52:53) Codey: - Right.
(0:53:22) Al: I was just a standard early access backer. Um, and, uh, I'm so super excited to finally play this game again. I just, oh, it's been so long. Like, this is one of the few games that we had like really early on in the podcast that we talked about and I'm super excited.
(0:53:22) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:53:24) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:53:43) Codey: Yeah. I love that it starts out with...
(0:53:44) Al: That's all.
(0:53:47) Codey: So I know the cat's name is not Snacko, it's Momo, right?
(0:53:52) Al: And which one?
(0:53:54) Codey: The heterochromic black cat that you play as?
(0:53:57) Al: Me-can.
(0:54:00) Codey: Okay.
(0:54:02) Al: I think there's a few different cats and I can never remember which one.
(0:54:04) Codey: Okay. The trailer starts out with him in a box and he's waking up.
(0:54:09) Codey: He was he wouldn't happen. He wouldn't happen in a box and it is so cute.
(0:54:13) Codey: This trailer highlights all of the things that this game has and it's been so awesome to watch this game and throughout the podcast lifespan.
(0:54:31) Codey: Because you're right, this was one of the first things that we talked about.
(0:54:34) Codey: I mean, not me, I wasn't a part of that.
(0:54:37) Codey: But to see where it's come from there and...
(0:54:44) Codey: And just see how great it's become.
(0:54:47) Codey: I'm like so excited.
(0:54:49) Codey: I did not back anything so I will not get an early access key.
(0:54:54) Codey: But...
(0:54:58) Al: I mean, you can always just buy it, but I bought this four years ago.
(0:55:05) Codey: No.
(0:55:06) Al: This is why I love a bit Kickstarter, right? Because it's like games that I bought nearly half a decade ago, I'm finally getting to play without paying anything now.
(0:55:11) Codey: Yep.
(0:55:14) Al: It feels like it's a free gift. That's how it works, right?
(0:55:16) Codey: Yep.
(0:55:18) Codey: Yep.
(0:55:20) Codey: It is like that.
(0:55:21) Codey: Yep.
(0:55:22) Codey: I just had that, I just went to a concert in Cincinnati, Ohio,
(0:55:26) Codey: and I had already paid for the tickets.
(0:55:29) Codey: I had already paid for the hotel,
(0:55:30) Codey: so I got there and it was like,
(0:55:30) Al: Classic.
(0:55:31) Codey: I didn't have to pay for anything.
(0:55:32) Codey: Except for like the gas to get there and we made a bunch of food before so we just ate like all the food that we made and it's like this is basically a free concert.
(0:55:41) Codey: It's not, I paid money for it, but it felt like it.
(0:55:42) Al: Yeah, yeah, that's that's I'm pretty sure that's how I'm gonna feel when at my with my trip. No, I was gonna talk about my I mean my trip in February. But yeah, that too. My trip to the US.
(0:55:51) Codey: when your Kickstarter back or key rolls in.
(0:55:58) Codey: Oh, for-- yeah.
(0:56:04) Al: I don't know if you're not heard. I'm going to there's a Pokemon go event in LA that I've
(0:56:12) Al: been to.
(0:56:16) Codey: I also don't have, oof the jet lag coming back is gonna hit you like a ton of bricks can confirm.
(0:56:24) Al: Anyway, so yeah, like I've paid for like the flight and the hotel this month. So when I get to February it's gonna feel great
(0:56:27) Codey: Yep. Yeah it's like oh this is basically free. Very awesome.
(0:56:30) Al: You know
(0:56:32) Al: Except food it's gonna be a lot of food
(0:56:34) Codey: Yeah you can't bring uh all the food you need. Yeah.
(0:56:37) Al: So, yeah, it's nacho on the wholesome snack the wholesome snacko if you will
(0:56:40) Codey: Yep. The wholesome snack. Love that.
(0:56:46) Codey: Ooh, Soggy Jima. It's such a cute game.
(0:56:47) Al: All right, we're on the home stretch we can do this is saggy Shima
(0:56:53) Al: they have
(0:56:54) Al: released their beach update which importantly includes frog hats just have to say that and also they can do so well take it away you go you go for this bit
(0:57:04) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:57:11) Codey: Okay, um, I mean the frog hats to me I I personally don't really do much with the hats especially because they say that some cats
(0:57:20) Codey: Sorry, some cats some bunnies don't want hats because they already have something on their head So like for example you zoo has like a leaf on their head. So
(0:57:27) Codey: They probably don't want a hat to cover that
(0:57:30) Codey: So I haven't really done much with the hats
(0:57:33) Codey: But the other update
(0:57:34) Codey: Part of the update is the beach access. And so in the game there's there's a big beach
(0:57:42) Codey: and
(0:57:45) Codey: It is something that you can just like put towels down and put like an umbrella down and then they'll like relax on it But this update now allows them to like float in the water with like a pool floatie
(0:57:56) Codey: Which is adorable. It also looked like there might be a new
(0:58:02) Codey: structure that you can buy that is beach.
(0:58:04) Codey: specific maybe like a some type of cabana house or something which is really cool yeah I don't
(0:58:15) Codey: oh I still have this game I was like I don't even know if I still have this game on my iPhone
(0:58:21) Codey: I also don't know if the beach update is like already on here or if I need to update it or what's going on it looks like it's not because I can't scroll all the way to the beach lake to the water.
(0:58:34) Codey: But I mean, it's just so cute. They look so cute like floating in their little...
(0:58:39) Codey: Yeah, kind of hints towards world expansion in the game
(0:58:44) Codey: and maybe like they'll expand
(0:58:47) Codey: northward a little bit more because there's a beach on the southern part of the screen. Maybe like northward there'll be something else and they can expand to other things.
(0:58:57) Codey: Which is exciting and interesting.
(0:59:00) Codey: And I think this update is free? Question mark?
(0:59:04) Al: Yeah, well the game is free.
(0:59:04) Codey: No, no, you're right, you're right, you're right.
(0:59:12) Al: ad supported with an in-app purchase to get rid of the ads, remember.
(0:59:15) Codey: And that, yeah, the in-app purchase, I did that in a heartbeat.
(0:59:19) Al: Of course you did.
(0:59:20) Codey: I paid like $7, so.
(0:59:20) Al: This is a great app.
(0:59:21) Al: It's so cheap.
(0:59:22) Codey: Mm-hm, mm-hm, real cute.
(0:59:28) Codey: Eastward Octopia.
(0:59:30) Al: This is the really weird one, which is like randomly they decided to add a DLC to this game to make it a farming game.
(0:59:37) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:59:37) Al: Anyway, we've got a release date for it.
(0:59:39) Al: It's coming 31st of January.
(0:59:41) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:59:43) Al: So another...
(0:59:46) Codey: Yeah, it seems like it's a like exploration game kind of like Stardew Valley.
(0:59:53) Al: It is, yeah, which makes it really weird.
(0:59:56) Al: So I believe that they said that this is in an alternate reality to the main game, where they decide to just settle down and make a village instead of explore.
(1:00:08) Al: And I'm like, "OK, fine."
(1:00:13) Al: It's coming out at the end of January.
(1:00:14) Codey: Yeah, uh, I mean, they're targeting another audience.
(1:00:20) Al: I just wonder where people come up with these ideas.
(1:00:25) Codey: Like if it's not just an exploration thing, if it's a hunker down and build a world and farm and, Mm hmm, yeah, I don't know.
(1:00:31) Al: But it's not another but it's a DLC. This is what's weird to me. It's a DLC [laughs]
(1:00:38) Codey: I don't know.
(1:00:39) Codey: I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.
(1:00:40) Codey: I don't know.
(1:00:41) Codey: The flying pig, though, looks very upset.
(1:00:44) Al: It does, it's terrifying.
(1:00:44) Codey: And I wonder why it's upset.
(1:00:50) Al: Because it looks like it's near death.
(1:00:51) Codey: It does look really bad, really mad.
(1:00:53) Codey: Okay, moving on, summer house.
(1:00:58) Al: I just lost the game. Thanks, Codey. This is a building game. So it's kind of like, what were those other, there's like a few of these kind of games where it's like, they're kind of like a very small scale city builder type thing. So you're like building these different buildings, but it's not like our. Yeah, it's an.
(1:00:59) Codey: Yeah, I lost the game.
(1:01:02) Codey: You're welcome.
(1:01:18) Codey: It's like a 2D side-scroller building game.
(1:01:28) Al: Yeah, it's an interesting different way of doing that, which I feel like I would quite like because one of my problems with like city builders is like, I'm so focused on making the layout perfect. But on this one, it's like no, none of that. There's none of that.
(1:01:47) Al: Here's a place, build a house. I quite like that idea.
(1:01:48) Codey: Yeah, yeah, I mean, so losing the game was because they literally, the guy in the trailer literally says you cannot win or lose this game.
(1:02:02) Codey: But he also said build little houses, find hidden secrets.
(1:02:04) Codey: So as you're building the house and as you place certain structural aspects of houses like onto the house, you kind of unlock like new, like one of them, you put a window down and then you can unlock a version of the window that has a guy leaning.
(1:02:18) Codey: out the window. Um, just that kind of thing. So like kind of encourages you to play around and put things in weird places and, and just design a little, a little summer house. Very cute.
(1:02:32) Codey: Not my type of game coming in 2024.
(1:02:32) Al: Currently debating whether I can put
(1:02:45) Al: Bugaboo Pocket. This makes me wonder whether there's a Bugaboo Not Pocket.
(1:02:52) Codey: hmm
(1:02:54) Al: So this is like a weird kind of like bug Tamagotchi type game.
(1:02:58) Codey: mm-hmm yep
(1:03:02) Codey: i'm not seeing a non a non-pocket version
(1:03:07) Al: No, I think it was mostly a joke. I don't think there is. I think this is just the game.
(1:03:11) Codey: pet bugs in your pocket
(1:03:15) Al: Bug's in my pocket, please.
(1:03:16) Codey: uh I always have a bug in my pocket
(1:03:21) Al: You win a bug fact.
(1:03:24) Codey: Isn't it cute?
(1:03:26) Codey: Isn't it so cute?
(1:03:26) Al: It's such a ridiculous. Okay, right. Let's maybe make this like more structured than just...
(1:03:30) Codey: Okay, so I'm the bug prison, so basically like outside it's basically like a Tamagotchi game so it shows that it shows you placing an egg and then the egg hatches and then you kind of take care of the resulting creature and then you feed it and then at one point pupates so as we know
(1:03:33) Al: So yeah, go for it. You're the bug person.
(1:03:54) Codey: as we know insects that have complete metamorphosis go through multiple life stages goes through egg the egg stage the larval stage which is often like a caterpillar or a grub it then has a pupil stage which is where it makes a little cocoon and it's a pupa and then it has the adult stage which is the adult beetle or butterfly or bee or whatever it is so these are all this is true for everything that has complete metamorphosis and so you kind of are taking care of the animal, the bug.
(1:04:24) Codey: As it goes through these different stages, I am curious if they're going to have ones that don't have complete metamorphosis.
(1:04:28) Codey: That'd be really interesting.
(1:04:30) Codey: Um, but so you take care of it and in the people stage, like when it's pupating,
(1:04:35) Codey: when it's got its little cocoon that's hanging from the ceiling, um, it doesn't want to be touched, no touch, no touch baby, baby need babies becoming soup.
(1:04:44) Codey: We still don't understand what happens during pupation, but they essentially become soup and then un-soup themselves.
(1:04:54) Codey: As you're doing this, you learn about bugs.
(1:04:59) Codey: It gave you a bug fact about crickets, I think is the thing, about how crickets change their chirp frequency based on the temperature.
(1:05:09) Codey: You can kind of know when it's getting colder or warmer based on how fast they're chirping.
(1:05:13) Codey: Very interesting.
(1:05:14) Codey: I'm curious how many types of bugs they have.
(1:05:17) Codey: They have a fact about crickets, which might mean that they have crickets.
(1:05:24) Codey: But they show a beetle, and they show a butterfly, or sorry, not a butterfly, they show a rosy maple moth.
(1:05:33) Codey: So they show a moth, which is the same thing.
(1:05:34) Al: I was going to say, is that not a moth? I thought it was a moth.
(1:05:36) Codey: No, it's a moth.
(1:05:39) Codey: It's a rosy maple moth, which is in the order lip adopter.
(1:05:42) Codey: Same order as butterflies, though, so same same.
(1:05:46) Codey: Very fuzzy.
(1:05:48) Codey: So I'm curious how many types of bugs that they're going to have.
(1:05:51) Codey: I say that it's coming in 2024, it's going to come to steam.
(1:05:54) Codey: I would play the heck out of this on switch and I'm really interested to kind of see what all is going to happen in this game, for sure.
(1:06:06) Al: A hundred and seventy five plus.
(1:06:08) Codey: That's what it says.
(1:06:11) Al: Bugs.
(1:06:12) Al: That's a lot of bugs.
(1:06:20) Al: Also, you can give them hats.
(1:06:22) Codey: Yeah, one of them has a little silver top hat.
(1:06:26) Al: One of them has a, not in the trailer, but on the steam page, has a little flower hat.
(1:06:32) Al: You play as a research scientist helping a forest recover after...
(1:06:36) Codey: Spoil them with pets, minigames, food, and furniture.
(1:06:40) Codey: Oh, there is another part where you put down like a piece of ceramic and the weevil is like super excited about the thing.
(1:06:49) Codey: And then there's another one where a grub like sees a mushroom and gets really excited and then goes and eats mushrooms.
(1:06:53) Codey: It's very cute.
(1:06:55) Codey: And it's also on Steam, it's on Mac OS.
(1:06:59) Codey: I don't know if I might have this on my computer.
(1:07:04) Codey: So yeah.
(1:07:06) Codey: Very excited to watch this and see what happens.
(1:07:12) Codey: See where they go with this.
(1:07:15) Codey: Yeah, so I'm not sure which,
(1:07:17) Codey: if I'm gonna get this on Switch or Steam or what,
(1:07:20) Codey: but not for debate, I'm getting it.
(1:07:23) Codey: Excited to hear when in 2024 it is coming out.
(1:07:28) Al: Yes, they're getting quite vague with the releases here now, aren't they?
(1:07:32) Codey: They are these last,
(1:07:33) Al: The last couple have just been 2024!
(1:07:35) Codey: Yeah.
(1:07:36) Codey: The ones don't have much.
(1:07:37) Al: Speaking of which, the final game that we have on our list is Voyages of Nira.
(1:07:37) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:07:43) Al: This is by a few game developers from Rare, the game studio, who decided to go off and do their own thing.
(1:07:52) Al: And, whew, my word, this game is gorgeous!
(1:07:56) Codey: It is, it really is the co-op.
(1:08:00) Al: So it's an open world exploration-y...
(1:08:06) Al: Look, you can ride a surfboard on the sea, right?
(1:08:08) Codey: Mm-hmm. It seems like you use your magic to propel the surfboard. And you're basically exploring to decorate your house and build up your island and make the, I'm assuming,
(1:08:08) Al: I don't really care about anything else, but it looks gorgeous.
(1:08:22) Codey: spirit of Nira happy and heal them, I'm assuming. Even the like wayfaring aspect of it that shows you on a boat at one point as well with your friends versus doing...
(1:08:38) Codey: the surfing aspect.
(1:08:40) Al: Yes, it does. One of the big things about open world games is they need to have like good traversal. And it does look like they have lots of different kinds. So like they've got the standard glider as well and stuff like that. So I'm hoping this works really nicely in terms of like you want to move around the world.
(1:08:58) Al: It was like gold.
(1:09:02) Codey: this is one of those games I don't know like have this has this game ever been mentioned before
(1:09:09) Codey: because this game is like polished like this looks great um yeah so I am I am impressed color me impressed um I want to see more about what all you can do right now it just looks like a
(1:09:30) Codey: collect resources, build your build your area, fight demons, like fight golems like you said, but I'm wondering what else it might have in it.
(1:09:40) Codey: And I'm excited to hear more.
(1:09:42) Al: Ooh, it's cooperative as well.
(1:09:44) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. 16 is a wild amount of people.
(1:09:55) Codey: I can probably count on one hand how many people I play games with or would like to play games with,
(1:10:00) Codey: So crazy.
(1:10:02) Codey: That's the Wholesome Game thingy.
(1:10:04) Al: Awesome! That was a wild ride, but I think we're there. I think we made it.
(1:10:10) Codey: We did.
(1:10:12) Codey: Uh huh.
(1:10:13) Al: So links to everything in the show notes, hopefully assuming I don't die by the time I get this out.

(1:12:48) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:12:56) Codey: What happened? Oh no. So curious.
