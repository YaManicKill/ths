# Transcript
[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Do
[00:19.360 --> 00:21.360]  Do
[00:30.080 --> 00:33.680]  Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.480]  My name is Al and my name is Cody and we are here to talk about
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.120]  Cottagecore games all the cottagecore games
[00:43.640 --> 00:50.600]  So much a million of them so much news and we are also here to remember how to podcast
[00:54.080 --> 00:57.560]  Was the last episode you did with me the last one I did with you oh no
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  The
[01:02.560 --> 01:04.880]  Last episode I did
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.180]  Think was no, I I don't even know I don't even know
[01:11.160 --> 01:14.260]  But the last episode is funny because people will be hearing
[01:14.960 --> 01:17.900]  The last yeah that we did and then they're gonna hear this
[01:17.900 --> 01:22.000]  I was what so that's what I was trying to ask was that last episode that you did
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.440]  The last episode that I did with you can record farming simulator with Johnny after in between. Oh, really?
[01:27.440 --> 01:30.680]  I honestly can't remember though. How early did we record the last episode?
[01:30.680 --> 01:36.360]  I don't know my word. I was just listening to it the other day because it's so fun when for the listeners
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.360]  I usually don't listen to podcasts. I'm on but if they were recorded months before
[01:42.880 --> 01:44.280]  Months
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.320]  Absolutely months. It's like it's it's like a whole new conversation
[01:48.920 --> 01:54.640]  Cuz my brain has forgotten it and it was also really funny to hear like what have you been playing?
[01:55.080 --> 01:57.240]  Kind of things and I'm like, oh wow
[01:57.520 --> 02:04.800]  Like the last episode I was talking about the game pass and how excited I was and I'm like I have not done anything
[02:07.840 --> 02:13.180]  It was it was two months ago, it was the the 16th of June we recorded that episode
[02:13.840 --> 02:14.960]  which
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.720]  Which was what to be two episodes before the farming thing. I've done a couple since then as well
[02:20.720 --> 02:28.160]  But anyway, that's my point is it's been what about six weeks at least been a minute since either of us are podcasted
[02:28.160 --> 02:30.160]  So this is a hot mess
[02:30.740 --> 02:32.740]  Buckle in you're here for the ride
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.220]  There's transcripts on the show notes and on the website
[02:37.840 --> 02:42.060]  If you're listening on YouTube, there should be there should be auto-generated transcript there as well
[02:43.400 --> 02:45.400]  Who knows how well it does with my voice?
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  Does things do things not
[02:50.760 --> 02:56.000]  Things have gone a lot better in the last few years, but yeah, there was a point where like most of the like
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.640]  Voice related stuff just did not work at all for Scottish accents
[03:02.120 --> 03:07.740]  Like you would say something and it would think you said something completely different. Have you ever tried speaking properly?
[03:12.920 --> 03:14.920]  So, what are we talking about today?
[03:16.680 --> 03:18.840]  An American told me to speak properly
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.100]  You know right after I said that I was like is that the right way to phrase that word
[03:26.960 --> 03:28.960]  It's a good thing you didn't say proper
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.340]  I like to speak proper. You gotta talk right proper there. I don't know why you went, Texas
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.360]  Listeners didn't hear our conversation before this Cody
[03:42.700 --> 03:46.320]  Anyone not from Texas has a lot of disdain for Texas
[03:47.140 --> 03:49.780]  We love our Texan listeners. Mm-hmm
[03:50.180 --> 03:52.920]  Because we know that there are the good ones because I guess
[03:53.740 --> 03:57.340]  The amount of stuff we've said in this podcast the non good ones are not listening anymore
[04:01.460 --> 04:07.500]  Listeners who are listening to this will probably agree that Texas even the ones that live in Texas
[04:08.980 --> 04:14.660]  Correct, I'm just here because my family's here and I love them and maybe we can make Texas better
[04:14.660 --> 04:21.660]  We're gonna talk about news because it has been
[04:22.260 --> 04:28.040]  At least a month since any news and it's been about six weeks since any instance a decent amount of news
[04:28.300 --> 04:31.260]  Because I completely forgot to go through the news for the episode that was four weeks ago
[04:31.580 --> 04:35.540]  So they just got three pieces of news that we could remember off the top of our heads
[04:37.620 --> 04:39.620]  So now we've got the rest of the news
[04:39.820 --> 04:42.260]  So Buckland's gonna be great. But first of all
[04:42.780 --> 04:44.780]  Cody what have you been up to I
[04:45.360 --> 04:47.620]  have passed my comps and
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.380]  So now it's all like getting work done
[04:51.500 --> 04:57.600]  So I've there are a couple of projects that I've had that I've like been on the back burner and I just I made
[04:57.900 --> 05:03.700]  Meetings for them and I was like, hey, I haven't been able to do this because I was doing my comps, but now I'm done
[05:03.700 --> 05:05.980]  Let's get this stuff done. Like let's go
[05:07.020 --> 05:10.280]  And trying to get those off my plate. That's really cool
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  I haven't really been playing anything that many game Pokemon go
[05:15.560 --> 05:19.320]  I'm actually going to go fast in New York City. So whoo
[05:19.960 --> 05:26.760]  You're going fast go go to the fast Pokemon go to New York City
[05:27.880 --> 05:32.860]  yeah, so that'll be I I'm gonna say it'll be fun even if the game itself is
[05:33.760 --> 05:38.920]  Buggy or if there are issues or whatever, it's still gonna be fun because there's you know members from our
[05:40.400 --> 05:44.320]  It's super effective community or going and we're all gonna meet up and hang out and it's gonna be great
[05:45.400 --> 05:51.920]  I'm super sad that I couldn't justify the cost. Yes. It was like 700 quid to fly there. Yeah
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.680]  it's easy for me because my partner lives there and
[05:57.120 --> 06:01.720]  So I literally just have to get a bus there and then I don't have to worry about anything else
[06:02.320 --> 06:04.640]  because like I already kind of know how to do and I
[06:05.360 --> 06:07.360]  know how to get around I
[06:07.900 --> 06:11.040]  Can just stay with him because places there are super expensive
[06:12.040 --> 06:16.800]  And the buses yeah that I've also played this game Tetris
[06:16.800 --> 06:21.880]  This is the one that either might just be official Tetris or might be a scam and we're not sure
[06:22.400 --> 06:24.400]  I'd still think it's a scam
[06:24.600 --> 06:30.840]  Like anything that promises you a cruise for playing a game a certain amount feels like a scam
[06:30.960 --> 06:34.720]  Well, so I was talking to someone about it about how like basically how they do that is
[06:35.200 --> 06:42.720]  How you is you're playing and as you're playing you're watching ads so they're earning ad revenue sure sure sure
[06:42.720 --> 06:44.400]  But it's a cruise
[06:44.400 --> 06:47.080]  right well, and I looked at the the
[06:48.320 --> 06:50.920]  fine print and basically pays for an
[06:51.560 --> 06:53.560]  inner cabin
[06:53.560 --> 06:55.680]  room so like you don't have a window and
[06:56.400 --> 07:03.260]  It's one of those rooms for you and one other person, but you still have to pay like all of these scam which
[07:04.220 --> 07:08.740]  The room itself I went the room itself is like $1,000 per person. Oh
[07:09.780 --> 07:11.100]  so
[07:11.100 --> 07:17.900]  I'm fine with saving two grand because the rest of the fees are like $20 a day for this dude
[07:17.900 --> 07:20.340]  did you do for this like things like that and
[07:20.900 --> 07:25.640]  basically if I can if I not if when I
[07:27.020 --> 07:29.020]  So optimist
[07:30.020 --> 07:32.020]  Or in this cruise and buy it
[07:32.940 --> 07:38.960]  Jeff is yeah, I'm it, but when I last played I was at like 30,000 points, and I'm now at almost
[07:39.680 --> 07:41.360]  250,000 points so
[07:41.360 --> 07:48.140]  Cruises in sight y'all I'm a quarter of the way to one of the cheaper ones, but and what's the deadline for it?
[07:48.140 --> 07:52.780]  Oh, I mean they have like rolling deadlines, so if you want to go, so what's the deadline for the cruise?
[07:53.060 --> 07:58.660]  Yeah, there will be another one after after this step another cruise or another thing to replace the crew
[07:58.700 --> 08:01.180]  Another crew to your point. I feel like your points will release
[08:01.180 --> 08:06.140]  I don't think the points if I wake up one day and these points are gone. I'm just honest
[08:06.140 --> 08:11.840]  I don't I'm just I'm just so convinced that there's gonna be a catch somewhere and it's like
[08:13.340 --> 08:20.020]  Otherwise everything reset no I super agree so this one there is one here the cruise must be booked by
[08:20.900 --> 08:27.780]  September 25th, I believe the last time we talked about this the cruise had to be booked by August so they just have
[08:28.920 --> 08:34.860]  Current like rolling ones or whatever, but you go through all these different places in Alaska, which is cool
[08:37.260 --> 08:41.360]  But yeah, I'm also waiting for the catch all right well
[08:41.360 --> 08:46.260]  I look forward to hearing that you finally get on the cruise, and then you have to pay a thousand pounds to get off the
[08:46.260 --> 08:48.100]  cruise
[08:48.100 --> 08:50.100]  We didn't say you could leave
[08:52.740 --> 08:55.260]  Pay for your freedom, so what have you been up to?
[08:56.260 --> 09:02.420]  I've been playing on my switch you and on holiday. I did go on holiday. I didn't really play anything while on holiday. I'm so bad
[09:04.420 --> 09:08.740]  Doing anything while on holiday, but this is the first recording since you got your switch back
[09:08.740 --> 09:14.020]  So I think it is switch so so I got my switch back, but it wasn't my switch
[09:14.020 --> 09:14.880]  It was another switch
[09:14.880 --> 09:22.260]  They just replaced the switch, but did you get like so I remember that you had a limited edition one did you yeah?
[09:22.260 --> 09:26.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, they gave me a like for like but okay. I mean I wasn't worried about that because
[09:27.740 --> 09:32.060]  like it was new enough that I would just like I would go back to the the
[09:33.140 --> 09:37.540]  Retailer that I bought it from like it's been less than a year. I'm not I wasn't worried about that okay
[09:38.500 --> 09:44.300]  What I'm sad about is that I had obviously no saves left on it because there were is a new switch
[09:45.540 --> 09:49.620]  So I had lost all of my Pokemon saves except
[09:50.300 --> 09:54.980]  My Pokemon sword because that is on another switch for shiny hunting and
[09:55.780 --> 09:59.360]  My Pokemon brilliant diamond. Yeah ones that I've just like
[10:00.060 --> 10:05.700]  That don't really do anything with anymore, so I lost my scarlet which had a hundred fifty hours
[10:05.700 --> 10:08.540]  and I lost my violet and I lost my
[10:10.500 --> 10:12.500]  Pikachu, let's go Pikachu
[10:12.900 --> 10:17.620]  Which I had like 300 hours on and my let's go Eevee
[10:17.620 --> 10:21.460]  Which didn't have a lot on it, but it was like halfway through a Professor Oak challenge on that one
[10:21.460 --> 10:26.260]  And it had two shiny Pokemon that hadn't transferred off and I lost my legends Arceus
[10:27.660 --> 10:32.540]  What is the lesson to be learned there is no lesson to be learned here? There's nothing you can do to fix this
[10:32.540 --> 10:37.440]  There's no option because they don't let you move the saves off right? That's the thing
[10:37.440 --> 10:42.460]  That's what so you can you can transfer Pokemon saves between switches, but you have to do that
[10:42.980 --> 10:44.980]  At the time your switch is working
[10:45.660 --> 10:49.100]  Right you cannot back them up there is no way to back up Pokemon save
[10:49.100 --> 10:51.960]  They just don't let you do it and then when you go and send in your switch
[10:51.960 --> 10:53.860]  You're like oh we might wipe your switch
[10:53.860 --> 10:57.120]  You might not be able to keep everything make sure you back up, and I'm like how?
[10:57.860 --> 11:02.380]  How am I meant to do that and then you send it in and they don't they don't back it up?
[11:02.380 --> 11:07.800]  And then they just give you a new switch because it's like oh, we don't actually care about this, so it's just oh
[11:08.180 --> 11:09.180]  No, there's no way
[11:09.180 --> 11:11.700]  This is the thing there's no lesson to be learned the lesson to be learned is
[11:12.140 --> 11:16.340]  Nintendo and Pokemon both suck, and I hate them both. I'm very annoyed
[11:17.020 --> 11:19.980]  But so I played through Pokemon scarlet. I just kind of like
[11:20.420 --> 11:27.340]  Sped run it I got someone to pump some vitamins into my no vitamins some XP candy into my my Pokemon
[11:28.780 --> 11:30.780]  to speed run it and
[11:31.900 --> 11:36.020]  Just yeah, I did it so I've now got to the point where I can actually do all of the raids
[11:37.020 --> 11:39.020]  I
[11:39.140 --> 11:45.340]  I've not done Scott. No I was violated not scarlet was violated like that. I might do scarlet at some point
[11:45.340 --> 11:49.860]  I've done scarlet as far as I can like redeem online stuff, so I got the second
[11:50.460 --> 11:58.360]  But I don't have energy for any I I haven't even I'm still I still haven't finished area zero
[11:58.360 --> 12:00.740]  I don't even think I've gotten to areas
[12:00.740 --> 12:01.900]  Oh
[12:01.900 --> 12:03.900]  Cody
[12:03.900 --> 12:05.300]  I need to finish
[12:05.300 --> 12:08.320]  I know I've heard but yeah, so I played these games three times now
[12:08.320 --> 12:11.860]  And I'm going to end up doing a fourth at some point, but who knows when I have them
[12:12.700 --> 12:20.020]  So and today I started playing Pikmin 4 whoo which is interesting because I was talking about this in the slacks
[12:20.020 --> 12:23.460]  And I was like I don't understand why this game has multiple tutorials
[12:23.460 --> 12:28.260]  So you start the game up, and it's like a tutorial with a little bit backstory as to how you get to this game
[12:28.260 --> 12:32.620]  And you're like okay cool. This is nice. This is a good tutorial because it's like oh you got this little area
[12:32.620 --> 12:34.580]  You can run around and then it teaches stuff as you go
[12:34.580 --> 12:39.500]  It doesn't ever stops you doing something it just kind of shows things on the screen and then eventually once you've done everything
[12:39.820 --> 12:43.740]  you then get through and you go through the next bit story, and then it takes you to the
[12:44.260 --> 12:49.140]  First level and the first level is a tutorial and you're like I don't understand. Why is this a tutorial and this is a
[12:50.180 --> 12:54.260]  Infinitely worst tutorial because you basically you walk ten steps
[12:54.260 --> 12:57.340]  And then it pauses shows a cutscene tells you how to do something
[12:57.340 --> 13:02.780]  They already taught you how to do and then you walk another ten steps it pauses have the cutscene
[13:03.260 --> 13:07.120]  Bunch of nonsense and then tells you how to do a thing that you already know how to do
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.580]  And I'm just like I don't understand. It's not even like other games have better
[13:11.260 --> 13:18.260]  Tutorials this game has a better tutorial than it does like I don't know how do you make both of those tutorials one?
[13:18.260 --> 13:23.220]  Which is terrible one which is great, and then just keep them both. I don't understand
[13:23.860 --> 13:30.540]  Bizarre so I was enjoying it now. I'm not enjoying it. Hopefully I can get through the tutorial and start enjoying it again
[13:34.260 --> 13:37.700]  Should we talk about some news yeah, we got a lot of news oh
[13:38.600 --> 13:40.600]  Right moon drop
[13:41.060 --> 13:43.060]  1.0 is it
[13:43.100 --> 13:48.180]  Except it's still in early access. Maybe no it looks like they've clicked the button
[13:48.180 --> 13:49.820]  It does look like it's yeah
[13:49.820 --> 13:54.780]  So they had said at the end if you still see the game labeled as early to access on steam there was a slight hiccup
[13:54.780 --> 13:57.980]  With the price increase valve needs to approve the increase which I expect to happen later today
[13:57.980 --> 14:01.700]  So like that should be fixed now, so it should just be version 1.0
[14:01.700 --> 14:06.740]  Yeah, and I don't understand like at the top of their thing. It's version 1.0 because I commit crimes
[14:06.740 --> 14:13.980]  I think I suspect this is our or it's not the first version right because 1.0 is like the first version
[14:14.180 --> 14:20.180]  Okay, I think it's pretty common to be like this is the point where we will hit like the first full version and
[14:20.660 --> 14:25.440]  Even though there might be news to like it's yeah, I mean I can argue for hours about version numbers
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.420]  I don't care like if you're if you're if your first version outside of early access is 1.0. That's fine. I'm fine
[14:30.420 --> 14:31.260]  I don't care about that
[14:31.260 --> 14:36.400]  There are so many more things to be annoyed about which I will definitely be annoyed about at some point. Yeah for sure
[14:37.280 --> 14:44.960]  The mutating mountain farm yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the look of this game like just the graphics
[14:45.960 --> 14:51.480]  It's not and this is not to be mean, but it's not like the cute 8-bit graphics
[14:51.480 --> 14:57.000]  It's like yeah, the shifting mountain sounds interesting. Yeah, but there needs to be more
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.360]  I think I'm don't think I'm gonna to me. It sounds chaos like which is going to appeal to some people
[15:02.480 --> 15:04.920]  Yeah, it's a challenge, but for me. I'm like
[15:05.400 --> 15:10.920]  I would rather play a cozy catch butterflies and look at butterflies king
[15:10.960 --> 15:13.280]  What a coincidence do I have the game for you?
[15:15.080 --> 15:17.080]  Flutter away
[15:17.120 --> 15:23.560]  This game is also right now. I think this game came out like two days after the last episode where we had any news and
[15:24.520 --> 15:31.300]  Yeah, well no this isn't released August 3rd, so yeah, yeah, it's I mean it's currently August 17th
[15:35.160 --> 15:41.160]  Anyway, yeah, this is the cute little there's a capybara friend and you're trying to find butterflies
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.380]  You're filling a deck. Yeah, like kind of a decks like one of the
[15:46.760 --> 15:49.640]  pages of your journal that you saw I kind of like paused the
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.160]  trailer and I read a little bit and it was really cool because it was telling you like
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.320]  Information about the rainforest and about what the rainforest peoples calls these better call these butterflies. Yeah
[16:00.200 --> 16:02.240]  So yeah, it is now available on
[16:03.160 --> 16:05.160]  Switch for $12.99
[16:06.120 --> 16:08.200]  and steam for $12.99 and
[16:08.640 --> 16:15.560]  I will say on steam will on Mac and PC which is always good to know for those of us that have max as their prime
[16:15.880 --> 16:19.480]  And you can pet the capybara. So if you're a big fan of the Twitter
[16:20.280 --> 16:22.420]  Slash-x slash whatever we want to call it page
[16:23.080 --> 16:25.080]  Can you pet the dog?
[16:25.320 --> 16:27.320]  Happy bar it yeah
[16:27.960 --> 16:29.960]  This reminds me a lot of
[16:29.980 --> 16:33.500]  Yes, it does in a good way big thing. It's on my maybe list
[16:34.080 --> 16:40.100]  Palio have announced that they're coming to switch and I think this is the first time where they've said a release
[16:40.960 --> 16:44.360]  Timeline they've said that it's releasing holiday season
[16:45.120 --> 16:46.840]  2023
[16:46.840 --> 16:50.520]  Which presumably it like this is just about switch, right?
[16:50.520 --> 16:56.760]  It says Palio will be available on Nintendo switch this holiday season to presumably that also means that the steam version will be released
[16:56.920 --> 16:58.920]  Some people are already playing it
[16:59.120 --> 17:00.520]  Yeah, it's in early access
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.320]  But yeah, they do it like it would be weird if they released on switch because you're not allowed
[17:05.840 --> 17:09.800]  Ignoring the fact that there's new dreamlike Valley is in this weird situation
[17:09.960 --> 17:15.200]  And I don't know why like I suspect the only reason that it's allowed to do it is because it's Disney
[17:16.400 --> 17:21.240]  It would be then you're not technically allowed to have early access games on switch
[17:21.320 --> 17:23.320]  So they would have to say it's finished
[17:23.560 --> 17:28.440]  Right and it would be weird for the steam version to still be an early access when I mean they do that though
[17:28.440 --> 17:33.300]  Like they have games come out and they're available and then they have plans to port it elsewhere
[17:33.440 --> 17:37.600]  Yeah, but it's not but that's not that's the wrong way. Like it's already a wrong way
[17:38.460 --> 17:40.460]  Like isn't it?
[17:41.640 --> 17:43.760]  It's just their website you just do
[17:44.880 --> 17:50.280]  Interest. Okay, so it's gonna be an exclusive to switch. I believe so, but it's an open beta now
[17:50.600 --> 17:55.040]  But it's only on the website. So yeah, I haven't played it
[17:55.600 --> 17:59.700]  But I have a friend that has a reference code and she's like gonna give it to me when
[18:00.640 --> 18:05.720]  Because I said I wanted to wait for it to be on steam or sorry switch. I want switch
[18:06.400 --> 18:12.760]  So once it's on switch, I'll I'll jump into this game 100% so yeah, it's gonna scratch that
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.720]  World of Warcraft itch. Yeah, cuz it's Philly. Mm all isn't
[18:18.600 --> 18:20.600]  Mm-hmm, which means that I probably
[18:21.320 --> 18:24.640]  But well, it'll be all me and it'll be cross play. So it'll be great
[18:24.640 --> 18:29.600]  I look forward to hearing about it when you play it next. We have sprite Valley, which fun fact
[18:29.600 --> 18:34.860]  I don't know how if I've ever said this in the podcast before I may have may have not stardew valley's original name was
[18:34.860 --> 18:37.460]  Sprout Valley. This is not that this is a separate game
[18:38.200 --> 18:39.840]  Sprout Valley
[18:39.840 --> 18:45.100]  Is a pixel art one a pixel art farming game. Stop me if you've heard that before
[18:45.100 --> 18:57.260]  As an off-handed comment in our kickstarter update we are planning to release this fall
[18:57.940 --> 19:01.660]  Like it doesn't it doesn't say it's not like it's titled August update
[19:01.660 --> 19:05.660]  What are we working on and then they talk about a bunch of stuff and they're like we're planning to release this fall
[19:05.660 --> 19:12.020]  And then there's just more words after that and I'm like, oh, okay. This is why I read all the words in these updates
[19:12.860 --> 19:19.100]  Specifically it's specifically said this month is not much going on in terms of updates. We're planning to release
[19:20.500 --> 19:22.500]  What are you doing then?
[19:22.860 --> 19:26.380]  Bizarre, so yeah, apparently that's a thing that's happening
[19:28.260 --> 19:32.020]  Cool nothing else to say about that one just now the palace on the hill
[19:33.300 --> 19:37.740]  We got the first information about release date and then that is delayed. So
[19:38.660 --> 19:42.020]  Well, they specifically said that so they have a prologue
[19:42.020 --> 19:46.660]  Yeah, you can play on Steam and they got a lot of really good feedback from the prologue
[19:46.660 --> 19:51.900]  and so now that since they're trying to incorporate the feedback that they got from the prologue, they're going to
[19:53.420 --> 19:55.320]  Extend the date
[19:55.320 --> 20:01.340]  Yeah, I'm not I'm not complaining about that. It's funny how they had never publicly said that they were planning to release in August
[20:01.900 --> 20:07.440]  It's just this tweet is the first time they'd said that and in the city in the next sentence and for same sentence
[20:08.500 --> 20:12.860]  They're delaying. So it was just funny how you're like, oh, they're planning to release in August. Oh, no, they're not anymore
[20:13.660 --> 20:15.660]  Like it's just a little bit of whiplash there
[20:16.740 --> 20:20.980]  So yeah, there's there's there's no date just now, but that's fine
[20:22.780 --> 20:29.140]  That's good that they're taking the feedback from the prologue it still looks really cute is that Xbox news new yeah, okay
[20:29.140 --> 20:34.580]  So it's coming to Xbox. We didn't know that before I lose track. There's too many games to keep track of 91
[20:34.580 --> 20:36.140]  I know have in my list
[20:36.140 --> 20:38.140]  We can add to it
[20:38.780 --> 20:40.780]  Ova Magica
[20:40.820 --> 20:43.940]  Has been delayed so 2024. I'm not surprised
[20:43.940 --> 20:47.060]  I think we're gonna get a lot of this over the next couple of months because we still have
[20:47.860 --> 20:49.860]  22 that have just said
[20:49.980 --> 20:51.020]  2023
[20:51.020 --> 20:56.180]  And nothing else and then we have like another 15 that are meant to be coming out this year
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.880]  So I suspect at least 20 of them will be delayed
[21:00.580 --> 21:03.640]  Because we're we're in August now. Yeah
[21:03.960 --> 21:10.920]  And I just I commented that the for Ova Magica on the delay the update mention about this
[21:12.360 --> 21:18.220]  The response from all the factors backers was largely positive and I just wanted to shout out over magic here because that they are
[21:18.560 --> 21:25.920]  Doing really well about being having open open and honest communication about where the game is and what what exactly they've been working on
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.920]  Yeah, and it's all stuff that people have been asking about. It's not out of the blue
[21:30.920 --> 21:37.160]  It's and everyone's just like yeah. Yeah, take your time. Like we're just really excited for this game. So yeah be
[21:38.480 --> 21:40.480]  Honest as we've discussed before
[21:41.320 --> 21:44.000]  Communication can do a massive thing, you know
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.680]  You don't have to end up in the situation that some game developers do when they don't say anything people get annoyed
[21:48.680 --> 21:50.220]  Well, and it's not just game developers
[21:50.220 --> 21:56.680]  I was just having this conversation the other day with someone about authors because I read books and it's often
[21:56.920 --> 22:02.240]  Multiple book series and then you have an author that just goes AWOL for a decade
[22:02.760 --> 22:09.080]  Where they're like, oh I'm working on it and I'm like, okay in the time that you have been quote-unquote working on this one book
[22:09.080 --> 22:14.720]  This other dude has put out 20 books. So like what and it's not even it's not even nice
[22:14.720 --> 22:17.380]  also when they then go and do like other things like, you know,
[22:17.380 --> 22:24.820]  They make a TV series based on their book and then they write other books. And then there's another TV series about their other book
[22:25.340 --> 22:28.780]  Not I was actually not talking about Martin
[22:28.780 --> 22:33.100]  I know but I know it but he is another great example of that of like, okay
[22:33.100 --> 22:35.100]  But like we are still waiting
[22:36.580 --> 22:39.240]  Like even just saying hey
[22:40.220 --> 22:41.660]  the
[22:41.660 --> 22:47.620]  Stories gotten away from me or hey, this is taking a little bit longer or something like that like yeah
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.840]  We know that these things happen writers block happens
[22:50.480 --> 22:55.280]  Literally our phrase that's coined that's used in other places because of that, right?
[22:55.280 --> 23:01.880]  You just need to say it like I'm stuck and I thought that doing a second project would be great like cool or hey
[23:01.880 --> 23:03.880]  I'm making lots of money on this other one
[23:08.120 --> 23:12.880]  Great annoy people but it's less annoying than just saying nothing. Yeah
[23:13.600 --> 23:16.220]  But yeah, so over magica thumbs up
[23:17.080 --> 23:19.080]  for talking about agreed
[23:19.280 --> 23:25.880]  Thumbs down for having games that release on the 28th of September this week. Oh my word Cody, right?
[23:25.880 --> 23:31.920]  So wild vendor have announced that their game is releasing on the 28th of September 28th of September that might sound similar
[23:31.920 --> 23:35.460]  You say well, it's not it's not the day that
[23:36.100 --> 23:41.220]  Mannequins night market harvest me in the winds of anthos paleo pines and my time a sand rock is releasing. It's not that day
[23:41.220 --> 23:43.220]  It's not the same. It's two days after that
[23:43.220 --> 23:45.220]  Oh
[23:47.300 --> 23:49.700]  My word that week is I just
[23:50.340 --> 23:54.340]  Heard we've got the Tuesday got four games coming out the Thursday. We've got another game coming out
[23:56.060 --> 24:01.740]  Look I'm sorry, but Mannequins night market still Trump's ever. Yeah, not about Wild Mender
[24:01.740 --> 24:06.240]  Let me let me clarify the thumbs down is not for Wild Mender. It's just for the date
[24:06.300 --> 24:10.260]  Yeah, and I hadn't heard about Wild Mender. So I'm just gonna blurb it real quick
[24:10.780 --> 24:14.680]  Do you want me to no no, no, so I was just I was still just exact
[24:15.380 --> 24:19.960]  Exasperated by that week. I just like just before just just hate game developers
[24:20.100 --> 24:25.100]  See if you're like, oh, I don't know when other games are releasing right and I don't want to overload things
[24:25.100 --> 24:29.200]  I have a list come and talk to me. I have a list of
[24:30.220 --> 24:32.220]  91 games
[24:32.420 --> 24:38.500]  91 and you know what actually if you pay to pay on my patreon you can get the list and see it I have
[24:38.780 --> 24:41.740]  91 games if you're a game developer come and talk to me
[24:41.740 --> 24:46.980]  I'll tell you when there are games because there are a lot of games coming out and we don't want you
[24:47.500 --> 24:49.500]  Releasing at the same time, please
[24:49.500 --> 24:55.120]  Yeah, well and not only because we are overloaded as players but like that's not gonna be good for you
[24:55.120 --> 24:59.140]  I mean if you're not at this point Mannequins night market then
[24:59.900 --> 25:04.860]  You're gonna be like man release was really thin and be like, hmm
[25:04.860 --> 25:09.660]  There's a reason for that and it starts with M and ends with an echoes night market
[25:12.420 --> 25:19.220]  Why wild vendor quote is a desert gardening survival game where you'll get to start from a small spring in a
[25:19.260 --> 25:21.820]  barren desert and grow it into a blossoming oasis
[25:21.820 --> 25:27.340]  Search the desert around you for valuable seeds to grow a new place to craft a range of useful items as you explore the desert
[25:27.340 --> 25:34.140]  You'll find adorable wildlife to befriend secrets to uncover an ancient deities to ally with just remember to take a full water bottle and fluent
[25:34.420 --> 25:35.460]  food
[25:35.460 --> 25:41.660]  Yeah, it's basically an open-world game where you're turning a desert into not a desert. Yeah, and there I mean first of all
[25:42.300 --> 25:46.780]  Mmm, sometimes deserts need to be deserts. They're also an ecosystem, but second of all
[25:48.660 --> 25:51.980]  It looked really cool like there was like a magic system or something to it
[25:51.980 --> 25:55.220]  Like some of the creatures are like magical like little wispy things flying around
[25:55.700 --> 26:00.620]  You were flying around at one point and I don't know if that's with tech or if it's just that you're able to fly
[26:01.420 --> 26:03.580]  But it just yeah, so I'm guessing
[26:04.500 --> 26:06.500]  related to the whole like
[26:06.500 --> 26:07.940]  Don't get rid of all the deserts
[26:07.940 --> 26:13.660]  I'm guessing that this is like a or this is not how the world used to be and we're now kind of like
[26:13.740 --> 26:18.280]  Returning it to what it was which obviously still has its issues humans messing around with things
[26:19.340 --> 26:23.820]  Generally causes issues, even if you think you're like fixing the problems that you caused in the first place
[26:25.180 --> 26:28.480]  But yeah, I don't think it's just like oh, here's a desert. Let's get rid of a desert
[26:28.480 --> 26:30.480]  Deserts are stupid, no they're not
[26:32.440 --> 26:33.700]  Stupid deserts
[26:33.700 --> 26:35.280]  Awesome
[26:35.280 --> 26:39.400]  Okay, so that's all of the release news for like games
[26:39.840 --> 26:45.800]  We then have a bunch of information about some updates slash DLC. So we have another lens island update
[26:45.800 --> 26:53.400]  This one is called the cursed underworld update and it's releasing on the 10th of September and Cody you've you you've played this game
[26:54.240 --> 26:56.960]  It create includes a new mode
[26:57.560 --> 26:58.800]  And
[26:58.800 --> 27:03.840]  Instead of the underground cave network being static, which is what it was when I played it
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.900]  It is now gonna be procedural but you can also if you don't want things to attack you you can have a peaceful game mode
[27:10.360 --> 27:12.360]  you can enchant weapons and
[27:13.160 --> 27:16.520]  There's I don't know what improved survival mechanics is, but I'm here for it
[27:18.240 --> 27:24.040]  It sounds good, I like to survive in a survivor game I like to survive and if it's improved that's cool
[27:24.040 --> 27:26.160]  No, um, I don't know
[27:26.160 --> 27:32.320]  I just I haven't taken the time to play this in a while as they creep towards a 1.0 question mark, right?
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.560]  They're not ready. They're not in 1.0 yet. They're not. Oh, yeah. No, this is uh, this is a early access update
[27:37.740 --> 27:42.520]  every time I see new things, I'm just so jazzed and
[27:43.340 --> 27:45.280]  to see things
[27:45.280 --> 27:47.280]  Develop from where they started
[27:47.680 --> 27:51.360]  And know that even when it started it was a pretty fun game
[27:51.360 --> 27:53.640]  Like it was just that there were a couple things that
[27:54.440 --> 27:59.760]  That were closed off. But other than that, like yeah, I saw where to go. I saw what to do. So
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.220]  And I was enjoying doing it. So yeah super excited
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.080]  To play this and the trailer looks really cool. So I need to jump back in. Yeah
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.800]  Yeah, they've generally I think it's been generally been a good a good early access
[28:15.800 --> 28:20.000]  My one complaint is they launched without controller support when I first played it
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.920]  I was like, this is horrific to try and play on my Steam Deck. Like this is just
[28:24.680 --> 28:27.840]  Horrible, they now have controller support. I've just not gone back yet
[28:28.800 --> 28:30.620]  above snakes
[28:30.620 --> 28:32.620]  Also has an update
[28:32.960 --> 28:34.720]  1.2 update
[28:34.720 --> 28:38.440]  Which it doesn't have a name, but does have some stuff
[28:38.600 --> 28:42.360]  So as usual they're adding more pieces to add to your world
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.220]  because if you don't remember above snakes is the game that it's like a
[28:46.220 --> 28:50.580]  Cell based how would you piece like puzzle?
[28:50.580 --> 28:54.820]  It's like it's like a game board and you're like adding squares to your board
[28:55.300 --> 28:59.980]  And there's like a limited number of different things you can do. So they've added a bunch more and
[29:01.540 --> 29:08.860]  Japanese localizations, so if you only speak Japanese, which you probably don't because you're listening to this podcast you can now play the game
[29:09.540 --> 29:15.460]  Or if you are learning Japanese and you want to do that because I know some people like to do that
[29:15.460 --> 29:19.140]  That's also a way to do that. Yeah, I guess like the one question that I have from
[29:19.780 --> 29:25.260]  This is oh, so there are two new desert world pieces specifically desert. I guess that was
[29:25.900 --> 29:29.940]  That answers my question. I was like, what what world pieces are there?
[29:29.940 --> 29:31.740]  Because if you just go based on this picture
[29:31.740 --> 29:36.140]  it would be like some type of foresty one and then some type of fossil e-desert e1 but
[29:36.780 --> 29:44.380]  It says added two new desert world pieces that unlocked after placing the first different kinds of desert because desert is important ecosystem
[29:44.380 --> 29:50.460]  I feel a theme sundown survivor. Sorry. Yeah, just sorry just the above snakes updates out now sundown
[29:55.580 --> 29:57.140]  Probably not
[29:57.140 --> 30:04.780]  1.3 zone a I still don't really know about this game. It's a very stressful game. Yeah, it looks like it's an intense
[30:05.540 --> 30:10.660]  I don't know. I guess I haven't looked at it more closely. I'm just reading the balance changes
[30:10.660 --> 30:14.140]  They did a lot of like some things got nerfed some things got that got boosted
[30:14.140 --> 30:16.380]  But then I saw this word mammoth
[30:18.020 --> 30:20.480]  Mammoth my moose. What is mammoth?
[30:21.260 --> 30:27.980]  Muth's HP. Is it a mammoth and a cow? I you have my attention. I don't want to play this game
[30:28.980 --> 30:30.980]  Listeners if you have played sundown
[30:31.580 --> 30:36.140]  Survivors, is it sundown or sundown survivors? It was called sundown
[30:36.140 --> 30:42.060]  It's now called sundown survivors, but they don't see have changed the name. It's a roguelike. I don't want to play it
[30:42.100 --> 30:44.100]  Okay, if you have played sundown
[30:44.580 --> 30:49.860]  Tell us tell us what mammoth is because I have a curiosity. I
[30:51.220 --> 30:53.800]  But limited time they did this annoying thing
[30:54.360 --> 30:57.280]  Where they changed the name and they never actually said they were changing it
[30:57.280 --> 31:01.920]  So they just like started referring to it as the new name and like at least do it consistently
[31:01.920 --> 31:06.900]  Your logo doesn't even have the word survivors. I know that's why I was confused. It's also not in their blurb on Steam
[31:06.900 --> 31:11.540]  It's just yeah, if you're gonna rename it do it properly. Come on control F
[31:12.540 --> 31:16.180]  sundown survivors has a 1.3 update which is out now and it has
[31:16.660 --> 31:21.880]  Bug fixes and patches and that they nerf a lot of things down at the bottom. Yep
[31:22.580 --> 31:28.300]  That's thing. Tell us what mammoth is. Yeah, we want to know what it's a mammoth of some kind at me
[31:28.300 --> 31:32.420]  Well, I wonder if it's just yeah, is it just a cow a weird name for a mammoth?
[31:32.420 --> 31:35.860]  Who knows travelers rest have a new update. It's a farm animal
[31:36.540 --> 31:38.540]  added you farm so
[31:38.780 --> 31:45.220]  It's hard to know when you've not actually played these games so if you watch the trailer she is hitting cows
[31:45.620 --> 31:51.520]  It 50 seconds into the trailer. She is hitting cows with a broom and the cows die
[31:51.520 --> 31:54.740]  Oh, don't do that and her too
[31:55.300 --> 32:00.940]  She like kills the two cows and then gets the material from that but like is that no
[32:02.140 --> 32:04.900]  No, you see it. Oh, no
[32:05.420 --> 32:10.980]  With the pig one of the items looks like guts it does one of the eight for the pig
[32:11.500 --> 32:18.180]  Right when she kills the pace one of them looks like a ball of intense intestines pork and beef. Oh, no
[32:19.180 --> 32:25.760]  Nope, there was something else. Yeah, it did say something gonna have to pause it was up for like one frame into it's called intestine
[32:26.600 --> 32:28.600]  Oh my gosh, I'm done
[32:33.640 --> 32:36.300]  You pick up pig intestines have you
[32:36.960 --> 32:41.320]  Listeners, have you ever wanted to use pig intestines in a game?
[32:42.160 --> 32:48.920]  Travelers rest is gotcha back. Oh, I wonder if you use it to like make sausage, right? Cuz it's now
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.320]  Okay
[32:51.320 --> 32:53.320]  No
[32:54.160 --> 33:00.300]  Wine you do you are you a vegan don't play this game definitely don't oh my word. That's
[33:02.360 --> 33:04.360]  The animal you put
[33:04.780 --> 33:06.780]  Look, I know I know
[33:07.640 --> 33:11.400]  Right. I don't want pig intestines in my game
[33:11.980 --> 33:14.240]  Right, like this is the whole realism
[33:14.760 --> 33:20.720]  Versus like actually yeah, and it's like it feels a little bit weird killing your fan at farm animals
[33:20.720 --> 33:22.720]  I know that that's the thing that happens
[33:23.600 --> 33:28.280]  Yeah, why are you killing them with a broom? That is just the pain in their faces. Yes
[33:28.720 --> 33:36.960]  They look act like they've built sprites that are like pain face like flinching. This is horrible flinching. Oh my word
[33:38.360 --> 33:42.580]  Yeah, there's so much detail here and then it pig intestines pop out
[33:42.880 --> 33:48.100]  This is someone who's developed the game so much and they're like, you know rabbit hole. No, I'm kidding
[33:48.360 --> 33:53.940]  Someone probably wants this someone's interested in it. But with a broom, I don't want travelers rest
[33:55.340 --> 34:02.880]  As as as you're seeing this clip of this person hitting and killing these cows and pigs with a broom the narrator says
[34:03.300 --> 34:06.840]  Do it and your animals will be easier to take care of
[34:08.620 --> 34:10.620]  Take care of
[34:11.620 --> 34:14.300]  Can you go take care of the cow, please
[34:15.020 --> 34:17.020]  We need food for the dinner
[34:17.660 --> 34:19.660]  Take care of it
[34:19.940 --> 34:21.660]  Okay
[34:21.660 --> 34:22.780]  Wow
[34:22.780 --> 34:25.020]  Farm animal updates out now. Oh
[34:26.380 --> 34:28.380]  So, okay, right
[34:29.640 --> 34:31.640]  I've just seen a tweet from them
[34:32.180 --> 34:33.340]  saying
[34:33.340 --> 34:39.740]  That they are thinking about an animal cruelty free slash vegan method. They are working on it
[34:40.460 --> 34:45.420]  It is on there, oh, yeah, here we go. Someone says hitting the animals with the room really turned me off
[34:45.420 --> 34:48.140]  I'm buying the game. I'm looking forward to a more humane update
[34:48.740 --> 34:50.740]  Working on it. Oh
[34:51.040 --> 34:52.900]  my gosh, I
[34:52.900 --> 34:59.260]  Still bought the game because it looked amazing. I can't put the controller down and then they say mission accomplished
[35:02.480 --> 35:09.060]  They're like we're working on it the prisons like I bought it anyway, and they're like cool don't have to do anything
[35:09.060 --> 35:14.000]  No, I'm kidding. They're still working on it. They have a road map. Yeah, I can't see on the road map though
[35:16.300 --> 35:20.220]  Insect collection all very long-term. Yeah, I can't see
[35:24.740 --> 35:27.380]  Yeah, I can't see you on there on their list so
[35:28.300 --> 35:30.060]  Let's move on shall we will come back
[35:30.060 --> 35:34.460]  well, we'll keep you up to date on when there's a vegan option for travelers rest or even just a
[35:35.380 --> 35:40.660]  More humane way of killing your animals, maybe it's new new farming mechanics
[35:42.180 --> 35:45.660]  Let's build a zoo. Yep speaking of cruelty to animals
[35:47.420 --> 35:53.260]  Well, let's build a zoo is the one that lets you like crossbreed into like horrific creatures, oh, yeah love this
[35:53.260 --> 35:57.220]  I just I love this game so much
[35:57.220 --> 36:00.940]  I wish I enjoyed playing management games and I would play this much more
[36:00.940 --> 36:04.740]  Anyway, the aquarium Odyssey DLC which adds a
[36:05.900 --> 36:12.260]  Aquarium is I know so you can go get it now. Oh, it's apparently in my library. Did I already buy it?
[36:12.660 --> 36:18.780]  When did I buy this DLC? Is it free? Oh, no, I didn't buy it's all good. No. No, I did. No
[36:19.140 --> 36:23.600]  It's part of dinosaur island the no it no. No, none of that. None of that
[36:24.660 --> 36:29.720]  It is that the news update was on the game itself. Not the DLC
[36:29.960 --> 36:35.520]  So when I said in library, man, we're all good. I'm no longer confused 50 plus new animals
[36:37.120 --> 36:43.520]  Over 50 new fish and mammal species are ready for you to adopt and showcase to your visitors from dolphins to manta rays whales and
[36:43.520 --> 36:45.880]  starfish to lobsters and eels
[36:46.400 --> 36:50.920]  There are so many favorites available to take in by animals to your zoo
[36:50.920 --> 36:57.320]  You will have the ability to create more than 10 million animal variants in the sandbox mode. Are you ready to make the world's first?
[36:57.840 --> 36:59.840]  Chick ale or
[37:00.080 --> 37:01.520]  elus
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.080]  Which I'm assuming are a chicken whale and an eel moose chicken whale
[37:06.600 --> 37:12.820]  Yeah, I I don't know if I'm ready for that Cody. I think I feel like this whole game
[37:13.920 --> 37:21.520]  Or at least the concept of making all these variants came when someone was like, oh, this is my chihuahua Great Dane mix
[37:22.520 --> 37:24.520]  And they were like what I
[37:25.080 --> 37:31.000]  Just I love that. I just I just love that. They're they're leaning into this and just going even more crazy
[37:31.560 --> 37:33.560]  Like I love it. It's great
[37:33.820 --> 37:38.840]  Fantastic. I just wish I enjoyed playing it more. I mean, so you did you play let's build a zoo?
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.880]  I did. Yeah, so do you like put in a thing or do you do you take DNA?
[37:43.880 --> 37:47.780]  And yes, it was DNA based. Okay, so you you're not you're not
[37:48.620 --> 37:50.100]  Procreate
[37:50.100 --> 37:53.580]  Or like cutting them half and splicing them together notice DNA base
[37:53.580 --> 37:58.780]  So you build like a DNA lab and then you put two in and you analyze their DNA and you come out with this
[37:59.500 --> 38:00.700]  abomination
[38:00.700 --> 38:01.860]  right
[38:01.860 --> 38:04.180]  And you can do it as many times you want with this man
[38:04.180 --> 38:10.500]  Do the abominations are do the abominations live every time or is there a time when it just comes out and it's just like obviously
[38:11.500 --> 38:17.140]  Not happy to be alive. That would be horrible. I haven't come across that in my experience
[38:17.140 --> 38:19.140]  They all lived. Okay, but
[38:19.460 --> 38:21.460]  Who knows?
[38:23.260 --> 38:26.940]  Like one in every hundred they come out asking for death
[38:28.220 --> 38:33.380]  Just like you made a chick ale, but you used the nice dip because
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.820]  Because it was it was not I tell you here's something though
[38:40.260 --> 38:43.540]  The interesting thing about this game is that obviously you have different?
[38:44.420 --> 38:48.660]  Areas in your zoo, right? You say like this is the desert area. This is the grasslands, etc
[38:48.660 --> 38:51.120]  Etc. And obviously with this one you have like here's the water
[38:51.540 --> 38:54.860]  But it's not like you can't put them in the other areas, right?
[38:54.860 --> 38:57.640]  You you it tells you which ones are the ideal ones to put them in
[38:58.100 --> 39:03.460]  and it also does things with like oh don't put it with this animal because they'll eat them or whatever which is is quite a
[39:04.060 --> 39:08.820]  cool way of doing it, but you can put them in one that it's not meant to be there and
[39:09.620 --> 39:11.580]  If you put it with something that will get eaten by it
[39:11.580 --> 39:15.540]  Then it just gets eaten and if you put them in a one that it's not meant to be and they just don't live as
[39:15.540 --> 39:19.180]  Well, so like they get sad or ill and stuff like that. Yeah
[39:19.500 --> 39:23.420]  Can you can you put non water creatures in the water and drain them?
[39:26.420 --> 39:28.300]  So in in
[39:28.300 --> 39:33.660]  Zoo tycoon that you could do you like you could literally just put an animal in an empty enclosure and
[39:34.060 --> 39:40.740]  Then give it like the bare freaking minimum and that's it and they're unhappy and I wouldn't do that. I'd be like
[39:40.980 --> 39:44.700]  This is not about what you yeah, this is not about what you would do. I just didn't know
[39:44.700 --> 39:50.460]  I just want to know but then you can you drain the dichotomy is if my sim
[39:50.780 --> 39:55.340]  goes to bed earlier than I wanted it to I put it in the
[39:55.600 --> 40:01.180]  Shed of shame where I make it walk into a room and just delete the door
[40:03.900 --> 40:09.540]  I think the thing is right when you're doing when you're playing the Sims and you're being mean you're doing cruel to the humans
[40:09.700 --> 40:13.860]  You're probably thinking about horrible humans, right? Cuz humans can be pretty horrible
[40:13.860 --> 40:14.740]  I mean
[40:14.740 --> 40:20.340]  I'm thinking about my sim that that was supposed to go to bed was supposed to go to school that day
[40:20.340 --> 40:25.940]  And it was so close to an a right and now it's the weekend and now you didn't go to school on time
[40:26.540 --> 40:29.180]  You don't get to do anything this weekend. Oh my
[40:32.740 --> 40:36.500]  But like well just just just go with me on this one, right so like, you know
[40:36.500 --> 40:40.700]  You've got you've got there are many many cruel evil people, right?
[40:40.700 --> 40:44.780]  And so you can you know, you can think oh this is fine because it's a cruel evil human, right?
[40:44.780 --> 40:49.260]  But you don't really get that with animals. So animals are mostly just kind of doing their natural instincts
[40:49.780 --> 40:51.780]  let's ignore orcas for just now and
[40:52.860 --> 40:54.540]  and so
[40:54.540 --> 40:58.220]  You like I think that's probably the difference, right?
[40:58.220 --> 41:02.820]  You can't like be like being cruel to a dog and you're just like, oh, this is Hitler, right?
[41:03.500 --> 41:09.460]  Works I don't know. Sometimes I feel like my dog when he gets tries to get into the trash for the eighth time in the
[41:09.460 --> 41:10.460]  day
[41:10.460 --> 41:12.460]  Your dog is Hitler
[41:13.460 --> 41:15.460]  We're back to the cat with war crimes
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.420]  So, yeah
[41:18.420 --> 41:20.860]  But I don't even know but let's build a zoo
[41:21.420 --> 41:22.980]  aquarium
[41:22.980 --> 41:24.980]  So that's the updates in DLC
[41:25.900 --> 41:27.900]  None of the animals are Hitler
[41:29.100 --> 41:31.100]  that we know of and
[41:31.100 --> 41:33.100]  I wonder if there's a
[41:33.340 --> 41:40.580]  an animal crossover that would make the word Hitler like a hippo and anything with a cat stantler
[41:42.900 --> 41:44.900]  We're gonna we're gonna talk about
[41:45.540 --> 41:47.540]  some other updates
[41:47.940 --> 41:50.160]  That didn't fit into the previous categories
[41:50.380 --> 41:57.460]  So we have a new gameplay trailer for harvest moon the winds of Anthos and all I care about is the dog race
[41:57.460 --> 42:01.140]  I don't know. So have we have me and you talked about this game yet?
[42:01.140 --> 42:06.780]  No, so I feel like this game still hasn't given me a reason not to like it
[42:06.860 --> 42:12.340]  Yeah, which I'm still waiting for it it. I mean other than the fact the name is weird
[42:13.500 --> 42:14.940]  like all
[42:14.940 --> 42:19.860]  That there are so many games that have weird but like it looks all right
[42:21.140 --> 42:26.940]  The horse controls look janky, but other than that, I think that the the dog
[42:27.500 --> 42:32.840]  The dog I'm still really hopeful about. Yeah, so what's the month? It's just that there's a trailer. Oh, yeah
[42:32.840 --> 42:39.120]  Yeah, just new trailer. There's the I don't think there's any new. Yeah. No, it looks it looks good an icy tomato
[42:40.160 --> 42:42.160]  Snowman. Oh, that is a cute dog. Oh
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.860]  So I am it looks cute. I'm excited to hear what y'all have to say about it. Oh, I found the problem
[42:48.860 --> 42:53.020]  Don't touch bears don't and don't come up to black bears or touch
[42:53.740 --> 42:55.740]  dinosaurs, excuse me
[42:56.660 --> 43:01.940]  At one minute 38 seconds in the trailer someone is in like a lava zone and they're pointing at a dinosaur
[43:02.640 --> 43:09.240]  Yeah, well, where else are the dinosaurs gonna be in to be fair in the past, right Cody to be fair
[43:10.300 --> 43:13.440]  She's shocked. She is pretty sure that is a shock
[43:15.220 --> 43:17.220]  My face looking at the dinosaur
[43:17.940 --> 43:25.220]  What the heck? Although then she's got a shocked face when Doug jr. Is talking about chickens. So I feel like not much
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.260]  She gets shocked by a lot of stuff. Um, I yeah, I mean chickens are all chickens. It's cuz chickens are dinosaurs. Oh my god
[43:34.620 --> 43:39.800]  No, the volcanoes are up at the chickens are thing. We're off the rails Moonstone Island
[43:40.860 --> 43:47.440]  Has a collaboration that we know Johnny is gonna love. This is an ooblets collaboration. This is wild
[43:47.740 --> 43:50.400]  Yes, this is wild Cody this
[43:51.040 --> 43:56.000]  Island are adding ooblets into the game. This opens up like what like where is the end?
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.400]  I just ooblets in your coffee ooblets in
[44:01.160 --> 44:05.600]  House of dragons. I'm so fascinated by this like yeah, I
[44:06.320 --> 44:08.320]  Think it's interesting. Um, I
[44:08.960 --> 44:14.240]  Wrote hilariously Johnny. What ooblet do you want in Moonstone Island tells Johnny?
[44:14.840 --> 44:21.440]  Which of the goofy named things rad lad is probably one of the better named ones from his point of view I suspect yeah
[44:21.440 --> 44:22.720]  Yeah
[44:22.720 --> 44:26.400]  It's just a joke. The other person asked would be bev what they think
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.480]  What ooblet they think would be best for collaborations and then also which one would be best for rad lad is definitely a good option
[44:33.480 --> 44:35.480]  I also like Shrumble
[44:35.520 --> 44:41.440]  And those are the only ones I can I'm trying to find a list of impumbs. Oh, those are clubs
[44:41.560 --> 44:47.280]  I was gonna say that's a club. Come on. Why not? I want like a list of the ooblets. Okay, whatever
[44:47.280 --> 44:49.600]  This is taking too much time really interesting though
[44:51.080 --> 44:54.360]  To see rad lot to see a collaboration between these games
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.760]  So I wonder if they're gonna do more or if ooblets is gonna put their their
[45:01.640 --> 45:04.160]  Ooblets in two other games. I don't know
[45:05.960 --> 45:08.440]  Very interesting. Yeah. Yeah
[45:09.440 --> 45:16.400]  Mossfield origins are moving to self-publishing. I mean, I don't think this really changes much for anyone. It's an interesting thing
[45:16.400 --> 45:21.360]  I know the Stardew did this a few years after release they switched from
[45:22.000 --> 45:26.640]  What was it the cat Stardew? Yeah, what was Stardew? I thought it was always just no
[45:27.640 --> 45:30.680]  Used a publisher Chucklefish. Mmm Chucklefish
[45:31.520 --> 45:33.520]  And then moved to move to self-publish
[45:34.400 --> 45:35.920]  Yeah, I mean I
[45:35.920 --> 45:41.240]  If you can do it, it's less money to pay for other things. So more I need to the developer
[45:41.240 --> 45:46.720]  I guess they've obviously thought this there. There's also steam next fest
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.600]  Which there'll be a demo of muscle origins
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.160]  During steam next fest, which is an event happening here on October
[45:56.760 --> 45:58.860]  So it's a multi-day celebration. It starts
[45:59.860 --> 46:01.580]  October 9th at 10 a.m
[46:01.580 --> 46:08.940]  And I believe it's just kind of there's seven days and there's hundreds of demos and hours of the developer stream
[46:08.940 --> 46:14.260]  So it's just kind of like a way for you to see people playing the games that are coming up in the future
[46:14.260 --> 46:18.300]  So Mossfield origins. Yeah, there's probably a bunch of other games as well
[46:18.300 --> 46:25.420]  I don't tend to talk a huge amount about them because like we're doing up-to-date news, but this is quite a while away
[46:25.420 --> 46:27.540]  So get on that if you want to play it
[46:28.420 --> 46:32.820]  We've got two soundtracks there. All right, so we've got roots of Pacha and
[46:33.340 --> 46:39.260]  Research story have both released their soundtrack. It's a patcha is on Spotify and research story is not
[46:40.020 --> 46:42.100]  but you can get the research story one for
[46:43.060 --> 46:45.060]  yes on steam and
[46:45.420 --> 46:50.140]  It has to be one tracks a couple different artists, which is yeah speaking of something that's coming out
[46:50.140 --> 46:55.900]  But we have no very little about it. Yeah, I'm hyped about this. I'm gonna start my cooking channel
[46:56.100 --> 47:00.420]  Yeah, because the stardew valley cookbook is coming out next year
[47:01.060 --> 47:04.100]  So I'm gonna start a cooking channel called get this
[47:05.420 --> 47:06.860]  al dente
[47:06.860 --> 47:08.860]  It's the worst
[47:11.180 --> 47:17.140]  We could totally have like that could be a segment on this show like well al dente instead of green houses
[47:17.140 --> 47:19.380]  it's like another edition of al dente and
[47:20.420 --> 47:23.380]  In it, maybe like you and one other person
[47:24.060 --> 47:25.780]  Recreates a
[47:25.780 --> 47:30.060]  Cooking recipe from this cookbook. I feel like it needs to be a separate thing
[47:30.060 --> 47:33.420]  I feel like okay, even if it's just like a temporary thing, okay
[47:33.620 --> 47:37.620]  This is not me promising to do this by the way, just just in case you're thinking
[47:38.420 --> 47:42.940]  Promising to do I am promising. Let me tell you let me tell you so I love this
[47:42.940 --> 47:47.260]  so I have some developer friends who were commenting on this and
[47:48.220 --> 47:53.820]  They were throwing a bunch of weird prompts into chat GPT to try and get some suggestion, okay, and
[47:55.580 --> 48:00.480]  One of them one of the one of the prompts came up with the best tagline
[48:01.780 --> 48:06.420]  So it starts off al welcome you unsuspecting culinary captives
[48:11.620 --> 48:16.680]  Unsuspecting culinary captain, I mean it has to happen. I'm here for it
[48:17.820 --> 48:24.580]  Today we're diving into the deep dark abyss of culinary chaos to whip up that elusive monstrosity known as seafoam pudding
[48:25.300 --> 48:29.940]  Charming game stardew Valley, although it for some reason wrote star view Valley. Oh
[48:34.100 --> 48:39.060]  I'll grabs a mixing bowl and starts hurling ingredients into it ingredients into it without measuring
[48:41.300 --> 48:46.900]  I'm gonna follow this recipe. All right, listen up because I'm only saying this once we're making seafoam pudding
[48:46.900 --> 48:52.720]  I've already said that a second time why I don't know nobody knows but we're doing it anyway because apparently it's a thing
[48:52.900 --> 48:59.460]  That is you like you say that al grumbles of these struggles to crack eggs spilling them all over the counter
[48:59.460 --> 49:02.220]  How dare you I am good at cracking eggs. Thank you very much
[49:02.340 --> 49:04.380]  No, I'm sure that you can crack eggs
[49:04.380 --> 49:11.420]  But you've done you've said like that exact phrase of like here we're doing this why I don't know but we're doing it
[49:11.420 --> 49:14.180]  Anyway, like I feel like you said that before
[49:14.860 --> 49:19.220]  First we need eggs how many who cares just throw them in you like guessing games, right?
[49:22.620 --> 49:24.620]  It's you on chaos mode
[49:24.780 --> 49:30.960]  Next up sugar because every good recipe starts with a truckload of sugar who needs dental hygiene when you can have a sugar high
[49:31.220 --> 49:34.360]  It's al dente get yourself to the dentist
[49:38.580 --> 49:44.060]  No vanilla extract or is it fish oil who cares a splash of something liquid and it's good to go
[49:44.180 --> 49:50.180]  I'll dramatically pours a random liquid into the bowl then sniffs it suspiciously. Those are two very different things
[49:52.620 --> 49:54.620]  You need to include this somewhere
[49:55.540 --> 50:02.540]  Unlike put it on the on the slack. No the pièce de résistance. They're enigmatic seafoam. What is it?
[50:02.540 --> 50:06.820]  How do you get it? No one knows and honestly, I'm not even sure if I care at this point
[50:07.540 --> 50:12.460]  I'll flings handfuls of whipped cream and crumbled cookies into the bowl laughing maniacally
[50:15.020 --> 50:18.280]  Well, assuming that I put the vanilla extract in nice
[50:22.740 --> 50:25.980]  Mix it all together until it looks like a crime scene of flavors
[50:27.100 --> 50:30.700]  We want confusion chaos and flavor anarchy people
[50:30.900 --> 50:37.580]  I'll mixes the concoction with wild abandon splattering the camera with bits of the mixture now for the grand finale
[50:37.580 --> 50:44.160]  We summon the culinary spirits of Stardew Valley by screaming at the top of our lungs. Are you ready? I don't care
[50:44.180 --> 50:51.760]  Let's do it. Anyway, I'll let's a primal screen that scream that shakes the entire set causing a few dishes to crash to the floor
[50:52.860 --> 50:58.380]  And there you have it folks the abomination that is seafoam pudding from the depths of gaming nonsense
[50:58.860 --> 51:03.820]  Servant in whatever container you can find an old shoe. Perfect a flower pot even better
[51:05.500 --> 51:09.760]  I'll violently scoops them pudding into various unconventional containers
[51:09.960 --> 51:13.840]  This is al signing off with a reminder culinary precision is for the week
[51:14.240 --> 51:21.120]  Embrace the chaos revel in the madness and remember if your food doesn't make you question your life choices. Are you even living?
[51:26.920 --> 51:32.220]  I'll take some monstrous bite of the seafoam pudding his expression a mixture of confusion and irritation
[51:33.120 --> 51:38.620]  And if you're wondering if this tastes good who cares until next time stay furious my friends
[51:39.760 --> 51:41.760]  You
[51:42.880 --> 51:49.520]  Better like follow if you make al dente you better follow this to the letter. It's script exactly exactly. Oh
[51:50.360 --> 51:54.440]  My words, I just I would watch that. I love it. I
[51:55.240 --> 51:57.240]  Just like this is the thing, right? Okay. I'm not
[51:57.880 --> 52:02.000]  We don't need to get into debate but like sometimes it can create masterpieces
[52:05.320 --> 52:07.540]  Why does AI know me better than I know myself
[52:07.540 --> 52:09.540]  So
[52:12.620 --> 52:15.740]  So there's uh, there's a stardew valley cookbook coming out next year
[52:18.780 --> 52:23.660]  Am I gonna buy it probably I don't know why I'm saying probably I think you all know what's gonna happen
[52:23.660 --> 52:27.740]  Yeah, but there's not gonna be there's no pictures or in anything of it right now
[52:27.740 --> 52:33.300]  It's literally just it's coming out the end. I mean, well, let's be honest. Let's be honest Cody if
[52:34.100 --> 52:36.500]  There were any pictures would it make?
[52:37.540 --> 52:40.540]  Me any little more likely or less likely to buy it
[52:43.180 --> 52:47.160]  You see the pictures when you buy it Cody that's how it works you don't want to get it free
[52:48.040 --> 52:52.820]  You'll share the pictures with me. So here's an interesting so you can get it on hardcover for
[52:53.500 --> 52:54.740]  $28 or
[52:54.740 --> 53:00.340]  Or 22 pounds or you can get on the Kindle for I don't know what it is in dollars, but it's nine pounds
[53:00.340 --> 53:06.200]  So probably about ten. So that's good because quite often books are like the same price on Kindle, which is just stupid
[53:06.200 --> 53:09.560]  This is a very decent. Yeah, I mean
[53:09.560 --> 53:14.920]  I do think that not buying this is probably the better option for the vast majority of people, right?
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.800]  But yeah, I'm almost certainly gonna buy this so come join the patreon and help me pay for this insane
[53:22.520 --> 53:28.660]  Thing. Oh my word. I'm just I I can't get over how much that script actually does sound like me
[53:29.480 --> 53:31.760]  Why I just am I that predictable
[53:32.480 --> 53:35.200]  said oh my word at some point I
[53:35.680 --> 53:37.920]  I would have been like you wrote this
[53:39.240 --> 53:41.360]  You wrote this don't tell me
[53:42.440 --> 53:44.440]  unsuspecting culinary captives
[53:45.880 --> 53:49.920]  You don't know it but you're a captain of a chaotic vessel, here we go
[53:51.220 --> 53:52.760]  anyway
[53:52.760 --> 53:56.120]  Got three more pieces of news olds. We got this
[53:56.160 --> 54:02.440]  yeah, so we've got three games that are various levels of information and they're
[54:03.440 --> 54:05.200]  Chill town
[54:05.200 --> 54:08.380]  Was on Kickstarter it has been funded and it is ended
[54:08.920 --> 54:10.920]  So if you want to back it too late
[54:10.920 --> 54:17.800]  They're currently saying that the early access is coming out in October and the game is releasing in q2
[54:18.080 --> 54:21.440]  2024 I'd be very surprised if that happens. But yeah
[54:22.280 --> 54:28.200]  If you want it, it will exist at some point cuz yeah, it just got funded. So yeah, literally
[54:29.160 --> 54:34.840]  Five days ago as we're talking so if it was coming this soon like what was being funded
[54:34.840 --> 54:37.480]  Yeah, I mean, I guess it's not that uncommon that they're like
[54:37.480 --> 54:39.320]  Oh, we just need to like get this over
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.520]  Like if it's somebody's been developing it for years on their own and then they're like, right?
[54:43.520 --> 54:48.540]  I'm so close, but I need to like devote my time to this then they would they would do that
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.960]  It's coming to PC and maybe Mac, but it's unclear
[54:53.800 --> 55:00.800]  It doesn't say it's not coming to Mac it doesn't say it's exclusive to Windows but they oh they were only asking for
[55:01.520 --> 55:04.200]  $1,000. Oh, that's how you know, you're gonna get a success
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.600]  We're excited to share that our Kickstarter campaign has achieved a funding level of
[55:10.120 --> 55:15.600]  490 percent. Oh wait 10. Sorry. They were asking for 10,000. Oh, yeah, but like still that's not
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.360]  Not very much. Yeah, I mean it is it's a big difference between 10 and 1
[55:22.480 --> 55:27.660]  But yeah, yeah, I think that it looks like my comment was that it looks like Animal Crossing
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.960]  Yeah, but there's a cat following you and there's a little bit more
[55:31.600 --> 55:33.480]  Detail. Yeah. Yeah
[55:33.480 --> 55:37.600]  So what did I did I write anything for this a unique blend of?
[55:37.800 --> 55:43.840]  Soothing simulation and an idle game with a music decoration fishing cooking farming dot-dot-dot
[55:43.840 --> 55:44.240]  Yeah
[55:44.240 --> 55:46.240]  It did have a decent amount of farming
[55:46.280 --> 55:51.440]  Look into it and some of the farm things that you have like it looked like they were like turnips or whatever
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.880]  Yeah, they look alive. They look like why did the turnips look alive?
[55:56.200 --> 55:58.200]  No, not this again
[55:59.400 --> 56:03.160]  Unless these are turnips unless it's like Joan
[56:03.440 --> 56:09.440]  Am I eat is this an ooblets and they're gonna help me out or am I gonna have to eat live turnips?
[56:09.440 --> 56:13.160]  Maybe it's like the stockings the stonk exchange in
[56:13.560 --> 56:20.000]  Animal Crossing where you just like are trading these things and you're not actually eating players have a range of methods for
[56:20.240 --> 56:23.700]  Catching different types of pals. Oh, it's ooblets again
[56:24.200 --> 56:30.220]  these methods include digging them up from the ground sneaking up on them and capturing them while fishing in the sea or
[56:30.800 --> 56:31.800]  employing
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.760]  Specialized tools such as a suction gun explicitly designed for their capture
[56:36.800 --> 56:41.480]  These I know that was quite that is the wording on that my word
[56:42.440 --> 56:45.000]  These toes just imagine them running away
[56:45.360 --> 56:51.600]  Like there's one in the corner like mommy no, it's like no gonna shoot you
[56:53.760 --> 56:58.580]  These tools can either be crafted by the player or purchased from the local town shops and
[56:59.160 --> 57:03.680]  You're right. Yeah. Okay, so you're growing you're growing you're growing creatures too. It's a creature collection
[57:03.680 --> 57:06.920]  Why didn't it say that doesn't say that anywhere but it's great
[57:06.920 --> 57:09.200]  It is like you read the detail and you're like, oh you
[57:09.520 --> 57:16.920]  Grow these creatures and you capture them and then you evolve them and then there's different rarity and your bonds increase with them
[57:16.920 --> 57:19.080]  And you can make hybrid they're calling them pals
[57:19.840 --> 57:22.840]  Which I really don't like as a word pal
[57:24.760 --> 57:26.240]  Hybrid pals
[57:26.240 --> 57:29.840]  Yeah, it's a creature collection farming game, which is fine. Like I like that
[57:29.840 --> 57:34.060]  Yeah, I don't know why I didn't realize that because I have backed this one
[57:35.640 --> 57:37.960]  So I really paid attention when I was backing it
[57:39.280 --> 57:45.800]  No, it's good. I like it, but it like doesn't make that clear anywhere else. And then there's also just fish
[57:46.480 --> 57:54.040]  Just just fish. Yeah, like hyper realistic looking fish in this game that you have turnip with eyes
[57:55.000 --> 57:56.320]  Like what?
[57:56.320 --> 58:01.920]  The fish looks so if I've you seen the fish I'm scrolling they look so out of place. Oh
[58:02.920 --> 58:10.320]  Yeah, yep, what's with what's with that it's like everything is like chibi and cartoony and then you've got this
[58:11.560 --> 58:17.000]  Hyper-looking boss. It's the same with the with the butterflies. Also, these are all just
[58:18.120 --> 58:23.760]  But like this is this reminds me of Animal Crossing because Animal Crossing when you collect the insects and then you look at them in
[58:23.760 --> 58:29.800]  Your that's true. Whatever they look very real and the way that your person holds up the thing like wow
[58:29.800 --> 58:36.160]  I caught it like it's very Animal Crossing. Oh, I think they actually cooking. Oh, you can pay $75 to get a unicorn
[58:37.360 --> 58:39.360]  or
[58:39.760 --> 58:42.740]  $20 for a baby dragon kickstart. Yeah, it's a
[58:43.260 --> 58:49.000]  75 for what Oh add-on baby drug. Okay. Yeah, it's twenty twenty dollars that you can you can get the dragon on its own
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  They did not unlock
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.520]  Switch. Yeah. Yeah, it's just gonna be PC
[58:56.160 --> 58:59.000]  Question yeah, I mean they'll port to switch if it's successful
[58:59.360 --> 59:03.820]  But yeah, it certainly won't be coming to start with but these things never do they never release with switches. Yeah
[59:04.080 --> 59:07.800]  Yeah, I like the look of it. It looks a little bit weird. It looks a little bit cute
[59:07.800 --> 59:12.640]  I'm intrigued to see how it goes. I didn't realize until this conversation that it was a creature collection game
[59:12.840 --> 59:16.560]  You learn something new every day classic Moonlight Peaks
[59:17.440 --> 59:19.960]  have you ever wanted to be a
[59:20.760 --> 59:26.520]  Vampire I says this is wild and expedience life as a vampire in Moonlight Peaks

[59:34.640 --> 59:41.720]  Befriend the local werewolves witches and mermaids and maybe even find eternal love along the way in this heartwarming life
[59:41.720 --> 59:44.680]  Sim you set out to prove to your skeptical father
[59:45.720 --> 59:47.720]  Dracula
[59:48.240 --> 59:50.240]  What
[59:54.040 --> 59:58.040]  It's down under about this game father is Dracula
[59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.920]  You're trying to give some humanity to Dracula
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.200]  Unravel the mysteries of the seven families and step out of the shadow of your father
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.460]  Find your perfect match vampire dating is full of options from werewolves to unsuspecting humans. Yikes
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.820]  Unsuspective also one of the pictures in the dating in the I know it's your father
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.420]  Well, I don't know you don't know that's their father is just in the image
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.580]  That's above the bit that talks about your father, but it doesn't actually say it's your father
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.340]  So I'm assuming it's not I like the guy with the owl
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.500]  I'm guessing because the two characters in that image are both in there
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.100]  So I'm guessing that you play as one of them and the other one is a villager
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:41.460]  like you can choose one of the like I presume those are the two options you can choose from and
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:48.300]  She's she looks like a witch not right, maybe they're just I'm so confused knows this is wild
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:54.140]  You I'm gonna have to play this game. I mean it has full controller support. So yeah you do
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:02.180]  You fly that's the thing that matters that or the ability to break up couples is what you need
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:09.260]  Well, yeah, I like it's very it's very kind of purpley. Yeah. I'm really liking the color scheme
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:14.060]  I'm looking at all the characters. It's my vibe. I'm very like I like the art
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:19.180]  I like that you can you fly around as a bat you like fire. I should have umpire. Yeah
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:26.780]  There's also a blood meter in the top left. What oh, no, you're gonna have to kill. What are you do?
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:36.140]  All moonlighters assemble ask me anything. Oh there was an AMA and I'm hoping I'm hoping I'm hoping
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:41.620]  That that is just like your your energy bar and you go to sleep to bring it up
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.700]  But I have a bad feeling that you're gonna have to keep eating humans
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.980]  What if you fall in love with a human and they just let you
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.740]  loftier

[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.580]  The important thing I haven't seen the bees. Where do the bees?
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.480]  If you watch the trailer there, you can see them in the background of about 35 seconds into the trailer
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.240]  You're looking at like a plant
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.800]  a
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.040]  Creation thing and it looks like the plant chamber has
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.600]  temperature pH level nutrients energy and water
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:45.080]  So you can change all those things and behind it are beehives and the bees are coming and going. Oh

[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.640]  What is this fish engine

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:04.200]  You're like building it. Oh, it's a hydro energy station. Your dog is helping you build it. It's it's for energy. Okay
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.800]  But yeah, look at there's like two of them in the in the in the picture in the big picture

[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.360]  It's an MMO, but it does look pretty cute. One of the beehives looks like a little game boy
