[03:23.200 --> 03:26.560] so yeah before that we're gonna have a whole bunch of exciting news
[03:27.200 --> 03:29.360] but first of all kevin what have you been up to
[03:31.680 --> 03:36.080] it's been a minute since i've been on so i'm trying to think um it's been a minute yet i
[03:36.080 --> 03:41.840] feel like yeah the gradually episode is your last one yeah um tears of the kingdom i'm not
[03:41.840 --> 03:48.000] done with it but i have i don't remember if i had it when i last recorded but i've i'm going
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.320] through that it's guess what it's a good game um shock the lightning temple is the best part of the
[03:54.320 --> 03:59.840] game thus far i haven't done the fire temple i will say but uh man i really like the lightning
[03:59.840 --> 04:09.280] temple it's a pyramid in a desert it's it's a good thing um let's see aside from um that
[04:10.240 --> 04:16.240] marvel snap continues to eat away at my life um i hit uh infinite last season that's like top of
[04:16.240 --> 04:22.240] the top i finally caught up with johnny um and i am trying to claw my way back up there slowly but
[04:22.240 --> 04:29.760] unsurely um aside from that uh but but all that's a little that's all that's a little old news
[04:29.760 --> 04:38.560] what's eaten my life this week aquarium odyssey deal sea forts let's make a zoo whatever it's
[04:38.560 --> 04:44.320] called the zoo game i'm playing that i'm back in nice let's build a zoo whatever
[04:45.280 --> 04:53.840] yeah what abomination of nature have you are you most excited by so as the name applies is
[04:53.840 --> 04:58.800] aquarium odyssey it's all your fish and whatnot right so yeah i'm probably gonna work on like a
[04:58.800 --> 05:03.520] puffer fish and a blue whale because that just sounds funny just stick the head on the blue whale
[05:03.520 --> 05:11.840] nice tiny little puffer fish head um but um i mean it's good you know go back to the episode we
[05:11.840 --> 05:17.520] talked about that game it's still good it's great value go go get it let's build a zoo um
[05:18.560 --> 05:25.360] what about you al what have you been up to nice um let's see so i've started i've started playing
[05:25.360 --> 05:34.240] the original harvest moon on my switch oh so that is interesting i'll talk more about that later
[05:34.880 --> 05:41.840] ah some other did you have a question no no actually that does make me uh i should point
[05:41.840 --> 05:46.880] out i've also i've actually kept up with story of seasons uh wonderful life um as a you know
[05:46.880 --> 05:53.920] comparison point since that is the yeah the grand pappy of that game um so i am curious to see how
[05:53.920 --> 05:59.120] that uh that compares because that game uh i'm still enjoying it but uh but i guess we'll hear
[05:59.120 --> 06:04.320] about that some other time maybe uh i don't know what it's not like i'm saving it for a future
[06:04.320 --> 06:10.640] episode or anything like that definitely no no why would we do that on this platform why are we
[06:10.640 --> 06:15.120] talking about harvest moon on the harvest season no that doesn't make sense but yeah it's it's
[06:15.120 --> 06:18.800] interesting i'll say that at this point it's interesting because i never played the original
[06:18.800 --> 06:22.720] did you you never played the original did you i wonder if it was your first yeah that's correct
[06:23.040 --> 06:31.120] yeah so it's interesting to go back and see where it all began and um what was a staple back then
[06:31.120 --> 06:36.560] and what has changed since then it's been very interesting i'm not sure it's the sort of game
[06:36.560 --> 06:42.000] i'm going to play for months right like it's not sure but i'm sure it shows a little age just a
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.920] little maybe yeah but at least for a bit to see what it's like because you know history is is
[06:47.920 --> 06:53.920] interesting context is good for things yeah usually i have also
[06:55.520 --> 07:01.360] i've been doing a bunch of raids in pokemon to get ready for mewtwo which is i think coming on
[07:01.360 --> 07:10.800] this friday um so looking forward to getting a mewtwo with the remark enjoying that
[07:11.520 --> 07:15.520] i haven't been disliking it i mean i feel like the raids are one of the better bits of the game
[07:15.520 --> 07:21.520] i feel like it's the work one of the worst i just i really like i've really been enjoying
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.160] the blissy ones because it's like you go in there and you absolutely take it down and then it heals
[07:26.160 --> 07:30.400] you and you're like oh great thanks and then you get loads of rewards for it i've been enjoying
[07:30.400 --> 07:36.560] that oh sure i guess that if you're grinding out the easy mindless ones yeah that that makes sense
[07:36.640 --> 07:47.280] like i yeah okay and that's fair like i i'm on many tangents here but um i play with my brother
[07:47.280 --> 07:54.000] calvin and a lot of times we even do not even online just like next to each other couch local
[07:54.000 --> 08:01.200] co-op type yeah situation where he has his switch i have mine and we're uh where we'll be doing a
[08:01.200 --> 08:05.280] raid together whatever right and and that's good because hey the person i'm coordinating with is
[08:05.280 --> 08:11.600] like right next to me we can actually just talk and and coordinate stuff but yeah it also being
[08:11.600 --> 08:19.440] able to see each other's screens more or less shows how insanely broken the raids can be
[08:20.480 --> 08:24.880] um that might not be the case at lower easier raids where you clear them out into a second
[08:24.880 --> 08:33.520] but yeah like the raid will be finished on one of our screens like a good at least 30 seconds
[08:33.520 --> 08:43.120] before the other person it's wild wild um but um you know and and that's all technical like
[08:43.120 --> 08:48.880] shenanigans but um even from a non-technical like more subjective i don't particularly
[08:48.880 --> 08:54.560] like the design of them i much prefer the sword shield once yeah but we don't need to get into
[08:54.560 --> 09:01.280] that bit again yeah i don't know do yeah no i don't all right that's fine but yeah go ahead
[09:01.280 --> 09:07.600] so that and uh i've got loads of games that i'm kind of ongoing but not really done a huge amount
[09:07.600 --> 09:13.120] i've still not managed to push past the bunch of tutorials at the beginning of pikmin 4 they are
[09:13.120 --> 09:21.040] really not fun um i'm not about the full game but i can tell just from the demo that it's bad it's
[09:21.040 --> 09:27.200] real bad my problem with is right you get into the game and it starts you off on this little kind of
[09:27.200 --> 09:33.200] mini tutorial level where you're playing with with olimar and um you've got all your powers
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.880] and everything and that's that's actually a really good tutorial really fun tutorial
[09:36.880 --> 09:40.960] and i was having loads of fun during that and then you finish it and you go into the actual
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.280] start of the game and they put you into a new tutorial which is just walk 10 steps get talked
[09:45.280 --> 09:49.600] at for five minutes walk 10 steps get talked out for five minutes and i'm like why are we doing
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.680] this so i'm really hoping we get back to what it was at the very beginning and i would actually
[09:53.680 --> 09:59.520] enjoy it but i'm not enjoying it right now so i've not been playing it a lot it's wild because
[09:59.520 --> 10:08.080] this is you know the fourth entry in the pikmin series and i will say like i have never once
[10:08.080 --> 10:18.640] associated dialogue with the pikmin series and yeah we love that story it's and so it's just
[10:18.640 --> 10:26.080] it's it's wild to see the pivot they took from like no dialogue to oh we're just gonna throw
[10:26.640 --> 10:33.600] every as much dialogue as humanly possible as we can into this it's insane bizarre
[10:34.960 --> 10:38.080] and i need to at some point go back and finish off hollow knight but i've just not had the
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.360] the brain space for that but i mean that requires a lot of brain space i don't want to blame you and
[10:45.360 --> 10:49.760] i did just get a bunch of games for my birthday so that's gonna make things busy so oh you'll like
[10:49.760 --> 10:58.880] this so i got what did we get uh i got i'm trying to remember the one that wasn't sonic related
[10:58.880 --> 11:06.960] that i got uh oh yeah i got louise's luigi's mansion 3 oh that's that's a good one and then
[11:06.960 --> 11:14.560] i got uh two sonic games because apparently the two sonic games and a sonic lego set because
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.840] apparently this was the sonic birthday i don't even know how that happened oh so i got every
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.880] birthday is the sonic birthday i got the new sonic set um you know the one without the ball
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.960] that sonic goes in yeah yeah and the the um the thing that speeds it along so i got that
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.960] which i'm excited to build yeah and then i got sonic forces which i had never played
[11:37.760 --> 11:45.360] oh oh that um that's a game with highs and lows it'll be interesting to see
[11:46.480 --> 11:52.560] i got that for switch and i got i think you might actually like it though i'm hoping so i'm hoping
[11:52.560 --> 11:59.440] so because there's there's yeah the levels are short i'll say that that's good that's good yeah
[11:59.440 --> 12:09.520] and i got sonic frontiers for ps5 ah now we're now that's a good one did you did you think you
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.680] could play sonic in breath of the wild i didn't think so but apparently you can and it's enjoyable
[12:15.680 --> 12:21.040] i am excited to to play it um all the all the extra updates they're all free aren't they there's
[12:21.040 --> 12:27.520] no like paid dlc for that isn't it i yeah i've not heard of any paid dlc yeah because they just
[12:27.520 --> 12:32.560] announced their last um update for that game yeah dude do you not remember we had this conversation
[12:32.560 --> 12:37.760] about sonic direct like two months ago yeah we had the birthday dlc is that still going on
[12:37.760 --> 12:44.000] no there was uh there was another thing they've announced anyway i don't remember whatever so i
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.840] got that's what i got i've not played any of them yet but uh they're on my list so lots of games
[12:50.480 --> 12:57.040] lots of stuff i think that's what we've been up to all right should we talk about some news i
[12:57.120 --> 13:06.000] guess contractually obliged to all right so first of all we've got apico 3.0 uh is coming out soon
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.840] so it's the new apico update um it has a bunch of new areas some newbies some new quests and
[13:13.840 --> 13:18.640] fishing mechanic so if you felt one thing that was missing from apico is fishing
[13:18.640 --> 13:28.320] no it's got it do we get cody in a fishing hat you see the fishing tutorial no she is not
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.400] wouldn't that be something look if i mean basically fish are the bees of the sea right
[13:37.680 --> 13:46.080] i ooh that's that's it sure i'll say yes just just to aggravate cody so it also looks like
[13:46.640 --> 13:51.760] wait i feel like they've taken this really in a really weird direction because i'm just watching
[13:51.760 --> 13:57.600] the the trailer for the update and it looks like you can dive underground not underground dive
[13:57.600 --> 14:06.160] under the water whoa and get water bees is that a thing yes you can get bees in the water no i
[14:06.160 --> 14:15.200] know in the game is that a thing in real life oh probably not bees in water water bees bees cannot
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.000] swim that's the first thing that cannot breathe underwater but they can be submerged
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000] for up to five minutes
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.840] gotta pollinate wait scientists just discovered there are bees in the oceans
[14:29.840 --> 14:39.680] bees is in quotes oh they're pollinators oh we'll paint it okay here we go all right then um
[14:40.400 --> 14:49.440] okay that's well okay but all right i'm just see this is how wild this apico update is yeah
[14:50.400 --> 15:00.880] you know you love cbs we got a new whole fishing month now we got an episode to throw in there
[15:01.200 --> 15:03.280] get cody in there
[15:05.760 --> 15:12.480] anyway that is coming soon speaking of coming soon we got a release date for steam world build

[15:25.760 --> 15:31.840] what is steam world it's uh it's a city builder okay i've heard the name but i've never actually
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.480] bothered to look what steam world is because the steam world dig right yeah so steam world
[15:36.480 --> 15:41.520] have a bunch of different games in different genres and steam world build is their
[15:43.120 --> 15:49.760] city builder one and it's their new game oh it's got it's ooh it reminds me of dragon quest
[15:49.760 --> 15:56.720] builders got that that square grid system i like it yeah it looks great it looks quite cool um i
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.080] might give it a try at some point oh that looks like combat like actual combat sort of thing okay
[16:02.080 --> 16:08.480] that's interesting huh all right yeah i'm wondering whether it's um so it's definitely not like first
[16:08.480 --> 16:15.840] person i'm pretty sure it's kind of terror defense combat that's what it sure looks like so i mean
[16:15.840 --> 16:21.360] that's good i like terror defense i do too i do yeah all right this looks pretty good online
[16:21.360 --> 16:30.320] december 1st december 1st coming to windows windows playstation xbox and switch and it's like
[16:31.360 --> 16:39.200] ps5 and 4 and it's xbox series s and x and xbox one it's like it's on all the things
[16:39.440 --> 16:45.600] everything that matters except mac i stand by my state
[16:47.600 --> 16:53.120] wow oh kevin
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.760] kevin i can't wait to get the plugs in so people can send their hate mail
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.360] kevin i think that my time at sandrock is scared of the necos night market
[17:05.360 --> 17:11.280] i most things should be i'm scared of the necos night market because i'm so excited for it
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.240] it's going to consume my life for context they have delayed their 1.0 release so that was meant
[17:18.240 --> 17:22.640] to be coming out the same day as mannequins night market on the 26th of september they have taken
[17:22.640 --> 17:29.600] the very sensible decision to delay until the 2nd of november yeah some room between them and
[17:29.600 --> 17:38.320] mannequins night market yep that's that's the move i mean yeah i can't i can't think of any
[17:38.320 --> 17:43.680] game well that's not true there's probably some games but it's a that's a tough time to come out
[17:43.680 --> 17:51.120] um yeah i don't blame you i'd run away i love them they probably have no idea right like it's
[17:51.120 --> 17:55.440] probably just any more time but i love the idea that they're like actively like having a meeting
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.760] like oh no we're just releasing the same day as mannequins night market we need to we need to
[17:59.760 --> 18:05.760] change we're gonna we're not gonna nobody's gonna play our game there are okay i don't know about
[18:05.760 --> 18:14.320] sandrock but that absolutely happens i'm positive oh sure red dead redemption 2 you bet it moved
[18:14.320 --> 18:19.840] because breath of the wild came out on the same day week whatever sure sure but but we are talking
[18:19.840 --> 18:25.600] about mannequins night market right it's not exactly uh is it is it are you gonna regret this
[18:25.600 --> 18:34.560] statement al look i think we are living in a bubble let me put it that way well a pro manneco
[18:35.120 --> 18:40.080] bubble i suspect most people have never even heard of the game well if then we're not doing our jobs
[18:40.800 --> 18:49.360] because we are not pr people yeah i am i'm a chill i'm gonna shill so hard for like
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.680] i'm not a pr person until they like offer to pay me money then who knows
[18:55.440 --> 18:57.440] hashtag not an ad but it could be
[18:59.920 --> 19:01.920] yes definitely not an ad yet
[19:06.720 --> 19:14.720] research story um their 0.4 update is out now and it brings the spring and summer festivals
[19:14.720 --> 19:20.480] and a lot of smaller stuff that most people don't care about if you play the game you might
[19:20.480 --> 19:26.640] care about there's a link in the show notes these researchers have very very vivid lives i've got to
[19:26.640 --> 19:39.440] say cody do you have spring and summer festivals who doesn't know at her job i mean totally
[19:39.600 --> 19:40.160] i don't know
[19:44.400 --> 19:46.880] one lonely outposts have released a road map
[19:48.240 --> 19:53.040] and their first update the customization and controller update is out now
[19:54.880 --> 20:00.240] so if you wanted to play it with controller support you can play it now if you were refusing
[20:00.240 --> 20:06.960] to play this game until there was character customization good luck no not good luck good news
[20:07.840 --> 20:16.480] no it's there now good luck still good news is there now also they implemented the calendar i
[20:16.480 --> 20:23.280] don't know how they didn't have a calendar in uh in a farming game that's wild i'll say roots
[20:23.280 --> 20:29.520] apache didn't have a calendar but that's because you had to invent the calendar um yeah but um
[20:30.800 --> 20:35.120] is this is this game actually out has anyone checked it are they just are they just bluffing
[20:37.120 --> 20:41.840] well it's in my library i own it and it's downloaded on my steam deck apparently but
[20:41.840 --> 20:49.120] i haven't okay download without your knowledge it's like malware i think i kickstarted this
[20:49.120 --> 20:56.880] game i i really don't know i lose track right this is okay all right um
[20:59.680 --> 21:05.680] yeah so they've got a roadmap for the rest of their updates as well so there's one coming fall
[21:05.680 --> 21:15.920] 2023 there's one coming winter 2023 one coming early 2024 and one coming 2024 presumably not
[21:15.920 --> 21:24.240] early uh so if you are interested in what's upcoming that will be in the show notes as well
[21:24.240 --> 21:31.600] speaking of things coming soon we've got fae farm which i think comes out and yeah it comes
[21:31.600 --> 21:37.280] on the 8th of september oh that's real soon that's like when people hear this that'll be
[21:37.280 --> 21:42.960] like a week yep yep yep yep um they have released a new trailer their launch trailer

[22:32.480 --> 22:40.000] like there you go it's i'm interested see i feel like fae farm has actually
[22:40.000 --> 22:48.000] been getting push um from my kendo yeah yeah so i'm interested to see if this actually becomes
[22:48.720 --> 22:56.800] a thing and the whole mmo aspect like it's it's i'm applauding them for trying this it's it's
[22:56.800 --> 23:04.080] it's a bold idea um i'm not fan i'm not a fan of the character designs but other than that the
[23:04.080 --> 23:11.040] animations and the visuals in general look very nice um yeah yeah this guy chopping trees and
[23:11.040 --> 23:18.080] he's going full like haymaker circles with his axe it's crazy um all right fae farm well i mean
[23:18.080 --> 23:26.560] soon enough we'll find out get ready for the the harvest season guild and fae farm and we'll see
[23:27.200 --> 23:35.600] i have no idea i really don't we'll see disney dreamlight valley this is a very small piece of
[23:35.600 --> 23:42.480] news they've teased bell bell's coming to the game is that small to you good sir yes yes it is
[23:42.480 --> 23:52.960] bell yep it's the best i love i love image descriptions on the internet so have you
[23:52.960 --> 24:00.240] read the image description on this tweet no i haven't it says bell sits on a bench by a pond
[24:00.240 --> 24:06.400] reading a book in a screenshot from disney dream life valley i mean it's very descriptive that's
[24:06.400 --> 24:14.880] correct and you know what and that's all i need yeah i'll i'll i'm excited to just sit on a bench
[24:14.880 --> 24:22.560] with bell and talk about books that was awesome so if you've really if if the one character you've
[24:22.560 --> 24:29.520] been waiting for is bell those people exist oh and i am a hundred percent sure there are like
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.800] and i and i'm sure there there are quite a few of them right like it's not going to be one you know
[24:34.800 --> 24:41.280] i'm sure there are i'm not personally excited for bell but that's just me that's fine i'm not
[24:41.280 --> 24:52.240] judging anybody i'm judging i like bell all right what's wait what slime rancher they're making a
[24:52.240 --> 25:00.080] movie i know for slime rancher what so slime rancher that game where you are ranching
[25:00.080 --> 25:06.160] ranching and so what is the what would be the verb you would you're you're raising on line
[25:06.160 --> 25:12.560] no ranching's good ranch you're ranching slimes we're not talking about this the hot in stardew
[25:12.560 --> 25:20.880] valley no no no we're talking about the game um they're they're making a a movie about it um
[25:22.240 --> 25:29.280] is there a story in this game i've not actually played it look gran turismo got a movie anything
[25:29.280 --> 25:35.360] is possible right but it wasn't about the game this is the thing it wasn't like animal crossing
[25:35.360 --> 25:45.840] got a movie what oh yeah you didn't know that professor latin has a movie well actually professor
[25:45.840 --> 25:52.720] latin is plot driven so that kind of makes more sense but oh yeah a 2006 japanese animated film
[25:52.720 --> 25:57.440] based on the animal crossing video game series oh yeah i'm not i'm not even going to try and
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.920] pronounce what the title it looks like it wasn't it's what it's the animal crossing movie that's
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.640] all you need that's all you need to look it up it was not released outside of japan it was not but
[26:06.640 --> 26:13.440] you can watch it subtitles i don't know what to say i mean i would watch an animal crossing movie
[26:13.440 --> 26:19.280] if it was um released in in english i don't really i'm not in the mood for
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.960] just no anyway uh it's like you're gonna go watch this slime rancher movie
[26:27.600 --> 26:35.200] well okay what is story kitchen hold on i'm trying to see which one's what story kitchen
[26:35.200 --> 26:39.200] yes story kitchen what are you talking about i'm sorry i'm reading the article
[26:40.160 --> 26:45.200] linked story kitchen is working together with game developer manomi park oh what is story
[26:45.200 --> 26:55.760] kitchen presumably they're a filmmaker well i mean well let's see like are they gonna i want to
[26:55.760 --> 27:04.800] here i i'm curious because like what can i expect company can i expect um you know
[27:05.760 --> 27:12.720] i go robbie to join this this cast they are apparently making a seafood film as well
[27:12.720 --> 27:19.040] what they are seafood kitchen are yeah see see actually seafood would be great for a movie
[27:20.000 --> 27:30.160] um this is wild oh interesting so right okay you're this is this is wild right story kitchen
[27:30.880 --> 27:35.360] is a combination of the writer creator of the john wick franchise
[27:35.360 --> 27:42.800] what the producer of the sonic the hedgehog movie and some rich dude um
[27:44.480 --> 27:52.640] this is actually not a bad pedigree man alive john wick sonic the hedgehog what's not to love
[27:53.520 --> 28:00.480] okay oh no apparently so i'm wrong this this this this the third person is a is a commentator
[28:00.480 --> 28:06.400] apparently oh that's very different from a rich person yeah well i just he was in a suit and i
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.200] didn't recognize him i didn't say what he was so i just assumed he was just a random rich dude
[28:11.200 --> 28:20.240] but apparently he is a an american play-by-play commentator okay like well i mean i don't
[28:20.800 --> 28:27.600] yeah this is that's those are like some decent credits actually to have on your pedigree
[28:28.800 --> 28:37.920] and i will say keanu reeves being in this movie is is more possible than zero now
[28:41.920 --> 28:49.280] oh my word it's just going to be like john wick but with slimes love it love it that'd be amazing
[28:51.200 --> 29:00.480] this is this is why this is why he's ranching slimes to avenge the the pet that died
[29:02.320 --> 29:09.840] i just i don't know what to say oh i'm getting more excited about this oh yeah this is
[29:12.880 --> 29:15.520] sifu's a lot like john wick too actually
[29:15.520 --> 29:25.360] oh they are also making a vampire survivors film oh they're the guys doing the vampire
[29:25.360 --> 29:31.520] they're doing the vampire survivors film oh okay i won't lie i'm excited about this now what game
[29:31.520 --> 29:39.760] are they not basing something on now that's oh i i don't think we've actually seen one of their
[29:39.760 --> 29:44.320] projects come to fruition but no they're pretty new so it looks like it was last year they found
[29:44.320 --> 29:50.160] this company so yeah it's going to be a wee bit before any of them release but but but i'm i won't
[29:50.160 --> 29:58.880] lie i'm i'm excited like i why there will pro they will probably be better than other video game
[29:58.880 --> 30:05.200] movies i will say that yeah well that's not that's not a high bar but what i find what i find really
[30:05.200 --> 30:15.920] interesting is the three that they've decided to to do are sifu vampire survivors and slime rancher
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.200] one of these things is not like the others um it's not the one you think actually
[30:27.440 --> 30:33.280] well it's gonna be better than the assassin's creed movie i can tell you that i never even
[30:33.280 --> 30:38.320] watched that that's fine that's fine look as if as long as it's better than
[30:39.520 --> 30:44.960] oh what was that one with tom holland oh um uncharted yeah uncharted that was
[30:46.240 --> 30:50.320] meh that was probably on the level of assassin's creed i can tell just by looking
[30:52.000 --> 31:00.240] it was fine but it was not great just like assassin's creed those were two hours i spent
[31:00.320 --> 31:03.360] and i guess i spent those two hours watching a movie
[31:05.360 --> 31:11.600] that's my review that's quite exciting for the slime rancher movie well i'm gonna watch it
[31:12.160 --> 31:17.200] let's not pretend yo for sure i'm probably gonna watch all three of these at some point
[31:18.480 --> 31:27.040] um but okay so sifu one thousand percent could be live i mean do you know what sifu is
[31:27.120 --> 31:31.440] the sifu one is live action yeah okay yes because that's just kung fu
[31:31.440 --> 31:36.320] mood the mood it's a kung fu mood that's all it is i believe the vampire survivors one is animated
[31:36.320 --> 31:42.560] uh i don't know but it could be live action my point i'm trying to make here slime rancher how
[31:42.560 --> 31:49.360] would you do that live action what did that mean yeah the vampire survivors one is animated and
[31:49.360 --> 31:57.520] the sifu one is live action this is one that is both shockingly uh i don't it doesn't yeah it
[31:57.520 --> 32:02.160] doesn't say it doesn't say it's probably gonna be animated i'm i'm just messing it's probably
[32:02.160 --> 32:10.000] gonna be animated um i'd be i don't know i think it could be either how would you well you you
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.840] okay you're gonna cgn all the slime i understand that but like what what does it look like because
[32:15.840 --> 32:20.640] slime right i hold on let me double check slime rancher is like cutesy isn't it yeah it is they
[32:20.640 --> 32:25.600] look like the juveniles or whatever so you could you could have quite a weird contrast between the
[32:25.600 --> 32:31.120] the the surroundings and the the person the player character that ends up being in the game
[32:31.120 --> 32:37.600] and then there's the cg cutesy slime bouncing around this realistic environment it would be
[32:37.600 --> 32:45.120] weird but i love it or do they just lean into it and make them like serious like faceless
[32:45.120 --> 32:52.960] monstrosities oh no it's the um the is it the thing is that the no the blob the blob the blob
[32:52.960 --> 32:59.280] oh the blob the blob that's a very different thing like come on i just the blob is what i'm
[32:59.280 --> 33:03.520] thinking no no i'm just saying that would be oh that'd be something to make the movie with that
[33:05.200 --> 33:12.000] with the oh my goodness wait hold on i'm talking about slime ranch but i don't remember the last
[33:12.000 --> 33:18.720] time i actually looked at it this thing's a first-person shooter yeah okay oh well okay
[33:18.720 --> 33:23.440] makes more sense well shoot you're not really shooting i think the the thing you're holding
[33:23.440 --> 33:31.920] like moves this the slimes around it's a vacuum gun yeah well that'll well hey it's like a tractor
[33:32.800 --> 33:37.600] yeah this will be interesting to see um
[33:39.920 --> 33:46.320] i didn't wow i didn't think we'd cover a movie on this show well wow this is wild i love it
[33:47.360 --> 33:54.400] speaking of wild things you didn't expect you'd see bungee are apparently making a life sim game
[33:54.400 --> 34:06.560] okay so do with that what you want i you know bungee bungee the um the the destiny yeah they're
[34:06.560 --> 34:12.000] the destiny and halo some of the halos did they take over halo they didn't do the first halos did
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.120] they did halo 3 i think i don't i don't i never i've never played any of these games anyway they
[34:17.120 --> 34:21.280] have they have released a bunch of information about a bunch of their games in incubation and
[34:21.360 --> 34:26.640] he said one of our favorite incubation projects is a team-based action game inspired by several
[34:26.640 --> 34:33.440] genres in a brand new science fantasy universe it draws inspiration from right this is a crazy list
[34:33.440 --> 34:41.520] oh my goodness fighting games platformers mobas life sims and frog type games wrapped up in a
[34:41.520 --> 34:47.200] light-hearted comedic world i think like frogger that's what i assume but who calls it a frog type
[34:47.760 --> 34:54.880] i guess not to get sued by the frogger people what well it's either that or maybe it's like a
[34:55.680 --> 35:02.240] typing game with frogs i'm okay i'm trying to think what these categories what they add up to be
[35:03.280 --> 35:09.200] it's like you're crossing a road but it's 3d so there's vertical platforms too
[35:10.240 --> 35:16.480] but it's also heavily combat because it's a moba i've come across i searched for frog type on
[35:16.480 --> 35:22.080] google to see if anybody had any idea of what that means and there's a games radar article
[35:22.080 --> 35:27.360] which is bungee's next secret game is finally out in the open it's team-based sci-fi and whatever
[35:27.360 --> 35:41.040] frog type means oh oh they are definitely um is this frog fractions too i think they must mean
[35:41.040 --> 35:47.120] frogger that's that's what i'm assuming like but i don't know how that builds into everything how
[35:47.120 --> 35:56.240] does that work like none of this though it could be for a life sim platformer frogger game like
[35:56.240 --> 36:02.720] i don't ever i can kind of actually make a game with the other ones until you throw life sim
[36:02.720 --> 36:08.720] i don't i just i i really look forward to seeing what what on earth they're talking about right
[36:08.720 --> 36:17.440] and we're just this is wild it's a team-based game so you're you're what life sim games are
[36:17.440 --> 36:26.080] team-based unless they mean life sim like spore where you're generating life no i mean they are
[36:26.080 --> 36:33.200] specifically saying like life sim is a pretty standard term like and i know i mean my only
[36:33.200 --> 36:41.520] thinking is maybe like maybe these are these maybe these aren't all the same thing at the
[36:41.520 --> 36:48.560] same time so it's like you know how you you would describe say um it's just cult of the lamb well
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.280] this is what i'm thinking so cult of the lamb right when you initially talk about what it is
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.080] makes no sense until you think about the fact that it's essentially two different parts of a game
[36:58.080 --> 37:04.480] yes there are two games since well well it's well it's two concepts of games put really nicely
[37:04.480 --> 37:12.880] together it somehow works but makes no sense when you think about it sure so let's do the same so
[37:12.880 --> 37:18.800] it's not presumably it's not going to be life sim frogger at the same time right like it's not going
[37:18.800 --> 37:23.600] to be the same screen and you're playing a life sim game in the style of frogger that's not going
[37:23.600 --> 37:32.960] to happen you don't you don't know look no you're right i don't know i i have no idea i'm just
[37:32.960 --> 37:41.200] trying to figure out like the rest of the world and the part that just it's bungee who's making
[37:41.200 --> 37:46.880] this the destiny people what will it look like yep this is what i'm this is what i'm like is it
[37:46.880 --> 37:52.320] is it going to be like because the frogger would imply it's top down the the moba would imply it's
[37:52.320 --> 37:58.080] kind of top downness as well like the the fighting game you don't really tend to get like
[37:58.080 --> 38:03.840] top down fighting games though do you platformer would imply at least side on or if it's 3d you
[38:03.840 --> 38:08.720] know that you certainly wouldn't expect top down for a platformer like i don't know what's happening
[38:08.720 --> 38:16.880] here light-hearted comedic world i can bungee do that is there anything in their portfolio that
[38:16.880 --> 38:23.120] shows they know what that looks like i'm super excited to see what this is oh my gosh between
[38:23.120 --> 38:31.200] this and the slime rancher movie oh my for me we've lost the reins on on not just this episode
[38:31.200 --> 38:40.720] on the genre what on earth is going on well let's go to something a little bit more sane is it
[38:41.440 --> 38:49.040] pumpkin panic this is a new game it's out now explore this little farm in the middle of the
[38:49.040 --> 38:56.560] forest plant crops you're already oh i'm in take take care of the plants go fishing or whatever
[38:56.560 --> 39:02.720] you prefer but have a good time but be careful they say that strange things are happening in
[39:02.720 --> 39:15.600] the area i mean like it's your character is looks like the horror villain serial killer guy you're
[39:15.600 --> 39:23.920] wearing a pumpkin mask is that a mask or is it a face i i don't know either way and everything's
[39:23.920 --> 39:36.320] like this dusk lighting sort of thing and you it's i don't oh oh gosh this clearly like they're
[39:36.320 --> 39:40.720] showing only cutesy images but there's clearly something horrifying that will happen in this game
[39:40.720 --> 39:46.720] oh yeah somebody let kelly know she's gonna love this oh she already knows we're talking about it
[39:46.720 --> 39:52.000] don't don't you worry we're talking about it hey i'm feeling what we're i know we're gonna talk
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.800] about this year for halloween don't don't don't you be assuming things don't you be assuming
[39:58.800 --> 40:05.600] things um also you it's out and you can just get it for whatever you want question mark price they
[40:05.600 --> 40:13.520] say name your price yeah it's right there it is website it is name your price on itch go go give
[40:13.520 --> 40:21.440] that creator money if you can't afford it go go play it and and and uh share it it looks wild
[40:21.440 --> 40:27.040] the average play time is 40 to 60 minutes it says so you don't need weeks to play this game
[40:28.000 --> 40:39.040] and it has controller support okay i'm watching this trailer like i there's the shift like i mean
[40:39.040 --> 40:46.800] it's what you expect but they that shift goes hard the tone shift i mean like you first of all
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.800] you're holding the red balloon from it it's clearly the red balloon from it and then it
[40:52.800 --> 40:59.440] ends with the shadowy person but like crawling like golem chasing you it's oh yeah i love how
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.560] i love how you're like walking around your farm in the dark with your little lantern as well yeah
[41:05.200 --> 41:12.800] like i yeah no it's great oh this this feels like real scary game oh i'm not i don't like it
[41:12.960 --> 41:20.480] um oh that create that shadowy creature oh my word it's just and it's because they change
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.600] uh first it has like some music like yeah all right that's music and then they cut to like
[41:25.600 --> 41:32.800] staticky sound and it's it's not great i don't like it oh this is definitely cottage gore um
[41:32.800 --> 41:42.640] oh yeah oh yeah wow wow what a this is gonna be more saying it does not look more sick
[41:43.680 --> 41:52.480] oh okay so shall we continue the wildness of this episode i see the name okay i just want to say the
[41:52.480 --> 41:58.960] name of the next entry is called mobberville and my new reaction at the the rate we're going i
[41:58.960 --> 42:10.000] thought this was some sort of mafia wrong kind of wrong kind of mob all right unfortunately no no
[42:10.000 --> 42:17.520] no no not unfortunately so this is mob as in like you know like the villains and games
[42:18.240 --> 42:27.280] yeah the so help the mobs rebuild their homes so this is presumably like after
[42:28.880 --> 42:34.960] after someone has gone through this that the hero has gone through and destroyed everything you're
[42:34.960 --> 42:43.120] trying to help the monsters rebuild their village i like this idea i'm looking at the video though
[42:43.120 --> 42:52.960] i'm not particularly fond of the execution yeah and i'm not see if i saw this trailer
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.600] that you tell me the description i thought oh this looks like a nice little farming s game
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.240] because you're farming and building things my biggest complaint is the the guy doesn't look
[43:02.240 --> 43:08.320] like a mob he just looks like a guy yeah your your player character looks pretty generic and
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.600] i wonder whether there might be character customization at some point to look like
[43:11.600 --> 43:18.160] different there is the trailer shows you can like get little goblin ears or you can get a wheelchair
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.520] so there is some type of customization but just when when you say mob you know like
[43:24.400 --> 43:32.160] again creeper like minecraft that's probably one of the most uh prolific uses of the word
[43:32.640 --> 43:40.320] where all the things that aren't uh the character called mobs the villagers the yes minecraft so
[43:40.320 --> 43:48.240] eudex the creepers the whatever so you'd expect something that looks not maybe human or yeah or
[43:48.240 --> 43:52.960] i don't know something more like oh this is clearly a monster guy or whatever anyways
[43:52.960 --> 43:59.040] um but that said uh the game actually looks nice once you get over um past that disconnect i'm
[43:59.040 --> 44:07.200] having um it's an interesting stat it's unlike it it's an interesting mix of like some things
[44:07.200 --> 44:14.640] look kind of realistic some things don't there's some parts are kind of like very samey colors
[44:14.640 --> 44:20.400] some parts are quite vibrant it's an interesting mix of things i'm yes unsure of how i feel about
[44:20.400 --> 44:29.360] it all it almost looks cell shaded at times i would say yeah i like it i don't know it's
[44:29.360 --> 44:37.280] interesting i guess people look at it i i'm fond of the again the main character design not the
[44:37.280 --> 44:45.840] notwithstanding i like the look of this game a lot actually um but work with me here just imagine
[44:45.840 --> 44:53.520] this game same premise but you're in the mafia i'm telling you there's there's something there
[44:53.520 --> 45:02.880] life sim mafia game is that what you're saying i mean yeah you're the you're in the mob but
[45:02.880 --> 45:08.640] you're not like one of the the you're not one of the goons you're the guy who who like runs the
[45:08.640 --> 45:12.880] office you're there you gotta feed the mob
[45:16.720 --> 45:18.960] why are we talking about a digimon next now
[45:21.520 --> 45:28.320] chronomon this is our final news item for the episode thank goodness for that chronomon
[45:28.320 --> 45:34.320] a monster taming rpg farm sim you guys think i'm joking but google it there is a digimon named
[45:34.320 --> 45:44.480] chronomon chronomon a monster catching rpg sim on your pc slash mobile slash wear os smartwatch
[45:44.480 --> 45:52.640] a truly cross-platform game you can get this on my tesla in my tesla while not driving i kid you
[45:52.640 --> 46:04.080] not they have a version of this game for android watches oh yeah i just saw it look anytime you
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.000] talk monster catching right like of course you're gonna look at the monster designs i just saw
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.800] dragonair that was just a dragon that was a pokemon i haven't looked i still haven't looked
[46:14.800 --> 46:20.560] at it despite you saying it let's have a look but the trick the trick is you can make them very close
[46:20.560 --> 46:25.680] to pokemon because when you're playing on your apple watch or your android watch whatever you
[46:25.680 --> 46:32.960] can't actually see they're too small that's how they get you yeah oh wow that's just pokemon grass
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.440] that is just pokemon grass i mean how different can you make grass look let's be honest
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.160] uh yeah i'm fine i'll give them that but like are you playing as a beehive i think there's a beehive
[46:44.160 --> 46:52.720] mon um why not yeah then like that's a good idea i like it um so you excited to play this on your
[46:52.720 --> 46:57.840] apple watch or fitbit whatever i don't know how those things work i know i don't do star wars
[46:57.840 --> 47:04.400] watches i really don't know like i'm presuming that the watch version is a pretty it's like a
[47:04.400 --> 47:10.000] tamagotchi type thing surely it's not like the full game you know what if it is though i mean
[47:10.560 --> 47:19.200] look people have done wilder things yeah that's true i oh it's kickstarter i missed this
[47:20.720 --> 47:24.800] it's kickstarter i was watching the video i didn't look where i was yeah so oh wow they oh
[47:24.880 --> 47:30.320] it's done you can back this project it's two weeks left but we're done both chronomon and
[47:30.320 --> 47:36.400] mobberville are on kickstarter right now chronomon is has hit its goal um
[47:39.600 --> 47:45.040] mobberville has not uh and i suspect probably won't but um
[47:46.480 --> 47:53.040] which is shame because i think mobberville looks like a better game yeah um so
[47:53.680 --> 47:59.920] oh yeah oh i just i didn't oh okay let me put reference
[48:00.720 --> 48:07.520] marvel only has 200 bucks out of a 25 000 goal they have two roughly the same amount of times
[48:07.520 --> 48:15.760] chronomon oh that's rough which stinks because it's a real shame when someone has like this
[48:15.760 --> 48:21.440] great idea that they want to do and they love making games and they can't do it but oh my heart
[48:21.520 --> 48:26.960] look but this is what we're here for we're influencers yeah go back the game if you want it
[48:27.760 --> 48:29.360] or even if you don't go but go back
[48:32.640 --> 48:35.840] oh look it's like me and any of greg's kickstarters
[48:39.600 --> 48:46.480] i don't want it but i want to support it look look look greg greg listen to the show
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.280] i don't think he does i don't think he does but i don't think he does but i'm sure i've told him
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.240] before look it's fine i backed his latest one and i'm just and i backed it for the highest one
[48:56.240 --> 49:02.480] to get the the the hard hard cover one it's like i'm not going to use that but it's okay
[49:02.480 --> 49:08.960] because i'll give it to someone i know who plays um uh ttrpgs i i'm just not a ttrpg
[49:08.960 --> 49:13.120] kind of person yeah there's nothing wrong with backing something that you're not going to use
[49:13.200 --> 49:19.520] yourself just to support a friend yeah so with that go go as we talk
[49:19.520 --> 49:23.440] as we're on the chrono mod news item the takeaway is go back momerville
[49:25.040 --> 49:30.000] i don't know what the takeaway is what is the takeaway what does online
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.440] leaderboards mean that's the next stretch goal kevin i don't know but we're already
[49:35.440 --> 49:39.280] nearly an hour into this episode and we've not even introduced the interview yet
[49:39.280 --> 49:44.960] it's been it's and half the time you've just been wondering what these news items are
[49:46.400 --> 49:55.120] what does all this mean so that's the news we're just about to go into the interview
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.640] but before we do because kevin and ray finish off the podcast in the interview
[50:00.640 --> 50:07.600] um we've got a few things to plug before that yes so kevin you've got a new thing so the new thing
[50:07.600 --> 50:15.520] i've been doing um so um our mutual friend alex uh has toyed i don't half jokingly half seriously
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.040] it's now full seriously because he's finally done it um he has done he has started a new podcast
[50:21.040 --> 50:27.040] called uh rainbow road radio dedicated to all things uh mario mario however you want to say
[50:27.040 --> 50:33.680] it and call it um i am on said podcast we are i think the we're going to record like the eighth
[50:33.680 --> 50:40.080] by the time this comes out the eighth episode will be out uh you can follow it at rainbow
[50:40.720 --> 50:46.320] road pod i believe let me double check that good good job me good good job shilling um

[50:54.000 --> 51:01.040] um but uh or you can find me at koopa prez or at spider squared yes rainbow road pod is the the
[51:01.040 --> 51:10.240] handle that he goes by on on twitter i don't i don't 100 it's been kind of a warm-up period for
[51:10.240 --> 51:16.080] us um so you know we're still figuring things out feeling it out and whatnot so we're gonna probably
[51:16.080 --> 51:20.720] formalize and get better at shilling and what he's been keeping on the down low intentionally
[51:20.720 --> 51:27.440] um but uh if you want links to the episodes feel free to look up there or message me at koopa

[52:09.600 --> 52:14.880] not finally being able to chill here on the harp season because uh uh big news in the gaming world
[52:14.880 --> 52:19.680] i'm sure everyone has heard about charles martin a the voice of mario for 30 plus years has just
[52:19.680 --> 52:26.000] retired so yeah that will actually be the next covered on the next episode so definitely a good
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.160] time to jump in um you know feel free to go back to the earlier episodes they tend they're they're
[52:32.160 --> 52:37.280] not maybe probably not even as news heavy as harvest season here um it's all minor news so
[52:37.280 --> 52:42.560] you can go back we cover games and and topics and things so it's it's pretty go back to easy to
[52:42.560 --> 52:49.600] listen to um so yes uh shout outs to alex for that he's the real dude who does the editing of

[53:49.440 --> 53:57.040] like it well why not you gotta be somewhere why not tumblr you know um twitter's a dumpster fire
[53:57.040 --> 54:05.360] now but tumblr at least has years of being a dumpster fire not run by one single egomaniac um
[54:07.440 --> 54:11.920] yeah go to the patreon give me money please it'd be great yes i love doing this and it'd be great
[54:11.920 --> 54:17.760] to do it more and you can hear the special secret show yeah we don't know what the next episode is
[54:17.760 --> 54:21.600] going to be because i've not really thought about it but there will be one at some point lots of
[54:21.600 --> 54:27.440] extra content there probably and if not go back and listen to the other ones because they're all
[54:27.440 --> 54:32.720] good and they're not news related so they're very easy to listen to almost all of them are
[54:32.720 --> 54:39.280] completely outside of time except with we cover basically every like nintendo direct and pokemon
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.560] and stuff like that some of them will be dated but they're still fun especially if you go listen
[54:44.560 --> 54:49.760] to the ones where we try and predict what's going to happen exactly i don't see how long we were
[54:49.760 --> 54:54.400] they are such fun to listen to because normally i end up editing them or or something like just
[54:54.400 --> 54:59.280] that there was one where i recorded we recorded the day before and i didn't edit for like two
[54:59.280 --> 55:06.960] weeks or something so that was fun to edit but anyway look i was obviously joking and speaking
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.080] in hyperbole that we didn't get katy perry as the champion of the cinno remakes but we could
[55:12.080 --> 55:19.120] have at least gotten a reference in scarlet and violet just a hint come on pokemon that is the
[55:19.120 --> 55:25.840] biggest problem with that game you know what if you want to go hear lots of thoughts on that on
[55:25.840 --> 55:30.720] squirrel and violet go go check out the patreon there is one episode in there somewhere where it's
[55:30.720 --> 55:36.960] just johnny and kevin complaining about the games and we need to do a follow-up so we can complain
[55:36.960 --> 55:44.640] more we had an let's wait for the dlc oh there you go there you go all right so there's the
[55:44.720 --> 55:50.640] plugs or is that it was there anything else al i think that's everything upcoming we have an
[55:50.640 --> 56:01.040] interview from well kevin was intro interviewing ray what's his name chase chase chase
[56:01.040 --> 56:10.240] interviewing ray chase um one of the voice voice actors in wildflowers do you want to give any more
[56:10.240 --> 56:16.400] information about it or him or like has he you say he's quite a prolific voice actor is he
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.640] voice acted anything i would have known um you may not have played it but he voice acted noctus

[56:28.240 --> 56:34.080] yes right like even everyone knows what a final fantasy is i have heard of a final fantasy if you
[56:34.080 --> 56:41.120] voice acted the protagonist of a final fantasy that's yep that's a big deal so okay so that's
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.920] that's a starting point there's a good number of other things i'm trying to think of what you would
[56:45.920 --> 56:52.080] know al um there's an anime he's in games ray chase um i suggest you guys just look at his

[59:21.280 --> 59:29.760] this interview that kevin did with ray literally i think like four months ago yeah okay that i want
[59:29.760 --> 59:37.200] to put an asterisk yes we've recorded this interview a hot minute ago um and due to several
[59:37.200 --> 59:42.800] reasons it took a while for us to get it out and get it ready um so with that there is a small
[59:42.800 --> 59:48.560] asterisk that some of the information is uh maybe a little outdated some of this stuff is out now
[59:48.560 --> 59:55.520] and more importantly um uh i i show a stream he does called lava um it's like a weekly stream they
[59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.640] are no longer weekly sadly they do live action shows it's like a comedy troupe thing um so
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.440] unfortunately but uh still check them out you can follow them all that stuff will be covered in the
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:13.680] interview um but yes uh oh oh and one one more important thing i forgot to tell right during
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.800] when i actually talked to him um so i this is big special thanks to ray of course for being on the
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:28.720] show but absolutely the reason the only reason i look twice at wildflowers was because i heard ray

[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:38.720] off by talking about the reason we bought you into the show the flimsy excuse i was able to get
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:49.840] to get you on here um wild flowers um so you play wesley who is a werewolf um how did that happen
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:57.440] how'd you end up playing a werewolf what's the history here so wild flowers so full disclosure
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:05.360] yes i worked on this game i have not played this game before that's fine uh valerie um
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.640] the voice of terra who i've sat down with also has not played she hasn't played it she's the
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.240] main character yeah gotta play a game if you're the main character i always try to do that
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:26.560] um okay let's see i auditioned in march of 2021 for the characters of angus oh yeah they didn't
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.320] use code there's a code name for the project which i won't reveal because why not it might
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.760] ever come out again uh the code name is not wildflowers it's something else random word
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.040] um and uh auditioned for angus seaton who must be a character in the game yes example actors
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.320] they're looking for seth rogan or jonah hill uh usually i pass on those yep i didn't do that
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.160] i don't have a voice that uh i do a lot of different voices but i can never play
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.000] big friendly dude i can play big mean dude but i just don't have that timbre to be like
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.560] i'm a large man and i'm friendly i just don't have it uh i also did but i did audition for
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.960] reverend christopher connor they were looking for bradley cooper in the hangover or chris
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:16.320] evans in knives out i gave him oh he's like a uh he's like a church guy yeah these are such
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:23.120] strange descriptions for the characters well sometimes i mean some so many times um the
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.240] the the breakdowns they they that they think they're looking for something and then an actor
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.600] will come and give them something completely different they go oh that's exactly what we're
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:38.080] looking for okay so i got wesley vook um it says wildflowers is a gentle paced game where players
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:42.640] get to master the arts of becoming a witch manage and grow their own farm and come to know and love
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:47.360] the characters of fairhaven in a deep play at your own pace character driven story that spans
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:55.200] a year would you say that's accurate yep that is yeah pretty much on point to the game wesley is uh
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:05.440] male age 35 werewolf half russian half tlingit accent alaskan north canadian example actors
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:12.400] martin sends meyer and anton yelchin in odd thomas uh so they were looking for a russian
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:19.760] accent yeah okay intellectual dapper polite and curious unlike the other residents of ravenwood
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.200] hollow wesley wasn't born faye he grew up in a small town of alaska and got a college scholarship
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.280] that took him to anchorage this is all true i think but after a terrible accident in the woods
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.120] wesley discovered that he became a wolf during the full moon wesley collected every bit of
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.200] information he could find traveling to many remote places to try to cure his lycanthropy
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.840] there was no cure eventually wesley found himself in ravenwood hollow where he made a home for
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.680] himself among the other fans set up shop as a bookseller wesley would like nothing more than
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.880] to run a normal bookstore for normal humans but he's also grown attached to the fae he lives with
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:56.960] now plus the humans in fairhaven who he visits when he's not in wolf form um and uh it looks
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:04.240] like he's got three little lines and uh i assume that i did a russian accent right right which is
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.320] interesting because he does not have one in game yeah so i did it so i'm listening on my computer
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:16.080] it sounds like i do has wood based paper breaks down over time it releases lignin which smells
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:23.440] like vanilla i just love that fact that's kind of what i did for him okay uh amazingly that got me
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:32.320] a call back a few months later many months later and uh oh no it was a directed callback so uh
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.200] that's pretty rare in the business where they say hey we're we're gonna do or no i'm sorry
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.640] so that's not rare uh callbacks are usually directed i'm thinking of like uh when they change
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:49.440] the uh when they change the specs which it looks like they said no more russian uh they want to do
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:57.280] a uh they usually it's like a requested redo or something uh but this is a callback uh and yes
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:03.200] it looks like we are no longer doing uh any russian accents or anything like that so
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.240] oh wait why did i do a russian accent is that i'm thinking now because actually it did say
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.760] alaska north canadian in the original script huh so i guess i looked up anton yelchin and odd
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:24.800] thomas or martin sensemeyer why did i don't know yeah i wonder why i did russian um i guess i
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:34.880] said today i'm making a strong choice uh and then i did uh let's see i don't have a recording of my
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.160] uh i don't have a recording of my callback alas but it must have been i gave it the wesley voice
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:48.720] that we all know and love there it is and uh then it took uh a week to get an offer i did this all
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:59.680] remote because this was right in the smackzag of of covid august 2021 and uh i got to work on a
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:06.480] couple of sessions with this and um the director was chrissy abajos who's super super fun definitely
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:12.400] one of those directors who's very passionate about their job and really really cares about
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:19.040] um uh making the project as good as possible uh she's an absolute blast to work with an actor
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:26.560] herself um so she's really good at communicating and uh and just uh just a dream and um worked on
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.920] that a couple sessions and then uh slowly been doing more for all the uh updates the marriage
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:38.240] updates that had been coming along which is fun so it's a gift that keeps on giving yeah certainly
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:46.640] um yeah um yeah valerie talked about the voice director and this their first job as director
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.240] i think when they just knocked it out the park because it's yeah fantastic fantastic work all
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:10:01.440] around 100 okay so let's talk about wesley himself i like obviously the bias here but
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:11.760] um i still think wesley is one of the best written characters in the game um and you know
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:17.440] there's lots of other great character arcs but just he's aware right which is a fantasy situation
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:24.160] but he's dealing with this isolation and parts of his identity he's not comfortable with and
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.880] you know those are very real relatable issues um and still even with that he's intelligent and kind
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:39.600] and just all around great so how did you you know find his voice or fit in the role like would you
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.400] do anything to find inspiration or anything like that well i'm was highly aware of the genre of
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:53.040] game that we're doing that this is a stardew valley type cozy game and uh i really wanted
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:59.280] i really wanted wesley to be as cozy as possible um even though he's a werewolf he's a lot more
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:09.200] like a teddy bear so um i was was playing a gentle guy with a gentle voice and uh and making him as
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.400] as cozy and lovable and huggable as possible so that was a lot of where it came from especially
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:24.640] with his lines how positive he is certainly all the time and very um loathe to say anything bad
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:34.000] about anything um i'm trying to find if i have any scripts yes i do yeah he's just always happy
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.280] even saying oh my heart yes you just took my breath away he's always he's always happy and
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:48.720] excited uh and um and i love that about him yeah um yeah that's uh that's a lot so even though he
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:56.720] has like that backstory where he's a little bit um where he's a little bit uh out of sorts and
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.280] there's you know plot elements where things are getting messed up in the community that they live
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:10.240] in um uh he's uh at the end he's always going to be gentle and always uh always a good guy yeah
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:16.480] yeah um fantastic fantastic performance ray um hearing that like it makes a lot of sense the
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:24.880] teddy bear um because yeah that's clearly what he comes across as um whether human or wolf four um
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:34.800] that's that's really neat to know um let's see here oh so but you've seen your character at
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:43.760] this point i'm sure um yes he is a dapper dapper fellow like good heavens i fanned myself when he
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:53.920] came onto the game okay i've i've got to know if was the design like that from the beginning
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:01.920] because i for people who don't know ray he's been known to sport a quite lovely beard and facial
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.320] hair throughout himself right so yeah in the in the original audition they had final character art
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.920] so wow i knew exactly what they were getting into wow because i i could have sworn they were
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:25.760] taking inspiration from you from me oh no that's uh oh that's interesting um that is cool um do
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:34.480] you have any favorite moments or lines from your uh wesley's story and whatnot um i like the ones
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:41.280] where he uh i i don't know i i because the marriage is out right right right yes i i think
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:49.120] it's really fun uh doing those lines um where he's he's just so polite always um even when things are
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:57.680] out of out of sorts uh there's um uh yeah there's there's the the him hanging around the house and
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.480] just being so happy all the time and saying he loves uh his wife so much uh just gives me a lot
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.640] of joy it's uh it's so easy to do those uh lines and so much fun and it's better than doing combat
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:17.600] lines or crazy stuff uh instead just saying i was just getting lost in your eyes it's it's really
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:25.200] good it yeah um yeah fantastic choice first pass for that reason alone um i love the just the way
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:37.040] says dear sweetheart sweetheart yeah um yeah fantastic work on that um let's see here so
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.440] uh okay so you haven't gotten to play the game yet um which i recommend i think it's really
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:49.600] fantastic but have you played other types of farming games like you said you know it's a
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.760] stardew valley you played other cozy type of games like that for sure i i played harvest moon
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:02.640] back on gameboy um i played stardew valley um the life sim kind of games are there
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:11.280] uh never played the sims actual sims yeah um i haven't either yeah i mean this is a what is
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:17.760] this podcast is like farming type games yeah so you must know more than just these right what are
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.920] right ones yeah so the genre that we've kind of settled on is called cottagecore
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:31.360] cottagecore nice that's the kind of the genre and yeah so like stardew and harvest moon were
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.840] where we started in farming type games but you know it's really blown up in the past
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:44.560] couple of years since stardew we've got what was it bear and breakfast where you play as a bear
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.880] running a bed and breakfast ah beautiful yeah there's uh a stardew corn that just came out
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.880] called roots of pacha which is set in the stone age which was really fun um cool yeah so yeah
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:07.440] it's it's it's really blossomed and it's fun to see um and you know one of the i still think i
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.240] talk about wildflowers a lot on the show since i played it because i think it just really stands
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:20.720] out um you one of the honors you guys have is this is the first i think cottagecore game of
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:27.680] any kind that has been voice acted and you know fully voice acted oh i guess you're right yeah
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:35.200] yeah all those other ones are more pixely or um that yeah that's uh yeah that that not voice
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.160] actor even the harvest moons yeah since the antenna 64 didn't have any yeah acting right
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:47.600] yeah no no day so yeah it's and it's it's so nice because so many of these games are
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.400] character driven a lot of times because they have a little relationships and whatnot and
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:59.520] just hearing the performances you guys give all these little nuances and tone and and
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.080] the rhythm how you guys talk it's it's just adds so much to the characters um it's it's really
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:15.600] awesome to see great to hear a game come to life like this um but yeah so that uh so it's cool to
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.320] see that you have played some other ones are you playing any stuff right now in particular the
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:26.880] other product core or otherwise uh i mean it's sort of a relaxing sim type game but i've been
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:34.960] playing through death stranding um it's a wonderful game uh i i played a little when it came out and
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.240] then got too busy but now i have a little bit of extra time at night sometimes and uh i'll play
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:47.040] that one and it is super it's a chill game there's some combat obviously and stuff but uh it's it's a
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:53.520] really nice meditative game where you're slowly you know just like a cottage core game making
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:59.280] the places around you better and uh it feels really nice oh i hadn't thought about that but
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:06.640] yeah it is it is like that isn't it you're building up the environment the setting yeah
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.560] it is yeah like a lot of these cottage core games yeah exactly little norman redis and his funky
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:22.560] fetus um yes so let's see here um what about well i know you're a voice actor and nda's a
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.520] monk but is there anything you want to talk about that maybe recently came out that you know about
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.960] or something you're excited about something like that a video game i'm excited about or anything
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.840] like that that you worked on any of your projects um what just came out it is so hard because we're
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:49.360] never notified when that stuff happens um uh i don't know uh what the heck am i in um i don't
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.120] think anything cool oh i mean what just came out we just saw murder mystery 2 that was really fun
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.960] yeah i got to narrate on that that was awesome uh what a pleasure so that was that was something
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.840] sure if i sit down with my handy dandy uh excel spreadsheet of all the things i've done i'll be
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:13.280] able to go like oh yeah this came out but um not always sure that's fine um yeah for people who
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:20.240] listeners who might not know murder mystery 2 is a bona fide motion picture uh with adam sandler
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:27.840] and jennifer aniston yeah that's right um so congrats on that that was cool to hear um and
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:35.920] on that topic like this is well as far as i know like the fourth big picture film you've been on
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.480] you've been on a number of them now how what is that like how's that different from your typical
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:47.120] voice acting gig uh i mean it is uh it is wild everybody's uh works differently and the the
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:55.200] director really really matters um it's uh it's it's crazy it's crazy those those things i did
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:01.280] i did malignant got to play gabriel uh worked with james won and in licorice pizza i got to work with
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:08.960] paul thomas anderson um it was uh it's it's wild you're just grateful and um you're so excited to
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.480] go to work and so excited to work on these things um the the auditions for those are few and far
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:20.320] between but they're really really worth it uh every every step of the way uh if you if you
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:29.040] book one of those you've you just feel great um well i can imagine it's it's so cool to hear um
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.000] pass it in those unlike licorice pizza you had a genuine on-screen character for that one i i
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.720] haven't seen it myself so i don't know how much but it was cool to see you actually in the film
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:47.680] itself it was cool uh that was uh it was a voiceover only audition um just a voice match
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.400] and then they asked me a few months later can you grow a mustache because maybe we want to do this
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:01.120] role on camera and i said yes i can and then uh then covet happened it got delayed a bit but um
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:07.280] i grew my hair out grew the mustache and uh i got to be on set for a day it was awesome that's cool
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:19.200] so so that's where the mustache came from yeah um oh that is fascinating um let's see here uh so
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.560] okay so that's all you know career stuff but what else have you been up to um on your free time or
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:31.440] any interest you want to talk about well um as you might know uh from following lava we're making a
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:38.160] video game and um directing it so i've got a lot on my plate the um that is essentially my full
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:43.520] time job right now along with voice acting and going to conventions so uh it's been it's been
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:49.280] busy it's been stressful but i really hope that ultimately uh it's it's worth it when this game
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:56.240] comes out because it's uh it's a special one yeah i mean certainly like uh i assume max and robbie
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:05.280] from bla bla are also working on it absolutely they are yeah yeah so i like i for people who
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:12.800] haven't seen it they're these three are comedic improv geniuses and i can't wait and they have a
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.640] long history in anime video games so they know all the junk that we're into um i'm very excited to
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:24.160] see thanks kevin we're definitely definitely making this game uh our fans are our target
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.760] audience i think you guys will get a kick out of it um it will i i'm not going to say a lot
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:37.680] about it but it's not going to be a gory first person shooter that's for sure oh that'd be
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:44.880] something um okay i know it's still under wraps you guys have been pretty pretty good about that
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:53.280] do we have any eta on when we can see it general spitball idea i know when it when it's uh we're
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:59.280] aiming for release but i uh am not at liberty to say unfortunately um but we are i will say
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:05.200] this we are on schedule um uh since we got since we got uh funded and uh we've been working with
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.960] our publisher um we haven't had any hiccups in the schedule so getting milestone to milestone
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:16.240] we're doing okay so definitely not and definitely at this point not the kind of game that's going
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.920] to be delayed by a year we are on track yeah no um and that's that's probably for the better
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:31.600] um yes i i can uh i can uh relate for sure yeah um one of the hallmarks of the cottagecore genre is
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:42.480] a very significant portion of them are riddi gogo crowdfunded etc and boy um our delays a common
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.720] thing absolutely even though this is our first game our publisher that we're with is uh uh
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:54.720] long standing and uh able to give us a lot of advice along the way oh that's that's exciting
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:01.840] um yeah but yeah no good good on you um yeah i'm very interested to see that okay let's let's step
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:06.720] back in time a little again some of the listeners might not be familiar with some of your past work
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:13.920] what are some of your favorite roles from the past um for voice acting um i loved uh doing
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:21.200] noctis um he means a lot to me that was uh main carrot guy in final fantasy 15 16 is coming out
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:28.640] next month which is exciting um and uh that would that one really stood stood out uh because we
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:35.920] worked on it for three straight years with the same people uh high quality director engineer
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:43.440] studio the other actors were all so on point and uh and we told that story which was a really
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.880] wonderful story in order which almost never happens with with voice acting especially if
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.440] you're a main character a lot of the times you're right kind of a blank slate you're just kind of
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:25:03.360] going through the motions you're saying lots of uh normal lines that are uh just uh you know
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.920] utility the store is locked or out of ammo and stuff like that right right um but uh
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:13.280] but noctis had a really cool story a lot of really emotional scenes and that's always the the best
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:19.520] part of being an actor is getting to go into those media emotional things that uh that means so much
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:26.480] so that role for sure means a great deal to me and it's fun to every once in a while come back
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:32.960] and uh and and give her a little reprise uh doing decidio or uh we even have that uh
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:39.280] that mobile game uh that they brought us all back for we all did our lines uh i don't know how it
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:46.240] turned out but uh it's it's always good to come back he's he's a great character yeah yeah he is
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:55.760] um yeah he's i can't say i 15 like i mentioned earlier my sister she's the one who's getting
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.880] into the voice acting world and she's big in a square enix and that's when i started taking
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.200] note of the voice acting world and obviously you were the star there but like i still feel like
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:11.840] that's probably the rule that really puts you on the map um uh uh yeah absolutely for fans for
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:18.720] sure i don't know if casting directors know about it but uh fans for sure right um yeah that's uh
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:26.880] and yeah i i you can't be stressed enough how uh how wonderful ff15 is and you're the like you
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:33.200] said the emotional aspect is just it's fantastic i mean talk about a comfort game too like uh
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:40.640] it is a one of the charms about it is it's just a hanging out with friends sort of simulator you
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.400] just go in and the party banter is so good and natural that you just want to stay there a long
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.440] time and drive around and fish and do hunts and stuff and you can play that game forever
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.680] uh people you know do hundreds of hours of uh of hanging out with us um and uh i think that
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:01.200] definitely for fans of this podcast would uh would be interested in that
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:11.920] yes certainly certainly um i couldn't agree more um let's see here so um okay so
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:21.360] obviously on this show we oh a lot of the games and genres are wildlife or nature centric and
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.360] whatnot and uh i i happen to know you recently moved into a new home but i'm curious are you
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:33.840] still out in bear country because you've had a few run-ins with the wildlife yes uh we moved
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:39.040] right as covet happened we didn't even know it was happening uh but it just happened to be really
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:45.600] good timing we moved to a uh we bought a little cabin out in the woods uh just like a a cottage
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:52.880] core fan would um and uh and then covet happened we were like well let's live here full time because
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.360] it certainly is a lot easier than living in a city right now yeah and we were fortunate to be able to
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:04.560] do our work remotely uh during covet and uh still do now it kind of opened up um that there's a lot
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.720] of uh remote work that's out there these days um and then uh and then yeah just recently we moved
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:16.640] to a little town called ohai california which and we still have our our little bear cabin in the
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:25.040] woods which is about two hours away from here um but this is also a very very uh i wouldn't say
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.840] sleepy but it is it is a relaxed sort of vibe out here okay um very very much in touch with nature
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:38.160] and stuff and uh i mean we have uh we uh one of the the cool features of this house was it has
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:44.720] a garden in the back um it's got six different fruit trees i'm looking at our quat tree right
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:52.400] now which is in season uh we have clementines we got limes lemons passion fruit bush um it's uh
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:58.080] it's an amazing place so we do love that outdoorsy life uh ourselves it's one of our favorite things
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:06.320] oh yeah we have a a mighty oak in the front uh of our house which is uh it's gotta be at least
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:11.680] 100 years old this thing is huge wow it's ridiculous yeah wow you're doing your own little
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:21.840] cottage core game setting i'm 100 yeah that's awesome oh man um obviously a lot of the listeners
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:29.680] probably think that's a dream home um because it is i mean it is it is our dream for sure
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:38.720] oh that's lovely that's absolutely lovely um but yeah i i mean i i am out here in atlanta which
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:46.960] is pretty urban but it's still fairly in tune with nature there's a lot of uh woods and wildlife
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.160] especially you know once you're outside in the serb suburbs um just this past weekend i actually
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:30:00.240] had to uh rescue another as in like the fifth time a giant snapping turtle off the highway
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:08.000] take it back wow yeah um good on you those highways are scary yeah so the fact that you
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:16.320] can stop traffic is important yeah yeah um yeah i and yeah like i said there's a lot of ponds
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.720] near where i live so there's a bunch of these and like i said it's multiple times i've encountered
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:26.320] them now they're huge i think that one must have been at least 30 pounds uh how yeah a big old
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:31.680] thing um and they will bite but you know living again living here with all this i knew how to
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:37.760] handle it kind of um but do you do your fan do your fans know your uh your screen name
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:44.720] my screen name oh yeah yeah they know my name koopa it's my twitter handle it's uh i think
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:50.240] it's important uh i didn't realize how turtley you were as a real person that's very true
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:59.040] uh yeah they would be my uh what is it constituents yeah exactly all right ray so
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:07.840] you're a very seasoned voice actor i'm going i've heard the answer plenty of times but uh
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:14.000] for people who might not be as familiar and might be interested in this world um valerie offered
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.800] some coaching lessons for instance but what advice would you have for people interested
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:25.120] in getting into va and whatnot what advice would i give i feel like this answer has been changing
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:32.800] a lot uh with uh with ai and stuff and how what that means for for the future of this profession
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:40.320] as a whole right i didn't even thought about that i feel like uh uh you know it's it is really
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.600] impressive what it can do especially when it's a straight ahead read obviously audiobooks it's
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:53.920] ideally suited for um i think when it comes to real emotions it seems to have some some struggling
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:59.120] with that sort of thing so maybe we're a few years away before we are all replaced in uh
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:07.680] in anime and in video games and stuff um so for now i think the best thing to do is is really be
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:14.320] the best actor that you can um because it's it's the one thing that's uh while it can replicate
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:22.080] our voices really well and give straight ahead reads a narration sort of reads um if you want to
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:31.200] truly distinguish yourself in this field it's work with heavy emotions work with subtleties
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:37.040] because humans can really really tell when that's a robot or not or when a robot is cheating uh
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:45.040] at that um we can really feel the depth of and movement um within a human um
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:53.920] so for that i think it you go back to the roots and work on theater and work on live productions
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:33:04.240] and work on uh shakespeare and true honest human emotion is going to be the uh the biggest thing
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:10.480] in the marketplace in the the years to come i feel um and uh and that is something that you
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:17.520] can do anywhere every community especially like if you're out there in atlanta um you can join
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:25.280] the local theater and take real theater classes um and start to work on those really meaty roles
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:31.760] that have been established long long established classics roles um that'll really let you sink
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:37.200] your teeth into something so honestly i think that's the the the advice i give this week who
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:47.120] knows what next week is but for now um also all of us uh who are working in this industry i feel
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:52.560] have also started in theater it is a very much common ground a common language between actors
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:58.480] and directors we all went to school for it we all have participated in community theater did plays
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:05.600] middle school high school college afterwards um it's uh it's a really really useful tool
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.680] in this industry okay yeah that's that's really solid advice um yeah i hadn't even
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.720] like i obviously i see a lot of the ai stuff but i and i know there's been
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:23.440] controversies or stuff that's popped up about it with the voice acting stuff but yeah that's a
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.800] very good point about the emotions and whatnot it's definitely gonna get rocky for a few years
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:35.360] i have no idea what is to come as uh i don't think anybody does which is what is so scary but also
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:41.200] exciting about it who knows um so we'll uh we'll all be staying tuned right along with you guys
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:51.360] okay um let's see here um so all right let's let's go back to gaming a little more casual what uh
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:59.120] what stuff are you personally excited to play or see um etc um as a fan do you know career wise
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:05.600] um i am excited to play diablo 4 uh has been really good i've missed the um
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:12.400] the betas and the uh that stuff but uh from what i've been hearing it just seems like the perfect
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.840] sort of relaxing put in 20 minutes here and there sort of game and that's the that those are the
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.480] things that i'm always looking forward to the most uh something where i can uh fit it into my
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:28.560] schedule and uh and play for a little while and play something addictive and fun and immersive
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:34.320] and that game is looking really really good um which which also makes me sad i don't know if i'll
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.920] be able to play final fantasy 16 when it comes out i love the series and uh this one looks really
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.400] really good but i don't know if i have the time to uh to put in that that is also one of the reasons
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.160] why death stranding is great right now because each of the trips takes like 20 minutes and you
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.160] can you can do a delivery and uh and then walk away from the console and um so i'm always looking
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.720] forward to things like that rogue likes um slay the spire my favorite video game always playing
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:10.320] that one forever um and uh those are the ones that i'm looking forward to the most um yeah today the
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.520] new zelda reviews dropped it looks like it's a perfect game but uh i don't i don't know if i'll
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:21.280] have time this year i'll have to be a late gamer on that one yeah no uh it's yeah it's tough when
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:28.960] you you know have a lot of actual stuff going on right yeah yeah i'm a nine to fiver so um i have
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:34.880] a little bit of time after but uh at the same time you're working on some really cool stuff and it's
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:41.760] it's definitely worth it um i'm working on i'm working on not cool stuff too yeah there's
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:50.880] certainly some bad things i've been a part of let's be real oh well i mean your performance
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:37:00.960] isn't probably but yeah oh man um yeah that that'll be that's a topic for sure biggest regrets um
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.480] you don't have to i won't put you on the spot here but uh linden i'll poke your brain about that
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.720] um let's see how do you oh man deal before that comes out real soon i didn't realize how close it
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:22.240] was um yeah a couple weeks yeah um let's see oh whoa here talk changing gears to one of them
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.600] something i'm excited about but you're in street fighter ah see i knew there were things that were
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.600] coming out that i forgot about yes street fighter six uh really proud of that one that game you
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.400] know we're never in charge of how good the game is it's uh always a crapshoot right and it looks
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.640] like this will be this is the one where everything's coalescing and they're making this
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:50.960] one really really high quality it looks fantastic right like i dabble in fighting games but i
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.400] associate with a lot of people who are into it and it's it's just through the roof type for it
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:07.840] um and for people who don't know ray's playing dial um the classic flat there somehow yeah
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:16.160] soldier man go home and be a family man yeah he's so much fun uh to play uh it's uh it was
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:23.200] uh an honor to uh to to go and work with uh with jonathan the director and um it was alex lee who
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.720] recommended me for the role in the first place so i have him to thank yeah alex lee the voice of luke
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:36.400] good friend of mine and uh uh he was like whoa they're recasting guile uh hey give ray a shot
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:42.000] so i'm uh really grateful that he uh he gave me that opportunity oh that is awesome well shout
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.680] out to alex i had no idea he did that oh that's that yeah i'm a big big fan of alex he's done
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:56.800] some great stuff too um let's see here um yeah zelda's zelda's the big i'm probably gonna be
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.080] late to that one um myself oh oh roguelikes you mentioned that um like slay the spire so
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:08.160] oddly enough um a lot of us who are on this show i don't know about all our listeners but we're into
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:12.640] road bikes i don't know if there's some weird common ground between that and cottagecore but
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:20.640] uh have you played cult of the lamb uh i looked into it and it looked great um but it wasn't a
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:26.960] must play for me so that was uh that was one that i was like ah this this hits all the right notes
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:34.160] but i don't have to play this one right now so i i didn't i i kept my uh hand off this the steam
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:41.200] buy button on that one i mean i know yeah i feel like a lot of good roguelikes are like
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.680] that because they just always be there you know well in cults of the lamb is also you're building
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.520] uh a village too right so that that is sort of that cottagecore itch as well yeah we did talk
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:40:00.080] about it on the show because of that um but uh it's it surprised me how much more it's combat
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:07.760] focused than the cutesy village stuff um but uh it's it's super enjoyable super comedic i'd
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.400] recommend if you ever get a minute um what are you playing these days oh my gosh good
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:23.520] wild flowers and nothing oh an update came out last week yes the farming the further farming

[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:30.320] in the previous one and if it doesn't much work together i don't care i'll figure it sure so yeah
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.960] i'll swap this leave this in so they know our technical foibles yeah just in case it doesn't
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.440] we managed to record this after we'd recorded everything else because i realized we needed to
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:48.720] put these plugs somewhere so these will be very subtly slotted in between the news and the
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.400] introduction to the interview will it work only you know listener only you know if it will work
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:45:00.720] i think at this point we gotta put it in here well this if it works this bit will be uh in
