[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000] music
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000] music
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000] music
[00:15.000 --> 00:20.000] music
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.000] music
[00:25.000 --> 00:30.000] music
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.000] Hello, farmers? Yeah, I think we're still farmers.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000] Oh, are we supposed to do it at the same time?
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.000] I don't know. I've never been in secret OWL once, I don't think.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000] Okay, go ahead. You go ahead and do it. Let's run it back.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000] Do we? No, I like this. This is what I like. This is what I love to give OWL.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000] Hi, farmers. Hello, farmers. Go for it, Micah.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000] Hello, farmers. Welcome to The Harvest.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000] Micah. He is Micah, I'm Kevin. OWL's not here,
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000] for good reason.
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000] OWL is having
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000] a heart attack editing this. That's where he is.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000] Sorry, OWL. I'm not.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000] Gotta earn that paycheck.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000] Welcome to The Harvest season. We talk about Cottagecore,
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000] whatever. Who cares? All I care about is this game right now, right here.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000] It's a wonderful life. Story of Seasons, A Wonderful Life,
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000] the big remake, the biggest thing to happen to Cottagecore since, I don't know,
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000] Stardew Valley, probably. It's a big one. Yeah, it does
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000] seem to have quite the excitement around it, which
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000] understandable, coming from the GameCube era, I think a lot of people really
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000] loved it. I guess I just wasn't aware
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000] until they announced the remake, how many people were excited about it.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000] Yeah, I mean, like, well, we'll get into it, right? But like you said,
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000] GameCube era, right? And there wasn't a lot of competition for this type of game,
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000] so I think anyone who's a fan of it probably had a start
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000] somewhere along the lines of the early Harvest Moon games.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000] Yeah. Okay, before we get into that, though,
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000] we'll do all the other stuff we always do. There's actually a good chunk of news,
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000] I think. I think. There is.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000] We've got a list here. Yeah, we'll talk about these news that don't matter.
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.000] I'd say that. I don't know. I'll probably freak out over one of them. Oh, gogotown's on there.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000] Never mind. Okay. Anyways, but before that, just a reminder, transcripts are available
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000] along with the show notes, et cetera, et cetera, on the website.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000] Also, Al wants us to mention that this is the last episode.
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000] I don't know if he's announced. I haven't listened to the last episode or two, but we have a
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000] very special month coming up ahead. We're doing a fishing month
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000] about fishing games and fishing things in video games.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000] So it will be exciting. Yeah, Al will be
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000] on vacation, so we won't be actively editing. We won't be having
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000] up-to-date news as we have per usual, but there'll be a bunch of fun
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000] fishing content. Big the Cat will be mentioned multiple times, I promise.
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000] Okay, but Micah, what have you been up to?
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.000] I have been playing
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000] quite a few games. It's a little wild right now.
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000] Oh. You know, I don't have
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000] the most time in the world to play games, as much time as I would like
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000] to have. Nobody does. But the time that I do have
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000] is being kept very full between
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000] Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom, I still haven't beaten.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000] I've got 230-something hours in the game. Holy moly.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000] A lot of that is, not a lot of it, there is a good
[04:41.000 --> 04:46.000] few hours there that has been like, I left it on while I was
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000] working. Sure, sure, sure. And it just ran the clock on
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000] standing in the shrine or whatever.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000] 30 hours of gameplay, 200 hours of Korok torture.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000] But I've done a lot in that game and I'm trying my best
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.000] to, this is how I play games like that, it's completionist but with
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000] the caveat of completing everything before I finish it.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000] Which is hard to stop myself from doing but
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000] that's just how I do it, I don't know. I think it's because
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000] I know that if I beat the game I'm going to put it down and the likelihood that I'm going to pick it up
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000] anytime soon is much lower. That's super fair. I don't want to get as much as I can out of it before
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000] I hit the credits. Which, I mean, I get that
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000] and the games, you know, I don't need to say but the only
[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000] bad part is that's a big game, that's a beefy game.
[05:51.000 --> 05:56.000] Three maps, three maps. It's huge.
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.000] It's very good but yeah, it's a big game. I am pretty much
[06:01.000 --> 06:06.000] at the point now where I'm ready to start
[06:06.000 --> 06:11.000] the process of the endgame and finish up the story and stuff.
[06:11.000 --> 06:16.000] Also, Final Fantasy 16 is an incredible game.
[06:17.000 --> 06:22.000] I was very excited for that. I wanted to finish Zelda before that came out so that I could focus on that.
[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000] I didn't, obviously. So I played the
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.000] two hour demo that carried over, it carries your
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.000] game progress over. I played the two hour demo for that
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000] hooked immediately. I played another couple hours and then I forced
[06:42.000 --> 06:47.000] myself to stop so that I could try to finish Zelda and I'm not going back to it until Zelda is done.
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000] Very good game, so far at least.
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.000] Very different as far as JRPGs go.
[06:57.000 --> 07:02.000] Yeah. But very good, I like it.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000] Okay. And then Story of Seasons.
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000] Yeah, that's a game, isn't it?
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000] It is. And also something special that
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000] took a break to play a bit of that we
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000] may or may not talk about in the greenhouse.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000] You listeners will have to stick out to hear about that.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000] Yeah, I know about that game. I've heard about it. Mystery.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000] Now we've got him hooked. Alright, now we can drag him through the mud.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000] Well, let's see.
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000] Gaming is too good this year. There's too many good things this year.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000] Then you stop, but then you slow down. Give me a little room to breathe.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000] So, I've been traveling a bit here and there.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000] So I've been doing a lot of mobile stuff as usual.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000] Marvel Snap, Pokemon Masters.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000] But when I do get some Switch, I guess it must have been Switch time.
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000] I have played, well I play Pokemon Unite
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000] as much as I can because I love that game. Did you ever try Unite, Micah?
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000] I did, and I have some friends that play it very regularly and are
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000] very good at it. And I see
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000] how miserable it makes them. That's correct.
[08:42.000 --> 08:47.000] And decide not to partake in it. I'm already not a big
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000] boba person. You are a smart man.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000] As I do with most things Pokemon, I've forewent that to play
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000] some Unite when it first came out. I played a good chunk of the first two
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000] seasons, or maybe three seasons, two or three seasons, and then after that I was
[09:07.000 --> 09:12.000] kind of like, I can't really keep up with this anymore. I got my cool
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000] Venusaur skin, the Season Pass Venusaur skin, whenever that was. Maybe Season 3?
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000] I don't know. And then that was kind of it after that. Until they put
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000] maybe Meganium or something in it, then probably not going to play much on it.
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000] Famous last words because they're going places.
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000] I have my brother, so I play regularly because I play with him. So it's obviously a lot more
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000] fun when you have someone you can play on the regular.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000] Let's see here. But anyways, I bring it up because
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000] the last couple of months or whatever, they've been doing an
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000] Eevee festival because they now are up to
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000] five Eeveevolutions in the game, which means you can
[10:03.000 --> 10:08.000] now have a full team of Eevees. I did see that, yeah.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000] Who's not included yet? They've got Sylveon, Umbreon, Espeon.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000] They have Gleafeon and Glaceon. Vaporeon? No.
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000] They all start off as Eevee.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000] First one was Sylveon, then we got Glaceon, Espeon,
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000] then over this asbestos, they added first
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000] Umbreon and then Leafeon, and now they added the next
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000] Eeveeon Inteleon.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000] My favorite Eeveelution.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000] The sniper one.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000] Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly,
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000] to keep people hooked, they have not added the original three.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000] Maybe we do want Inteleon or Flareon.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000] Inteleon is kind of fun because he's a sniper and he hides.
[11:13.000 --> 11:18.000] He's like the secret agent design and he kind of plays like it, which is kind of cool.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000] The shenanigans over at Unite.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000] Other than that, I have been playing a lot of Story of Seasons because I enjoy this game.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000] Spoiler alert. I also
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000] have played a demo of my own.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000] Pikmin 4. The Pikmin 4 demo.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000] Are you a Pikmin fan, Micah? Yes, I did also play the Pikmin 4 demo.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000] So I will say I was a little concerned about
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000] Pikmin 4 because I read some early reviews and the whole Ochi, the little
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000] doggy guy, I don't know, they didn't seem to be
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000] focusing on the Pikmin stuff that I love.
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000] I'm also biased though because I started with Pikmin 2 so I'm used to challenge.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000] But that said, the Pikmin 4 demo
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000] has pretty much put those fears to rest
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000] because it still plays like Pikmin. It's a very, very pretty game I will say.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000] It is. I kind of agree that I wasn't sure how the
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000] gameplay was going to feel, if it would feel more
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000] like classic Pikmin or if it would feel like a Pikmin game with Ochi.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000] But I found that it feels like it really speeds the
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000] gameplay up a little bit more without losing the integrity of the
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000] Pikmin gameplay. It lets you navigate those
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000] maps a little bit better. Did you beat the demo?
[13:04.000 --> 13:09.000] I beat the demo. I did not do everything in the demo because I know some people who are min-maxing the
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000] heck out of that demo because it's like a limited demo where you hit a certain checkpoint
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000] and then you can't play anymore. But I just kind of played
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000] naturally as I would without trying to min-max everything.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000] But yeah, it feels like Pikmin. There's some things I wish
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000] I really enjoyed the multiple captains that you could
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000] control. It sounds like at some point Ochi might basically become that
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000] because the upgrades get ridiculous on in my ear.
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.000] But I don't know. We'll see. Like I said, the main thing is it still feels like Pikmin.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000] I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, it's kind of neat that
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000] it's got the like...
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000] There are all of these other... They're not all captains but like the
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000] other... What is it? The rescue squad or whatever? All the different rescue squad
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000] characters are interesting characters. They add something to it.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000] Yeah, it is. They unlock different features. You have your doctor and your
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000] engineer and all the different stuff. So that is cool how they divided that up and kind of
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.000] tied it into the search and rescue thing. Yeah.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000] There is actually one complaint I will say about the demo. I feel like there's a lot of text
[14:35.000 --> 14:40.000] which I'm not always opposed to but I don't know. I'm just not used to in a Pikmin game
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000] I guess. There's a lot of text. There's a lot of dialogue in that demo.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000] Yeah. It was also a very long demo. Like longer than I expected it to be.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000] Yeah. Yeah. I got a good maybe four hours out of it.
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.000] But I'm a fairly seasoned Pikmin veteran. Like I could jump in and hit the ground
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000] running. I'm sure for anyone new, it'll last you a good minute.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000] Yeah. Yeah. They give you. You have like a cut off where you
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.000] when you get to a certain point in the like doing enough like a certain
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000] point in the story because it goes by days. Yeah. Well actually it's
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000] they tell you anything you can do in those days is like you can do whatever you want.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000] Yeah. It's not even a certain number of days. They tell you you have to collect a certain number of
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000] resources or whatever. Oh right. Yep. Yep. So you can if you just don't collect the resource
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.000] you can keep playing ad nauseum. Just do whatever you want. Yeah.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000] So yeah. That's that's Pikmin 4. Looking forward to it. That game.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000] It's I can't believe it's coming out.
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.000] You know how bad it is Michael. I heard something that hurt me bad the other day.
[15:57.000 --> 16:02.000] The entire Splatoon trilogy came out between Pikmin 3 and 4.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000] Wait like the like they they put it out on the
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000] switch within that time or like they released in the same time it took
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000] Pikmin 3 came out in 2013 Pikmin 4 comes
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000] out this year and the entire Splatoon trilogy came out in between. There's no
[16:24.000 --> 16:29.000] way Pikmin 3 came out in 2013. Live damage on air.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000] I see that was my reaction.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000] What do you mean. Straight to the heart. It was a decade.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000] Holy cow. OK. Oh pretty rough. Yeah.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000] That's that comes out in a few weeks from like
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.000] two from day recording. Oh Pikmin. This is this is the
[16:58.000 --> 17:03.000] curse of being a Pikmin fan. But anyways
[17:05.000 --> 17:10.000] that that's enough of what I've been up to. I've suffered enough. Thanks to you Pikmin.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000] Let's see. So with that said let's get into the news
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000] let's let's see if we can take more damage from these news articles.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000] OK. First of all we have a research story
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000] update. Alfie's awesome automations. Let's read
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000] the blurb shall we. It's version 0.3. I can't keep track of all these early
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000] access and whatnot. Oh it's automation in the game.
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.000] Of course. All right Al. Al's doing a happy dance I'm sure.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000] You can automate your farms and a lot of let's see
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000] gives a new progression goal for players to automate and optimize their farms. It is an important part of base
[17:57.000 --> 18:02.000] management and contributes to the overall quality of life by reducing repetition of tedious
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000] work. Alfie's shot Alfie
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000] I guess is the automation guy. He's got a steampunk top hat and monocle. His shop
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000] exterior was already added in the game but with a placeholder to prevent entry as it did not make it for the initial release.
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000] Now all existing buildings in the games can be entered.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000] So yeah there's a lot of oh wow there's even auto
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000] fishing and bug catching. Oh that's interesting.
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.000] Auto collectors and yeah. That's interesting.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000] And lamps and sprinklers all that good stuff.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000] I'll tell you I love a good sprinkler in my farming game. Really?
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000] I do. Why do you feel like? Because the amount of time that it takes
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000] to watercraft and stamina you know for most games
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000] typically the amount of time and stamina it takes to watercraft.
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.000] Is there a game you're thinking of maybe in particular?
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000] Maybe one we'll talk about later.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000] Next we have Kynseed.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000] Let's see. This is the big build update. Oh I should have
[19:22.000 --> 19:27.000] mentioned Alfie's update is out now. The animation update.
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.000] Let's see. Kynseed. I don't remember what this game is.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000] They're doing the big build update. You can do customization.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000] You can personalize both the interior and exterior of their farms.
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000] Over 500 items. Everyone loves customization. That's cool.
[19:47.000 --> 19:52.000] Looks like a hedge maze. And you can expand your farm.
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.000] There will be some stuff. Other features they'll announce in the future.
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.000] As this update is not out yet but looks like the focus of this update is customization.
[20:02.000 --> 20:07.000] Which is fun because I think a lot of farming games don't actually have that.
[20:07.000 --> 20:12.000] You can't customize your farm per se.
[20:12.000 --> 20:17.000] Other than the crops you plant and stuff.
[20:17.000 --> 20:22.000] Like layout, decor and stuff like that.
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.000] The hedge maze thing is really neat. I do like the idea of being able to build your own hedge mazes.
[20:27.000 --> 20:32.000] Or different themed farms.
[20:32.000 --> 20:37.000] Or a magical farm.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000] On your own magical garden island.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000] I also say at the end of this update.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000] But wait. There's more. In a short while we'll be announcing another extraordinary feature called Totems.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000] Until next time.
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000] I don't know what that means. I don't know what totems typically are in farming games.
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.000] Other than the warping totems in starting.
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000] Maybe that's what it is. Being able to warp around from spot to spot.
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000] Roots of Pacha has totems. It's the Stone Age stardew.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000] But they're like the more typical or traditional sense of totems.
[21:24.000 --> 21:29.000] Like animal spirits and things like that.
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000] So I don't know who knows. Stay tuned and we'll learn about totems.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000] Next up. Ikone Island. There is a story update.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000] That is out now. With 30% off on early access.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000] At least at the time of recording I think.
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000] This was posted on July 6th. I'll have to check when it is.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000] When that lasts.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000] It looks like it ends July 13th.
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.000] Might be cutting it real close.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000] So it might be too late.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000] But regardless you don't have to wait too long because this will be the last early access update.
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000] This is the story update.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000] Which means the full story has been added in.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000] Oh! There's now voice acting.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000] That's a big one.
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000] I feel like that's a big deal for farm games.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000] Or like sim games. There's not a lot of voice acting involved.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000] Yeah it's nice to see that they've been getting enough budget or recognition.
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000] Whatever you want to call it to include voice acting.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000] I think that's a big step up for the genre.
[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000] So let's see. Every character has their own side quests, storylines or whatever now.
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000] There is the bloom box. Oh you can play your own music. That's really nice.
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000] Well you need to craft it. You craft the little music player and collect discs.
[23:26.000 --> 23:31.000] Kind of like Minecraft.
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000] But I do enjoy playing your own choice of music out of a catalog or whatever.
[23:36.000 --> 23:41.000] Let's see.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000] The cloud cycle traps players in an endless night until they sleep.
[23:46.000 --> 23:51.000] As you might recall mutated plants roam when the island is shrouded.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000] Interesting. I didn't recall that.
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000] That's an interesting way to handle it.
[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000] There's a day night cycle but once it hits night time it's just permanent until you decide to sleep.
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.000] Yep or you can just skip it straight up.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000] That's an interesting way of going about it for sure.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000] Auto pickup. That's nice. You don't have to actually pick up resources.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000] They just float over to you.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000] And some visual upgrades.
[24:32.000 --> 24:37.000] Shadows are a lot more pronounced in some areas.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000] Oh wow. They're doing voice acting for English and Norwegian audio.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000] With many more text languages being added.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000] That's cool.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000] There's an unlockable island that has been added.
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000] This is a very extensive update list.
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000] We added a couple things in.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000] This is a lot of content.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000] These are just the bullet points. There's full patch notes after that.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000] And it just goes. There's tons of stuff.
[25:23.000 --> 25:28.000] So there you go. If you've been playing Ikone Island or have thought about it.
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000] It looks like now is the time to get in.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000] This sounds like the final early access update.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000] They're ready to go.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000] Okay. Speaking of ready to go.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000] This is also an early access I believe and working on ready to go.
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000] They are adding a gallon tree and bartering update.
[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000] Let's see what that does. Oh, on July 13th.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000] That's the same day the other sale ends.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000] Don't feel bad about missing the other sale.
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.000] There is a promotion for Fabledom 2 that does also end on July 13th.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000] Not the full game. Sorry.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000] The update launches on the 13th.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000] There is at least that.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000] I've kept my eye on it because it thinks the art style is kind of cute.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000] Village builder. Not a city builder because it's like Renaissance medieval style.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000] So you're building up this little village.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000] And let's see. The update just based off the trailer includes new buildings and a mission system it looks like.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000] So yeah, that looks like the biggest one.
[26:59.000 --> 27:04.000] Unlike Ikone Island, this does not have a massive patch list.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000] But it will be out in just a few days so we can see in person.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000] So yeah, good on you Fabledom.
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.000] Looks very good.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000] That already happened. Isn't it 4th of July?
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000] It took a little while to get to the point that we are at now.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000] Yeah, alright.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000] I apologize to Everdream Valley for missing my busy schedule.
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000] Missing the 4th of July announcement.
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000] Look, Pikmin took a decade.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000] It's okay if you're a week late Everdream Bell.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000] Okay, they have, well, 4th of July, USA, USA.
[28:00.000 --> 28:05.000] All those red, white, and blue decors and things.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000] You don't see that being added to any games.
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.000] 4th of July Americana.
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.000] Yeah, it's an interesting choice to
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000] flat out reference a country in
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000] a cottagecore, farm sim, life sim game.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000] Not even Animal Crossing did end.
[28:35.000 --> 28:40.000] They do a handful of ones.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000] I mean they have those items that are like, here's an item from the US.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000] South Korea or whatever, but not a whole event for it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000] This is a big deal.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.000] There's confetti everywhere. Some of this decor is loud and obnoxious, but in a really fun way.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000] The kind I want to see.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000] They're celebrating the 4th of July more than I have.
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000] Since Pikmin 3 came out.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000] So good for you for celebrating for all of us Everdream Valley.
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.000] Alright, next up, Spirit of the Island.
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000] It is coming to mobile with a new DLC soon.
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000] Let's see here.
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.000] Oh, they're working on cross platform releases between PC and consoles.
[29:41.000 --> 29:46.000] But yeah, they have a mobile version now, which is always a big jump.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000] So good for them.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000] I hope that's a means they've been doing well.
[29:56.000 --> 30:01.000] Oh, it'll be on, Xbox Demo Fest is happening
[30:01.000 --> 30:06.000] at some point July 6th. If you have an Xbox, you can try this already.
[30:06.000 --> 30:11.000] Let's see here.
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000] They're coming with a DLC called Adventureland.
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.000] Oh, you can build your own amusement park.
[30:21.000 --> 30:26.000] I'm down for it. I'm a big fan.
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000] Okay, now the anti-update. We're getting delays now.
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000] Let's see, Cloudscape, a Kickstarter game.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000] They are now going to come out next year.
[30:41.000 --> 30:46.000] They have a big list of updates. Oh, they added cows. Good for you game.
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.000] That's a good check mark.
[30:51.000 --> 30:56.000] They also plan to have early beta tests towards the end of 2023.
[30:56.000 --> 31:01.000] So people who backed for early access.
[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000] People who backed at tiers that give early access to the beta will still get that.
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000] But by the end of the year.
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000] But the full game, it sounds like they're looking more towards 2024.
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.000] You know, that's the story of Game Dev.
[31:21.000 --> 31:26.000] That's Kickstarter for them for taking the delay if they gotta.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000] I'm sure nobody is excited about delaying anything.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000] But if it means that it's going to make a better product in the end, then good for them.
[31:36.000 --> 31:41.000] All right. Well, there you go.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000] There's a cave. They added a cave.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000] I'm just excited for the cows. I'm always excited for cows and games.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000] It looks like Whimnim Island Cave and Flora.
[31:56.000 --> 32:01.000] This is a very colorful game.
[32:01.000 --> 32:06.000] It feels structure wise. I don't know how to describe that.
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000] Level wise, it feels like 16-bit era Zelda games.
[32:11.000 --> 32:19.000] Yep, that's what I'm thinking. Original Link's Awakening or Oracle of whatever.
[32:19.000 --> 32:26.000] And they've added cutscenes and a dock. There's a lighting system overhaul.
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.000] Yeah, there's a lot of stuff.
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000] Yeah, there's a lot of stuff. It is a good amount of work.
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000] Oh, those cows. Oh, cows can have colors.
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000] They're cute. There's a blue cow.
[32:47.000 --> 32:55.000] Yeah, there's a big update on Kickstarter, so you can click on the link to read through all of that.
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000] But yeah, so that is Cloudscape.
[33:00.000 --> 33:06.000] And next up, my favorite news of this episode.
[33:06.000 --> 33:14.000] It's the tweet that starts with Turnip Boy in Smash, question mark, question mark.
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.000] Not really, but Turnip Boy Rob's Bank is coming to Switch.
[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000] Imagine though?
[33:20.000 --> 33:26.000] It's, I mean, it's possible now.
[33:26.000 --> 33:33.000] You know, Turnip Boy committed tax evasion and now Turnip Boy has got to rob a bank.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000] That's just the natural progression.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000] Turnip Boy breaks and enters into Sakura's office.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000] Yeah.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000] Are you familiar with Turnip Boy?
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000] Turnip Boy, yeah.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000] I love what this team is doing because it's just unhinged and I love it.
[33:55.000 --> 34:01.000] It's the most chaotic neutral thing ever and I love it.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000] It's great. Good on you, Turnip Boy.
[34:03.000 --> 34:11.000] My younger brother Calvin really loves Turnip Boy and boy, is he a lot like Turnip Boy.
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000] Committing tax evasion? Robbing banks? Hold on, wait.
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000] Mine as well.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000] What do you mean by that?
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  Mine as well.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  But yeah, so Switch, I believe, yeah, the original was also on Switch.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  So now this one's coming.
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  So that's, yeah, good for them.
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  Good for you, Snoozy Kazoo.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  It looks just as unhinged as I would have expected it.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  He has a gun now.
[34:40.000 --> 34:50.000]  It's just, it's a like bullet hell type game and very Binding of Isaac-y.
[34:50.000 --> 34:58.000]  But with that special Turnip Boy je ne sais quoi.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  Which means something.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  Yep.
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  For sure.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  I mean, just, it's Turnip Boy.
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  If you know Turnip Boy, you know what we're talking about.
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  Yeah.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  What you might not know we're talking about next, because I don't know what this is.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  Let's see, Monster Patch.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  Oh, oh, wait, no, I do know what this is.
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  Okay, so the creator-
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  Sean Young.
[35:23.000 --> 35:24.000]  Yep, yep, that's Egglide.
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Yep, Sean Young, creator of Littlewood.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  Littlewood dev.
[35:27.000 --> 35:34.000]  He's been working on a monster catching game and he now calls it Monster Patch.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  Monster Collector, auto-battler, roguelike.
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  What?
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  That's a lot of words together.
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  I don't-
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  It's great.
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  Is it?
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  It's great.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  Just keep adding genres to each other.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  I love it.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  I don't-
[35:54.000 --> 36:02.000]  It's got the Littlewood pixel, the like signature pixel art style, which I loved.
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  I love it.
[36:03.000 --> 36:08.000]  Yeah, no, the monster designs are good.
[36:08.000 --> 36:16.000]  There's some big kind of like confused, like single brain cell looking frog thing that
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  I also am immediately in love with.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  I like the bunny with the one eye.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  I like Cyclops, like the other one's like scarred, closed, whatever.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  Yeah.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.000]  I think it's a bunny.
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  And the piercings.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  Yeah.
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  The ear piercings.
[36:32.000 --> 36:38.000]  There's also something that kind of looks like, I'm sorry Sean Young, but it kind of
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  looks like Darumaka.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  It's really Darumaka at home.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  But derpy Darumaka with the eyes in the house.
[36:45.000 --> 36:51.000]  There's also in this screenshot, there is shown an evolution tree.
[36:51.000 --> 36:58.000]  So you can see like three monsters next to each other that very clearly evolved from
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  each other.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  Yeah.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  But it looks very neat.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  Auto, monster collector, auto battler, roguelike.
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  With a wacky and dark story that is a commentary on the predatory practices of gaming corporations
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  on today's youth.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  I don't like that.
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  I don't, I don't, you're getting a little too close to home, especially for fans of
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  this genre.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  Thank you Sean Young for your service.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  Applause.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  No, I'm sorry.
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  Okay.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  I love it.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  It's great.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  I'm sure it'll be great.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  But I'm very excited to see how that goes.
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  And just that I feel, I feel like it's going to hit too close to home.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  Oh, what am I saying?
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  Al's the one who's, Al's one's going to be right in the game basically.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  Okay.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  Um, go, go town.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  Um, I believe I remember this one.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  It's a fairly chaotic.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  Oh, very animal crossing esque looking game.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  Um, the update is, or they're adding a unicorn trike.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  That's, that's the update.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  That's it.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  Al likes it.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.000]  He says unicorn.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  I have not heard about this yet, but I'm interested in it because it's made by the people who
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  made yonder, uh, the cloud catcher Chronicles.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  Oh really?
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  And um, grow ever tree, the song of the ever tree.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Oh, oh yeah.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  That one I know.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  Um, yeah, you should check out the trailer.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  I played more of yonder than I played of grow ever tree, or grow song of the ever tree,
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  but I, I do like their style of game.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  Yeah.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  Quite a bit.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  You should, uh, you should check out the trailer.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  I remember being pretty fond of it.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  It's like a little, it looks very cool.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.000]  Yeah.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.000]  It looks like a little more chaotic or busy animal crossing, but in a good way.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  Um, yeah, that's how I remember seeing it.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  Um, the art style is very clean too.
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  Like it feels like a very, I don't know, almost claymation cinematic.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  Yeah.
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.000]  That kind of like toy legend of Zelda feel almost anyways.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  Um, and, but I guess the big thing is you can ride around on things.
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  Like that's what I'm thinking about here.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  There will, I'm sure there'll be other options other than a unicorn tricycle.
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.000]  Yeah.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Um, so that'd be fun.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  Tricycle is very, very cool.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  Very exciting.
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  Yep.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  Um, I, I, I will, I won't lie though.
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  At first when I read the Al's notes, I thought it was a unicorn on a tricycle.
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.000]  Um, but, uh, but you know, don't take what I can get, I guess.
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.000]  Um, all right.
[39:48.000 --> 39:56.000]  Um, Sun Haven, you can now get a, you can switch your, if you've got a switch copy,
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  you can switch it to a steam key.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  Um, there's information on Kickstarter.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  I don't know the details, but I assume the steam key is already available and the switch
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  version is not question mark.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  But either way, if you change your mind to, um, uh, there you go, you can do it.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  Sun Haven.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  Um, wait, what is this next one?
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  Prehistoric kingdom?
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Dinosaurs?
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  Oh, oh Spencer.
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  Take control of limitless power in prehistoric kingdom to build, manage and grow the ultimate
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  zoo for extinct animals.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  It's Jurassic park simulator.
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.000]  I'm sure they probably don't want people to call it Jurassic park simulator.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  But I mean, but that's what it looks like.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  And that's a Jurassic park simulator.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  I calls them like I sees them.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  That's, I don't know how much of this is CGI trailer and how much of this is gameplay,
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  but I like the concept.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  It's, it's just Jurassic park simulator.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  Um, yeah, that's, and that's like a positive.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  Like that's a good, that's a good, a good thing.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  Absolutely.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  At least my perspective.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  Yep.
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  And they're going for some high fidelity visuals.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  Um, yeah, this is not a 2d pixel art game.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  Um, I would maybe clarify that like, this looks like Jurassic park simulator without
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  the violence, without like the catastrophic, um, breach.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  Well, now we just lost half the audience.
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.000]  Who cares?
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  It's a like peaceful drill.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  Like if, if Jurassic park succeeded.
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  Yeah.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.000]  Okay.
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  Play the play that, uh, what, what happened in the 10 years before Jurassic world happened
[41:45.000 --> 41:46.000]  in the movie?
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  Um, but yeah, no, I mean, dinosaur zoo.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  What else?
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.000]  It looks really cool though.
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  It does.
[41:52.000 --> 41:59.000]  It looks like you build a, you can like build out the habitats for the dinosaurs as well
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  as the like portions of the park that people, cause they're obviously not, you know, hanging
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  out with the dinosaurs.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  You're observing them.
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.000]  So unless, unless, yeah.
[42:13.000 --> 42:22.000]  So there's like kiosks and uh, you know, give shops, food stands, things like that.
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.000]  Walkways paths.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  Yeah.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  It's like a theme park.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  Yeah.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  So yeah.
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  Simulator, but with, with dinosaurs.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  And if that excites you, Spencer, I know you're listening.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  Um, it's out on early access right now.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  So go check it out if you like it.
[42:39.000 --> 42:46.000]  And if again, by some miracle, this is out before July 13th, then it's 25% off right
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  now as a recording.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  Oh snap.
[42:50.000 --> 42:56.000]  Our listeners have a lot to get right like into like 24 hours after this release.
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.000]  You're either gonna, if you're listening to this, you either have very little time to
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  get some deals or you missed them.
[43:04.000 --> 43:05.000]  It's too late.
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  It's one, it's one or the other.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  We don't, there's no in between.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  There's no in between.
[43:12.000 --> 43:17.000]  Something that they will have time for is Hello Kitty Island Adventure though.
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  Um, do you remember Animal Crossing had those Sanrio crossover amiibo cards?
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  Yeah, I do.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  Okay.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  This Sanrio said, but what if we just did the whole thing though and made you Animal
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  Crossing with Hello Kitty and a whole lot of other stuff though.
[43:36.000 --> 43:42.000]  Cause there's swimming and roller coasters and ancient dungeons and minecarts and there's
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  a lot going on.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  Already obsessed with this.
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  There's very cute.
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.000]  I love Sanrio.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  Gudetana is on the beach apparently.
[43:52.000 --> 44:00.000]  The amount of like actual adventure that it looks like is being added to this is, is really
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.000]  interesting.
[44:01.000 --> 44:10.000]  There's like minecart, uh, racing from like boulders, there's like underwater swimming
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.000]  to like pirate ship, like sunken pirate ships.
[44:15.000 --> 44:21.000]  It's Animal Crossing, but also with like an adventure aspect.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.000]  Yep.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.000]  But you can still decorate and stuff.
[44:23.000 --> 44:27.000]  You create, you create your own little Sanrio character.
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  Um, that's cute.
[44:29.000 --> 44:35.000]  Um, there's also, uh, it looks like all of the, all of these Sanrio characters, like
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.000]  there's Sanrio characters that I guess wouldn't have expected to be in it too.
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  Like Aggretsuko is in there.
[44:41.000 --> 44:42.000]  Wait, Aggretsuko's in there?
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  They are, they're in the minecart, aren't they?
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  What's that?
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  Yeah, Aggretsuko, they're in there, right?
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  I could have added them.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  Yeah.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  Oh snap.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.000]  I just, I just caught that.
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  What you just said.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  Oh snap.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  That's crazy.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  Yeah.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  Pretty nuts.
[44:59.000 --> 45:00.000]  It looks good though.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  Yeah.
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  Uh, it is, uh, Apple Arcade.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  Oof.
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  Oof.
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  Which, not sure how that's going to play.
[45:10.000 --> 45:20.000]  Uh, it is, yeah, it's iOS, iPadOS exclusive currently, maybe also on like Apple TV.
[45:20.000 --> 45:31.000]  Uh, but, uh, Apple Arcade, if you don't know, is iOS's, um, or Apple's like subscription
[45:31.000 --> 45:37.000]  service for, it's like a monthly subscription service for their games.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  Uh, so, interesting.
[45:42.000 --> 45:49.400]  Um, there have been games that have had like Apple Arcade exclusivity that have later been
[45:49.400 --> 45:56.000]  released on other platforms, but there have also been games that have not, so, I guess
[45:56.000 --> 45:57.000]  we'll see.
[45:57.000 --> 45:58.000]  Yeah, we'll see.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  That's the big one, right?
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  We'll see what happens.
[46:00.000 --> 46:09.480]  Um, 28th of July for people who want to check that out on Apple Arcade.
[46:09.480 --> 46:10.480]  So that's the news.
[46:10.480 --> 46:11.480]  Um.
[46:11.480 --> 46:12.480]  We did it.
[46:12.480 --> 46:14.700]  We made it through the news.
[46:14.700 --> 46:15.700]  That was a lot of news.
[46:15.700 --> 46:22.740]  Uh, I should, we should also say, uh, Al did put in the show notes for Hello Kitty Island
[46:22.740 --> 46:27.900]  Adventure as one of the bullet points, Gudetama on the beach.
[46:27.900 --> 46:35.540]  So I think we would be remiss to not point out that there is Gudetama on the beach in
[46:35.540 --> 46:37.340]  Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
[46:37.340 --> 46:44.060]  This game has like, just those three, Hello Kitty, Gudetama, and Aragatsuko, that's like
[46:44.060 --> 46:46.940]  three fandoms that they've already captured, right?
[46:46.940 --> 46:47.940]  Yeah.
[46:47.940 --> 46:49.060]  That's, that's impressive.
[46:49.060 --> 46:55.400]  Also in the key art is, uh, Kuropi, which is my favorite Sanrio character, um, sweet
[46:55.400 --> 46:56.400]  little frog-son.
[46:56.400 --> 46:58.820]  So I'm very excited.
[46:58.820 --> 47:01.220]  Gets left out of a lot of Sanrio stuff.
[47:01.220 --> 47:02.600]  Well, there you go.
[47:02.600 --> 47:03.600]  On the cover.
[47:03.600 --> 47:07.580]  I'm very excited that, uh, he's front and center on the, the key art.
[47:07.580 --> 47:08.980]  There you go.
[47:09.500 --> 47:19.700]  Uh, there's, my favorite Sanrio character is Hello Kitty, the Gundam version.
[47:19.700 --> 47:26.420]  I wonder if we'll get some, uh, some Gundam crossover in Hello Kitty Adventure Island.
[47:26.420 --> 47:27.660]  Is that Island Adventure?
[47:27.660 --> 47:29.020]  Do you know about Hello Kitty Kiss?
[47:29.020 --> 47:36.980]  Maybe they go to, uh, you know, maybe they go to White Base and then there's an adventure
[47:36.980 --> 47:37.980]  there.
[47:37.980 --> 47:42.100]  They have the money for it.
[47:42.100 --> 47:44.060]  Do you know about Hello Kitty Kiss?
[47:44.060 --> 47:45.060]  Do I know what?
[47:45.060 --> 47:46.300]  About Hello Kitty Kiss?
[47:46.300 --> 47:48.020]  No, I don't know.
[47:48.020 --> 47:49.020]  What is that?
[47:49.020 --> 47:50.020]  Okay.
[47:50.020 --> 47:52.420]  This is Kiss as in the rock band Kiss.
[47:52.420 --> 47:59.040]  Um, it was a canceled, uh, animated series that was going to be about the band Kiss,
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.260]  but they're Hello Kitty characters apparently.
[48:02.260 --> 48:16.500]  I am seeing on, uh, Google images, um, crossover Hello Kitty Kiss designs and simultaneously
[48:16.500 --> 48:20.180]  shocked and not surprised, right?
[48:20.180 --> 48:27.180]  So I feel like makes sense for like how out of control some of the collabs at Hello Kitty
[48:27.180 --> 48:33.460]  does are, but, um, also why Kiss?
[48:33.460 --> 48:38.780]  This means though that Gene Simmons had to agree to this at some point, somewhere.
[48:38.780 --> 48:39.780]  It's true.
[48:39.780 --> 48:44.940]  In fact, in this image that I'm looking at, it says Gene Simmons was producing Kiss and
[48:44.940 --> 48:48.780]  Hello Kitty Mashups, so I don't know.
[48:48.780 --> 48:50.780]  Where's that game?
[48:50.780 --> 48:53.180]  Uh, okay.
[48:53.180 --> 48:55.180]  We need it.
[48:55.180 --> 48:56.180]  Okay.
[48:56.180 --> 48:58.820]  Is that a game to cover still?
[48:58.820 --> 49:01.820]  And unfortunately it's not Hello Kitty Kiss.
[49:01.820 --> 49:02.820]  Okay.
[49:02.820 --> 49:03.820]  Okay.
[49:03.820 --> 49:09.060]  All right, Micah, have you seen the movie Ratatouille?
[49:09.060 --> 49:12.380]  Uh, I have.
[49:12.380 --> 49:18.060]  For people who have seen it and I guess spoiler question mark, if you haven't watched it,
[49:18.060 --> 49:19.060]  go watch it right now.
[49:19.060 --> 49:20.180]  It's a great movie.
[49:20.180 --> 49:24.620]  There's this pretty much, I would call it the climax or whatever.
[49:24.620 --> 49:27.900]  There's a scene when Ego, that's the reviewer's name, right?
[49:27.900 --> 49:28.900]  Ego?
[49:28.900 --> 49:37.020]  He takes a bite of the titular Ratatouille and he's warped to his childhood, goading
[49:37.020 --> 49:42.780]  home from falling down and his mom gives him his Ratatouille.
[49:42.780 --> 49:43.780]  That played a Ratatouille.
[49:43.780 --> 49:49.780]  Interesting choice of dish for like a child, but you know, I'm not gonna, I'm not here,
[49:49.780 --> 49:50.780]  Josh.
[49:50.780 --> 49:51.780]  Carry on.
[49:51.940 --> 49:52.940]  Yeah, I guess so.
[49:52.940 --> 49:59.820]  But the point I'm trying to make here is Story of Seasons, A Wonderful Life is that plate
[49:59.820 --> 50:02.740]  of Ratatouille.
[50:02.740 --> 50:07.980]  I just want to start off by saying that, that this is a remake of a game that came out in
[50:07.980 --> 50:12.620]  like 2003 ish, almost two days, two decades ago.
[50:12.620 --> 50:13.620]  I don't know, something like that.
[50:13.620 --> 50:16.260]  It was on the GameCube.
[50:16.260 --> 50:24.060]  I had a lot of fondness, a lot of nostalgia, and boy did this game deliver.
[50:24.060 --> 50:29.140]  What are your opening thoughts, your general thoughts on the game, Micah?
[50:29.140 --> 50:37.620]  I am of the group of people that liked A Wonderful Life, but didn't get into it as much as I
[50:37.620 --> 50:41.180]  got into other Harvest Moon games at the time.
[50:41.180 --> 50:42.180]  Okay.
[50:43.180 --> 50:49.500]  Case in point, Friends of Mineral Town was like my top Harvest Moon of all time.
[50:49.500 --> 50:50.500]  Okay.
[50:50.500 --> 50:52.260]  That's my favorite one.
[50:52.260 --> 51:02.500]  And I think I was more into the, like I started with Harvest Moon 64 and Back to Nature and
[51:02.500 --> 51:09.980]  all that stuff, I liked Hero of Leaf Valley, stuff like that.
[51:09.980 --> 51:19.060]  But when it started to move to portable Harvest Moon experiences, that was when I started
[51:19.060 --> 51:20.680]  to lean more towards that.
[51:20.680 --> 51:27.900]  So I did play A Wonderful Life, but that was almost like, not the stopping point for console
[51:27.900 --> 51:34.860]  Harvest Moon for me, because I still played Animal Parade, I still played Magical Melody,
[51:34.860 --> 51:39.900]  when those came out on the Wii, I still played Harvest Moon games, I just didn't get into
[51:39.900 --> 51:45.700]  them quite as much as I did when I was playing portable ones.
[51:45.700 --> 51:54.420]  Like when they put Hero of Leaf Valley on the PSP and stuff like that, that was more
[51:54.420 --> 52:02.960]  being able to take it with me on the go and continue, do that, that season cycle on the
[52:02.960 --> 52:06.100]  go kind of became my interest.
[52:06.100 --> 52:12.660]  But I do have very distinct and like fond memories of A Wonderful Life.
[52:12.660 --> 52:18.820]  Not quite as much as I think you and all of the other people that were super, super excited
[52:18.820 --> 52:24.500]  that this was getting a remake, but still definitely there.
[52:24.500 --> 52:25.500]  Yep.
[52:25.500 --> 52:26.500]  Okay.
[52:26.500 --> 52:27.500]  Okay.
[52:27.500 --> 52:28.500]  That's good.
[52:28.500 --> 52:29.500]  That's all right.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.500]  I appreciate that though.
[52:30.500 --> 52:34.340]  Maybe a little more grounded than my very rose colored glasses here.
[52:34.740 --> 52:42.260]  However, I will say, given that, given my existing stance on A Wonderful Life for the
[52:42.260 --> 52:53.020]  GameCube, this has been a much more fulfilling experience for me of that game.
[52:53.020 --> 53:00.220]  I can't appreciate all of the differences between the versions and things like that,
[53:00.220 --> 53:07.060]  but I have played more of this version than I ever played of the GameCube version at this
[53:07.060 --> 53:08.060]  point.
[53:08.060 --> 53:09.060]  So.
[53:09.060 --> 53:10.060]  Okay.
[53:10.060 --> 53:11.620]  That's where I'm at.
[53:11.620 --> 53:12.620]  All right.
[53:12.620 --> 53:15.820]  Now, to be fair, I have these fond memories, but I didn't make it that far, I don't think.
[53:15.820 --> 53:20.140]  I think I maybe made it to year three on my GameCube.
[53:20.140 --> 53:28.420]  I made it to year two, I have hit A Wonderful Life Shippuden because there's a time skip
[53:28.420 --> 53:29.420]  between year one and two.
[53:29.620 --> 53:30.620]  You hit the time skip?
[53:30.620 --> 53:31.620]  Yeah.
[53:33.620 --> 53:34.860]  Spoiler alert, there's a time skip.
[53:34.860 --> 53:39.500]  I don't think it's a spoiler for me, but it's a pretty big part of the marketing.
[53:39.500 --> 53:40.500]  Yeah.
[53:40.500 --> 53:41.500]  The selling point is...
[53:41.500 --> 53:43.500]  You get married and have babies and stuff.
[53:43.500 --> 53:47.260]  And then eventually get old and die.
[53:47.260 --> 53:49.260]  I'm anxious about finishing this game.
[53:49.260 --> 53:52.260]  I don't want to die.
[53:52.260 --> 53:53.260]  Yeah.
[53:53.260 --> 53:56.780]  But anyways, I digress.
[53:56.780 --> 53:57.780]  So yeah, that's where I am.
[53:57.780 --> 53:58.900]  How far have you made it, Micah?
[53:59.900 --> 54:01.900]  I have also hit year two.
[54:01.900 --> 54:02.900]  Okay.
[54:02.900 --> 54:03.900]  Today.
[54:03.900 --> 54:11.140]  It was kind of a mad dash at the end, because I really wanted to get to year two before
[54:11.140 --> 54:17.720]  we talked about it, because I do think that that's when the game...
[54:17.720 --> 54:24.220]  It's a pretty significant change, so I think I would be doing a disservice by talking about
[54:24.220 --> 54:25.780]  it before getting to that point.
[54:25.780 --> 54:26.780]  Yep.
[54:26.780 --> 54:27.780]  I appreciate that.
[54:27.780 --> 54:28.780]  Thank you for your work.
[54:29.140 --> 54:37.820]  It's a little bit of a mad dash to get to year two, but it's well worth it, because
[54:37.820 --> 54:40.860]  it's been such a great time playing the game.
[54:40.860 --> 54:43.460]  Oh, okay.
[54:43.460 --> 54:44.740]  So let's back up.
[54:44.740 --> 54:57.620]  Let's get back up a bit, because as a remake, I think as a remake, it was really, really
[54:57.620 --> 54:59.780]  well done.
[54:59.780 --> 55:01.440]  There's some choices.
[55:01.440 --> 55:06.360]  I think I disagree, but those are personal preferences or philosophy, whatever you want
[55:06.360 --> 55:12.120]  to call it, and some of the renaming of things and some details like that.
[55:12.120 --> 55:17.540]  But in general, they captured the game perfectly, in my opinion.
[55:17.540 --> 55:19.860]  But let's talk about this game.
[55:19.860 --> 55:23.900]  This is a farming farm game.
[55:24.260 --> 55:29.180]  Actually, your dad in this one, I believe, is the one who inherits, wills you the farm.
[55:29.180 --> 55:35.380]  Oh, fun fact, I hate credits, because I said, no, I don't want the farm, and the game says,
[55:35.380 --> 55:37.980]  okay, and you just leave and you hate credits.
[55:37.980 --> 55:40.820]  I didn't know that.
[55:40.820 --> 55:42.780]  Is that the original too?
[55:42.780 --> 55:43.780]  I don't remember.
[55:43.780 --> 55:46.700]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[55:46.700 --> 55:49.840]  It feels like it very much was in the original.
[55:49.840 --> 55:52.660]  But yeah, I said it no, and I got credit.
[55:53.420 --> 55:55.500]  Any percent speed run completed.
[55:55.500 --> 55:58.500]  That's fantastic.
[55:58.500 --> 56:00.780]  I love that.
[56:00.780 --> 56:09.020]  You are given your farm, and the blueprint for Stardew and all those games are right
[56:09.020 --> 56:10.020]  here.
[56:10.020 --> 56:11.680]  You have your fields where you plant crops.
[56:11.680 --> 56:13.820]  You take care of animals.
[56:13.820 --> 56:15.380]  You interact with villagers.
[56:15.380 --> 56:17.420]  You get hitched.
[56:17.420 --> 56:22.180]  Interestingly enough, this one is one of the few games that force you to get married at
[56:22.700 --> 56:24.700]  the end of year one.
[56:24.700 --> 56:27.980]  But yeah, you interact with villagers.
[56:27.980 --> 56:29.380]  There's the social system.
[56:29.380 --> 56:31.220]  There's some fishing.
[56:31.220 --> 56:34.060]  There's a proto-mining.
[56:34.060 --> 56:35.060]  It's like a dig sale.
[56:35.060 --> 56:36.780]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[56:36.780 --> 56:43.340]  But yeah, all the bread and butters of the farming genre are there.
[56:43.340 --> 56:49.940]  But that said, I think it's important to note, I think the scale or the scope of the game
[56:49.940 --> 56:55.020]  is a lot smaller than the modern day versions of them.
[56:55.020 --> 57:01.140]  The area itself is physically, I think, a lot smaller than, say, the Stardew map.
[57:01.140 --> 57:08.460]  And the cast is, I don't know, maybe 20 people.
[57:08.460 --> 57:19.800]  But I think it works in its favor, because it doesn't feel as hectic at times.
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.720]  You can go through the pace a little slower.
[57:23.720 --> 57:28.880]  You can get your farming done and still go through the dig site or fishing and still
[57:28.880 --> 57:33.120]  talk to people.
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.420]  I think there's so much we can talk about.
[57:36.420 --> 57:38.340]  Let's talk about the farming for a second.
[57:38.340 --> 57:40.560]  Let's focus on that, because that's the start of the show.
[57:40.560 --> 57:49.140]  Yeah, I do feel like it's like farming sim-lite almost, because for anybody that doesn't know
[57:49.140 --> 57:52.980]  and hasn't played it, it still does the seasons.
[57:52.980 --> 57:55.780]  But each season is only 10 days long.
[57:55.780 --> 57:56.780]  Oh, good call.
[57:56.780 --> 57:58.360]  Yeah, that's very, very important.
[57:58.360 --> 58:03.220]  Which is a pretty distinct difference from most farming games.
[58:03.220 --> 58:06.940]  I feel like 30 days or whatever is typically how long.
[58:06.940 --> 58:07.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[58:07.940 --> 58:14.380]  You know, like an average month length is how most farming sims go.
[58:14.380 --> 58:19.820]  But this kind of chops it down to 10 days per season.
[58:19.820 --> 58:26.180]  And I almost feel like that is way more...
[58:26.180 --> 58:33.220]  You still spend a good amount of time in the game, but it almost makes it feel more manageable.
[58:33.220 --> 58:34.220]  Yeah, totally.
[58:34.220 --> 58:35.500]  It's a playthrough.
[58:35.500 --> 58:36.500]  I agree.
[58:36.500 --> 58:38.140]  More manageable to get through the years.
[58:38.140 --> 58:47.100]  And I'm sure that the intention of that design was so that you get to the progression of
[58:47.100 --> 58:59.500]  the story of your life easier without having to go through 120 in-game days to get to the
[58:59.500 --> 59:01.780]  next chapter.
[59:01.780 --> 59:12.100]  That feels like a pretty big ask for how big those story chapters are or how big those
[59:12.100 --> 59:13.460]  milestones are.
[59:13.460 --> 59:18.620]  So having shorter gaps between them makes more sense.
[59:18.620 --> 59:22.320]  It also kind of...
[59:22.320 --> 59:23.900]  It's all like...
[59:23.900 --> 59:29.660]  You mentioned the cast only being about 20 people or something like that.
[59:29.660 --> 59:31.660]  What also feels like...
[59:31.660 --> 59:36.340]  My initial impression of it was, and I remember this when I played the GameCube one too, was
[59:36.340 --> 59:44.460]  that it felt almost weirdly empty, small town-y kind of.
[59:44.460 --> 59:46.100]  Not just small town.
[59:46.100 --> 59:50.100]  They're all kind of small town, village, whatever.
[59:50.100 --> 59:56.340]  But this felt a little bit more empty, almost.
[59:56.900 --> 01:00:04.300]  It also, again, makes it feel more manageable talking into and befriending, getting gifts
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.300]  for all these people.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:16.940]  That's not to say it's small, but it's size-wise or content-wise, it's small.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:22.020]  But it just feels more, I don't know, just more manageable.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:31.540]  It doesn't feel like it's as time-consuming or as daunting of a task as it feels for other
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.060]  farming sims with relationships.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.060]  I totally agree.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.060]  Mechanics.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:47.540]  I might not articulate this super well, but it's designed for this small kind of run-down
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:55.780]  little corner, not run-down, but just very underdeveloped little village town place.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:02.460]  There isn't even a general store, unlike most of them.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.940]  Stardew has so much stuff, for reference, because I think Stardew is going to be the
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:11.660]  big reference point, since that was kind of a successor in many ways.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:19.420]  Stardew has so much stuff, and the time, the day wasn't designed for that much stuff,
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:23.300]  and there's just so much you can do.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:29.140]  Well even if we even want to stay within the franchise, pioneers of Olive Town being the
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:39.460]  most recent, unique iteration, obviously they've been doing collaborations with Dormon, and
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:48.340]  they've been doing remakes, but the most recent, unique entry, or new entry being pioneers
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:57.420]  of Olive Town, so many shops and people and stuff, there's really not, like you said,
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.080]  there's not a lot of that.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:07.500]  Your general store is two days you buy your seeds from another farm, there's a traveling
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:14.940]  salesman named Van that shows up on the third and the eighth of every month, and you get
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:24.180]  your tool upgrades through him, kind of when you hit certain milestones with him, I think,
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:33.700]  and you order fodder and animals through your own farm.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:45.340]  It's all kind of like a decentralized market, which is kind of an interesting approach.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.980]  Yeah it is.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:51.000]  But I like it.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.660]  It's very easy to incorporate into your schedule, as you're making your rounds around town or
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.660]  whatever.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.040]  I like it a lot.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.420]  But since we've mentioned seeds, let's talk about the farming for a second, because it's
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:13.140]  your standard to hold the ground, plant the seed, water, and you're gross.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.700]  But the real differentiator, and I haven't played, I don't remember the last time playing
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:24.980]  another story of seeds again, to be honest, I have pretty much a limited scope of them.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.300]  Hybrids are a big thing in this game.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:33.540]  I don't know if you hit it yet, Micah, because it pops up in year two.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:45.020]  But this giant talking plant joins your farm, and you feed him crops and seeds, and he can
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:53.340]  hybridize them into tomatoes or straw mellows or all sorts, basically every permutation
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.420]  you can think of.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.220]  You can create some sort of hybrid crop.
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:04.060]  And they're very creatively named, just cut both of the words in half and then jam two
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:07.660]  parts of it together.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:12.320]  Which again, that's in year two, you can't hit it in year one.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:20.060]  But that really opens up the farming to a lot more experimentation and adds death.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.060]  I don't know.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.060]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.580]  No, I was just gonna say, it adds death.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:31.220]  And you unlock an extra field, or you can during year two.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.900]  It times it nicely.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.260]  Year one's almost like a tutorial year, and then year two, okay, you know what you're
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:41.460]  doing, so let's throw these extra features that you can play around with.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.580]  Because none of it's required, but it is fun to experiment with.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:58.960]  Yeah, I haven't gotten to that point yet, but I read recommended tips, things that you
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.500]  should do, and one of the things that they had mentioned was, because I was kind of looking
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.580]  at like, okay, what things can I get?
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:12.700]  There are a lot of things that they don't really explicitly say in the game that are
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:22.500]  just kind of like, you learn as you go, which made me feel like I should probably check
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500]  and see.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:29.340]  I'm not missing anything that is maybe really obvious to people who've played it before,
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.840]  but I have no idea.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:37.500]  And one of the things that they had mentioned was, there are certain relationships that
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:47.540]  you want to focus on in year one, like your, I can never remember the farmhand's name.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.540]  Van?
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540]  Old guy.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:55.540]  No, not Van, why am I saying Van, oh my gosh, I can't remember his name either.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.540]  Matt.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540]  It's Matt.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.540]  It's Matt.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.540]  It's Matt.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:00.540]  It's Matt.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.540]  Matt.
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.540]  Matt.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:03.540]  Matt.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.540]  Matt.
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.540]  He lives on your farm, he was there to be like, introduce you to everything.
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.540]  Oh, wait, yours?
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.580]  Yeah.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.580]  Takakura.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.580]  You're a farmhand guy.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:10.580]  Takakura.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:11.580]  Takakura.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.580]  Yes.
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.580]  Yeah.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580]  He lives on your farm.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.580]  He's your dad's bud.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.940]  He, I did see that they said, you know, of the relationships, Takakura was one because
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:26.500]  you can, the sooner you boost his relationship, then the sooner you get access.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:32.580]  The plant, I can't remember the plant, what the plant's name is either, but then also
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:40.740]  Gary, who is the old man, walks around with his wife, Nina, because I guess after year
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.700]  one, he stops accepting gifts.
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.700]  He does.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:49.340]  So his relationship is a lot harder to, or his friendship is a lot harder to boost after
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.340]  year one.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:56.540]  And then Daryl, who's the scientist, because he gives you access to, he just gives you
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540]  a seed maker.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.540]  Yeah, he does.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.540]  Daryl.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:03.740]  So those were kind of the like three that it was like, hey, you should pay attention
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.420]  to these relationships.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.780]  So there are like, like that, like if I hadn't read that, I would have no idea that Gary
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:15.060]  would stop accepting gifts after year one.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.700]  I would be very confused as to why and will like, maybe disappointed that I didn't take
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:25.900]  advantage of that before, you know, I'd lost the ability to.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.900]  Yeah.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.940]  I mean, I get what you're saying.
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:38.940]  Like, yes, there's a lot of, not obscure, but like, things that don't play out till
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.060]  later, you won't know about until later, because you have to invest in.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:43.060]  Yeah.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.060]  All right.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:50.900]  And there's nothing in the game says like, hey, invest in this to get whatever.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:58.260]  I kind of, I have mixed feelings on it, because some of those are big advantages.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:07.860]  But it's also not necessarily required and just like, because of the limited amount,
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:13.540]  or the limited scope of the game, like giving people gifts is a big activity, at least it
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.780]  was for me.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:19.900]  So it just, it kind of happens, in my opinion.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:27.060]  But I can get how that would frustrate people, because, and this is probably the nostalgia
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:34.100]  bias too, but there's an element of playground secrets to it, like, oh, did you know if you
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.820]  talk to the scientist, he'll give you a seed maker, yada yada.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.820]  Yeah.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:45.580]  And I love that too, like, don't get me wrong, I do love that there are things that aren't
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.060]  like super obvious in the game.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:55.220]  It's just, I'm just letting people know, I guess, that there are things that it doesn't
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.260]  explicitly tell you.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.700]  And they're, like you said, they're not super important things either.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.300]  Yeah, nothing critical, I don't think.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:09.100]  There's little things that I didn't realize until later.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:16.620]  As an example, maybe it says it in the tutorial and I missed it, but I don't think I saw that
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:23.740]  it has it, but I could never really figure out when the quest board, which there is a
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:29.860]  quest board in the game, there's very limited amount of quests that you get, it's not like...
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.300]  That's new to this game, it wasn't in the original.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.060]  There's quests happening all the time.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:42.180]  It's again like quest board lite, where you get maybe four quests total within a month,
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:46.980]  or within a season, sometimes maybe just two.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:52.620]  But I didn't realize, I could never really tell without running up to the board and looking
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.440]  when quests were available.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.860]  And then it kind of clicked at one point that I started kind of trying to look out for what
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:05.460]  I would know, and then I noticed that when there are blue pages on the quest board, that's
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.660]  when quests are available, which I didn't know.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:13.820]  Again, it's such a minimal thing that it doesn't totally matter, but it's little quality
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:21.340]  of life things that can be missable without really looking for them or paying attention
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.540]  to them or things like that.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.460]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.180]  Like I said, the quest board in particular, that's new to the remake from what I recall.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:33.080]  I don't remember that in the original.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.820]  And I believe it's on the halfway points, the first and the fifth days of the month
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:42.500]  when the new requests pop up.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.860]  That's a good thing to point out.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:54.320]  One thing I guess along these lines, talking to people is important because sometimes characters
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:59.420]  will drop stuff like this, they'll teach you recipes, they'll give you hints on stuff to
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.980]  farm or things you can find or do.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:08.380]  There's even a television inside your house that has a channel dedicated to farming tips,
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.900]  which you should check out daily because they teach you stuff.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:21.020]  So yeah, there is a lot underneath the surface or stuff that's not told to you explicitly,
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:30.260]  but if you talk around and interact with the people, you'll learn some stuff.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:36.740]  So let's talk about the people for a minute on that note.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:45.220]  First of all, as a general note, the art style change from the original to this, the original
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:52.260]  had like, almost I would say chibi looking characters, that sort of visual art style,
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:58.420]  but here they're more fully sized, proportional, whatever you want to call it.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:04.300]  I think they're trying to get closer to the current story of season standard.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:08.180]  It's kind of somewhere in between, I guess.
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:18.500]  Still like big heads and smallish bodies, but not like full blown chibi.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:25.500]  The big one for me though, are the animals because all the animals are the cutesy story
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.320]  of seasons that we know, except the cows.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.120]  The cows are just regular cows.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:37.960]  Yeah, it's a really strange, I don't know, you know, I feel like the story of seasons
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.040]  cow is like an iconic cow.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:49.920]  And you can see it inside the barn and on the chalkboard, you can see the cow.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:57.640]  It's in like, you know, if I remember correctly, it's in some of the promotional stuff, because
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.640]  there's like little sketch drawings and stuff.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:09.160]  And it's more like the original story of seasons cow in those.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:16.040]  So it's a weird choice to make a more realistic looking cow in the actual game.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.240]  But you know.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.080]  But I digress.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.300]  But yeah, the people.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.300]  Still a cute cow.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.300]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300]  Oh yeah.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300]  No, for sure.
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.300]  For sure.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.300]  Always cute animals.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.480]  And you can snuggle them, which is like, that's just, it's great.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.440]  Dedicated snuggle button is great.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.240]  And you know, it actually benefits your animals.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.120]  I find it funny that you can snuggle them wherever.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:49.000]  So you know, if you're like standing behind your cow, you're gonna snuggle that cow butt.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.040]  But it's still, I still enjoy it.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.440]  But yeah, aside from that, animals are pretty straightforward, I think.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:06.380]  You milk your cows, get eggs from your chickens, and so on and so forth.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.360]  But yeah, going back to the people.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.480]  So what are your thoughts on the cast, Micah?
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:18.480]  Because there's a varied amount of the 20-ish or so characters.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:31.320]  Uh, I guess if I had not really known, or like, become familiar with the Story of Seasons
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:38.320]  art style now, or like the character design style, some of it would be a little bit jarring.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.520]  And it still is a little jarring.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:48.080]  But I can only imagine, at the time of the GameCube release, how jarring some of those
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.280]  characters were.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.080]  Like Daryl, and from what I understand, Gustavo has changed significantly.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.360]  Oh my gosh, Gustavo.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:03.080]  So there are some characters that definitely underwent the yesification process.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.100]  Gustavo was one of them.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:11.180]  He had a big like almost witch hat and a beard, and now it's just like a little sun hat and
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:16.720]  no beard.
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.680]  Gotta make the bachelors and bachelorettes sexy, I guess.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.520]  I guess so.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.800]  Daryl, oh Daryl, we keep mentioning him.
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.760]  He's like a mad scientist who lives in town.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:29.760]  He's totally-
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:34.600]  Still very like, is Daryl, was Daryl a significantly different looking character?
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:38.280]  No, no, he looked just like that, I remember.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.280]  Okay.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.120]  Because kind of, kind of terrifying.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.360]  He's got mad scientist hair, he's got lightning bolt eyebrows.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:47.360]  His shoes are mismatched.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:53.760]  Yeah, and it's not even really the hair, it's more the like bloodshot eyes and how aggressive
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]  he is.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.320]  He's pretty creepy.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.200]  It's the combination of like the creepy mad scientist vibe, the bloodshot eyes, and that
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.300]  he's just like straight up mean to you.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:09.240]  Like calls you an idiot and like calls you a fool and like yells at you when you go in
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240]  his house.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.240]  I know, it's great.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.240]  It's great.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.240]  I love Daryl.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.680]  Pretty intense.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:20.080]  He's like Wile E. Coyote as a human.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.920]  And then the two, the twins.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.580]  Yeah, the twins.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.200]  Also very intense character design.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:35.640]  Just like wild looking old men in overalls, matching overalls, and same-
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.640]  Everything.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.280]  I don't know what, I don't know what kind of bald you call that.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280]  They got the-
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280]  Friar bald, maybe?
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280]  I don't know.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.080]  They got, I guess so, they got the male pattern baldness, but big puffs around the edges.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.080]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.280]  I like the twins.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:04.720]  The American politician from the like 1700s, or the 1800s, like hair sideburn situation
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.720]  going on.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.720]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.440]  Nailed it.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.520]  That Martin Van Buren do.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:11.520]  Yes.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.760]  The Martin Van Buren do.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:24.480]  Yeah, Charlie and Cole, their names were changed to, well, first of all, they're pyro, gosh,
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.200]  what's the word?
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.200]  They're fireworks makers.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.480]  Gosh, I forgot the actual word.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.480]  Pyrotechnicians?
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480]  Is that it?
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.480]  Okay, well, yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480]  I don't know.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.480]  Pyrotechnics?
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.480]  Yeah, pyrotechnics.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.720]  They were going to be pyrotechnics.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.740]  They're fireworks makers and they look it because they're all dirty and covered in ash
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:51.200]  and soot and they probably blew off their hair.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.000]  They're all like very unique characters.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.640]  And like I said, if I wasn't as used to how kind of wild the character design has been
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.920]  in some of the more recent story of season stuff, like pioneers of all town had some
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.760]  wild character designs too.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:17.920]  Very unique, which I appreciate that they are utilizing a more unique art style to them,
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.760]  character style to them.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:26.880]  Mostly for supporting characters, the player characters and the bachelors, other than Gustavo,
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:38.200]  all kind of still look, you know, your anime average attractive anime character.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:45.240]  There's no crazy, you know, proportions or anything between them, it's just what you
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240]  would expect.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.920]  Okay, so there is one big exception though.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:59.880]  And this is the point of, this is the thorny subject, let's say, you know Gordy the artist,
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880]  yes?
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]  Yes.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]  Okay.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.080]  Do you know what he looked like originally?
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.080]  I don't.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.640]  I'll take you, I'll give you a second here.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.880]  Just do quick Google search.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.000]  What does Gordy look like originally from Wonderful Life?
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.400]  I'm having trouble typing.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400]  That's okay.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.960]  The listener can type too, because this is important.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.960]  Oh!
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960]  Yeah.
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.960]  Okay.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960]  Yeah.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:35.960]  So, um, okay, Gordy's a good talking point because that's absolutely not what I was expecting.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:36.960]  Right?
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:44.320]  So I like, I think this is a good talking point for a lot of the updates or translation
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:51.920]  changes they made, because for people who didn't look at the image, in the original
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:20:01.200]  Gordy was a huge hokey-eaten muscular guy with a most spiky mohawk and a bandana around
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.600]  his neck.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.600]  Very tough looking guy.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.200]  Tingled jaw.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200]  Yeah.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.320]  Angry looking brow.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.020]  Yep.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:23.220]  And in this remake, he now looks like a jock with pretty boy eyes and blonde hair, no mohawk
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:27.660]  anymore, and regular proportioned.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:28.660]  And so...
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:31.020]  Just a buff, sexy jock, you know?
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.020]  Yeah.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.220]  Bandana around his head.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.220]  Right?
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:36.220]  And so there's...
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.740]  He keeps the sweat out while he's sculpting.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.060]  I don't know.
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.060]  Yeah.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.060]  So that's...
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:46.580]  Like, okay, so the thing is, some things needed updating, right?
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:52.340]  Like there was definitely some stereotypes back then that I definitely needed updating
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.540]  from that original design, right?
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.540]  But...
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.540]  100%.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:57.540]  There was...
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:01.820]  Like, Gordy's original design, I absolutely needed updating.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.980]  Yep.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:12.820]  I still think they lost some things that they didn't need to necessarily.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.860]  I think they could have made them a little bigger, not just tall, you know?
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:17.340]  A little buffer.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.860]  They have, you know, they have different body types.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:27.340]  I mean, Van, the traveling salesman, looks like an egg.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.620]  And also his favorite item is eggs.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:30.620]  So...
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.620]  There you go.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:38.580]  But yeah, so they have, you know, they have some more goofier, cartoony looking, as you
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.580]  said, designs, right?
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:42.220]  Like the twins and Daryl.
[01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:45.900]  It stinks that they kind of didn't lean into it, but they, like you said, it's probably
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:52.420]  because he's now a bachelor candidate and that they probably did that.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.420]  But I don't know.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:56.220]  Like, there's still some stuff like...
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.740]  The bandana around his neck, I think that could have been kept.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.820]  I think that would have made a big difference.
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:02.820]  The hair could have been different.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.540]  And again, a lot of this is personal stuff, but my point being is that there are some
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:12.500]  translation stuff or updates that they made that I don't necessarily agree with.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.200]  They actually went into big detail about it on their blog.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:22.820]  They're trying to stick closer to the original, like, Japanese version of it.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:29.500]  But I think there's some stuff from the remake that are so fondly etched in people's memories,
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:33.780]  like Molly, one of the female bachelorettes.
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.280]  She was originally called Muffy.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:42.700]  And that was just a, not arbitrary, but again, they were trying to match the original Japanese
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.320]  names closer.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.680]  So just little details like that, like, eh, I think maybe they could have stuck to the
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.420]  original English translation.
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:58.100]  But that's, I guess, just a personal preference philosophy thing.
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:05.160]  But yeah, it's really interesting to look at Gordy, his design changes.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:11.620]  And I think that speaks a lot to the remake in general, like how much effort they put
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:12.620]  into it.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.620]  Mm-hmm.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:24.380]  Yeah, and I think it depends too on the art team and the original artists or whoever,
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:29.100]  if they decide that they have a different vision now than they did then.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.620]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:41.380]  That's kind of their call, but I do agree that, like I said, I don't think that maybe
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:52.260]  some of the super extreme directions is something that we could necessarily hope for, for the
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:57.300]  bachelors and bachelorettes, but I do kind of wish, I agree that I wish that there were
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:07.100]  a little bit more variation as far as body type or, you know, kind of general personality.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:12.820]  I mean, there are different personalities, but it's kind of your standard personalities
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.900]  that you would expect.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:21.580]  There's nothing wild that you could get out of it, but all of the really wild characters
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:32.740]  are not marriage candidates, which, but there's still, that's where I think maybe the compromise
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:43.220]  was is that they kept some of the NPCs, like really extreme like character designs, and
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:48.220]  the ones that they turned into bachelors and bachelorettes kind of, you know, softened
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.460]  them up or whatever.
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:55.860]  And in cases like Gordy's, you know, fixed some, uh...
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:56.860]  Issues?
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.860]  Issues?
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:58.860]  Yep.
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.860]  Uh...
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:00.860]  Okay.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:07.540]  Speaking, speaking of issues, there's two more characters I think we should talk about.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:08.540]  Okay.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:14.020]  Pui, the little bearded guy.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.460]  Do you know what he looked like in the original?
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.300]  I don't.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:26.380]  I don't know enough about Pui, but I get that the idea that like maybe, I don't know.
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:35.700]  So in this one, Pui is a kind of like harvest sprite, sort of, maybe, I don't know.
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:42.420]  I can't, I can't really say for sure, but I'm now looking at what Pui looked like previously.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:44.260]  Yep.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.940]  Uh...
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:51.300]  So Pui, uh, now he looks like he has, kind of just looks like a caveman.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.300]  Yeah.
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.300]  He was a beggar guy.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.900]  His little butterflies around his head.
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.940]  They used to be just flies.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:58.940]  Yeah.
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:25:59.940]  Uh...
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:00.940]  Yep.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.940]  Yep.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:09.940]  It's an interesting one, I suggest for people to look that one up.
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:13.180]  That one's...
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.180]  I get it.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.860]  Like, I can see why they wanted to steer from that, but...
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:18.860]  Yeah.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.860]  Yeah.
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:20.860]  Alright.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:21.860]  That one I'm not so bugged by.
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:27.540]  And I think a big part of it is the new version, I think, is still really interesting, right?
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:35.660]  Because he's like a ford man with like forest pants and a flower hat with butterflies.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:39.180]  So they're with something different, but it's still interesting.
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:40.980]  Yeah.
[01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:50.020]  And uh, but the other one, the other one that's a really big save is Lumine, the bachelorette
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.860]  that lives in the big mansion house.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860]  The rich girl.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:54.860]  Yep.
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.780]  Do you know what she looked like in the original?
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.780]  Uh...
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:05.260]  Her design was actually pretty similar, it's just, she was just a child in the original.
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.260]  Yeah.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:08.540]  Um, looks quite young.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.540]  I don't...
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.540]  Was she actually...
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:13.980]  So this is when you were saying that they're not like GB characters.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:23.900]  My feeling about that was that like, I appreciate that because it doesn't, it feels weird, especially
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:27.300]  now as an adult, maybe not as a kid.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:31.740]  It didn't feel as weird and I probably wouldn't have thought about it at all, but as an adult
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:38.100]  now playing these games, it does feel weird that even though my character looks like a
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:43.460]  child, I am trying to like, uh, court a child.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:54.500]  Like that feels strange, so, uh, not identifying them, like making them more like grown adults
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:58.900]  makes it, or not like grown adults, but making them more, you know, look more grown makes
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:01.300]  it feel more appropriate I guess.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.660]  Here's the thing with Lumine, in the original, she was just a child.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.340]  She was not a candidate.
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.400]  That's horrifying.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.580]  And then in the later updated version, they made her romanceable in a weird way.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.900]  It's it's pretty bad.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:17.900]  Okay.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:18.900]  Yikes.
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:24.220]  I, I guess I don't, yeah, like I don't know how old your character is supposed to be.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:30.420]  I don't know, but, um, but it does, um, that does feel weird.
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:31.420]  Yep.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.060]  Um, but I digress.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:39.500]  That's that's just for the history for the listeners, so you can get some flavor.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.460]  Uh, yeah, some much needed updates to some things, I think.
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:45.460]  Yep.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.000]  Some, um, okay.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.540]  But while we're on the topic of bachelor's match, let's, let's, let's run down the list
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:51.540]  real quick.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.540]  Cause there's not many of them.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:55.240]  There's Cecilia, the farm girl.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.460]  She lives on a nearby farm.
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.760]  She's sweet and down to earth.
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.180]  There's Molly.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:07.440]  She's works at the cafe, not no longer a bar now a cafe.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.200]  She's the blonde, just ex city girl.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.600]  Um, yep.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.880]  There is Nami who I think got an excellent upgrade in this one still, um, still similar
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:22.040]  design, but like now she has her jacket around her waist instead of wearing it.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.120]  Um, she's a wanderer.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:29.920]  She's kind of tough, well not necessarily tough, but just, I don't know how to describe
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:37.600]  her like, yeah, she's, you know, kind of more standoffish, a little more reserved, I guess.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600]  Right.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.980]  Um, a little more reserved and a little bit more, um, like, I don't know if aggressive
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:49.080]  is the word, but yeah, she's, uh, she did, yeah, she's, she's doesn't beat around the
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.280]  bush as much as other people or whatever.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.880]  Um, there's pretty blunt, straightforward.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.880]  Yep.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:02.880]  Uh, she is, let's see, there are, there's Lumine as we mentioned, who is now, uh, I
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.960]  think young adult, like early twenties, like late teens, maybe because after the time skip,
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.960]  she does look even older considerably.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.000]  Um, but, uh, she's a rich orphan girl.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.320]  Um, she's prim and proper because that's her aunt raised her.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:28.040]  There is Gordy, the artist we mentioned, um, very stoic, uh, which was a fun thing about
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:33.320]  his original design, like, you know, this big bodybuilder guy, but he was still very
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.360]  sensitive and stoic.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.080]  Um, but, uh, anyways, I digress, at least they kept that personality, which was nice.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:47.360]  Um, there's Matt, uh, who lives on the farm with, uh, Cecilia, she, she's basically the
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.320]  male equivalent, but he's a sourpuss.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.040]  Um, he's a frowny boy.
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:59.680]  Uh, there is Gustavo, the musician who has been yesified and, uh, I feel like I'm missing
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:00.680]  one.
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:01.680]  Who am I missing?
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.680]  Oh, Wally.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:07.040]  He's like a easygoing guy.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.960]  Kind of looks, he's got a, that's kind of his whole thing.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.000]  Just chill and easygoing.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:18.320]  Um, yeah, I think those are all the candidates, which is a big upgrade from just three in
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.800]  the original.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:25.520]  Um, so with that said, who'd you pick Micah?
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.080]  Uh, I picked Molly.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:33.560]  I originally was, cause I kind of like to, you know, I'm putting myself in this position
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:41.600]  of like, I'm living out this fantasy of like moving out to the middle of nowhere and living
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.320]  on a farm and you know, that's, those are my responsibilities.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.560]  It's farm life.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560]  It's not city life.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:59.360]  It's not, you know, uh, and so I originally wanted to, uh, try to marry Flora because
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:05.680]  I felt that Flora more closely resembled my real life partner, Becky.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.920]  I've wanted to marry Flora since the original too.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:17.120]  In like personality and, uh, like interests and, um, then I, when I found out that you
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:21.720]  couldn't romance Flora, which I'm still angry about it 20 years later.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.720]  What's that?
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.120]  I'm still angry about it 20 years later.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:36.040]  Uh, then I, I started romancing Molly and that was when I, I did sort of feel like,
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:44.040]  you know, she's got more depth to her personality too, that like feels also feels pretty similar
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:54.600]  and also she's blonde, like Becky's blonde, but when you start unlocking the, you know,
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:01.160]  they have the standard milestone points in relationship where you get cut scenes and
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:09.240]  you view certain things like, um, Molly's story being that she was a city girl and she
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:15.040]  left and she, you know, moved to this small town to work in a small town and she goes
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:20.920]  back and visits with her city friends and it doesn't feel the same and she feels like,
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.440]  you know, she doesn't belong there anymore and she like, she belongs in a small town
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:31.860]  and uh, you know, out in nature in the middle of nowhere kind of, uh, and that I feel like
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:39.880]  is very much Becky's mentality about, you know, wanting to live more in nature and not
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:44.160]  as much in, uh, you know, busy city life.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.640]  So pretty accurate.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.640]  Who did you pick?
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:55.520]  So, because we talked about Flora not being an available, I know, and I'm still upset
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.520]  about it.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:06.740]  Um, but, uh, I did waste, um, so I looked at the original three, um, uh, Cecilia, uh,
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:13.560]  Molly and, uh, Nami, um, because I felt like they were really polished, which I guess,
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.040]  you know, it's considered they were, they're original candidates make sense.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.600]  Um, so I was waffling between the three.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:29.600]  Um, but, uh, at the end of the day, I went back to the OG Cecilia, the one in my original
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.600]  pick.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.280]  So I, I couldn't, I couldn't do her dirty.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.880]  I just, I had to stand by her.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:42.520]  I will say it was, they do make it a little bit tough to not pick Cecilia because they
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:50.160]  do, there are more, um, it felt like more, not like forced interactions with Cecilia,
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:58.200]  but there, I felt like I hit milestones with Cecilia faster than I was anybody else.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.200]  She's the only one that you, or how should I put it?
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.200]  She's at the siege.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.720]  She, you can buy seeds from her, right?
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.720]  Like, yes.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.720]  Right.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.360]  That's, that's the key differentiator, like, even if you don't talk to her, she'll be hanging
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.880]  around the farm when you go buy seeds.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.080]  So yeah, no, that's a, that's a big, uh, that's a big part of it for sure.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:24.640]  But um, yeah, but yeah, no, she was the, uh, probably in any game ever, the furthest like
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.440]  romance option I've ever picked.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.880]  So I had to go back there.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.400]  Um, that makes sense.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.400]  Yeah.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.120]  But, uh, but yeah, but yeah, I will say it was a lot tougher because I think they really
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.640]  did polish the other candidates a lot more.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.640]  And that's great to see.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.760]  Um, I remember Molly was a bit like ditzier in the original it felt like, but now she's
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:56.320]  got that whole story, like you said, um, and Nami, I think she was even a little more aggressive
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.980]  or meaner, I guess for lack of a better way of putting in the original, but they softened
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:07.500]  her up a bit and they made her seem more like a, like, not smarty pants, but like she
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.220]  has a good head on her shoulder, right?
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:13.660]  Like she's a, she's a deep thinker and you can really see that in this one and, and I
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.660]  appreciate it.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.580]  Um, and also, like I said, she has a great new design, um, her messy hair and the jacket
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:20.580]  around the waist.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.580]  Good calls.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:22.580]  Good calls.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.580]  Yeah.
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:33.740]  I feel like, um, thinking about it now that the, the like male candidates do feel more,
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:41.980]  with the exception of Rock, the male candidates feel more, um, like adult or like more grown
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:47.700]  than the, uh, female candidates do, which is interesting.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:57.500]  I don't know, I'm sure there's some, um, like critique there that I don't have the like
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:04.360]  capacity for, but, uh, and I'm sure that there's some kind of like weird connotation that can
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.900]  be derived from that, but, uh, about, you know, the people who designed it.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:13.740]  Well, I mean, I can, I can tell you where that comes from.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:23.660]  It's uh, the, okay, so the original game, uh, had three, uh, Molly, Cecilia and Nami,
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:24.660]  right?
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:30.360]  So the other characters were still present, Gustavo, Gordie, Rock, Matt, they were all
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:35.580]  still present, um, but they were just regular NPCs.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:41.340]  So they had, uh, like we talked about, their, their personality.
[01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:46.180]  Because there wasn't, uh, because there wasn't same-sex marriage.
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:47.180]  Yep.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:51.120]  And, but no, hold it, hold it, hold it, but it gets better because...
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.020]  The ability to have a, you know, non-male protagonist.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.020]  Yeah, but it gets better.
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.240]  Do you know why?
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:01.100]  Because they released a version called Another Wonderful Life, which was the girl version.
[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.980]  I do know that.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.980]  Yep.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:04.980]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.380]  I mean, it wasn't, there's just, there was, uh, Harvest Moon has a history of that.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.860]  I mean, there was like Friends of Mineral Town and then more Friends of Mineral Town,
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.700]  which gave you the ability to play as a girl.
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:20.900]  And then there was, uh, Harvest Moon Girl, like straight up just Harvest Moon Girl.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:22.860]  I forgot about that one.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:30.540]  But, you know, it's, that's, they, they've got a history of that, uh, which is, you know,
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:31.540]  not great.
[01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:39.340]  The, uh, actual ver- the actual name was, uh, Harvest Moon for Girl, just the like Japanese
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:42.380]  translation of that game.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:50.340]  Uh, that makes a lot more sense now that you say that, um, and it does make sense that
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:54.980]  like, I guess I didn't really, I knew that there was a Wonderful Life and Another Wonderful
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:59.220]  Life and I knew that it was like a gender difference.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:05.820]  Um, for the protagonist, I just kind of, I forgot that that existed because I'm like
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:13.440]  focused on this, but also I do still think that they could have made like a little bit
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:22.420]  more of a, um, I don't know, like a, not to say that like Cecilia or, uh, Molly or Nami
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:27.500]  don't, you know, groan, they just feel more like your character's age.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:28.500]  Yeah.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:30.020]  Well, they're-
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:39.460]  The three male candidates do, like, like Matt and, uh, Gordy and Gustavo all feel much older
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.940]  than your character is.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.700]  It's, uh, it's their storylines.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:44.700]  It's their storylines.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.700]  What's that?
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:46.700]  I think it's their storylines.
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:55.300]  Like, uh, cause Nami, Cecilia, and, uh, Molly are all kind of at a young adult, like still
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:40:01.140]  figuring out where their life is kind of headed, point, while the other characters
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.780]  are just kind of doing their thing.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.340]  Gustavo just plays his music.
[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:11.780]  Gordy does his art, Matt is a Sarepus who is tired of the farm or whatever.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:14.300]  Um, so I think that's, uh,
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:20.580]  Yeah, it just, you know, it's, it just seems interesting that there's like not a, you know,
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:22.540]  more of a balance in that regard, I guess.
[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:33.260]  And I would guess probably there is some level of, uh, you know, it's like baked into the,
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:42.700]  the designers, you know, that that's kind of like the, uh, gender differences.
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.700]  Yeah.
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:47.380]  Um, I, it, it kinda, you know, it feels like that.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:51.420]  I don't think it's, you know, like a huge like point of contention or anything.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:56.580]  It's just an interesting thing to, to note that, like, I, that I didn't really think
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:57.580]  about much.
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:05.300]  Cause I do, like, there are male candidates that I, I do think are like, you know, good
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:10.540]  designs and like attractive characters, like they're all for the most part, aside from
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:17.580]  Rock, which I feel weird about, cause he feels so much like a child, like more so than like
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:22.780]  the other, even the, like, you know, female candidates do for whatever reason, he just
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:33.500]  has like his character design just feels very like young, but Matt and Gordy and, uh, Gustavo,
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:39.500]  I've definitely felt like less weird, you know, having like an attraction towards those
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:44.180]  characters because they felt more mature.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.860]  I don't know if that's the best way to put it.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:49.220]  I get you, I get you, I totally get you.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:55.780]  But that's, you know, like me as the player kind of like metagaming in that way where
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:05.820]  the less adult feel like, like full grown adult feeling, um, female candidates match
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:11.540]  more of the age that I feel like my player character is, which is like a, I don't know,
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.540]  it's a weird thing.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:19.980]  Definitely a weird thing to navigate for, like the age of your character in games that
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.780]  have like relationships and dating and things like that.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:30.140]  I mean, you know, I mean, if there's any game to think about that's this one, because age
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.140]  is a thing.
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:33.260]  Your character will age as you play the game.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:34.260]  Yes.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.260]  Right.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:41.580]  Um, and on that note, I just, uh, I guess let's talk about the time skip a little since
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:42.620]  you did hit it.
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.060]  Um, I mean, first of all, you have a kid, right?
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.060]  Like that.
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:49.180]  And that's, and, and again, this is one of the few games that forces you to get married
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:54.060]  because if you don't pick someone, the game will automatically hook you up with whoever's
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:58.260]  like your best, your highest affection or whatever.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:04.220]  Um, yeah, I actually did not know that until I was looking at the, those tips.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:08.180]  Cause I was already deep into the, I think by the time I started looking at tips, I was
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.580]  already engaged.
[01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:10.580]  Huh.
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:11.580]  Okay.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:17.420]  To Molly, I hit engagement at like, I like early fall.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:18.540]  Like it was very quick.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.540]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.540]  You can do it real easy with Molly.
[01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:21.540]  What's that?
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.340]  You can do it real easy with Molly.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:25.980]  She's got to give her flowers so you can.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:26.980]  Yeah.
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:33.220]  It's once you, like, once you know the things and like Daryl too, I hit really early, um,
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:37.820]  just giving him the, the like coins from the, from the mine.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:43.540]  It seems like they're pretty generous, at least with most characters, uh, with the like
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:44.860]  friendship levels.
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:46.580]  Yeah, they are.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.200]  As long as you like keep up with it.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:57.340]  But it's, again, it's like every, uh, NPC, every character in the cast has multiple things
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:58.860]  that they like.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.640]  So you can give them one of those like categories every day.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.380]  So like you can give them up to like three gifts or something, which is kind of, yeah,
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:15.220]  um, but yeah, yeah, um, uh, one of the, going back to the time skip thing, one of the interesting
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:23.060]  things is as you're aging, so is the rest of the town, like, uh, spoilers.
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:28.900]  As you mentioned, uh, Gary, um, you can't give him gifts anymore in year two and that's
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:35.580]  because he's depressed because his wife actually passes away between years one and two.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:42.660]  Um, uh, there's a new family that moves in, there's a new home that's built, um, and,
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:48.100]  and little touches like that, which are fun to see, you know, seeing it makes the town
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:53.580]  feel more alive and again, gives you a little more depth as you navigate new relationships
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:58.220]  or how relationships change as people age and things happen.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:02.580]  Um, so I do think that's, uh, that's nice.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:06.980]  It fits well with the, well, you know, how they designed it, like life changes.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.620]  And so you got to update how you approach it.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.900]  Um, yep.
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.940]  So that's, uh, that's good.
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:19.380]  Um, were there any other characters you wanted to talk about?
[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:32.540]  Um, uh, like character specifically, not particularly, um, uh, well, or maybe I should, I mean, there
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:43.020]  is the like story of seasons, harvest moon, like, uh, uh, harvest goddess slash, uh, harvest
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.020]  sprites.
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:45.020]  Yeah.
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:49.100]  They don't do much in this situation, but it's, it's more limited to, it's not like
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.820]  there's a ton of harvest sprites.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:58.140]  It's limited to these like three main harvest sprites that are kind of the, like, uh, you
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.380]  know, they're like a little trio.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380]  And they're fun.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.380]  They're fun characters.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:05.380]  I like their designs and stuff.
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:06.380]  They give you recipes.
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:10.020]  I remember them very distinctly from the GameCube one too.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:12.620]  They didn't have that big a role in the GameCube one either.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:16.500]  Um, surprisingly, this is one where they put the whole harvest goddess thing kind of in
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:17.820]  the background.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:22.900]  Um, but they also keep track of like an achievement system now, which is kind of nice.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:28.260]  Um, but, uh, well, there's one more character I want to talk about, but I think I'll save
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.380]  it for just a minute.
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:31.060]  Is there anything else you want to add about the game?
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:34.700]  Cause I think we've done a pretty good job talking about it.
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:44.940]  Uh, yeah, I think it's, I, I think it's got a really good system for, um, keeping you
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:53.740]  engaged throughout like multiple years rather than like I do again, I like that it's like
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:58.940]  farm sim light where, you know, it's kind of like speed runs you through a year.
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:07.260]  Um, not in a way that feels rushed, just that, you know, uh, it's, it's much more comfortable.
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:14.260]  Um, it does take a little bit of getting used to because there's that, you know, kind of
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:19.500]  managing the crops that they, there aren't a ton right away.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:24.080]  There's not a ton of crops, but you do get access to all of the crops that you can use
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:27.140]  in year one right away in spring.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:33.860]  So you can see when you go to get the seeds, it'll say like this grows between, you know,
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:36.220]  from spring to autumn or whatever.
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:41.740]  Uh, and then there's trees that give fruit and those flower in one season and then actually
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:44.820]  produce fruit in the next season.
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:51.580]  So you can kind of plan out, um, what it's going to be, but, uh, it took a little bit
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:55.540]  of like getting your bearings to understand, cause it doesn't tell you flat out how many
[01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:57.020]  days something takes to grow.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:58.020]  Yeah.
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.020]  That's, that's one of the big ones.
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:04.660]  It just tells you like quickly or, uh, kind of quickly or not quickly, you know, like
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:09.660]  there's like a really vague idea of how long it takes for the plants to grow or for the
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:10.900]  crops to grow.
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:17.700]  So you can think like, Oh, this grows quickly, so I'm going to plant it and then take care
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.700]  of it.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:25.000]  And it will grow in like a couple of days since the season is only 10 days long when
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:33.160]  really quickly can mean like day, day eight, you're getting the crops like, uh, and they'll
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:38.480]  still, you know, grow into maybe that, maybe that crop will grow into the next season or
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:39.480]  two.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.880]  Um, and typically for the ones that take longer time to grow, they go into those next seasons,
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.040]  uh, like across multiple seasons.
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.040]  So that's fine.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.920]  It's just, it's not obvious right away.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:55.600]  So it takes year one is definitely that like trial run of seeing how things work.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.940]  Um, there were a couple of times where I had planted something thinking I had plenty of
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:05.480]  time because of how it was presented and I did not have enough time.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:13.640]  Uh, and I was curious too, because you can, you can water your crops twice a day for most,
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:14.640]  most crops.
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:21.360]  Um, and I was curious if that speeds up the growth time.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:27.160]  And I, I Googled that and I was looking at, uh, a Reddit post about it and it was a more
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  recent one.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:32.520]  So it was people talking about the remake and not the original, which was kind of difficult
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:38.520]  in its own way, Googling things and having to sort through like the original and the
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.520]  remake.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:46.000]  Uh, but there was a Reddit post that was discussing it and somebody had kind of like tested it
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:54.240]  and the amount of times that you water apparently doesn't have any bearing on how, how fast
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:58.960]  the crops grow or, uh, the quality of the crop or anything like that.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.520]  Like as long as you keep it alive, it will grow pretty much the same amount of time.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:11.760]  So if I had one gripe about the game, I guess it would be that, that there's no, like, it's
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:20.320]  just so vague on what the timeframe is for crop growing and like the, um, the mechanics
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.640]  for crop growing that you don't, it's kind of hard to like really in a casual playthrough
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:33.720]  even just like figure out what you have to do to, to kind of like optimize things from
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.720]  season to season.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.720]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:41.860]  But other than that, I think that, you know, it's, it's nice having those shorter seasons.
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:48.680]  It's nice having like the, uh, um, limited casts.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.120]  I really love how the story evolves over time.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.480]  I'm a big fan of the, of like time skip, uh, type stuff.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.920]  One of my favorite, um, Dragon Quest games, I'm a big Dragon Quest fan.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.840]  One of my favorite Dragon Quest games is Dragon Quest V and that, uh, utilizes time skips
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.840]  in a very similar way.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.120]  So, um, I'm always excited to see stuff like that.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.120]  Yeah.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:14.120]  Yeah.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:15.120]  That's cool.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:18.400]  It's like, that was their mission statement to make this.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:20.200]  That's why they even title it Wonderful Life, right?
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:25.600]  It's a game that goes over periods of life and I think they do that very well.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.140]  Um, yeah, so, um, yeah.
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:34.920]  And it, in a unique way that like kind of forces you into it, like it forces you to
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:41.800]  experience your full life rather than just, you can, it's, you can get to it if you want
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:42.800]  to.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:43.800]  Like it's not a subplot.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.320]  It's the main, the main quest, you know?
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.320]  Yep.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:51.120]  You got to face that existentialism head on.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:52:00.720]  Um, uh, now, um, uh, there's just two more things I want to say.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.800]  Um, the first, uh, I think it's important to note, especially for Al, uh, there is no
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:09.900]  automation, there is no sprinklers, there is no auto collector.
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.760]  You have got to grind those chores out.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.120]  Sorry Al.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.120]  But it's fine.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.120]  It's not that bad.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.880]  It's, or at least, yeah, it's worse than other games.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:21.560]  Um, because like when you upgrade your can, you, you get through those fields pretty quickly
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.160]  when you upgrade the can.
[01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.560]  Um, right.
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:29.600]  And it's also like, you don't have a, you have really limited space for where your crops
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.600]  are.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.720]  It's not like you can build out this massive farm that's just crops.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:39.800]  You are literally like, you have the two fields that you can do.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:43.480]  Like there's two that you start with two smaller ones that you start with and then the bigger
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.360]  one that you unlock, like you said.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.160]  So that is like the extent of crops you can grow.
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:55.920]  Like, it's not like you're building out these huge, uh, fields that you need automation
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.920]  for.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:57.920]  Yep.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.920]  Um, yeah, no, so I, I, I'm fine with it.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:04.680]  Like I think it shows its age a little there, but I think it still works.
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:11.580]  Um, uh, and uh, my last point, unless you have anything else to add Micah, um, we did
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:19.020]  not discuss the, uh, the best part of the game, the, the, um, show stealing character,
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:27.300]  the, uh, the true marriage candidate we all want, uh, Mookoo Mookoo, uh, it's only appearing
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:31.220]  on tragedy only appearing during winter.
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:37.940]  Uh, if you head out to the forest, uh, you will find a large cryptid Yeti like creature
[01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:40.500]  named Mookoo Mookoo.
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:43.980]  Um, I don't know why Mookoo Mookoo is there.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.300]  It's never explained.
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:49.780]  Everyone seems cool with Mookoo Mookoo, except for Daryl who wants to hunt him, uh, or her
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.780]  it I don't know.
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:58.140]  Um, uh, and uh, Mookoo Mookoo is the best Mookoo Mookoo is the best that's, that's all
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:59.140]  I need to say.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:00.140]  I love Mookoo Mookoo.
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:05.860]  Very cute bow, uh, very cute, like mustache thing.
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:06.860]  Yup.
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:07.860]  Yup.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:12.100]  Apparently in Japan, there was a pre-order bonus that gives you a Mookoo Mookoo outfit
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:14.900]  that we never got, which is kind of terrible.
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:17.840]  Well, Oh, you know, fine.
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.340]  If they can release a plush, I'll be happy.
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:21.580]  Give me a Mookoo Mookoo plush.
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:22.580]  Yeah.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:23.580]  Darn it.
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.480]  All right.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:31.700]  That was a wonderful chat about a wonderful game called a wonderful life.
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.420]  It was very good.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:36.140]  Thank you very much Micah for joining me on that.
[01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:37.420]  Yeah, of course.
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:38.740]  Thank you for having me.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:47.500]  I'm always, uh, ready to talk about, I mean, I'm always ready to talk about any cozy game,
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:48.500]  cottagecore game.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:55.940]  Cause I love all of them quite a bit, but, uh, harvest moon slash story of seasons was
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:01.460]  my entry point for farm, farm Sims and life Sims and stuff.
[01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:05.520]  I mean, not just you, it's always nice to play them and talk.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.920]  It's kind of like the groundbreaker trailblazer, right?
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.920]  Like it's doji.
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:16.600]  Um, all right, Micah, where can people find you on the internet if you would like to be
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:17.600]  found?
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:24.680]  Uh, you, this is a loaded question these days.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:31.000]  I am still on Twitter, but I'm not using it nearly as much as I used to, uh, at Micah
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  the Brave.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.720]  I'm pretty much at Micah the Brave everywhere.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:42.320]  I am currently on, uh, I'm also on threads, which, you know, Twitter too slash Facebook
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.320]  too, I guess.
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]  I don't know.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.080]  It's Instagram's Twitter.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:51.520]  Uh, and also on blue sky at Micah the Brave.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:58.640]  Um, blue sky is very quiet right now, which is like a nice, kind of a nice difference
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:03.600]  from threads because threads is very intense right now.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:10.600]  A lot of signups, uh, blue sky seems, I, at least right now, because it's mostly, you
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.520]  know, art people that I know, it's just a lot of people posting their art and sharing
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:15.520]  their art, which is kind of neat.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:17.160]  Hey, that sounds nice.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:24.920]  Uh, I'm also on Instagram at Micah the Brave, I'm on Tumblr, you know, kind of all over
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:25.920]  the place.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:31.000]  I don't use all of it that often, but those are the places you can find me.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  Okay.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.520]  Um, and do find him.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.880]  Micah, uh, in case you don't, uh, might not remember, is an incredible artist.
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:45.240]  He made the corn logo that, uh, the Harvest Season uses.
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.240]  Aw, shucks.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:48.760]  Um, uh, his art makes me happy every time I see it.
[01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.360]  Really anything he posts makes me happy.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.160]  He's a wonderful and wonderful person.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:53.160]  Um.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.160]  Thanks.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.160]  You too.
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:56.400]  You're a good artist too.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.400]  Thank you.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:58.400]  I, I try.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:01.920]  Um, speaking of which, I'm going to shill my own stuff here.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:06.880]  Find me at Koopaprez on Twitter if you want to see me retweeting other funnier, smarter
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:14.560]  people, or my art account at SpriterSquared where I make pixel art of different things.

[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.000]  and other places.

[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:13.080]  reactions as he listens to this episode, uh, and you can also gain access to our, uh, Patreon
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:20.360]  exclusive premium, uh, show called The Green House where we talk about, uh, other stuff
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:28.040]  that aren't farming games, unless we talk about one that maybe is a farming game.
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.040]  Unless.
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:33.440]  Trust me, you're going to want to listen to this Green House.
[01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:36.120]  It's, okay, I want to give the-
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:40.360]  I don't think anyone else is talking about the game that we're talking about.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:45.200]  I want to be clear that the Green House I just recorded with Micah, um, I learned the
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:49.560]  game's existence about 15 minutes before when he texted me, hey, can we do a Green House
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.040]  on this game?
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.240]  Yeah, I'm amped about it.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:59:01.720]  Yup, I want to see it, uh, I want to talk about this game, um, so, uh, tune in and find
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:11.560]  out what game it is, um, because even if we told you, you wouldn't know what it is.
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:17.720]  But thank you again, Micah, for all these lovely chats, and until next time, dear listeners,
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.720]  have a good harvest.
[01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:52.800]  Nailed it.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:57.000]  All right.
[01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  You know-
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.680]  Better than I've ever done on the timing for the Have a Good Harvest.
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:02.680]  Honestly, me too.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:06.080]  Al's going to be upset.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:08.960]  Did you, did you notice Daryl's shoes were mismatched?
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:10.440]  I didn't notice that until year two.
