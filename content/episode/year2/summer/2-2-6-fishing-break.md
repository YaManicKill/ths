[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Music
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.100]  Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is
[00:35.100 --> 00:42.080]  Al. My name is Kelly. And we are here today to talk about more fishing. Fishing.
[00:42.080 --> 00:49.120]  Fishing games. I mean it's summer so it fits. Fishing month this is, I think, this is the
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.100]  last episode of fishing month. Welcome Kelly to the last episode of fishing
[00:53.100 --> 00:58.040]  month. Thank you for joining me. It's a real pleasure, I gotta say. I love fishing
[00:58.200 --> 01:05.280]  and fishing games. I loved fishing in real life as a kid so I'm happy to be
[01:05.280 --> 01:08.800]  here. What's your favorite fishing in the farming, not in the farming game, just
[01:08.800 --> 01:15.760]  what's your favorite fishing in any game? And why is it Spiritfarer? I really
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.840]  did like Spiritfarer but I'm not gonna lie I love Stardew which I know is kind
[01:20.840 --> 01:27.840]  of... Interesting. Controversial. Yeah. I love the challenge of it I don't know. Yeah I
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.640]  think that's fair. I think it's like, I think you either really like the
[01:31.640 --> 01:35.400]  difficulty of it or you absolutely hate it and you're just like, just let
[01:35.400 --> 01:39.360]  me catch the fish for goodness sake. I mean I definitely have some of those
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.600]  moments in Stardew where I'm like oh my god especially with like the legendaries
[01:43.600 --> 01:48.200]  and like the rare ones it's like just let me catch his fish. Yeah. But there's
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.360]  definitely been some games I've played where I'm like this is so easy it's
[01:51.360 --> 01:58.800]  boring. Yeah, yeah that's fair. I think there was an episode a couple weeks
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.400]  ago about ranking the fishing minigames. That's this one of one of these out of
[02:02.400 --> 02:04.800]  time things where it's not actually a couple of weeks ago it will have been in
[02:04.800 --> 02:10.000]  a couple of weeks ago. Where Johnny and Kev rank the fishing minigames and
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.040]  that's one of the things they talk about is like sometimes it's just kind of in
[02:13.040 --> 02:15.440]  there for the sake of being in there and therefore they don't put much thought
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.520]  into it and it's just kind of like oh yeah just press button. Which is fine
[02:19.520 --> 02:22.880]  but it like you got to think about whether your game actually needs
[02:22.880 --> 02:25.400]  fishing or not like so many of them are just like yeah we'll put fishing in
[02:25.400 --> 02:29.480]  because that's what you do. Yeah exactly it's you can really see which games
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.040]  really want it to be a part of the game and which games are just like oh well
[02:34.040 --> 02:40.840]  it's like a quote-unquote requirement for fishing for farming games. Definitely.
[02:40.840 --> 02:44.800]  Also I thought I love Animal Crossing I just I think maybe because I spent a lot
[02:44.880 --> 02:52.720]  of time doing that. Stockholm syndrome type thing. Yeah so those would
[02:52.720 --> 02:56.760]  definitely be my top two. What about you? I think I think it has to be Spirit
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.760]  of Hater for me which is the one that wins in the fishing minigame episode a
[03:00.760 --> 03:04.440]  few weeks ago because people will have already heard that. The Spirit of Hater
[03:04.440 --> 03:10.200]  was their joint winner as well. I like the balance of difficulty but you
[03:10.200 --> 03:14.720]  can still always do it like there's no kind of like stress time element to it
[03:14.720 --> 03:18.680]  it's just like you see it getting too strong that's fine ease off there you go.
[03:18.680 --> 03:23.480]  Yeah. Like the worst thing that happens is it breaks but the second worst thing
[03:23.480 --> 03:28.360]  is it just takes ages. Yeah and I mean you're already committed to it so what's
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.800]  what's the harm? Exactly. I did love also that you could fish while you were
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.880]  moving. Mmm yeah yeah. Because I feel like that was like you know especially
[03:37.880 --> 03:40.560]  towards the end when I had less to do I was like okay I'm just gonna fish now.
[03:40.560 --> 03:46.160]  Yeah definitely. All right awesome well I guess before we get too far into even
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.560]  though we just had a whole conversation about fishing transcripts are available
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.440]  in the show notes and on the website for the podcast if you need them. This
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.520]  episode obviously there will be no news because again it is fishing month and
[03:57.520 --> 04:03.360]  the last episode of fishing month and so I think we're recording this roughly a
[04:03.360 --> 04:07.360]  month in advance so that's why we've got no news if there's anything breaking
[04:07.600 --> 04:14.720]  then you'll hear about it in two weeks and this episode we're going to talk
[04:14.720 --> 04:19.800]  about fishing break which is a mobile game a fishing mobile game so we'll have
[04:19.800 --> 04:24.640]  lots to say about that soon but first of all Kelly what have you been up to?
[04:24.640 --> 04:30.880]  Well I at this moment just got back from I had been on vacation in Washington
[04:30.880 --> 04:38.240]  State out in the Olympia Peninsula so did a lot of hiking a lot of kayaking it
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.640]  was a lot of fun now I'm back in New York and it's very humid here and
[04:41.640 --> 04:48.040]  disgusting. Mmm you got smoke just now. You know honestly I feel like we're
[04:48.040 --> 04:52.200]  lucking out because I mean I've been monitoring the air quality and and we're
[04:52.200 --> 05:00.920]  at the very very very end of moderately bad air which is like couldn't just it
[05:00.920 --> 05:04.720]  that just kind of happens in New York sometimes anyway in the summer
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.400]  especially so like you missed you missed the worst of it yeah we did miss the
[05:09.400 --> 05:14.520]  worst of it well I was here when it was when the skies were orange oh you the
[05:14.520 --> 05:19.480]  first yeah yeah like two chunks of it but I missed the second time which was
[05:19.480 --> 05:23.920]  nice I did order new air purifiers though just to just to add some more in
[05:23.920 --> 05:29.720]  there yeah yeah unfortunate yeah I mean it doesn't hurt I have cats so they
[05:29.720 --> 05:36.600]  never hurt hmm what have you been up to? Eh not a huge amount in terms of games
[05:36.600 --> 05:43.800]  and stuff like that because my my switch is still broken which I keep checking
[05:43.800 --> 05:48.460]  every day on its progress and nothing's happened yet but it's meant to they say
[05:48.460 --> 05:52.980]  it could take up to 20 working days the 20th working day is the is two days
[05:52.980 --> 05:58.340]  before I leave for my month-long holiday so hopefully it doesn't take the 20 days
[05:58.340 --> 06:05.420]  because that's not getting to me do you have do you have you know you have a few
[06:05.420 --> 06:10.320]  switches I do I do it's not the end of the world but it's the one I really use
[06:10.320 --> 06:15.380]  and it's the one with my Pokemon saves on it the most important one yeah so
[06:15.380 --> 06:19.580]  like I don't really like I'm fine with like a few weeks of not having my switch
[06:19.580 --> 06:22.820]  and not playing it that's fine but like a whole month on holiday I would
[06:22.820 --> 06:27.380]  definitely be like setting up another one of my switches but it's just it's so
[06:27.380 --> 06:32.100]  much effort to like set up a switch and it's like I wouldn't have Pokemon and
[06:32.100 --> 06:38.500]  it's just yeah it's like do I go for my very original switch which obviously is
[06:38.500 --> 06:43.100]  like the the original it's getting pretty old now or do I use a switch
[06:43.100 --> 06:47.900]  light and then I have to use the the smallness with my hands that really
[06:47.900 --> 06:56.860]  struggle now like oh I don't know I did Hollow Knight with the joy cons the
[06:56.860 --> 07:02.140]  first time and I didn't realize towards the end that my the drift had set in oh
[07:02.140 --> 07:07.460]  no I actually didn't realize until I was playing Celeste after that and then I
[07:07.460 --> 07:13.820]  realized how bad the drift was yeah um but I can't I can't do joy cons anymore
[07:13.820 --> 07:19.860]  um and I like I don't know I love those hori like split pad thing yeah yeah
[07:19.860 --> 07:23.340]  that's why I've been using that's that's why I played all of well I've not
[07:23.340 --> 07:26.380]  finished it yet but that's why I have been playing all of Hollow Knight on is
[07:26.380 --> 07:30.900]  there the newer split pad the compact one which feels like it's a really nice
[07:30.900 --> 07:35.300]  balance of the kind of chunkiness but not too chunky and so it still fits
[07:35.300 --> 07:39.260]  nicely in our in a little case and stuff like that see that I've got to say
[07:39.260 --> 07:45.020]  that is the issue with the the normal ones is like even just how like
[07:45.020 --> 07:48.460]  traveling now I brought my switch I didn't actually play it which I gotta
[07:48.460 --> 07:52.060]  say I just realized when you started talking you meant games and not what I
[07:52.060 --> 07:56.100]  was doing in life no it's it's it's stuff in general we expect used to say
[07:56.100 --> 07:59.180]  what what have you been playing but we expanded it because not everybody's been
[07:59.180 --> 08:04.260]  playing something every time so that's that's good that's a good idea but yeah
[08:04.260 --> 08:08.980]  no to travel with it it doesn't fit in anything hmm so it's like I'm just
[08:08.980 --> 08:14.900]  risking ruining the joy cons like the joysticks putting it in my backpack yeah
[08:14.900 --> 08:19.180]  I got a case I got it a separate case that's like slightly bigger than a
[08:19.180 --> 08:23.420]  normal one it's not like ah it's like ah it's like a bag that you slide it into
[08:23.420 --> 08:28.900]  rather than the kind of like clamshell case and it just just fits it with the
[08:28.900 --> 08:34.660]  compact and split pads on it and I don't think it would fit with the pro
[08:34.660 --> 08:40.700]  the split pad pros I think they'd be too big and it's just just perfectly fits in
[08:40.700 --> 08:45.780]  and then I it's got a little front pocket that I put in a little case of
[08:45.780 --> 08:49.620]  games and and to joy con just in case I need some joy con for something because
[08:49.620 --> 08:55.180]  of course the disadvantage of the split pad is it doesn't have the the gyro yeah
[08:55.180 --> 09:02.500]  yeah I have the what is it the 8-bit mmm controller for that yeah yeah I also
[09:02.500 --> 09:07.900]  I've also ordered have you seen there's like a new kind of controller case type
[09:07.900 --> 09:13.740]  thing what is it called no let me need to find it I definitely want to see that
[09:13.740 --> 09:18.540]  because so you know what my my go-to thing to put my switch in is actually a
[09:18.540 --> 09:24.100]  knee brace I'm sorry what now um like like no like it's not like a cast or
[09:24.100 --> 09:30.820]  anything it's like one of those like soft yeah yeah yeah I put it in there
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.180]  because it actually the pressure holds the joy cons in place really interesting
[09:35.180 --> 09:42.540]  that's what I've done literally the entire time I've had my switch hmm so
[09:42.540 --> 09:47.060]  yeah I don't know it's definitely a unique choice so I've just sent you a
[09:47.060 --> 09:51.260]  link to what I'm talking about it's the the nitro deck and it's like this little
[09:51.260 --> 09:55.380]  kind of oh my god this looks so cool controller type thing that you slot it
[09:55.380 --> 10:01.220]  into and it's got the it's got a d-pad and the two analog sticks and the
[10:01.220 --> 10:09.100]  buttons on it and it looks like the old like n64 gameboy it's got those colors
[10:09.100 --> 10:15.700]  yeah and yeah I think it's really cool it's a bit expensive it's not cheap it's
[10:15.700 --> 10:20.500]  $90 but okay I was looking for the price I see it now um well that's not
[10:20.500 --> 10:25.940]  too bad considering that like honestly joy cons are what $80 yes it's not it's
[10:25.940 --> 10:30.780]  not terrible but it's not cheap but yeah I'm looking forward to getting that it's
[10:30.780 --> 10:39.540]  coming out sometime in the next three months apparently q3 we'll see but yeah
[10:39.540 --> 10:42.420]  I think it's I think it's gonna be really nice because I think it will give
[10:42.420 --> 10:49.020]  a nice bit of heft to it and it's the analog sticks are also there are what
[10:49.020 --> 10:55.220]  they called the no the analog sticks they're the ones that don't drift whole
[10:55.220 --> 11:01.820]  whole effect that's what I call so and a also comes with a its own case so it
[11:01.820 --> 11:06.720]  has a nice that is so nice so they've put a lot of thought into that and it's
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.240]  got a little thing for some games and a little extra extra pat storage thing as
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.480]  well so I'm really looking forward to it I think I think it'll be really nice
[11:15.480 --> 11:24.760]  oh so that's the same thing with the hori slip heads I've played games where
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.480]  I have to like so annoying like switch them out find joy cons that were there
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.440]  aren't a huge number of games that I use the gyro for but like Zelda for example
[11:34.440 --> 11:41.320]  I cannot play Zelda without without the gyro so like I had to for like the three
[11:41.360 --> 11:46.640]  weeks I was playing Zelda every day for like five hours I was using joy con for
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.360]  that I killed my hands wait is that so I my
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.040]  sister's the Zelda person in my house so I've only played one Zelda game and she
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.320]  actually gave me Breath of the Wild to play but I didn't start it yet she gave
[12:01.320 --> 12:06.000]  it to me on vacation it's good yeah no it looks good it just looks also very
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.720]  intimidating and it didn't feel like something I wanted to play while I was
[12:09.720 --> 12:12.560]  away fair enough fair enough well I would say if you think it looks
[12:12.560 --> 12:17.720]  intimidating follow the main site main quests because that will always give you
[12:17.720 --> 12:21.080]  something clear to do rather than because I think that's why I really like
[12:21.080 --> 12:24.760]  about what they've done is it's an open world you can do literally anything you
[12:24.760 --> 12:29.400]  want but you don't they actually give you some pointers if you need them so
[12:29.400 --> 12:32.800]  it's not just like it's not just like here's an infinite number of things to
[12:32.800 --> 12:36.480]  do is here's an infinite number of things to do and also here's an actual
[12:36.480 --> 12:40.560]  thing that you can do you know that's exactly what I need I need some
[12:40.560 --> 12:47.200]  structure because otherwise I will just be running around but that is good to
[12:47.200 --> 12:51.960]  know because I did not know that Zelda had the need for gyro so yeah so it's
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.000]  for it's for aiming like some people don't use it but I I'm really bad aiming
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.840]  without the gyro because it's like my hands can't move as fast as I need them
[13:00.840 --> 13:06.640]  to and yeah just I like I like being able to like aim with it for the arrow
[13:06.640 --> 13:12.000]  and the ball and I just slightly move it to get it right in the right place it's
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.360]  really nice that's very good to know I'll have to try out both methods to see
[13:16.360 --> 13:22.160]  which one like suits me better yeah um yeah so hopefully I'll get my switch
[13:22.160 --> 13:27.140]  back at some point and then I can finish up Hollow Knight I'm hoping it's
[13:27.140 --> 13:30.360]  finished up soon for you because it's just also I feel like it gives you
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.680]  anxiety when it's it's out there yeah yeah yeah well especially as it's a
[13:34.680 --> 13:39.360]  limited edition one so and my and my Pokemon saves are on it like if it
[13:39.360 --> 13:42.600]  wasn't a limited edition one and my Pokemon saves weren't on it I'd be like
[13:42.600 --> 13:45.240]  oh it doesn't really matter I'll get one I'll get a replacement for it if they
[13:45.240 --> 13:48.880]  break it or whatever but like if they break it I don't think I think they say
[13:48.880 --> 13:52.840]  like if we don't have the equivalent then we will replace it with a different
[13:52.840 --> 14:03.080]  one yeah and if they lose the saves there's literally nothing they can do
[14:03.080 --> 14:08.640]  you know yeah no there's there's there's definitely a lot riding on you know the
[14:08.640 --> 14:14.880]  line here yeah so hopefully we'll get it soon and then I'll finish up Hollow
[14:14.880 --> 14:18.200]  Knight and then I'll decide what I'm gonna do next I've got a bunch of games
[14:18.200 --> 14:25.240]  to play I've got the new story seasons a wonderful life haven't started it yet
[14:25.240 --> 14:28.520]  what else there's a bunch of other things that I'm like I want to play
[14:28.520 --> 14:32.160]  this but I just haven't done yet I've got a bunch of games on my steam deck
[14:32.160 --> 14:35.040]  that I haven't played yet as well but it's just like I just don't have the
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.600]  enthusiasm right now I just want to go on holiday you know yeah yeah yeah
[14:38.600 --> 14:43.520]  that's like um like I'm excited to get back to I was playing a lot of roots of
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.760]  Pacha before I left that's one of the ones that I've got nice it's it's a lot
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.240]  of fun I like it I think there's like you know things they could improve on
[14:53.240 --> 14:56.680]  but like overall I put a lot of time into that game and I really enjoyed it
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.200]  and now I'm just working on breeding different or getting different animal
[15:01.200 --> 15:06.920]  variations yeah yeah I think the outcome from our episode on it which who was it
[15:06.920 --> 15:13.280]  did that was it Cody and Kevin yes go my memory Cody and Kevin and was that it
[15:13.440 --> 15:17.840]  was better than they expected it to be and actually a lot of fun because I
[15:17.840 --> 15:21.800]  think a lot of a lot of these games can look just like oh it's just like stardew
[15:21.800 --> 15:25.720]  with a skin sort of thing but it's turned out to be a lot better than that
[15:25.720 --> 15:29.960]  which is good yeah I definitely think it held its own I think I think it just
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.520]  like you know with stardew there's like a lot of stuff to do so that's like it
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.080]  sets the bar so high yeah not to say that there wasn't a lot of stuff to do
[15:38.080 --> 15:41.760]  in this game there was it's different right like yeah I mean it's not about
[15:41.800 --> 15:45.400]  saying this is a better or worse game no exactly it's about saying is it just a
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.640]  ripoff or is it doing trying to do things differently that's that's that's
[15:49.640 --> 15:53.240]  what I'm looking for in farming games just now that's fair that's that's
[15:53.240 --> 15:56.120]  definitely hard because it's like I look through a lot of them on Steam and I'm
[15:56.120 --> 16:00.640]  like is this actually what I want to be doing is this just gonna be a chore yeah
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.480]  yeah yeah okay cool um yeah I think that's thing that's everything I've been
[16:05.480 --> 16:13.720]  up to and so as I mentioned there's no news this episode and so we're gonna go
[16:13.720 --> 16:19.480]  straight into our main topic which is fishing break so I guess I'll just
[16:19.480 --> 16:25.680]  introduce the game a little bit so obviously due to the name fishing break
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.600]  it is a fishing game and that's that's it that's that's what it is it's a
[16:30.600 --> 16:35.880]  fishing game right like you are a fisher person did we ever come to a conclusion
[16:35.880 --> 16:41.560]  on is what the best gender neutral term for person who fishes is no let's go
[16:41.560 --> 16:49.600]  with fisher person like a fisher person it doesn't it works and you have like a
[16:49.600 --> 16:53.200]  bunch of different areas and you fish in them and obviously there's more
[16:53.200 --> 16:59.800]  complication to it if you really want to but that's basically it right I would
[16:59.800 --> 17:03.720]  say that interestingly I don't know about you let's let's talk about the
[17:03.720 --> 17:11.320]  actual fishing mechanic first and it's it's very much like spirit faders
[17:11.320 --> 17:18.120]  fishing in a way right in terms of like reeling in obviously you you have this
[17:18.120 --> 17:25.160]  kind of side on view and you are you you swipe to like throw the cast there's the
[17:25.160 --> 17:29.680]  one cast the line into the water and there's a bunch of fish in the water
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.280]  and you can kind of like jiggle the line around and and then eventually want to
[17:33.280 --> 17:37.080]  grab on and then you have to it's got like the line tension mechanic where you
[17:37.080 --> 17:43.360]  have to pull it back and not break the snap it exactly yeah there's some added
[17:43.360 --> 17:46.640]  stuff to this is kind of like an RPG right so that you have an attack
[17:46.640 --> 17:51.740]  strength and the fish have a strength and the higher the strength the harder
[17:51.740 --> 17:54.980]  they are to catch and I think if you're if they're if they're above your attack
[17:54.980 --> 18:00.180]  level you can't you just can't catch them yeah which I really I like that as
[18:00.180 --> 18:03.900]  a mechanic but yeah I really liked the like I didn't expect that I thought it
[18:03.900 --> 18:07.020]  was to be honest when I first started playing I thought I was just gonna be a
[18:07.020 --> 18:10.740]  tapping game yeah kind of thing yeah because that's how the fishing works
[18:10.740 --> 18:17.020]  which I do I like tapping things so that's not a bad thing like I I do enjoy
[18:17.020 --> 18:23.580]  that as a fishing reeling mechanic mm-hmm yeah I think is the the the
[18:23.620 --> 18:28.460]  attack and defense kind of thing with you and the fish I think is like
[18:28.460 --> 18:31.380]  obviously all games actually have this under the hood they just don't kind of
[18:31.380 --> 18:36.700]  show you it I like how visible it is and it's like your attack is 70 this fish
[18:36.700 --> 18:41.860]  has got 75 therefore that's why you didn't catch it right like it's it's
[18:41.860 --> 18:46.900]  very clear when the difference is your skill and when the difference is you
[18:46.900 --> 18:50.380]  were never gonna be able to catch this you just not progressed enough yet yeah
[18:50.380 --> 18:54.420]  which I like I like that a lot like you said it is typically built in in the
[18:54.420 --> 18:59.300]  back end like it's like your skill improvement or whatever but yeah I like
[18:59.300 --> 19:05.220]  how they incorporated it into this yeah I also like how each fish can have a
[19:05.220 --> 19:13.420]  variety of attack power mm-hmm yeah which then you know qualifies them for
[19:13.420 --> 19:20.220]  different oh my god grade that's the word I'm looking for yes which I didn't
[19:20.260 --> 19:24.140]  realize at first I thought I was fishing badly and that's why I was getting bad
[19:24.140 --> 19:30.260]  grades fish just do better Kelly I was like am I holding it too much when it's
[19:30.260 --> 19:35.660]  red like am I am I not tapping it fast enough like what's going on here for
[19:35.660 --> 19:39.300]  those who listened to last week's episode which is about by the pier it's
[19:39.300 --> 19:45.860]  very similar to that as well in terms of like the reeling in so it's quite like
[19:45.860 --> 19:50.580]  that and quite like spirit fader but it by the pier had a timer and you had to
[19:50.580 --> 19:54.340]  get it in by a certain point or always snapped and that was incredibly
[19:54.340 --> 19:58.460]  stressful I did not like that so I like that this does not have that I hate
[19:58.460 --> 20:03.020]  timers yeah games like immediately start freaking out well this is the thing
[20:03.020 --> 20:07.740]  right like because it's it's not then just about your skill it's about your
[20:07.740 --> 20:12.580]  skill and also can you do your skill fast enough it's like no just let me do
[20:12.580 --> 20:15.880]  it right like it's just I don't know why they felt they need to have the
[20:15.880 --> 20:22.780]  timer on that yeah I feel like that's just trying to make you either use more
[20:22.780 --> 20:27.820]  bait mm-hmm or something like I don't know that's weird I don't know what the
[20:27.820 --> 20:30.880]  deal is with that but but that wouldn't even work in this game which so that
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.860]  makes it even better yeah like I don't think you could have a timer considering
[20:35.860 --> 20:43.260]  the way that you have to catch certain fish mm-hmm well that's the thing that
[20:43.260 --> 20:46.420]  that that was the thing about it is there is are like a perfect way to catch
[20:46.420 --> 20:51.020]  a fish but because of like you have to like pull it in and then stop and then
[20:51.020 --> 20:54.460]  pull it in and then stop and then pull it stop but that was how the other one
[20:54.460 --> 20:58.580]  the other game was as well and they managed to have have a timer in it which
[20:58.580 --> 21:04.140]  is why it was doubly annoying it's like either like Mickey button mash or don't
[21:04.140 --> 21:08.300]  have a timer right like if it's about skill make it about skill don't don't
[21:08.300 --> 21:12.100]  add a timer into that like that's just yeah I just find that annoying yeah
[21:12.100 --> 21:15.700]  anyway let's stop talking about different game this one doesn't have
[21:15.700 --> 21:20.100]  that and that's good but yeah like the general I feel like it's kind of this
[21:20.100 --> 21:25.620]  has become kind of like the the way to kind of have a realistic fishing as much
[21:25.620 --> 21:31.060]  as you can is is to have the line tension and you have to kind of reel it
[21:31.060 --> 21:35.020]  in and then stop and then we lay in this top and it differs depending on the
[21:35.020 --> 21:39.900]  fish like obviously like a we goldfish is gonna be really easy to get in even
[21:39.900 --> 21:46.180]  at the same level as like our masculine or whatever you know like it's masculine
[21:46.180 --> 21:54.520]  no I meant Barracuda that's what I meant oh my word Barracuda but yeah no I feel
[21:54.520 --> 21:58.420]  like that is true like it's very realistic to actual fishing like you
[21:58.420 --> 22:02.180]  have to let your line go out you know you have to give the fish a chance to
[22:02.180 --> 22:10.100]  like cool down mm-hmm mm-hmm I like that I also really like that like you have
[22:10.100 --> 22:16.140]  all your different kinds of bait right mm-hmm and and I'll be honest I've not
[22:16.140 --> 22:19.780]  done much with the bait I've kind of just used the kind of whatever is on the
[22:19.780 --> 22:26.180]  list and oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah I've been I've been I've actually while
[22:26.180 --> 22:29.580]  we're talking I've been letting ads play so that I can get more of the
[22:29.580 --> 22:33.280]  better bait I was doing that at the airport the other night while I was
[22:33.280 --> 22:43.180]  bored but what I really find interesting actually is that if you catch a certain
[22:43.180 --> 22:47.840]  fish other fish will eat that fish and then you catch that fish oh interesting
[22:47.840 --> 22:52.740]  so I thought because so at first I noticed did you notice that other fish
[22:52.740 --> 22:56.820]  were eating other fish just notice that no so that was one of the first things
[22:56.820 --> 23:00.460]  because I heard a chomp at one point and I was like what the hell is going on
[23:00.460 --> 23:06.380]  here and I look up and I see a dead fish float up to the surface oh my and I was
[23:06.380 --> 23:09.900]  like whoa what is happening and it was like a little fish that ate a bigger
[23:09.900 --> 23:15.900]  fish Wow so I was like okay let me test this out and I caught a little fish and
[23:15.900 --> 23:20.260]  tried to get one of the bigger fish to eat it mm-hmm especially like the
[23:20.260 --> 23:26.980]  special fish seem to do this more so yeah if you catch if you watch certain
[23:26.980 --> 23:31.620]  fish they'll eat other certain fish and then if you catch that fish that they're
[23:31.620 --> 23:36.260]  eating they will then potentially hope not every time eat the fish that you've
[23:36.260 --> 23:39.700]  caught on your line and then you can reel them in which I think is very
[23:39.700 --> 23:46.300]  interesting I did not expect that level of strategy honestly yeah it is it's
[23:46.300 --> 23:52.020]  definitely it's a I think I'm not going to get to this point but I are hundred
[23:52.020 --> 23:57.140]  percent can understand how somebody could like spend hours and hours on this
[23:57.140 --> 24:02.140]  game and like really get into it and for other reasons that we get into later on
[24:02.140 --> 24:05.860]  there's other other mechanics that are there a part of it but even yeah there's
[24:05.860 --> 24:10.540]  just there's so many fish and there's so many like different ways that the fish
[24:10.540 --> 24:14.420]  can come out and yeah different as you say scenarios that can happen with like
[24:14.420 --> 24:19.900]  fish eating fish and like it's it's very complex for what I assumed would be a
[24:19.900 --> 24:24.860]  very simple it's a pond and you have fish in it right no that was literally
[24:24.860 --> 24:30.340]  my mentality going in and I think like the second day I played I was like oh
[24:30.340 --> 24:38.020]  this is a lot more in depth than like I anticipated mm-hmm yeah and at first I
[24:38.020 --> 24:41.500]  was like okay I'm just gonna play this now I'm like do I continue playing this
[24:41.500 --> 24:45.220]  like I'm kind of like I'm not gonna put any money into it or anything like that
[24:45.220 --> 24:48.980]  of course not why would you but if I'm sitting here like we're talking right
[24:48.980 --> 24:53.340]  now I'm just gonna let some ads run hmm so I can get some more beat you know
[24:53.340 --> 24:58.860]  like it's a I really will play it often like Pokemon go is truly my main yeah
[24:58.860 --> 25:02.820]  mobile game but there's still only so much you can do while you're staying
[25:02.820 --> 25:07.900]  still though that's that's the thing exactly exactly so it's nice for that
[25:07.900 --> 25:13.140]  situation where you're just like standing there but yeah no it it
[25:13.140 --> 25:17.940]  surprised me the game hmm which I thought was pretty nice
[25:17.940 --> 25:25.540]  yeah is that everything about the actual fishing part of it oh this is a mechanic
[25:25.540 --> 25:30.400]  I forgot about that it's a very simple over you get these little coins that you
[25:30.400 --> 25:35.140]  can then use to tell a fish to get off your line basically oh wait what is that
[25:35.980 --> 25:41.260]  you got yes you get zap coins if you if you have a fish on the lane that you
[25:41.260 --> 25:44.860]  don't want on the lane you press that it uses up one of the coins and the fish
[25:44.860 --> 25:49.300]  gets off your line I only have I think one coin so I was like I don't remember
[25:49.300 --> 25:53.700]  what it said I just remember it saying something about special fish so I was
[25:53.700 --> 25:57.420]  like I'm gonna wait I don't know what this is yeah I think you get it for
[25:57.420 --> 26:02.580]  catching special fish okay that makes sense but yeah you use it you use it if
[26:02.620 --> 26:06.980]  you're I don't know why I would ever do that because it's like it I guess if you
[26:06.980 --> 26:11.620]  have like very high level bait or something and you don't want it to be
[26:11.620 --> 26:15.540]  used up that's what I was gonna say I think it's for the bait that you spend
[26:15.540 --> 26:20.420]  like the dollar in game dollars on yeah but I'm never going to do that so I
[26:20.420 --> 26:25.100]  don't foresee myself ever using this app mechanic but it's interesting that's
[26:25.100 --> 26:29.540]  there yeah yeah definitely like if you don't want to lose that special bait
[26:29.540 --> 26:36.500]  then it makes sense you get it zapped zap the fish I should have tried to see
[26:36.500 --> 26:39.900]  what happens you know like it's electrocuted let me let me bring it up
[26:39.900 --> 26:43.220]  because I'm I wonder if it'll float to the what I wonder if it'll float to the
[26:43.220 --> 26:50.540]  top like the other fish that get eaten let's find out live live testing this
[26:50.540 --> 26:55.020]  trying to think is there any other main mechanics I mean so what I do find
[26:55.020 --> 27:00.660]  interesting oh yeah no it does it kills them like every fish no just the fish
[27:00.660 --> 27:05.060]  it was on the lane and it looks like yeah you keep the bait nice okay that
[27:05.060 --> 27:10.840]  makes sense then it's just fluid up to the top did you say you can get the ones
[27:10.840 --> 27:15.740]  that are on the top no no that's how I that's how I when I saw them float to
[27:15.740 --> 27:20.300]  the top I was like what's going on here that's what I think I think I should
[27:20.300 --> 27:24.740]  eating the one that's flying yeah they'll eat the dead fish yeah yeah
[27:24.740 --> 27:28.400]  that's it gone it's been eaten so there you go that's how the zapping works it
[27:28.400 --> 27:34.380]  kills the fish nice which like what why does it feel weird when I'm catching
[27:34.380 --> 27:39.020]  fish like the whole point of fishing is to catch and kill and eat fish right
[27:39.020 --> 27:45.120]  like it shouldn't be weird that I've just killed the fish but it some of them
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.340]  are all right let's talk about museums then right we'll talk about the other
[27:48.340 --> 27:53.220]  stuff later let's talk about museums so as with every game there now has to be a
[27:53.220 --> 28:01.500]  museum and so and when you catch a fish if it's the first time you caught that
[28:01.500 --> 28:06.300]  fish possibly a grade graded one higher grades one as well but I'm not sure about
[28:06.300 --> 28:10.860]  that maybe you can correct me I think there is because I think there's like I
[28:10.860 --> 28:16.120]  think it's like if you hit every grade for a fish right okay like as you hit
[28:16.120 --> 28:20.400]  every grade you get a reward for that yeah so if it's a new fish or a fish
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.960]  you've caught a grade that you haven't caught before you can send it to a
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.720]  museum and you get money for that and interestingly the museum's will earn new
[28:29.720 --> 28:35.720]  money as you're not playing the game income exactly exactly it's quite nice
[28:35.720 --> 28:39.280]  opening up the game and it's like oh you've gained 800 coins from your
[28:39.280 --> 28:43.960]  museums you're like awesome let's get that then thanks especially as you've
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.240]  like upgraded more stuff it's like oh that's like a whole upgrade yeah
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.000]  exactly and it's also it's it's not even just like a theoretical thing you can
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.680]  visit the museum's as well mm-hmm yeah which is nice because you could see you
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.880]  can actually see the levels of the fish that you've got oh yeah so you can I've
[29:01.880 --> 29:09.640]  got a four star sturgeon apparently ooh I only have one S tier and it's a Wally
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.000]  well I I don't know how you say that one I think it's Wally yeah and I don't
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.120]  think I have anything above B mmm but it's interesting that it has they have
[29:18.120 --> 29:24.280]  stars and ranking as well yes I think it's like you know basic fish bigger
[29:24.280 --> 29:30.400]  fish special fish or biggest fish so I think special fishes for yeah special
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.240]  fishes for where's my shark I caught a shark shark before that should have that
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.240]  should tell me I was honestly shocked that I could catch the shark Oh sharks
[29:39.280 --> 29:45.680]  are five stars oh nice yeah the special ones are five as well I've got a the
[29:45.680 --> 29:52.720]  electric was this electric car I've got is five star and the only one I've got
[29:52.720 --> 29:59.680]  is five star as well yeah they're both they're both see yeah that's my shark is
[29:59.680 --> 30:07.320]  a D so it's not good great sad um yeah I like that you can you can go and check
[30:07.320 --> 30:11.120]  in the museum too yes and you can yeah you can visit it and you can see all
[30:11.120 --> 30:15.360]  your fish swimming around and you can see some stats about them and see what
[30:15.360 --> 30:18.840]  your next reward is and stuff like that there's like this is the thing this is
[30:18.840 --> 30:21.520]  what I'm talking about there's so much here right because there's is that's
[30:21.520 --> 30:28.880]  five different museums and in each museum there are like five or so no is
[30:28.880 --> 30:36.520]  that ten different collections mmm seven museums I haven't put fish in so you do
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.120]  you gain more as you as you go then because I've only got five I believe so
[30:42.120 --> 30:47.800]  because I'm up to I just unlocked the Asian River which is like world three
[30:47.800 --> 30:54.400]  yeah no I am nowhere near that so that's probably why okay so you get five to
[30:54.400 --> 30:57.240]  start with and then obviously you'll upgrade them you get more as you go
[30:57.240 --> 31:00.960]  along mm-hmm but but I mean that's the point like at the beginning you've got
[31:00.960 --> 31:05.360]  five and each of them has like a bunch of collections so it's loads there and
[31:05.360 --> 31:10.920]  then you get more as you go on as well and the collections are different fish
[31:10.920 --> 31:15.400]  but I also think different you there's two different things I'm trying to
[31:15.400 --> 31:18.960]  figure it out I think one is special fish and one is regular fish oh is that
[31:18.960 --> 31:23.600]  what it is yeah so you've got like if I look at my museum that I actually have
[31:23.600 --> 31:27.360]  fish in you've got the common collection the uncommon collection the rare
[31:27.360 --> 31:31.800]  collection the epic collection the legendary dark collection the legendary
[31:31.800 --> 31:37.240]  electric legendary fire legendary grass legendary ice legendary light yep oh so
[31:37.240 --> 31:40.240]  that's what I was getting rewards from okay that makes sense yeah I see it now
[31:40.240 --> 31:44.400]  yeah I think that's the same for all of them they all have our mm-hmm each of
[31:44.400 --> 31:50.920]  those collections and it's nice for them because you just randomly get money
[31:50.920 --> 31:58.200]  exactly so you can't beat that but it adds like a nice little achievement goal
[31:58.240 --> 32:06.440]  yeah there's so many fish I can't go over just how many fish there are that's that and then
[32:06.440 --> 32:09.880]  there's like these little event things too like there's just oh I haven't tried
[32:09.880 --> 32:14.200]  and have you tried one of them I haven't tried it yes they cost like a dollar I
[32:14.200 --> 32:24.000]  think usually like not real dollar like in-game dollar right okay and you know
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  I'm not doing great at them but like they're they're fun to just like have
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.760]  something to do while you're trying to wait for other fish to show up yes I did
[32:30.760 --> 32:35.280]  one where I had to catch like a b-grade smelt which was really hard yeah they're
[32:35.280 --> 32:41.200]  really tiny and they all look like look the same yeah but I did manage it so
[32:41.200 --> 32:45.040]  it's just like it's just like another little thing but I feel like it's one
[32:45.040 --> 32:49.160]  of those things that like kind of helps you get more familiar with the fish so
[32:49.160 --> 32:55.520]  if you are invested in playing the game it's like again more in-depth way to
[32:55.640 --> 33:02.800]  play yeah but yeah a lot of fish a lot more fish than I expected yes and I like
[33:02.800 --> 33:07.160]  how it's not just catch and sell it's like catch and give to museum and then
[33:07.160 --> 33:10.800]  it's catch and sell so you then yeah you're like oh yeah so you once you've
[33:10.800 --> 33:15.560]  once you've given it to the museum you're then you are basically selling
[33:15.560 --> 33:23.080]  them for coins and then you use those coins for upgrades yeah so many upgrades
[33:23.120 --> 33:28.920]  so many upgrades I don't do we want to talk about the upgrades for a second
[33:28.920 --> 33:34.440]  talk about the upgrades so my strategy initially was to focus on attack because
[33:34.440 --> 33:38.800]  I feel like that's the most important one you're not gonna catch anything same
[33:38.800 --> 33:42.720]  if you don't have that upgraded and it's definitely one of those things where
[33:42.720 --> 33:47.840]  like I would catch most of the fish and I would get like the stars for the fish
[33:47.840 --> 33:51.200]  in two of the areas but not like one of the areas because I wasn't strong enough
[33:51.440 --> 33:56.280]  yeah so it's like kind of nice because it does give you that like backward play a
[33:56.280 --> 33:59.080]  little bit where you you can move forward but there's still things to do
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.880]  behind you yeah there's a ton of things to still do behind like behind whatever
[34:03.880 --> 34:09.160]  level I'm on though too so that's not even an issue at this moment but then I
[34:09.160 --> 34:14.560]  made the mistake of upgrading the cast line to the cast distance and then not
[34:14.560 --> 34:19.380]  realizing that the line length that was nowhere near the same so I had the
[34:19.380 --> 34:22.500]  ability to cast far enough but I actually did not physically
[34:22.500 --> 34:27.060]  that's hilarious yeah so I've been slowly catching that up in between like upgrading my
[34:27.060 --> 34:30.820]  attack now yeah and I really did not care about the real speed because I feel
[34:30.820 --> 34:34.820]  like no matter what I'm just tapping so yeah well exactly yeah definitely it's
[34:34.820 --> 34:39.740]  like I'm not going to I'm not gonna pay for the one that just means that I have
[34:39.740 --> 34:43.260]  to press less right like I'm gonna do the one that means that I can do things
[34:43.260 --> 34:48.340]  that I couldn't previously do mm-hmm because there is literally no way to
[34:48.420 --> 34:53.700]  catch a fish if it is above your attack level yeah exactly whereas if it's
[34:53.700 --> 35:00.860]  slightly under it's just about time mm-hmm exactly um yeah I think I was
[35:00.860 --> 35:05.420]  roughly the same kind of just not maxing out but like getting my attack as high
[35:05.420 --> 35:13.280]  as high as I could and then yeah focusing on the the real length and the
[35:13.280 --> 35:17.980]  cast distance yeah yeah I was like am I missing something with the real speed so
[35:18.020 --> 35:21.940]  I upgraded it once and I was like this did nothing for me I suspect it's the
[35:21.940 --> 35:25.740]  sort of thing that like maybe endgame you'll want to have it upgraded because
[35:25.740 --> 35:31.060]  like some of them will just take so long that if you don't have it upgraded yeah
[35:31.060 --> 35:37.660]  yeah that makes sense and so yeah so we've talked about upgrades then blah
[35:37.660 --> 35:43.580]  blah blah blah you get that through selling the fish obviously the there are
[35:43.780 --> 35:50.620]  different areas and so you start with a couple of areas and then as as Kelly
[35:50.620 --> 35:54.060]  mentioned there are worlds as well so it's like you started with just one
[35:54.060 --> 35:58.540]  world that has one area and then there's like a one with multiple and you unlock
[35:58.540 --> 36:06.840]  them as you get more and more stars which is by catching more fish so it's
[36:06.840 --> 36:10.380]  all about catching fish you keep catching fish you keep getting getting
[36:10.380 --> 36:16.940]  stars you get stars you get more places to unlock therefore more fish that you
[36:16.940 --> 36:25.540]  can get your classic circular circular fish economy and it's interesting too
[36:25.540 --> 36:31.160]  because each each world has its own version of bait oh yes so like you can
[36:31.160 --> 36:34.940]  use the same bait through those three levels in a world but each world itself
[36:34.940 --> 36:41.880]  has specific yeah it's interested like the fish the fish will not well why did
[36:41.880 --> 36:45.320]  the fish in this area not like this kind of it's like surely the bait would be
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.520]  first specific fish relevant specific areas but yeah yeah I feel like you
[36:50.520 --> 36:55.520]  know that's just that's more of the simplification side yeah so suspension
[36:55.520 --> 37:01.000]  of disbelief type thing yeah listen I got I got tiny little fish eaten bigger
[37:01.000 --> 37:12.740]  fish than them and you can on the line yeah but I like the the illustrations
[37:12.740 --> 37:18.160]  for the fish hmm yeah there's definitely like this is obviously our mobile game
[37:18.160 --> 37:20.920]  it's definitely a cash grab mobile game but they've definitely put a lot of
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.000]  thought into into things like that there's there's good art and the game
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.620]  itself feels quite nice to play it doesn't like the you're kind of your
[37:29.620 --> 37:33.760]  player character has you know different facial expressions they will do as you
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.420]  catch and that through the different parts of the the catching process and
[37:38.420 --> 37:42.460]  stuff like that so yeah there's lots of nice thought that's been put into this
[37:42.460 --> 37:49.820]  relatively simple concept but relatively large actually game mm-hmm exactly like
[37:49.820 --> 37:54.140]  it's not there's there's definitely more to it than what you would assume
[37:54.140 --> 38:03.340]  downloading it yeah yeah not just that what you would but what we did and okay
[38:03.340 --> 38:06.120]  tournaments then you you said you've done a tournament don't tell me what
[38:06.120 --> 38:13.020]  it's like because I haven't done any okay let me see which one did I do I did
[38:13.020 --> 38:20.060]  I did I did the butterfly fish hunt so you have I just had to catch so each one
[38:20.060 --> 38:24.500]  of them is different but I had to catch the best butterfly fish I could okay
[38:24.500 --> 38:31.780]  which at that point I think I had still not fully grasped how to get a better
[38:31.780 --> 38:36.540]  grade of fish so I got a D grade and I still I still got um I think some
[38:36.540 --> 38:41.180]  dollars from it okay which then yeah so there's two currencies there's the the
[38:41.180 --> 38:48.300]  coins and the paper but yes for better I don't know if the box they call it box
[38:48.300 --> 38:54.020]  yes box box the box are like the premium currency that you use to buy the other
[38:54.020 --> 38:58.500]  currency and buy bait and stuff like that so yeah it's good to get get free
[38:58.500 --> 39:04.100]  stuff like that yeah and you can use the box to enter tournaments and events
[39:04.100 --> 39:09.660]  right I got actually I did not get bucks for that one I got a medal and I got
[39:09.660 --> 39:15.900]  coins and I got some bait right but then I'm also I'm currently doing the
[39:15.900 --> 39:22.960]  catch the best smelt you can okay and I did get a B on that one so far so when
[39:22.960 --> 39:28.420]  it ends at this point I will get three medals what are medals I don't I thought
[39:28.420 --> 39:32.140]  they were just like a achievement but maybe I'm wrong and I'll get two thousand
[39:32.140 --> 39:37.260]  coins and I'll get five bait so thousand coins wow yeah it's not a it's not a bad
[39:37.260 --> 39:40.740]  thing especially considering you're gonna be in there fishing anyway so I
[39:40.740 --> 39:46.900]  was like well I'm gonna be because I was trying to also get the bit so they have
[39:46.900 --> 39:51.940]  the events but then each world also has special things you can do in them so
[39:51.940 --> 39:58.940]  like one of them on the side was like catch the B grade Buffalo bass or
[39:58.940 --> 40:03.820]  whatever it was right so that's not a common fish so you're kind of just
[40:03.820 --> 40:08.180]  sitting there waiting for it to show up but you can't see the whole pond unless
[40:08.180 --> 40:13.100]  you cast your reel okay so I was just sitting there casting for the smelt
[40:13.100 --> 40:19.500]  waiting for the best to show up yeah so it's like it's definitely two birds with
[40:19.500 --> 40:23.880]  one stone kind of thing yeah but it gives you it gives you something to go
[40:23.880 --> 40:27.140]  for instead of just trying to get more money so remind you how you get the
[40:27.140 --> 40:36.380]  higher higher grade fish okay so that is the size of the fish okay bigger fish
[40:36.380 --> 40:41.020]  okay so the bigger the fish the higher the grade and then also the higher their
[40:41.020 --> 40:45.500]  attack right so you would you would end up if you were just catching all of the
[40:45.500 --> 40:49.580]  same fish that you wanted to catch you would eventually get a better one anyway
[40:49.580 --> 40:54.020]  assuming you're catching them all yes it does get complicated though because the
[40:54.020 --> 41:00.300]  fish do repopulate pretty quickly yeah so it really like I did play this with
[41:00.300 --> 41:04.980]  some strategy like I would throw my line wait for it to sink to the bottom mm-hmm
[41:04.980 --> 41:09.140]  and then kind of reel it in a little bit if I didn't see anything and then
[41:09.140 --> 41:14.180]  literally just sit there with my reel with my bait at the bottom of the pond
[41:14.180 --> 41:20.020]  waiting until I saw what I thought would be a bigger fish and then I would try to
[41:20.020 --> 41:23.580]  reel it in a way that would have tracked its attention only and not other fish
[41:24.420 --> 41:28.340]  which is hard to do sometimes very hard to do you're just like oh here's random
[41:28.340 --> 41:33.460]  fish is just yep decided it wants me and and sometimes it's a fish that's not even
[41:33.460 --> 41:40.140]  near the bait yeah though sometimes they're very fast and they're just like yeah I'm yours now
[41:40.140 --> 41:47.460]  so it's definitely a lot of patience in that way which is the problem because the tournaments
[41:47.460 --> 41:54.220]  are timed yes that was also like I feel like with the bigger fish it's easier to see the
[41:54.220 --> 41:59.500]  distinction between them yeah whereas with like this this one that I was doing with the smelt
[41:59.500 --> 42:05.220]  there it's a small fish so they all look pretty small oh those are the smelt I'm like I can't
[42:05.220 --> 42:11.100]  see this fish that it's talking about it's because they're the teeny tiny tiny one yep
[42:11.100 --> 42:16.660]  so luckily I did get a B grade and I was like you know what that's that's good enough for me
[42:17.620 --> 42:22.660]  yeah that's not too bad yeah I was like okay I'm gonna make some and you make money on it no
[42:22.660 --> 42:28.620]  matter what so yeah it doesn't hurt in any way and like to go back to the Bucks concept for a
[42:28.620 --> 42:35.220]  second because that is like what you need to enter the tournaments you do get that in game
[42:35.220 --> 42:43.540]  hmm not very frequently yeah so it is good to save up but like right now I have 72 bucks from
[42:43.780 --> 42:49.660]  different achievements and stuff so I'm sure you know as the game goes on it's harder to get them
[42:49.660 --> 42:56.980]  but you could definitely save them up I think it's it'll be yeah it's it's harder and and also
[42:56.980 --> 43:03.740]  easier at the same time to get them because it's like yeah sure there may be less opportunities of
[43:03.740 --> 43:08.800]  your opportunities but you're also better at it you know what you're doing more you know that
[43:08.800 --> 43:14.600]  sort of thing yeah exactly and like I don't plan on spending them really on anything besides
[43:14.600 --> 43:20.640]  I guess these tournaments but you could easily spend 50 of them on like special tape yeah so I
[43:20.640 --> 43:29.520]  do see how it's very easy to go through it quickly to smelt you found him I gotta see one oh okay
[43:29.520 --> 43:34.840]  that's not bad it's not bad so far still got a few minutes so I will say with that too what I
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.840]  was doing is like I would catch one and say it was like D grade I was like okay this smelt has
[43:39.840 --> 43:46.880]  an attack of six yes if I catch one that's seven that'll be a C if I catch one that's eight that'll
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.400]  be yeah that's like what I'm looking for yeah yeah but of course you don't know that until
[43:52.400 --> 43:58.840]  they scrapped on oh yeah yeah exactly but yeah definitely they are I see what you mean about
[43:58.840 --> 44:03.640]  the smelt I have seen cut some that look slightly bigger so I managed to get a C one but yeah I've
[44:03.640 --> 44:09.880]  not seen a one even bigger yet and it's it's hard to tell if there if that one is even bigger in
[44:09.880 --> 44:15.080]  certain instances because if the rest of them are just small it's like okay are you actually
[44:15.080 --> 44:24.960]  yes a B or you just have I just see no concept of how big you should yeah yep so it's it's
[44:24.960 --> 44:30.960]  definitely like there is some skill in that sense that goes into it yeah it definitely adds more
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.080]  and more interesting thing to it when you may have caught most of the fish and you're just
[44:35.080 --> 44:40.440]  kind of grinding through while you're waiting for like the legendary fish or whatever you can be you
[44:40.440 --> 44:46.920]  know catching all this all this all the stupid smelt exactly it gives you just something little
[44:46.920 --> 44:54.040]  to do absolutely are there any mechanics we've not talked about because this was everything that I
[44:54.040 --> 45:02.080]  could think of but I'm not sure if you've thought of something that I have missed I think that's
[45:02.080 --> 45:10.800]  about it like we could talk about I guess the you know you can watch ads to get beat yeah yeah you're
[45:10.800 --> 45:18.600]  kind of usual like everything costs money but you can you can always do stuff to get to get it for
[45:18.600 --> 45:25.320]  free if you watch ads which like I'm not a huge fan of ads and games but I like that way of doing
[45:25.320 --> 45:29.080]  it where it's like yeah you don't have to watch the ads but we'll give you something if you do
[45:29.080 --> 45:37.800]  sort of thing I quite like that I think it's a lot better than forcing people to need to have like
[45:37.800 --> 45:42.160]  the bucks to buy like special bait or something or you're just like locked out entirely yeah yeah
[45:42.160 --> 45:46.860]  yeah definitely definitely cuz like I don't mind being locked out of like the special bait but like
[45:46.900 --> 45:53.860]  the medium the middle bait yes you do need that yeah exactly it's like it's it's big fish it's
[45:53.860 --> 46:00.060]  not even just like special fish or higher quality fish it's just big fish you cannot catch certain
[46:00.060 --> 46:05.220]  types of fish if you don't have the big bait exactly so like I like that there is an option
[46:05.220 --> 46:12.700]  outside of that I do think it's interesting though that you catch a fish you go to sell it
[46:12.700 --> 46:19.660]  it says like double your money whatever I just assumed that that would be another ad it is yeah
[46:19.660 --> 46:31.060]  no if you click it it's it's an ad the first time I've already done it once I assumed oh okay that's
[46:31.060 --> 46:35.740]  just the whole mechanic if you do it a second time it wants you to spend five dollars to get
[46:35.740 --> 46:41.260]  the double it package is that like a permanent doubler I don't know because I don't want to
[46:41.260 --> 46:50.660]  spend five dollars okay don't say I do nothing for you listeners I'm testing out it was payday
[46:50.660 --> 46:57.740]  yesterday why not there you go a little treat yeah yeah I was like I think I caught something
[46:57.740 --> 47:03.100]  big and I was like you know what I'll watch an ad to get a thousand yeah coins for this yes and
[47:03.100 --> 47:08.900]  then I was like what the hell I can't watch an ad yeah I probably should have been doing on a high
[47:08.900 --> 47:14.940]  quality one oh sure I did it on such a low-level thing I'm sure I have no recollection of what I
[47:14.940 --> 47:20.060]  used the double it on all right let's see so I've now bought that and I've doubled that one fish
[47:20.060 --> 47:27.340]  let's catch the next one and see what it is I got a bulk a bunch of weird cosmetic stuff like like
[47:27.340 --> 47:33.620]  hats and boats and stuff yeah yeah exactly and oh it does look like it's for everything now so I'm
[47:33.620 --> 47:38.180]  just getting good I'm just getting double coins for everything so that's that's nice oh so you
[47:38.180 --> 47:42.540]  don't have to watch an ad or anything no no it just automatically they're all doubled me you know
[47:42.540 --> 47:47.820]  okay for five dollars that's actually not a good deal at all I should say I don't know whether it
[47:47.820 --> 47:52.220]  runs out or not but like that's that's for fish in a row now that they've just it just popped up
[47:52.220 --> 47:58.620]  saying times two and doubles the coins for it so and I mean I mean from what it looks like when you
[47:58.620 --> 48:05.300]  go to buy it it seems like there's nothing that says it's no limited let's go to a different area
[48:05.300 --> 48:13.340]  and check that it's not that's a good call it is funny too just to while you're checking that I
[48:13.340 --> 48:19.700]  don't know if you added any friends I know I did not I think you'd be the only person I would have
[48:19.700 --> 48:28.780]  to add lots of people playing this game if you google it there are reddit message boards like
[48:28.780 --> 48:34.900]  from like because I think the game came out like 2016 right but there are people still actively
[48:34.980 --> 48:40.820]  talking I checked the discord people are still talking in the discord Wow about gameplay and
[48:40.820 --> 48:48.620]  stuff so but I know they also put out like the I think the online version of it in 2020 I was
[48:48.620 --> 48:55.140]  looking into all this because I was like I was intrigued by like where this all came from I
[48:55.140 --> 49:01.940]  guess yes so it does seem I've tried three different worlds four different areas and
[49:01.940 --> 49:06.260]  they've all been doubled so I guess the only thing I can think of is it could possibly be
[49:06.260 --> 49:11.460]  a limited thing that runs out but there's nothing that says that so I'm going to assume that it is
[49:11.460 --> 49:17.700]  a permanent upgrade yeah cuz I feel like they'd have to mention that right you would hope so yeah
[49:17.700 --> 49:24.820]  yeah that's fair so I think I think it's a permanent upgrade which five quid for for a
[49:24.820 --> 49:29.540]  permanent doubling all your coins probably would have done that sooner if I'd known that yeah me
[49:29.540 --> 49:36.340]  too honestly definitely would have cuz that that is very helpful all right let's use some of these
[49:36.340 --> 49:42.980]  cosmetics I just paid for then I'm not gonna lie that totally flipped my view on that oh there you
[49:42.980 --> 49:48.860]  go cuz I was like five dollars to have to still watch ads and then you know who knows how long it
[49:48.860 --> 49:53.620]  lasts for or whatever yeah exactly well that's the thing like one-off it's really stupid yeah
[49:53.620 --> 49:59.900]  permanent thing is whole different kettle of fish yeah and yeah I don't know what the friend stuff
[49:59.900 --> 50:07.180]  does but presumably well you get coins for for inviting people presumably you can always that
[50:07.180 --> 50:12.340]  the fishing cruise yes and there is a multiplayer mode so that will be what you'll just be able to
[50:12.340 --> 50:19.660]  do it with your friends presumably mm-hmm I enjoy these games because they're they're like I don't
[50:19.660 --> 50:25.460]  have to worry about people yeah I'm not gonna join a crew and do all that no no thanks I have
[50:25.460 --> 50:32.460]  noticed there are some tournaments that you have to be in a crew to do yes there are so I've also
[50:32.460 --> 50:39.260]  been just like ignoring those for the most part because I'm like well I'm not gonna do that so I
[50:39.260 --> 50:44.340]  think that's I think that's everything yeah there is I don't know if you clicked on event mode but
[50:44.340 --> 50:49.980]  it does want you to download one of their other games oh no to get to event mode and I was like
[50:49.980 --> 50:56.100]  well I'm not doing that so nothing that yeah they want you to game yeah they want you to to unlock
[50:56.100 --> 51:05.340]  this world to complete the quarry event in pocket mine 3 so well I mean worth a try I guess yeah
[51:05.340 --> 51:14.860]  nice try I'm not doing that exactly so you know they put it there it it wiggles to get your
[51:14.860 --> 51:22.100]  attention yeah but I mean I gotta say for what I thought would be a very much so like freemium
[51:22.100 --> 51:29.580]  style game it does offer you a lot in terms of workarounds yeah to make sure that you could still
[51:29.580 --> 51:35.460]  play the game do a pretty high level without actually putting any money into it yeah definitely
[51:35.460 --> 51:46.460]  um I know can't see I haven't put any money into it but that's a pretty good one yeah honestly if
[51:46.460 --> 51:51.540]  you like is now I'm like okay well if I do continue to play this game I would put five
[51:51.540 --> 51:56.580]  dollars into oh no I'm sorry Kelly I mean it's fine what's five dollars when you play Pokemon go
[51:56.580 --> 52:00.180]  right that's which I don't even want to think about how much money I put into that game I
[52:00.180 --> 52:10.780]  really try not to spend any money on that game but it happens it definitely happens yeah so five
[52:10.780 --> 52:15.820]  dollars what's five dollars all right Kelly are you gonna continue playing the game you know I
[52:15.820 --> 52:20.460]  think I might honestly for a little bit I don't know for how long I can be very fickle with phone
[52:20.460 --> 52:26.340]  games like even Pokemon go I will drop that game for six months at a time yeah and then I'll pick
[52:26.340 --> 52:33.540]  it up and play it for months yeah so it all really depends right now I'll probably still
[52:33.540 --> 52:40.040]  continue playing it for a little bit yeah I don't think I would say I definitely would but I feel
[52:40.040 --> 52:48.100]  like I'm more likely to after after this episode like I think just like me chatting about it and
[52:48.100 --> 52:55.300]  and wow that fish is very high-powered I cannot get that just now and it's like double my current
[52:55.300 --> 53:03.260]  was it like it's like one of those it's a legend it's a leg yeah blue on a legendary barracuda I
[53:03.260 --> 53:10.700]  think or something like that one of those snap my line immediately yeah yeah ridiculous I was like
[53:10.700 --> 53:16.260]  I was so excited too because I caught that with the catch a little fish method yeah and then it
[53:16.260 --> 53:22.100]  snapped the line immediately and I was like god damn come on let me have it I worked so hard for
[53:22.220 --> 53:29.260]  this yeah it gets really hard to increase later on because it's like I'm currently at 70 power
[53:29.260 --> 53:38.500]  and it's plus five for 2,300 coins yep that's that's a lot yep and then it's like the what is
[53:38.500 --> 53:48.980]  it the there's like tears to it yes so like like right now I'm I just had the diamond rod so that's
[53:48.980 --> 53:55.980]  like 105 oh wow you wouldn't even be able to catch this fish it was 136 yeah no I had I think
[53:55.980 --> 54:02.060]  the one I caught was like 160 and I was like well that's just mean yeah yeah I'm not gonna be able
[54:02.060 --> 54:07.340]  to catch this for like six months why why would you tease me with this yeah like well now I never
[54:07.340 --> 54:11.540]  want to catch that fish so it's just out of the picture I was shocked actually that I caught a
[54:11.540 --> 54:16.660]  shark cuz I did not think I was it gonna be able to do that but yeah like right now it's like plus
[54:16.660 --> 54:22.860]  two and it's 2,800 and then there's like five levels to this rod before I get to the next kind
[54:22.860 --> 54:30.980]  of rod but it's a it's a it's a two-star rod now I don't know what that means it means something
[54:30.980 --> 54:37.900]  but I'm sure it's yeah I'm sure it does something I also like them the cosmetics are cute like I
[54:37.900 --> 54:42.780]  have a fishing boat that's a being bit by a shark right now no that's cute in Jaws fashion nice
[54:42.780 --> 54:50.100]  have you got what's your hat my hat right now is does not match my character because it's like a
[54:50.100 --> 54:56.660]  little curly hair sticking out of visor and it's like brown hair too so it does like totally does
[54:56.660 --> 55:04.500]  not match yeah I have a top hat on oh nice yeah yeah I don't think I have a lot of hat options oh
[55:04.500 --> 55:12.660]  I have the green or piggy it looks like the pigs from Angry Birds right yes I'll put that one
[55:13.100 --> 55:18.460]  cute yeah those are just like a fun silly little thing cool well I think that's everything then
[55:18.460 --> 55:24.260]  thank you for for chatting to me about fishing break no thank you for inviting me and asking me
[55:24.260 --> 55:29.260]  to play it and talk about it yeah we'll check in next time you're honest to whether you're still
[55:29.260 --> 55:37.780]  playing or not yeah definitely where can people find you on the internet Kelly um not really
[55:37.780 --> 55:50.100]  anywhere but I guess if you want to check out Instagram it's Rala mu r-a-l-l-a-m-i-e-u awesome
[55:50.100 --> 55:58.740]  if you want to find me you can find me as the Scott bot um on well maybe Twitter you know it's
[55:58.740 --> 56:02.420]  like this is coming out in a month's time I literally have no idea whether Twitter will
[56:02.420 --> 56:06.820]  exist in a month's time or not because we're recording this we're recording this two days
[56:06.900 --> 56:15.700]  or no the day after the the limiting to 600 tweets a day which didn't he um didn't he just
[56:15.700 --> 56:20.460]  update it to like 800 now because people are getting that that's hilarious so you get an
[56:20.460 --> 56:29.620]  extra 30 seconds of Twitter use oh dear well if it exists you can find me there but I'm also on
[56:29.620 --> 56:35.620]  mastodon at the mastodon.scott server and hopefully at some point tumblr will update
[56:35.620 --> 56:40.700]  to to be compatible with mastodon because they're they're working on that that'll be nice Wow
[56:40.700 --> 56:46.300]  tumblr coming back from the grave would have thought it I will say tumblr is one of those
[56:46.300 --> 56:52.460]  apps that I never delete from my phone yeah I don't I don't I don't want to create a tumblr
[56:52.460 --> 56:57.100]  account but there are some people that are only on tumblr that I'd like to follow so I want them
[56:57.100 --> 57:00.620]  to hurry up and finish their integration with that so I can go and follow some tumblr accounts
[57:00.620 --> 57:08.860]  from my mastodon account I will say as a avid tumblr in the early days I I think it's so funny
[57:08.860 --> 57:14.780]  to hear that people are some people are back to using it as their main thing that is truly
[57:14.780 --> 57:20.580]  mind-blowing to me yeah next next step tom will start up myspace again yep that's like literally
[57:20.580 --> 57:26.860]  the step above it like it's like I know I'm on tumblr I don't really do much on tumblr but I
[57:27.100 --> 57:33.500]  enjoy it yeah but to think that it's it's making some sort of a comeback is just ridiculous yeah
[57:33.500 --> 57:44.300]  good for them you can find the podcast on Twitter maybe at THS pod I haven't decided for them maybe
[57:44.300 --> 57:49.500]  maybe I've not decided what I'm doing with that cuz like it's one thing creating your own personal
[57:49.500 --> 57:53.220]  one it's another creating one for the podcast cuz then you actually have to queue it up today
[57:53.220 --> 57:58.700]  and look look the best way the best way to keep up to date with the podcast is keep it in your
