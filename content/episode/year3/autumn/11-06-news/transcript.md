## Intro

(30s) **Al:**

> Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al

(35s) **Kev:**

> My name is Kevin.

(36s) **Al:**

> and we're here today to talk about cotch score games.

(40s) **Kev:**

> Woo.

(44s) **Al:**

> Hello Kevin

(46s) **Kev:**

> Hi, ah.

(48s)

> In Utah, we're pumped people.

(50s) **Al:**

> um yeah it has it has been a week

(51s) **Kev:**

> It's been a long week for you, me, the world.

(58s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1m)

> Well, well, we have the same Prime Minister in a week. Who knows?

(1m 5s) **Kev:**

[laughing]

(1m 6s) **Al:**

> All right. We're going to do a news episode this episode.

(1m 11s)

> So we've got a couple new games. We've got a bunch of updates. We've also got, I forgot in the last episode to get the, I know what you released last month. So we're going to go over that as well.

## What Have We Been Up To

(1m 22s) **Al:**

> But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?

(1m 26s) **Kev:**

> What have, well, I'll tell you what my what I've been up to started immediately after recording last week, because we talked about fossil quest that cute little fossil museum simulator game, whatever you want to call it.

(1m 42s)

> And they had a demo or prototype, whatever you want to call it.

(1m 47s)

> I have a thing out on the stud IO and I downloaded it and oh man, I crushed it. I think I had about five hours and I finished all the content there was.

(1m 56s)

> So I it is yeah it's labeled as a demo, but I would call it more of a prototype because it's like you can see what they want it with their thinking of what they want to do, but there is a lot that's not there let's just say that is very under construction right so like the main loop of digging for fossils is and displaying them.

(2m 22s)

> It works to my opinion. You go out to it, you know.

(2m 26s)

> To the field, you dig up fossils and the digging parts, it's good enough. You have a little sensor, you look around trying to find where the fossil is located and find them.

(2m 36s)

> You, like, each individual fossil, you have to, like, delicately uncover and remove all the dirt and rock from it.

(2m 44s)

> So that works fine. After that, you go to your museum, you set up all your fossils and you displace, and all your decorations and everything.

(2m 56s)

> The museum, people come to it with little sequence, and they get an amount of money. Now, with your money, you can go out by more stands for fossil displays or upgrades or decorations or whatever, and then you go back out into the field and rinse and repeat.

(3m 13s)

> Yeah, it's, it's, I like it. It's a, it's a solid loop, big art styles, very cute. Like, there's very little outside that loop. There's like a shopkeeper into one and.

(3m 26s)

> You see, they clearly want to do more with them, but.

(3m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so it's missing the larger game moves, but the core loop you think is pretty.

(3m 34s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, yeah, I think it's pretty, they already got a solid grasp absolutely. Well, anyway, so yeah, so yeah, because I spent about five hours and got pretty much everything.

(3m 44s)

> And maybe some upgrades, but didn't really matter because I had all the fossil at that point. So, but, but yeah, so I'm looking forward to it whenever they've released that game fully. All, all definitely booted up again.

(3m 56s)

> So yeah, fossil quest, thumbs up outside of fossil quest. I think I have put down for now. I haven't gotten the DLC. I'll pull it up when I can't, but like, I mean, did a little post game was running around for filling the decks, teaching stuff, which is actually fairly enjoyable. I'm just running around catching stuff.

(4m 19s)

> And, and the Z a loop of like just, you know, every night is closhed to get a bunch of money and to get the, the Challenger ticket.

(4m 27s)

> Whatever. Well, I think it's a pretty decent groove, but yeah, but I was hitting the kind of wall. And so I decided to mix it up and I am back to premier riders this time my own file. So I'm unlocking everything on my own file. And yeah, I'm enjoying it with us as Caribbean. Right. Well, what's up with you?

(4m 46s) **Al:**

> Fair enough. What about me? I have been playing more Pokémon ZA. I am convinced. I'm determined,

(4m 57s)

> that's the word not convinced. I'm determined to finish up those legendaries and I did that today.

(5m 4s) **Kev:**

> Are you ready to finish it?

(5m 6s) **Al:**

> I got the final one today. Goodness me. It is possibly the most frustrating

(5m 7s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, free.

(5m 9s)

> Free out last.

(5m 16s) **Al:**

> like Endgame to a Pokémon game because it's just like constant. I got really good at getting

(5m 24s)

> so in the DLC they've got their equivalent to the, like so you know how in the night when you're

(5m 34s)

> battling you get the points and then you have used the points to go up the ladder or when you

(5m 38s) **Kev:**

> Yeah

(5m 39s) **Al:**

> finish the ladder you use it to just do you get items from the battles instead. They have an

(5m 43s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, yeah

(5m 45s) **Al:**

> equivalent, which is where

(5m 47s)

> the DLC areas, you get points and then after a while you get the special scans that are you to find special areas.

(5m 56s)

> And so I was maybe getting one of the legendaries every like five to eight special scans.

(6m 5s)

> So like it was a long slog because there's like what 12 legendaries or something like that that you have to get through that.

(6m 12s)

> that. So it was like, I done everything else and I am just grinding.

(6m 16s)

> Getting out these points, doing as many of the things as I can to then do a special scan and then the special scan is not a legendary. It's something I've already done and then you keep going and it's just a bit exhausting, but I got there in the end.

(6m 28s) **Kev:**

> Oh okay, yeah, so it's that loop sounds like a good idea, but just the random element like you just that sort of

(6m 36s) **Al:**

> It's too, it's too random. This is the thing. Like the game knows that those are the only things you've not done, right?

(6m 39s) **Kev:**

> Yeah

(6m 42s) **Al:**

> Like why does it not push you towards the ones that that you've not done yet?

(6m 43s) **Kev:**

> Yeah

(6m 48s) **Al:**

> It just at some point you're like, oh, these are the only Pokemon you don't have in your decks.

(6m 53s)

> Maybe let's give you them as the next five specials cans, you know, like it just it's such a weird a weird annoyance, but I got there. I'm done.

(7m 4s)

> I'm done, so...

(7m 4s) **Kev:**

[laughs]

(7m 7s) **Al:**

> So I picked up Shield today, Pokemon Shield, to finish up that decks and get that into home.

(7m 11s) **Kev:**

> Ooh!

(7m 13s)

> Yeah.

(7m 15s) **Al:**

> I'm determined to get that done before Pokemon Day, and then I'll have all of the games, decks, and homes and all of that stuff, so...

(7m 18s) **Kev:**

> Welcome on day.

(7m 23s)

> Uh, yeah.

(7m 25s) **Al:**

> Ready to not play Pokemon for six months until the new game comes out, or like, end months, probably.

(7m 25s) **Kev:**

> Done and done.

(7m 30s)

> Unless they have black white gray releasing it

(7m 34s)

> You don't know you don't know that you don't know it's the Elka version though it's the elka really

(7m 36s) **Al:**

> I mean, no.

(7m 38s)

> Even if that comes out this year, it won't come out until October. Like, come on, let's not, let's be real here.

(7m 46s)

> But don't I, don't I, though?

(7m 50s) **Kev:**

> I'm pretty sure they're shooting into our greenhouse episode.

(7m 56s) **Al:**

> I also picked up the Starsand Island demo, so this is the game that comes out this week.

## Starsand Island Demo

(8m 4s) **Al:**

> comes out of the day this episode comes

(8m 6s)

> out I think 11th yeah and they've actually taken the demo down off steam after I downloaded

(8m 14s)

> it because they don't they say because the aliases coming out I'm like I don't demos have

(8m 19s) **Kev:**

> What?

(8m 20s) **Al:**

> their use even when games have released like I don't understand why no I don't either and I think

(8m 21s) **Kev:**

> What?

(8m 24s)

> I don't like that.

(8m 27s) **Al:**

> it's purely because they they don't want to keep up to date so the demo save file doesn't

(8m 33s) **Kev:**

[Laughter]

(8m 36s) **Al:**

> go to the actual game and I think it's an old build like based on what they've said

(8m 41s)

> the demo has less in it than the actual game which obviously makes sense but like it's

(8m 46s)

> an old old version of things and I think they just didn't want to keep the save compatibility

(8m 51s)

> going and probably thought that if they want I guess this is the problem with early access

(8m 59s)

> right is that if you do have a demo then the demo does become quite out of date quite

(9m 4s)

> quickly, right? Because there's a lot of like...

(9m 6s)

> quality of life improvements that come in early access, especially quite early on, right? Because that's your first like proper feedback that you get, and then you're like, okay, we'll do a quick quality of life update to start with with all these things that people complained about.

(9m 21s)

> Great, fine. But that means your demo then doesn't have all that unless you update it, which I would argue is what you should do. But I guess they probably just don't want to put in the effort of that.

(9m 31s)

> And I guess if you have an out of date demo, then the argument is better.

(9m 36s)

> To have no demo than an out of date demo, I guess, you know, is, you know, is, but anyway, so I managed to get it before the ticket down. So I've got it.

(9m 48s) **Kev:**

> Well, look at now, you can sell your PC for like $500 with the install and then you get that PT money.

(9m 50s) **Al:**

> I don't think anybody cares about the stars on day one demo, but I think I am definitely enjoying this game.

(10m 4s) **Kev:**

> Okay, ooh, that's good.

(10m 4s) **Al:**

> It's... It's...

(10m 6s)

> So when I... when we looked at it before, we were a bit unsure on how it looks, right? Like, "Ooh, it looks like it might be okay. It might be bad."

(10m 14s)

> Like, maybe it's another one of those, you know, heartopia type things where it just ends up being pretty lackluster.

(10m 21s)

> But I got hooked into the colute pretty quickly. I like a lot of...

(10m 27s)

> I like a lot of how it works. I like the quest system and I like...

(10m 33s)

> Okay, one interesting thing about it is the

(10m 36s)

> crops take in-game hours to grow rather than in-game days. So, the first, yeah, yeah, so the first day you have like a bunch of

(10m 43s) **Kev:**

> Well, that's, that's weird, but okay.

(10m 48s) **Al:**

> wheat to grow and if you choose that path, that's the other thing is it does the the oh you can have

(10m 56s)

> different ways of playing the game. Do you want to be a farmer? Do you want to be a rancher? Do you want to be a

(11m 1s)

> crafter, etcetera, etcetera. The way that Luma Island does it as well.

(11m 6s)

> But yeah, so if you choose farming, you can choose any of them or all of them as well. Like you can overload yourself with too many quests if you want.

(11m 14s) **Kev:**

> Yeah

(11m 14s) **Al:**

> But which of course is what I did. But if you get the wheat and you grow it, you'll have it before you go to bed, which is very interesting.

(11m 17s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, that is that's the way you do it

(11m 30s) **Al:**

> I think it creates a very quick positive feedback loop. I think.

(11m 36s)

> Not saying that the way other games do it is bad, but having to wait multiple days before

(11m 40s)

> you have a crop and then you can say, I'm not saying that as bad, but I do like what

(11m 44s)

> this is doing in so much as I didn't do the thing that I do in most farming games, which

(11m 51s)

> is where I speedrun the start of the game because there's nothing to do because there was

(11m 54s)

> everything to do still, right?

(11m 56s)

> Because once the point I'm going to sleep with my crops, I'm going to be ready and two

(12m 2s)

> more in game errors, right?

(12m 3s)

> I mean, as well, wait for them and farm them and they go sell them.

(12m 6s)

> So crops seem to be open 24/7 as well, which is interesting.

(12m 11s) **Kev:**

> Oh, that's okay. That's really interesting. Just like the eternal farming game. That's weird.

(12m 16s) **Al:**

> And the, well, you do still have to sleep and if you don't go to bed before 2 a.m., then

(12m 22s)

> you do the standard collapsing thing.

(12m 24s)

> But yeah, it's like if you're awake, you can go to the shop.

(12m 28s)

> Like I went to a shop at midnight and it was still open, so that was interesting.

(12m 33s)

> The other thing is, farming takes back.

(12m 36s)

> It takes stamina, it takes stamina to fill your water in cans, specifically.

(12m 46s)

> It does not take stamina to plant seeds to water the seeds to harvest the seeds.

(12m 54s) **Kev:**

> Okay, that's cool.

(12m 54s) **Al:**

> So these are just some things that I quite like about it, and I think it's very...

(12m 59s)

> I'm going to need more time with the game, which I can't get right now, because I've run out of time in the demo.

(13m 6s)

> And yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah, I could probably starve and you save.

(13m 9s) **Kev:**

> ha ha ha ha ha yeah no you know that's a good problem right like it's left you

(13m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't want to do that.

(13m 16s)

> Yeah, exactly.

(13m 17s)

> So I need more time before I decide exactly how I feel about the game, but I'm definitely interested to play more.

(13m 17s) **Kev:**

> wanting more

(13m 25s) **Al:**

> It's not one of those ones when I pick up and it takes me forever to get into it.

(13m 29s)

> I was hooked pretty quick, which is hard for me to get hooked into a 3D farming game as well.

(13m 36s)

> I don't like how those work, but this has been quite...

(13m 40s)

> Here's another... one of the things that really annoys me about 3D farming games is trying to figure out the grid system, right?

(13m 48s)

> Because you're not looking, you know, top down, it's much harder to see where squares are and stuff like that.

(13m 54s)

> So when you have a tool, it's very good at showing you the square that you're looking at, which is obviously an important thing.

(14m 1s)

> But also the watering, you can just hold the box.

(14m 6s)

> It looks like you are, but it doesn't just, it just doesn't use up your thing, so, you know.

(14m 10s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, oh

(14m 14s)

> That's great. That's a good one

(14m 32s) **Al:**

> So, you know, that's a quality of life.

(14m 36s)

> You'll see the plot of land. It doesn't just have like the two states of water done unwatered.

(14m 56s)

> You will see it slowly go unwatered if you're watching it and it'll go from like a you know how they

(15m 2s)

> they always have like their kind of gray colored

(15m 6s)

> in their knot and then there are darker color when they're watered. It will transition slowly from one to the other, but not in a gradient, it's like the amount of ground that is watered, that is the watered color gets smaller.

(15m 9s) **Kev:**

> Yeah.

(15m 21s) **Al:**

> So you'll see this like circle of watered stuff in the middle, that's getting smaller and smaller and it will continue to be watered and be growing until it runs out of water completely and then it's completely dry again.

(15m 36s)

> Then you can water at any point and refill it and it's just it's growing for however long it has water or until it's fully grown.

(15m 45s)

> So it's just I don't know if I explained that one well or not, but it's like visually really, visually really easy to see how much water is left.

(15m 49s) **Kev:**

> I think I get it, but

(15m 55s)

> Yeah, yeah, that's the key thing like take away like you can tell just by looking where you're at

(16m)

> That's instead of waiting for a random time or what feels like a random time because you're not thinking about it. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool

(16m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And it does the nice, it does the nice, like you see sparkles on the

(16m 9s)

> plant when it is fully grown. So it has some, it has night. Well, so it gets better, it gets better

(16m 11s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, oh, that's okay. That's such a good one. Oh

(16m 16s) **Al:**

> Kevin. So those two things are really nice for like, Oh, just like looking over at your crops and going

(16m 21s)

> like, Oh, nothing's fully grown yet. And everything still has water. Great. That's fine. But if you

(16m 26s)

> You want more details if you go up and you put your focus on one of the...

(16m 31s)

> plants, it will tell you exactly how much water it's got left and exactly how long it's got left to grow.

(16m 36s) **Kev:**

> That's wild. That's that's wild, but like good wild. Oh man. Look at these innovations coming in

(16m 44s) **Al:**

> You know, right? Like, this is the thing they're actually doing some interesting things that I've not seen in other games.

(16m 49s)

> And lots of them are just really nice quality of life things rather than like, Oh, this time, everyone's blue.

(16m 58s)

> You know, or something like that, right? Like it's, it's, it's actually just trying.

(16m 58s) **Kev:**

[laughing]

(17m 2s) **Al:**

> It's kind of like what Starjoo did, right? Starjoo did. Here's what farming games are and here's how I want to make it better in a bunch of ways.

(17m 9s)

> Um, it's the same sort of thing. Like what would I do if I was building Harvard?

(17m 14s)

> this moon now it kind of feels like that. Um, also, you can write a skateboard. And you can even jump

(17m 17s) **Kev:**

> That's, uh, that's cool.

(17m 20s)

> Why are you saving the best for the last?

(17m 24s)

> Oh, is it?

(17m 26s) **Al:**

> while on the skateboard. You can jump over fences on the skateboard. They're oh, while Kevin, there are also

(17m 26s) **Kev:**

> Okay. Is it?

(17m 28s)

> Okay. To a roller skates in X, Y.

(17m 36s) **Al:**

> roller skates. I haven't unlocked them, but I have seen someone mention that there is a roller skates blue

(17m 36s) **Kev:**

> Ah. Oh. Okay.

(17m 43s)

> Okay. So, my point being was like,

(17m 47s)

> in X, Y, while I think we're cool and overall I'm glad they're in there.

(17m 51s)

> A lot of times we're fairly ineffective, um,

(17m 54s)

> aside from certain niche, like tracks or spots or whatever.

(17m 59s)

> How does it feel here?

(18m)

> Does the skateboard feel worth it?

(18m 2s) **Al:**

> it does. I do have a couple of issues. So one, I think this is just me getting used to it

(18m 13s)

> thing. There's been a couple of times where I've misjudged how far it takes to jump something,

(18m 18s)

> and I think that that will just come in time, but you know, we'll see. But you do, it does work

(18m 26s)

> how you would expect a skateboard to work if you're coming up to something and you press the

(18m 29s)

> jump up in the right hand, you will jump over the thing and continue.

(18m 32s)

> Keep going with your your your your speed which is very nice for traveling around the map like I basically once I got the skateboard. I stopped walking around the map. I was using this keyboard the entire time because of you.

(18m 43s) **Kev:**

> That's what I want to hear. That's good.

(18m 44s) **Al:**

> But this is not a problem with the skateboard so it has a tool wheel for selecting your tools to complain about this one your items still have to use up space in your bag.

(18m 56s)

> I hate that. Give me a tool wheel which is a separate like tool bag.

(19m 2s)

> So I don't have to have my bag space wasted with my tools when I have a tool wheel. Second, the tool wheel.

(19m 3s) **Kev:**

> Oh.

(19m 8s)

> But where are you storing them out? Doesn't make any sense out.

(19m 14s) **Al:**

> The tool wheel is not big enough. So let me just let me just double check what the current set. Let me build the game and double check exactly how many it was but.

(19m 16s) **Kev:**

> Oh, that's an actual problem.

(19m 26s) **Al:**

> Oh no, I can't launch the demo anymore. They've revoked the licenses for the demo disaster.

(19m 30s) **Kev:**

> BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO B Oh!

(19m 33s) **Al:**

> Oh goodness me.

(19m 38s)

> So I think it was eight slots on the tool wheel and considering we had axe pickaxe hole, watering can.

(19m 48s) **Kev:**

> I mean, if skateboard can go on there, that alone.

(19m 50s) **Al:**

> Well yeah, but let me let me finish a watering can. What else was their fishing rod bug net.

(19m 58s)

> And there was at least one more tool, but I can't remember what it was and then

(20m 2s)

> I was left with one slot, which you're like, oh, that's fine. The skateboard goes in that slot.

(20m 8s)

> Here's the problem. Your seeds have to go in the slot to in a slot to farm.

(20m 14s)

> You have to select seeds from the tool wheel, and I think this is the big problem with it,

(20m 22s)

> because my tools, including my skateboard, filled up my entire tool wheel.

(20m 27s)

> So I had to take one of the tools out to then add seeds into my

(20m 32s) **Kev:**

> Oh no.

(20m 32s) **Al:**

> tool wheel. So I think they need to do something there because I think it's it's the exact right number of slots if you solve that seed problem and you either give a different way to deal with seed somehow or you just do a different way of selecting it.

(20m 50s)

> It does feel weird that seeds are too in the tool wheel right like I get I think I get what they're doing it just it feels like they made that decision from a technical implementation.

(21m 2s)

> But so you do end up fiddling around a little bit right where like okay it's time to put a new bunch of places out to far.

(21m 27s)

> to put a new bunch of places out to see it far.

(21m 32s)

> I will need to put the whole into my toolbar bar and then I'll need to move it out and put the seeds in it's not the end of the world

(21m 39s)

> But it's fiddly, you know

(21m 41s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, yeah, I get that.

(21m 42s) **Al:**

> Especially if you have multiple multiple seeds you're putting down right like there was one time I had three sets of seeds

(21m 47s)

> I wanted to buy and use all at the same time and that took a lot of fiddling around to actually get it to work

(21m 54s)

> But yeah, it is what it is. I think they need to solve that the seed problem, but other than that pretty good

(22m)

> And yeah, this keyboard is good, and

(22m 2s)

> I didn't get to try any of the other vehicles, but there are other things. Like I saw for example, there's a more page you can rent.

(22m 10s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, that would be my guess right like you have skateboard

(22m 14s)

> Roller skates smoke bed feels like the next one

(22m 17s) **Al:**

> No, but you can rent the mopad before you own one.

(22m 19s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, okay

(22m 21s) **Al:**

> Like, first day, you can go and rent the mopad if you want, which is really interesting.

(22m 23s) **Kev:**

> Ooh, first day ooh, that's nice

(22m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. It's just there. It's just sitting there. You can just pay and rent it on its

(22m 29s)

> pair in game minute that you pay for.

(22m 31s) **Kev:**

> Oh

(22m 33s)

> That's that's innovative and what I don't know if I like that, but it is kind of cool

(22m 37s) **Al:**

> I think I think I do like it because it gives you options early game like nobody's making you use it

(22m 43s)

> but it's that or it's that or you have to wait and if you want to waste your money on

(22m 49s)

> on the moped you can do that right like why should we stop you doing that like I think it's a great I think

(22m 57s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, well, yeah, being open for the start, that is a fantastic idea, 100%.

(23m 2s) **Al:**

> So, um, there's probably a lot more I could talk about this game, but I probably shouldn't because we're 25 minutes into the end.

(23m 8s) **Kev:**

> I feel like you should on a certain place at a certain time. Maybe not here right now, but

(23m 13s) **Al:**

(23m 21s) **Kev:**

> And you can keep it that time!

(23m 24s) **Al:**

(25m 52s)

> You get a good one and people fall

(25m 55s)

> But the speed at which rusty likes have become a thing is pretty impressive

(25m 55s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(26m)

> Yeah, I think it's because they're quite low stakes. They're quite easy to especially if you have an existing like base of

(26m 8s)

## ConcernedApe Interview

(34m 7s) **Al:**

> Alright, finally, we're not finally finally. Finally, before the new games, we have an interview that IGN did with ConcernD, about 10th anniversary of Stardew Valley.

(34m 18s) **Kev:**

> Okay, first of all, I mean, did you start aging instantly? Did you like feel the grip if you're sprouting when you heard that?

(34m 27s) **Al:**

> oh yeah don't even yeah it's all right only one year and then the switch will be

(34m 29s) **Kev:**

> I didn't realize it's nook up on me. And yeah.

(34m 35s) **Al:**

> 10 years old so you know just gonna keep keep coming and keep happening and you

(34m 41s)

> know the um the Wii is 20 years old this year as well

(34m 44s) **Kev:**

> So now the concern dates ancient.

(34m 47s)

> Oh my goodness. No, that one I can live with. That one is all that's fine.

(34m 52s) **Al:**

> anyway there were a couple of things I found interesting from this interview

(34m 57s)

> so he does talk a bit about concern not pretending

(35m 1s)

> haunted juggle tier but that's all we covered that in his blub but like this

(35m 6s)

> feels like the blog post was in reaction to these questions

(35m 8s) **Kev:**

> Leave him.

(35m 11s)

> Yeah.

(35m 12s)

[laughter]

(35m 13s) **Al:**

> but interestingly so he said that he would consider doing a starchy valley at some point

(35m 17s)

> I've starchy valley too at some point and even started working on one but I ended up

(35m 23s)

> doing Hunter Chocolatier instead.

(35m 25s)

> - Yeah.

(35m 27s)

> He says that he would find it interesting,

(35m 30s)

> but he'd need to decide whether it was like different characters and a different area,

(35m 36s)

> or whether it's the same characters, but then you have to decide on which story lines progress and

(35m 43s)

> stuff like that. So I don't think we'll ever get that, but I thought it was an interesting thing

(35m 44s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, it is an interesting thought. I don't think you should do it because you have for those

(35m 52s)

> exact reasons. It's a it's a pickle to think and no one's someone's gonna be upset by it no

(35m 59s)

> matter what it what you pick so there's no no winning

(36m) **Al:**

> But you probably shouldn't, you should probably shouldn't decide to use that as the reason

(36m 7s)

> not to do something, right?

(36m 9s) **Kev:**

> - Well, I guess, yeah.

(36m 11s)

> - Yeah, I mean, look at us.

(36m 12s)

[laughs]

(36m 14s)

> - Uh, yeah, the real secret.

(36m 16s)

> Start new two, and possibly one could argue,

(36m 19s)

> start a three-party release.

(36m 20s)

> They're just hitting the updates.

(36m 22s)

[laughs]

(36m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(36m 23s) **Kev:**

> Basically.

(36m 24s)

[laughs]

(36m 25s) **Al:**

> What the other thing I found interesting now

(36m 27s)

> I don't know whether he's saying that this is not happening or is happening or might be happening

(36m 32s)

> But let me just quote this for you one idea that we were toying with for 1.7

(36m 36s)

> I don't know if this will happen or not was adding a farm map editor for the public

(36m 41s)

> So you could basically make your own because with every update

(36m 44s)

> It's traditional to add a new farm type when they came first came out

(36m 47s)

> There was just standard farm and that was it and then 1.0 added four different farms and then with every update

(36m 54s)

> What if we opened up this up to the community and it was like now you could press an extra button go into a browser and look at everyone's farm creation

(37m 2s)

> That now adds almost infinite replayability to Stardew Valley. I think this would be great

(37m 8s)

> Like being able to go like oh, here's a starter farm. I've made this swamp or

(37m 14s)

> like here's our second beach farm or something like I love the idea of being able to go

(37m 19s)

> you know, oh, another cell, let me see what other random

(37m 23s)

> farm layouts people have done like another kind of for like because this allows you because obviously you can do this with mods

(37m 29s)

> but not everybody has mods and being able to have this would be I think fantastic

(37m 31s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, I think so too, and you know what I think it should be a separate part

(37m 38s)

> Like I don't know I think the

(37m 41s)

> Making it like these the starter farm sounds like a lot because like

(37m 46s)

> That's a lot to do before you start the game, you know, but anyways, but generally speaking the idea of a bar map editor

(37m 54s) **Al:**

> Well, I think I think the idea would not necessarily

(37m 57s)

> be the someone who's first playing Stardew Valley

(37m 59s)

> goes, oh, I'm going to create my own custom map.

(38m 2s)

> It's another option, right?

(38m 4s)

> Like you can go in and either you can select one of the eight

(38m 8s)

> that you currently has or you can scan a QR code

(38m 14s)

> and get someone set up, or if you really want,

(38m 17s)

> you can then do a custom one yourself.

(38m 19s)

> Like I don't think the idea is that you'll open up.

(38m 23s)

> And it'll be like, "Oh, what's your name?"

(38m 24s)

> I know we're like, "Okay, now design a farm."

(38m 26s)

> I don't think that's what it will be.

(38m 27s) **Kev:**

[laughs]

(38m 28s) **Al:**

> Like, if there is a farm designer, I think it will be, yeah.

(38m 31s)

> I think you're right, it will be like accessible within the game,

(38m 34s)

> but not like you have to design it before you start the game.

(38m 38s)

> Yeah, that would feel a lot.

(38m 40s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, yeah, you get my point. Okay. Well, yeah, no

(38m 42s) **Al:**

> I think I get your point. I think I get your point.

(38m 46s)

> But I just love the idea of going like, "I'm going to do a new save."

(38m 49s)

> You know, someone's created this really weird thing that makes it really hard

(38m 54s)

> to give you a bunch more options.

(38m 56s)

> Like, I really like the one that has a little bit of, you know, stone area.

(39m)

> Maybe I want one that has more of that, you know, stuff like that.

(39m 3s)

> I really like that.

(39m 4s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, okay, sure. Yeah, I'm I'm just I guess not think about a little further how

(39m 10s)

> Or wonder how much you can actually do with it because I don't know

(39m 15s)

> Because on the just break it open to

(39m 16s) **Al:**

> It's definitely more about layout rather than anything else, right? Like it's not like you're

(39m 21s)

> going to be able to do big, complicated things, right? You'll be able to say this area is beach,

(39m 26s)

> this area is, you know, normal farmland, this is a cave. You could, you could have, and you can

(39m 32s)

> have different levels on there, right? Like we've seen that on the, it's not the four levels,

(39m 38s)

> the four corners farm. It's the other one that's like the different areas. It has an area that's

(39m 43s)

> for rocks in an area that's watery and in

(39m 45s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, yeah

(39m 46s) **Al:**

> That has one where you go up, a bit and like the rock bit is up high, isn't it? So you could do multiple

(39m 53s)

> levels, for example.

(39m 55s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, sure. Yeah, all right, can't make the Jojo Mark farm or your entire plots of Jojo Mark

(40m 3s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't think it'll be. I mean, maybe he'll add like one other idea of something that could be added in, but I don't think it's suddenly going to be like, you could build the entire village in your farm or anything.

(40m 15s) **Kev:**

> heh heh heh heh heh.

(40m 17s)

> Alright sure. Yeah either way, it's probably a fun idea.

(40m 20s)

> Do it. I did rea- before this interview, I didn't realize we're getting more, um, you know, marriage candidates or whatever.

(40m 31s) **Al:**

> Yes. Yeah, that was the other thing is is he said that there's gonna be more of that, but we don't know

(40m 38s) **Kev:**

> and mmm there's a lot obviously we have a lot of fee I have a lot of feelings on that but I'll just wait to see who it is

(40m 45s) **Al:**

> Do you? Yes.

(40m 49s) **Kev:**

> yeah

(40m 51s)

> oh we we can't I can't I can't bring myself to dare to hope that you'll be right now that we can do divorce simulator

(41m 1s) **Al:**

> I don't think we will, I don't think you'll do that.

(41m 1s) **Kev:**

> I don't think so either but it's so tempting to hope

(41m 8s) **Al:**

> I just, I think it would be hilarious if he just added Clint and no one else.

(41m 8s) **Kev:**

> we can

(41m 13s) **Al:**

> It's like, here's your new, your new romance of all is, it's just the ultimate troll update, right?

(41m 14s) **Kev:**

> that would be pretty good

(41m 18s)

> that'd be good I'm down for that yeah absolutely

(41m 22s) **Al:**

> All right, next we have two new games announced. First up, we have Emberville, awakened with no one else.

## New Games

## Emberville

(41m 31s) **Al:**

> And no memories inside, here we go, the Vitromotus, a vast underground world created as a magical dungeon where death no longer lasts, explore its depth, battle dangerous creatures, rescue survivors and rebuild the ruined town of Emberville while uncovering the truth behind this prison.

(41m 52s) **Kev:**

> Uh, that's, that's a lot of okay. Yeah, that that's a lot to take in. I'm, I'm down for these. I think just get you know, I won't lie. They, they caught me off guard. I didn't expect that the final word of that to be prison.

(42m 9s)

> Okay. Okay. And no one stopped it. Okay. Wait. Does that count for the crops too?

(42m 16s)

> I don't know.

(42m 19s) **Al:**

> Ooh, good question. Yeah, does death exist for crops?

(42m 23s) **Kev:**

> And how does the combat work if you can't, or I guess I'm just getting off.

(42m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I'm presuming it's if I think I'm presuming it just means roguelike

(42m 33s)

> Right like you can't die, but you can you know respawn

(42m 37s) **Kev:**

> Oh, it's Hades, it's just Hades.

(42m 41s) **Al:**

> Farming hit wait. There's farming in Hades too, isn't there?

(42m 44s) **Kev:**

> A little bit, I think, at least in Hades too, yeah, yeah.

(42m 47s) **Al:**

> So yeah, it's just

(42m 49s)

> just, yeah, I don't know. It's interesting. I wonder whether the mystery will actually

(42m 50s) **Kev:**

> They reinvented Hades, they got me, they got me figured out.

(43m) **Al:**

> be interesting or not. I'm not super interested in the farming part of this. It just looks pretty

(43m 8s)

> basic, but that doesn't feel like it's the main part of it. That's just a thing that they've

(43m 14s)

> slotted into the game as part of you know it looks like you are

(43m 19s)

> rebuilding a town right so it is a life simulator is a you know town builder but it very much looks like the point is the exploring and the finding out the mysteries and the combat that's like the main part so yeah.

(43m 35s) **Kev:**

> I do like the aesthetic. It's a little bit somber, I guess, like, it's very not gray like

(43m 42s)

> bad, like just the tones are very cool and a little dark.

(43m 47s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, I also think it's, your farm is a lot brighter.

(43m 51s)

> And I wonder if that's deliberate

(43m 53s)

> in that it's meant to be like this is the cam happy area.

(43m 58s) **Kev:**

> I guess so. Yeah, there's like a beach area too. Yeah, there's a few spots.

(44m 2s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but I think that could be the same,

(44m 5s)

> like maybe there's a part of it that's cam

(44m 7s)

> and part of it is, oh, that beach area does not look cam.

(44m 11s)

> That looks like a xenomorph from alien

(44m 14s) **Kev:**

> yep that yeah there is something coming out of the ground there you're right but it is the bright

(44m 14s) **Al:**

> coming out of the sand there.

(44m 17s)

> How do you make sand look not

(44m 21s)

> bright? That's the question.

(44m 22s) **Kev:**

> yeah I guess um that's a good yeah yeah yeah good point um that it's it has me intrigued

(44m 24s) **Al:**

> Then it's just mud if it's not

(44m 25s)

> bright.

(44m 29s)

> Certainly want to keep an eye on I

(44m 34s) **Kev:**

> at worst it might be cult of the lambish and that's what that was a good game

(44m 39s)

> It's a good game. We'll haven't kicked the game out. I should probably get back to that one day.

(44m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah, you do you do seem to be rebuilding the town and there just seem to be at least some sort of movement

(44m 51s)

> There might be just be on your farm that you're moving buildings

(44m 53s)

> But you definitely see moving buildings and I see in the town. They're definitely like rebuilding buildings

(44m 59s)

> So it might just be your farm you have control over where everything is and on in the rest of the town. You're just fixing things up

(45m 8s)

> Possibly but there's at least something there who knows how sandboxy it'll be

(45m 9s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, something like that.

(45m 13s) **Al:**

> as we can. This change.

(45m 15s)

> No, no, no, no, no. The cover art doesn't have the jewel chained. It just has the jewel, but on the video it's chained up at the end. So I think that the idea is to unchain it.

(45m 15s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, that looks important.

(45m 17s)

> Sondyl, Blake Logo, who knows.

(45m 20s)

> The mystery solved the mystery.

(45m 22s)

> Why is that jewel changed?

(45m 24s)

> I don't know.

(45m 28s)

> Oh, just the jewel itself, yeah, okay.

(45m 31s)

> Wait, what?

(45m 34s)

> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(45m 42s)

> Yeah, it's though you beat the game and other chains off

(45m 49s) **Al:**

> Yes, maybe, maybe we'll see.

(45m 52s)

> So yeah, lots to keep an eye on.

(45m 54s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, the one one more note that chicken. There's like a chicken with like a very like

(45m 59s)

> I heard of your nonsense expression. I don't know how to best describe it thumbs up for that chicken

(46m 2s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(46m 4s)

> No, I get what you mean, I get what you mean.

(46m 6s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, I like that chicken

(46m 9s) **Al:**

> And finally, we have Mystical Demon Farm.

## Mystical Demon Farm

(46m 13s) **Kev:**

> That's a title

(46m 14s) **Al:**

> Mystical?

(46m 15s)

> It is, it is very words.

(46m 18s)

> Mystical Demon Farm is a cute, cozy, but lively farm game

(46m 23s)

> that blends farming simulation, monster collecting,

(46m 26s)

> and dungeon crawling, collect demons,

(46m 28s)

> grow your operation and build an amazing farm

(46m 32s)

> of the Queen's Recognition.

(46m 34s) **Kev:**

> Oh, okay, um, look, so sometimes, and I'm not trying to single anyone out, it's just a friend.

(46m 37s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(46m 38s)

> That is correct, okay.

(46m 46s) **Kev:**

> Sometimes the gains that we've covered just feel a little madlifts, right?

(46m 51s)

> Just insert your adjective and noun and and genre or two.

(46m 57s)

> And here we are, um, no, not necessarily inherently.

(47m) **Al:**

> Is that bad?

(47m 5s) **Kev:**

> But let's see what we've got to put in here.

(47m 6s)

> Um, the arts are right.

(47m 9s)

> I guess there's a lot of wiggling stuff.

(47m 11s)

> I don't know, I don't know how I feel about that, but plants are wiggling.

(47m 13s) **Al:**

> Everything wiggle.

(47m 15s) **Kev:**

> I don't like that.

(47m 16s)

> Um, there's very cute bunnies, creature things.

(47m 22s)

> Um, what, what is, okay, some of the designs are fun.

(47m 25s)

> There's like sheep, but I don't know what that head is.

(47m 28s)

> It looks like a turtle.

(47m 29s)

> Is that a trunk? Maybe there's radish

(47m 33s) **Al:**

> Where are you in this trailer? I'm not, oh wait, I think I just saw where it was. So that was a sheep without green head and I

(47m 34s) **Kev:**

> here? Oh yeah, oh 24 you can see a farm and all sorts of crazy animals. You've got

(47m 44s) **Al:**

> Okay.

(47m 45s) **Kev:**

> slimes, you've got sonic, the hedgehog over there. There's a lady in a bunny suit. I don't

(47m 49s) **Al:**

> Oh yeah.

(47m 52s) **Kev:**

> know what's up with that, but there is no, no, no, I'm not talking like the, the, the

(47m 56s)

> hot bunny suit. I mean like like it looks like the other bunnies looks like an animal, but it's

(48m 1s) **Al:**

> Oh

(48m 1s) **Kev:**

> Ladies, is that a lady?

(48m 4s)

> I don't know what's going on over there.

(48m 6s) **Al:**

> I think oh I don't know that's part of the UI. Yeah, I think that just might be I think that might just be the spring

(48m 8s) **Kev:**

> Or is that part of the UI?

(48m 11s)

> It's sort of the UI.

(48m 14s) **Al:**

> I think like because it's spring you're seeing your player character in a bunny outfit

(48m 19s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, it looks like Easter bunny that's the that's the yeah, okay. That's what it is. Yeah, it never rides on the corner

(48m 20s) **Al:**

> I think that's yeah

(48m 23s)

> But the but but but but the bunnies do look like just a person in a bunny suit

(48m 30s) **Kev:**

> They do like zipper tea and animal crossing if you'll they are they are they are upright there

(48m 37s) **Al:**

> Yes. Look, I will see. I get the concerns about this game, but it does feel like it's coming from

(48m 43s)

> somewhere trying to do something interesting, even if it does feel a little bit bandwagonly as well.

(48m 46s) **Kev:**

> it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, that is that those are some, there are some designs that

(48m 49s) **Al:**

> You don't write on a broom, you write on a book, apparently.

(48m 58s) **Kev:**

> thing, it's certain uses. Um, um, there's a lot of like, look at that's a crazy looking

(49m 2s) **Al:**

> Yes.

(49m 7s) **Kev:**

> skill tree. What is going on there? There's a lot of menus in this game. Not again, not

(49m 12s)

> bad thing just... I'm gonna burn off.

(49m 13s) **Al:**

> Well, maybe a bad thing.

(49m 16s) **Kev:**

> Okay, well, oh, you are writing books. You're like surfing them. Um, yeah, I don't know.

(49m 22s) **Al:**

> Well, say it's at all.

(49m 24s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, it is like a turtle sheep and burn up boy, but it's radish. Redish boy.

(49m 33s)

> There's a lot going on. Oh my gosh, there's world maps. It's like final fantasy.

(49m 38s)

> Um, they got a lot going on. Again, none of it necessarily bad just, oh yeah.

(49m 43s) **Al:**

> It has some problems.

(49m 46s) **Kev:**

> It has very like, there's clearly like a dungeon rope.

(49m 50s)

> Who like feeling thin because you've got vampire survivor, because you've got like all these

(49m 56s)

> monsters and animals around you and you're doing it at a hyperbeam and...

(50m) **Al:**

> Kevin there's a blue hedgehog

(50m 2s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, I told you, I said Sonic! I said I'm the farm! Yeah, you got Sonic's there.

(50m 3s) **Al:**

> Oh, I missed you saying that and missed you saying that

(50m 9s)

> This is the problem with trying to talk a better way. I'll also watching the video is

(50m 13s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, no, that's, but now I get it.

(50m 14s) **Al:**

> not a big attention

(50m 17s) **Kev:**

> It's fine. Oh, yeah, there's a lot going, let's just think of it out. No, no, no, no, no.

(50m 25s) **Al:**

> Yes, so we don't have any information about when it's coming out yet.

(50m 28s)

> Just coming soon.

(50m 30s) **Kev:**

> Yeah, okay. You know what? I think they won me over. There's a lot of nonsense going on here.

(50m 36s) **Al:**

[Laughter]

(50m 38s) **Kev:**

> I'm down for some. Yeah, yeah. Had a lot of times, yeah, but the good kind, huh? But

(50m 38s) **Al:**

> That's what Kevin wants in a game, nonsense.
