5
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.880

7
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.259
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Hi, ah.

8
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.399
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: In Utah, we're pumped people.

9
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.219
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: um yeah it has it has been a week

10
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.820
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: It's been a long week for you, me, the world.

11
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.820
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah.

12
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Well, well, we have the same Prime Minister in a week. Who knows?

13
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.260
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughing]

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: All right. We're going to do a news episode this episode.

15
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:22.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So we've got a couple new games. We've got a bunch of updates. We've also got, I forgot in the last episode to get the, I know what you released last month. So we're going to go over that as well.

16
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?

17
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:41.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: What have, well, I'll tell you what my what I've been up to started immediately after recording last week, because we talked about fossil quest that cute little fossil museum simulator game, whatever you want to call it.

18
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: And they had a demo or prototype, whatever you want to call it.

19
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I have a thing out on the stud IO and I downloaded it and oh man, I crushed it. I think I had about five hours and I finished all the content there was.

20
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:21.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: So I it is yeah it's labeled as a demo, but I would call it more of a prototype because it's like you can see what they want it with their thinking of what they want to do, but there is a lot that's not there let's just say that is very under construction right so like the main loop of digging for fossils is and displaying them.

21
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: It works to my opinion. You go out to it, you know.

22
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: To the field, you dig up fossils and the digging parts, it's good enough. You have a little sensor, you look around trying to find where the fossil is located and find them.

23
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: You, like, each individual fossil, you have to, like, delicately uncover and remove all the dirt and rock from it.

24
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: So that works fine. After that, you go to your museum, you set up all your fossils and you displace, and all your decorations and everything.

25
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:13.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: The museum, people come to it with little sequence, and they get an amount of money. Now, with your money, you can go out by more stands for fossil displays or upgrades or decorations or whatever, and then you go back out into the field and rinse and repeat.

26
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, it's, it's, I like it. It's a, it's a solid loop, big art styles, very cute. Like, there's very little outside that loop. There's like a shopkeeper into one and.

27
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: You see, they clearly want to do more with them, but.

28
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.240
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, so it's missing the larger game moves, but the core loop you think is pretty.

29
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah, I think it's pretty, they already got a solid grasp absolutely. Well, anyway, so yeah, so yeah, because I spent about five hours and got pretty much everything.

30
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: And maybe some upgrades, but didn't really matter because I had all the fossil at that point. So, but, but yeah, so I'm looking forward to it whenever they've released that game fully. All, all definitely booted up again.

31
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:19.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: So yeah, fossil quest, thumbs up outside of fossil quest. I think I have put down for now. I haven't gotten the DLC. I'll pull it up when I can't, but like, I mean, did a little post game was running around for filling the decks, teaching stuff, which is actually fairly enjoyable. I'm just running around catching stuff.

32
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: And, and the Z a loop of like just, you know, every night is closhed to get a bunch of money and to get the, the Challenger ticket.

33
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:47.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Whatever. Well, I think it's a pretty decent groove, but yeah, but I was hitting the kind of wall. And so I decided to mix it up and I am back to premier riders this time my own file. So I'm unlocking everything on my own file. And yeah, I'm enjoying it with us as Caribbean. Right. Well, what's up with you?

34
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:57.860
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Fair enough. What about me? I have been playing more Pokémon ZA. I am convinced. I'm determined,

35
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.459
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: that's the word not convinced. I'm determined to finish up those legendaries and I did that today.

36
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Are you ready to finish it?

37
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.860
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I got the final one today. Goodness me. It is possibly the most frustrating

38
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, free.

39
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Free out last.

40
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.939
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: like Endgame to a Pokémon game because it's just like constant. I got really good at getting

41
00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:34.100
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: so in the DLC they've got their equivalent to the, like so you know how in the night when you're

42
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.060
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: battling you get the points and then you have used the points to go up the ladder or when you

43
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah

44
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.459
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: finish the ladder you use it to just do you get items from the battles instead. They have an

45
00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.439
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah

46
00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:48.459
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: equivalent, which is where

47
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:56.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: the DLC areas, you get points and then after a while you get the special scans that are you to find special areas.

48
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:05.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And so I was maybe getting one of the legendaries every like five to eight special scans.

49
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So like it was a long slog because there's like what 12 legendaries or something like that that you have to get through that.

50
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: that. So it was like, I done everything else and I am just grinding.

51
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:30.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Getting out these points, doing as many of the things as I can to then do a special scan and then the special scan is not a legendary. It's something I've already done and then you keep going and it's just a bit exhausting, but I got there in the end.

52
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:37.980
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh okay, yeah, so it's that loop sounds like a good idea, but just the random element like you just that sort of

53
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.759
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's too, it's too random. This is the thing. Like the game knows that those are the only things you've not done, right?

54
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.180
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah

55
00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:48.920
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like why does it not push you towards the ones that that you've not done yet?

56
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.180
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah

57
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.879
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It just at some point you're like, oh, these are the only Pokemon you don't have in your decks.

58
00:06:53.879 --> 00:07:04.480
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Maybe let's give you them as the next five specials cans, you know, like it just it's such a weird a weird annoyance, but I got there. I'm done.

59
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I'm done, so...

60
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughs]

61
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So I picked up Shield today, Pokemon Shield, to finish up that decks and get that into home.

62
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Ooh!

63
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah.

64
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:24.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I'm determined to get that done before Pokemon Day, and then I'll have all of the games, decks, and homes and all of that stuff, so...

65
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.300
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Welcome on day.

66
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.300
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Uh, yeah.

67
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:32.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Ready to not play Pokemon for six months until the new game comes out, or like, end months, probably.

68
00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.199
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Done and done.

69
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.519
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Unless they have black white gray releasing it

70
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:50.980
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: You don't know you don't know that you don't know it's the Elka version though it's the elka really

71
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I mean, no.

72
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Even if that comes out this year, it won't come out until October. Like, come on, let's not, let's be real here.

73
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But don't I, don't I, though?

74
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:57.980
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I'm pretty sure they're shooting into our greenhouse episode.

75
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:04.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I also picked up the Starsand Island demo, so this is the game that comes out this week.

76
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: comes out of the day this episode comes

77
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:14.100
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: out I think 11th yeah and they've actually taken the demo down off steam after I downloaded

78
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.420
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: it because they don't they say because the aliases coming out I'm like I don't demos have

79
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.100
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: What?

80
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:27.300
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: their use even when games have released like I don't understand why no I don't either and I think

81
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:22.379
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: What?

82
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.579
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I don't like that.

83
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:35.919
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: it's purely because they they don't want to keep up to date so the demo save file doesn't

84
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [Laughter]

85
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.139
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: go to the actual game and I think it's an old build like based on what they've said

86
00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:46.019
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: the demo has less in it than the actual game which obviously makes sense but like it's

87
00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:51.360
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: an old old version of things and I think they just didn't want to keep the save compatibility

88
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:59.139
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: going and probably thought that if they want I guess this is the problem with early access

89
00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:04.740
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: right is that if you do have a demo then the demo does become quite out of date quite

90
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: quickly, right? Because there's a lot of like...

91
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:21.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: quality of life improvements that come in early access, especially quite early on, right? Because that's your first like proper feedback that you get, and then you're like, okay, we'll do a quick quality of life update to start with with all these things that people complained about.

92
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:31.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Great, fine. But that means your demo then doesn't have all that unless you update it, which I would argue is what you should do. But I guess they probably just don't want to put in the effort of that.

93
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.519
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And I guess if you have an out of date demo, then the argument is better.

94
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:50.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: To have no demo than an out of date demo, I guess, you know, is, you know, is, but anyway, so I managed to get it before the ticket down. So I've got it.

95
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:58.240
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Well, look at now, you can sell your PC for like $500 with the install and then you get that PT money.

96
00:09:50.500 --> 00:10:04.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I don't think anybody cares about the stars on day one demo, but I think I am definitely enjoying this game.

97
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay, ooh, that's good.

98
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's... It's...

99
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:14.740
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So when I... when we looked at it before, we were a bit unsure on how it looks, right? Like, "Ooh, it looks like it might be okay. It might be bad."

100
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.659
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like, maybe it's another one of those, you know, heartopia type things where it just ends up being pretty lackluster.

101
00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:27.220
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But I got hooked into the colute pretty quickly. I like a lot of...

102
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.659
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I like a lot of how it works. I like the quest system and I like...

103
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.419
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Okay, one interesting thing about it is the

104
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:48.639
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: crops take in-game hours to grow rather than in-game days. So, the first, yeah, yeah, so the first day you have like a bunch of

105
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.759
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Well, that's, that's weird, but okay.

106
00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:56.340
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: wheat to grow and if you choose that path, that's the other thing is it does the the oh you can have

107
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.919
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: different ways of playing the game. Do you want to be a farmer? Do you want to be a rancher? Do you want to be a

108
00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:05.919
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: crafter, etcetera, etcetera. The way that Luma Island does it as well.

109
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:14.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But yeah, so if you choose farming, you can choose any of them or all of them as well. Like you can overload yourself with too many quests if you want.

110
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah

111
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:30.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But which of course is what I did. But if you get the wheat and you grow it, you'll have it before you go to bed, which is very interesting.

112
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.279
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, that is that's the way you do it

113
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I think it creates a very quick positive feedback loop. I think.

114
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.120
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Not saying that the way other games do it is bad, but having to wait multiple days before

115
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.740
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: you have a crop and then you can say, I'm not saying that as bad, but I do like what

116
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:51.700
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: this is doing in so much as I didn't do the thing that I do in most farming games, which

117
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.940
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: is where I speedrun the start of the game because there's nothing to do because there was

118
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.820
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: everything to do still, right?

119
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.019
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Because once the point I'm going to sleep with my crops, I'm going to be ready and two

120
00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:03.019
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: more in game errors, right?

121
00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:06.299
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I mean, as well, wait for them and farm them and they go sell them.

122
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:16.019
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So crops seem to be open 24/7 as well, which is interesting.

123
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.820
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh, that's okay. That's really interesting. Just like the eternal farming game. That's weird.

124
00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:22.340
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And the, well, you do still have to sleep and if you don't go to bed before 2 a.m., then

125
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.899
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: you do the standard collapsing thing.

126
00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:28.899
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But yeah, it's like if you're awake, you can go to the shop.

127
00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:33.980
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like I went to a shop at midnight and it was still open, so that was interesting.

128
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: The other thing is, farming takes back.

129
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:46.299
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It takes stamina, it takes stamina to fill your water in cans, specifically.

130
00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:54.700
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It does not take stamina to plant seeds to water the seeds to harvest the seeds.

131
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.539
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay, that's cool.

132
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.899
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So these are just some things that I quite like about it, and I think it's very...

133
00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:06.379
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I'm going to need more time with the game, which I can't get right now, because I've run out of time in the demo.

134
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah, I could probably starve and you save.

135
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.960
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: ha ha ha ha ha yeah no you know that's a good problem right like it's left you

136
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't want to do that.

137
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, exactly.

138
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:25.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So I need more time before I decide exactly how I feel about the game, but I'm definitely interested to play more.

139
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.519
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: wanting more

140
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's not one of those ones when I pick up and it takes me forever to get into it.

141
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I was hooked pretty quick, which is hard for me to get hooked into a 3D farming game as well.

142
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I don't like how those work, but this has been quite...

143
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:48.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Here's another... one of the things that really annoys me about 3D farming games is trying to figure out the grid system, right?

144
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Because you're not looking, you know, top down, it's much harder to see where squares are and stuff like that.

145
00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So when you have a tool, it's very good at showing you the square that you're looking at, which is obviously an important thing.

146
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.480
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But also the watering, you can just hold the box.

147
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:32.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It looks like you are, but it doesn't just, it just doesn't use up your thing, so, you know.

148
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, oh

149
00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:16.799
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's great. That's a good one

150
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.379
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So, you know, that's a quality of life.

151
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:56.820
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You'll see the plot of land. It doesn't just have like the two states of water done unwatered.

152
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:02.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You will see it slowly go unwatered if you're watching it and it'll go from like a you know how they

153
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: they always have like their kind of gray colored

154
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:21.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: in their knot and then there are darker color when they're watered. It will transition slowly from one to the other, but not in a gradient, it's like the amount of ground that is watered, that is the watered color gets smaller.

155
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.340
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah.

156
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:35.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So you'll see this like circle of watered stuff in the middle, that's getting smaller and smaller and it will continue to be watered and be growing until it runs out of water completely and then it's completely dry again.

157
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:45.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Then you can water at any point and refill it and it's just it's growing for however long it has water or until it's fully grown.

158
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:54.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So it's just I don't know if I explained that one well or not, but it's like visually really, visually really easy to see how much water is left.

159
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.639
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I think I get it, but

160
00:15:55.159 --> 00:16:00.080
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's the key thing like take away like you can tell just by looking where you're at

161
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.940
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's instead of waiting for a random time or what feels like a random time because you're not thinking about it. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool

162
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.799
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And it does the nice, it does the nice, like you see sparkles on the

163
00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:16.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: plant when it is fully grown. So it has some, it has night. Well, so it gets better, it gets better

164
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.259
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, oh, that's okay. That's such a good one. Oh

165
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.399
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Kevin. So those two things are really nice for like, Oh, just like looking over at your crops and going

166
00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:26.519
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: like, Oh, nothing's fully grown yet. And everything still has water. Great. That's fine. But if you

167
00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:30.840
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You want more details if you go up and you put your focus on one of the...

168
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: plants, it will tell you exactly how much water it's got left and exactly how long it's got left to grow.

169
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.320
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's wild. That's that's wild, but like good wild. Oh man. Look at these innovations coming in

170
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.399
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You know, right? Like, this is the thing they're actually doing some interesting things that I've not seen in other games.

171
00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:57.720
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And lots of them are just really nice quality of life things rather than like, Oh, this time, everyone's blue.

172
00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:02.720
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You know, or something like that, right? Like it's, it's, it's actually just trying.

173
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.759
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughing]

174
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:09.279
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's kind of like what Starjoo did, right? Starjoo did. Here's what farming games are and here's how I want to make it better in a bunch of ways.

175
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Um, it's the same sort of thing. Like what would I do if I was building Harvard?

176
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:26.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: this moon now it kind of feels like that. Um, also, you can write a skateboard. And you can even jump

177
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.140
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's, uh, that's cool.

178
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.480
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Why are you saving the best for the last?

179
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.440
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh, is it?

180
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:36.079
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: while on the skateboard. You can jump over fences on the skateboard. They're oh, while Kevin, there are also

181
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.779
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay. Is it?

182
00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:34.619
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay. To a roller skates in X, Y.

183
00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:42.799
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: roller skates. I haven't unlocked them, but I have seen someone mention that there is a roller skates blue

184
00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:40.819
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Ah. Oh. Okay.

185
00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:46.859
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay. So, my point being was like,

186
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.339
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: in X, Y, while I think we're cool and overall I'm glad they're in there.

187
00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:54.660
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: A lot of times we're fairly ineffective, um,

188
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.259
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: aside from certain niche, like tracks or spots or whatever.

189
00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:00.259
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: How does it feel here?

190
00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:02.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Does the skateboard feel worth it?

191
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:13.779
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: it does. I do have a couple of issues. So one, I think this is just me getting used to it

192
00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:18.339
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: thing. There's been a couple of times where I've misjudged how far it takes to jump something,

193
00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:26.339
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: and I think that that will just come in time, but you know, we'll see. But you do, it does work

194
00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.940
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: how you would expect a skateboard to work if you're coming up to something and you press the

195
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.480
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: jump up in the right hand, you will jump over the thing and continue.

196
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:44.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Keep going with your your your your speed which is very nice for traveling around the map like I basically once I got the skateboard. I stopped walking around the map. I was using this keyboard the entire time because of you.

197
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's what I want to hear. That's good.

198
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:56.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But this is not a problem with the skateboard so it has a tool wheel for selecting your tools to complain about this one your items still have to use up space in your bag.

199
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:03.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I hate that. Give me a tool wheel which is a separate like tool bag.

200
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:14.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So I don't have to have my bag space wasted with my tools when I have a tool wheel. Second, the tool wheel.

201
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh.

202
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: But where are you storing them out? Doesn't make any sense out.

203
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:26.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: The tool wheel is not big enough. So let me just let me just double check what the current set. Let me build the game and double check exactly how many it was but.

204
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh, that's an actual problem.

205
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:32.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Oh no, I can't launch the demo anymore. They've revoked the licenses for the demo disaster.

206
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.200
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO B Oh!

207
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Oh goodness me.

208
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:50.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So I think it was eight slots on the tool wheel and considering we had axe pickaxe hole, watering can.

209
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I mean, if skateboard can go on there, that alone.

210
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:58.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Well yeah, but let me let me finish a watering can. What else was their fishing rod bug net.

211
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.420
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And there was at least one more tool, but I can't remember what it was and then

212
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.539
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I was left with one slot, which you're like, oh, that's fine. The skateboard goes in that slot.

213
00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:13.940
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Here's the problem. Your seeds have to go in the slot to in a slot to farm.

214
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:21.460
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You have to select seeds from the tool wheel, and I think this is the big problem with it,

215
00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:27.140
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: because my tools, including my skateboard, filled up my entire tool wheel.

216
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.339
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So I had to take one of the tools out to then add seeds into my

217
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh no.

218
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:50.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: tool wheel. So I think they need to do something there because I think it's it's the exact right number of slots if you solve that seed problem and you either give a different way to deal with seed somehow or you just do a different way of selecting it.

219
00:20:50.500 --> 00:21:02.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It does feel weird that seeds are too in the tool wheel right like I get I think I get what they're doing it just it feels like they made that decision from a technical implementation.

220
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:27.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But so you do end up fiddling around a little bit right where like okay it's time to put a new bunch of places out to far.

221
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.460
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: to put a new bunch of places out to see it far.

222
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:39.099
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I will need to put the whole into my toolbar bar and then I'll need to move it out and put the seeds in it's not the end of the world

223
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:41.099
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But it's fiddly, you know

224
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.920
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah, I get that.

225
00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:47.700
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Especially if you have multiple multiple seeds you're putting down right like there was one time I had three sets of seeds

226
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.380
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I wanted to buy and use all at the same time and that took a lot of fiddling around to actually get it to work

227
00:21:54.019 --> 00:22:00.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But yeah, it is what it is. I think they need to solve that the seed problem, but other than that pretty good

228
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And yeah, this keyboard is good, and

229
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:10.200
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I didn't get to try any of the other vehicles, but there are other things. Like I saw for example, there's a more page you can rent.

230
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.680
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, that would be my guess right like you have skateboard

231
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.640
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Roller skates smoke bed feels like the next one

232
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.519
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: No, but you can rent the mopad before you own one.

233
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.460
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, okay

234
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.240
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like, first day, you can go and rent the mopad if you want, which is really interesting.

235
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.619
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Ooh, first day ooh, that's nice

236
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.480
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, yeah. It's just there. It's just sitting there. You can just pay and rent it on its

237
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.640
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: pair in game minute that you pay for.

238
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.740
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh

239
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.700
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's that's innovative and what I don't know if I like that, but it is kind of cool

240
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.720
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I think I think I do like it because it gives you options early game like nobody's making you use it

241
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:49.079
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: but it's that or it's that or you have to wait and if you want to waste your money on

242
00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:56.359
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: on the moped you can do that right like why should we stop you doing that like I think it's a great I think

243
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.299
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, well, yeah, being open for the start, that is a fantastic idea, 100%.

244
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:08.900
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So, um, there's probably a lot more I could talk about this game, but I probably shouldn't because we're 25 minutes into the end.

245
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.200
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I feel like you should on a certain place at a certain time. Maybe not here right now, but

246
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:21.460
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, I need any more time, but I am enjoying this game so far. And, uh, yes, I will be buying it on release date. Let's put it that way.

247
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: And you can keep it that time!

248
00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:27.059
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah. Theoretically.

249
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.700
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: They're at it.

250
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.460
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Christopher Nolan was wrong. They are breaking into your house. Let's deal it.

251
00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:31.660
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: - All right.

252
00:23:33.339 --> 00:23:36.380
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: [laughing]

438
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:43.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Tama Da Chi, Tama Da Chi, Tama Da Chi, I've got weird sims.

439
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:50.140
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: No, yeah, which, or what's, what's the, who's the batch for it?

440
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's too much happening.

441
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:51.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Make this near the end of the year, please.

442
00:33:51.500 --> 00:34:01.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You'll find out, I believe this is the last update before the 1.0 update, so we'll see you later.

443
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:02.640
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: No, I don't yeah, we're exactly we'll see you. Oh, let's always my attitude

444
00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:06.039
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: 1.0

445
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:21.300
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Alright, finally, we're not finally finally. Finally, before the new games, we have an interview that IGN did with ConcernD, about 10th anniversary of Stardew Valley.

446
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:29.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay, first of all, I mean, did you start aging instantly? Did you like feel the grip if you're sprouting when you heard that?

447
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.480
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: oh yeah don't even yeah it's all right only one year and then the switch will be

448
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:37.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I didn't realize it's nook up on me. And yeah.

449
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:41.719
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: 10 years old so you know just gonna keep keep coming and keep happening and you

450
00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:49.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: know the um the Wii is 20 years old this year as well

451
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: So now the concern dates ancient.

452
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.880
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh my goodness. No, that one I can live with. That one is all that's fine.

453
00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:56.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: anyway there were a couple of things I found interesting from this interview

454
00:34:57.159 --> 00:35:01.079
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: so he does talk a bit about concern not pretending

455
00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:06.280
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: haunted juggle tier but that's all we covered that in his blub but like this

456
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: feels like the blog post was in reaction to these questions

457
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Leave him.

458
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah.

459
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughter]

460
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.719
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: but interestingly so he said that he would consider doing a starchy valley at some point

461
00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:22.599
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I've starchy valley too at some point and even started working on one but I ended up

462
00:35:23.719 --> 00:35:25.599
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: doing Hunter Chocolatier instead.

463
00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:26.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: - Yeah.

464
00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:30.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: He says that he would find it interesting,

465
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.760
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: but he'd need to decide whether it was like different characters and a different area,

466
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:43.239
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: or whether it's the same characters, but then you have to decide on which story lines progress and

467
00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:48.199
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: stuff like that. So I don't think we'll ever get that, but I thought it was an interesting thing

468
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.960
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, it is an interesting thought. I don't think you should do it because you have for those

469
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:59.360
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: exact reasons. It's a it's a pickle to think and no one's someone's gonna be upset by it no

470
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.840
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: matter what it what you pick so there's no no winning

471
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.679
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But you probably shouldn't, you should probably shouldn't decide to use that as the reason

472
00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:08.960
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: not to do something, right?

473
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.599
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: - Well, I guess, yeah.

474
00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:12.400
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: - Yeah, I mean, look at us.

475
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.599
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughs]

476
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.880
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: - Uh, yeah, the real secret.

477
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.280
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Start new two, and possibly one could argue,

478
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.679
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: start a three-party release.

479
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.079
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: They're just hitting the updates.

480
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.360
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughs]

481
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah

482
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.760
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Basically.

483
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughs]

484
00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.880
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: What the other thing I found interesting now

485
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.719
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I don't know whether he's saying that this is not happening or is happening or might be happening

486
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.559
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But let me just quote this for you one idea that we were toying with for 1.7

487
00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:40.960
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I don't know if this will happen or not was adding a farm map editor for the public

488
00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:44.320
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So you could basically make your own because with every update

489
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.320
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's traditional to add a new farm type when they came first came out

490
00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.800
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: There was just standard farm and that was it and then 1.0 added four different farms and then with every update

491
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:01.760
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: What if we opened up this up to the community and it was like now you could press an extra button go into a browser and look at everyone's farm creation

492
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.519
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: That now adds almost infinite replayability to Stardew Valley. I think this would be great

493
00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:13.719
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like being able to go like oh, here's a starter farm. I've made this swamp or

494
00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:19.119
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: like here's our second beach farm or something like I love the idea of being able to go

495
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: you know, oh, another cell, let me see what other random

496
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.300
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: farm layouts people have done like another kind of for like because this allows you because obviously you can do this with mods

497
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: but not everybody has mods and being able to have this would be I think fantastic

498
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.579
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, I think so too, and you know what I think it should be a separate part

499
00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:40.559
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Like I don't know I think the

500
00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:46.039
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Making it like these the starter farm sounds like a lot because like

501
00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:53.280
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: That's a lot to do before you start the game, you know, but anyways, but generally speaking the idea of a bar map editor

502
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.219
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Well, I think I think the idea would not necessarily

503
00:37:57.219 --> 00:37:59.900
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: be the someone who's first playing Stardew Valley

504
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.579
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: goes, oh, I'm going to create my own custom map.

505
00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.980
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's another option, right?

506
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.659
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like you can go in and either you can select one of the eight

507
00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:14.179
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: that you currently has or you can scan a QR code

508
00:38:14.179 --> 00:38:17.860
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: and get someone set up, or if you really want,

509
00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.699
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: you can then do a custom one yourself.

510
00:38:19.699 --> 00:38:23.139
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like I don't think the idea is that you'll open up.

511
00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:25.139
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And it'll be like, "Oh, what's your name?"

512
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I know we're like, "Okay, now design a farm."

513
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I don't think that's what it will be.

514
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.239
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: [laughs]

515
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like, if there is a farm designer, I think it will be, yeah.

516
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I think you're right, it will be like accessible within the game,

517
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: but not like you have to design it before you start the game.

518
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, that would feel a lot.

519
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.599
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah, you get my point. Okay. Well, yeah, no

520
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I think I get your point. I think I get your point.

521
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But I just love the idea of going like, "I'm going to do a new save."

522
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: You know, someone's created this really weird thing that makes it really hard

523
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: to give you a bunch more options.

524
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Like, I really like the one that has a little bit of, you know, stone area.

525
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Maybe I want one that has more of that, you know, stuff like that.

526
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I really like that.

527
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.320
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, okay, sure. Yeah, I'm I'm just I guess not think about a little further how

528
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.960
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Or wonder how much you can actually do with it because I don't know

529
00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:18.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Because on the just break it open to

530
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.119
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's definitely more about layout rather than anything else, right? Like it's not like you're

531
00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:26.159
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: going to be able to do big, complicated things, right? You'll be able to say this area is beach,

532
00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:32.239
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: this area is, you know, normal farmland, this is a cave. You could, you could have, and you can

533
00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:38.960
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: have different levels on there, right? Like we've seen that on the, it's not the four levels,

534
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.760
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: the four corners farm. It's the other one that's like the different areas. It has an area that's

535
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: for rocks in an area that's watery and in

536
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah

537
00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:53.360
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: That has one where you go up, a bit and like the rock bit is up high, isn't it? So you could do multiple

538
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.599
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: levels, for example.

539
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:03.320
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, sure. Yeah, all right, can't make the Jojo Mark farm or your entire plots of Jojo Mark

540
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:15.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, I don't think it'll be. I mean, maybe he'll add like one other idea of something that could be added in, but I don't think it's suddenly going to be like, you could build the entire village in your farm or anything.

541
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: heh heh heh heh heh.

542
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Alright sure. Yeah either way, it's probably a fun idea.

543
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:28.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Do it. I did rea- before this interview, I didn't realize we're getting more, um, you know, marriage candidates or whatever.

544
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.340
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yes. Yeah, that was the other thing is is he said that there's gonna be more of that, but we don't know

545
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.639
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: and mmm there's a lot obviously we have a lot of fee I have a lot of feelings on that but I'll just wait to see who it is

546
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Do you? Yes.

547
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.960
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: yeah

548
00:40:51.519 --> 00:41:00.880
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: oh we we can't I can't I can't bring myself to dare to hope that you'll be right now that we can do divorce simulator

549
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I don't think we will, I don't think you'll do that.

550
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:09.840
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I don't think so either but it's so tempting to hope

551
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: I just, I think it would be hilarious if he just added Clint and no one else.

552
00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:08.960
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: we can

553
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: It's like, here's your new, your new romance of all is, it's just the ultimate troll update, right?

554
00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:15.440
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: that would be pretty good

555
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:23.679
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: that'd be good I'm down for that yeah absolutely

556
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:31.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: All right, next we have two new games announced. First up, we have Emberville, awakened with no one else.

557
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:52.500
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And no memories inside, here we go, the Vitromotus, a vast underground world created as a magical dungeon where death no longer lasts, explore its depth, battle dangerous creatures, rescue survivors and rebuild the ruined town of Emberville while uncovering the truth behind this prison.

558
00:41:52.500 --> 00:42:09.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Uh, that's, that's a lot of okay. Yeah, that that's a lot to take in. I'm, I'm down for these. I think just get you know, I won't lie. They, they caught me off guard. I didn't expect that the final word of that to be prison.

559
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:16.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Okay. Okay. And no one stopped it. Okay. Wait. Does that count for the crops too?

560
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I don't know.

561
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.360
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Ooh, good question. Yeah, does death exist for crops?

562
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:29.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: And how does the combat work if you can't, or I guess I'm just getting off.

563
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:31.760
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, I'm presuming it's if I think I'm presuming it just means roguelike

564
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Right like you can't die, but you can you know respawn

565
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:44.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh, it's Hades, it's just Hades.

566
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.400
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Farming hit wait. There's farming in Hades too, isn't there?

567
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:50.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: A little bit, I think, at least in Hades too, yeah, yeah.

568
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.840
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So yeah, it's just

569
00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:00.039
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: just, yeah, I don't know. It's interesting. I wonder whether the mystery will actually

570
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:56.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: They reinvented Hades, they got me, they got me figured out.

571
00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:08.039
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: be interesting or not. I'm not super interested in the farming part of this. It just looks pretty

572
00:43:08.039 --> 00:43:14.199
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: basic, but that doesn't feel like it's the main part of it. That's just a thing that they've

573
00:43:14.199 --> 00:43:20.599
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: slotted into the game as part of you know it looks like you are

574
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:35.360
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: rebuilding a town right so it is a life simulator is a you know town builder but it very much looks like the point is the exploring and the finding out the mysteries and the combat that's like the main part so yeah.

575
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.179
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I do like the aesthetic. It's a little bit somber, I guess, like, it's very not gray like

576
00:43:42.179 --> 00:43:46.119
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: bad, like just the tones are very cool and a little dark.

577
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.360
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: - Yeah, I also think it's, your farm is a lot brighter.

578
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.599
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: And I wonder if that's deliberate

579
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:57.960
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: in that it's meant to be like this is the cam happy area.

580
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.400
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I guess so. Yeah, there's like a beach area too. Yeah, there's a few spots.

581
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.400
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, but I think that could be the same,

582
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.639
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: like maybe there's a part of it that's cam

583
00:44:07.639 --> 00:44:11.039
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: and part of it is, oh, that beach area does not look cam.

584
00:44:11.039 --> 00:44:14.559
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: That looks like a xenomorph from alien

585
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:20.099
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: yep that yeah there is something coming out of the ground there you're right but it is the bright

586
00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:15.940
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: coming out of the sand there.

587
00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:21.079
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: How do you make sand look not

588
00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:22.440
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: bright? That's the question.

589
00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:33.860
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: yeah I guess um that's a good yeah yeah yeah good point um that it's it has me intrigued

590
00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:25.519
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Then it's just mud if it's not

591
00:44:25.519 --> 00:44:25.960
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: bright.

592
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.079
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Certainly want to keep an eye on I

593
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.900
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: at worst it might be cult of the lambish and that's what that was a good game

594
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.179
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: It's a good game. We'll haven't kicked the game out. I should probably get back to that one day.

595
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.119
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yeah, you do you do seem to be rebuilding the town and there just seem to be at least some sort of movement

596
00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:53.360
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: There might be just be on your farm that you're moving buildings

597
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.800
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: But you definitely see moving buildings and I see in the town. They're definitely like rebuilding buildings

598
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:07.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So it might just be your farm you have control over where everything is and on in the rest of the town. You're just fixing things up

599
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Possibly but there's at least something there who knows how sandboxy it'll be

600
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.500
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, something like that.

601
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.039
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: as we can. This change.

602
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:41.000
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: No, no, no, no, no. The cover art doesn't have the jewel chained. It just has the jewel, but on the video it's chained up at the end. So I think that the idea is to unchain it.

603
00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.820
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, that looks important.

604
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.340
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Sondyl, Blake Logo, who knows.

605
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.340
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: The mystery solved the mystery.

606
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.539
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Why is that jewel changed?

607
00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:28.019
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: I don't know.

608
00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:31.420
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Oh, just the jewel itself, yeah, okay.

609
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.300
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Wait, what?

610
00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.340
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.440
<v F76CEB25-5405-425E-9BAD-13FD41F3687D>Kev: Yeah, it's though you beat the game and other chains off

612
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.239
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: Yes, maybe, maybe we'll see.

613
00:45:52.239 --> 00:45:54.639
<v 1C19D2D3-4147-44F5-864B-CD55F064DD75>Al: So yeah, lots to keep an eye on.
