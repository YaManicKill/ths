00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.500

42
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.959
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: sure. I mean, you could have, I'm not going to lie. You could have done that before. Like just as a quote

43
00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:01.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, but now they'll say doctors of people know. Yeah. Yeah, well, people say doctors, so that means things are not in America, but it means things to other sensible people.

44
00:01:49.959 --> 00:02:04.439
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: that I said, yeah. It's true. I get to do the fun thing now where people say on the airplane,

45
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.239
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: [groans]

46

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: "Is there a doctor here?" And I'll stand up and say, "I'm an entomologist." And people can say, "He's dying,"

47
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: [laughs]

48
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.240

49
00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.719
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: and I'll say I'll get the pinning supplies.

50
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughs]

51
00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.360
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: All right, Cody and Kev are both here

52
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.719
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: because we're gonna do a new thing.

53
00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.879
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: We're gonna try a cottagecore of fantasy draft.

54
00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.039
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I will explain fully how this works

55
00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.439
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: when we get to them after the news,

56
00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: but essentially we are going to choose games

57
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.079
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: that we hope will come out this year.

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.360
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And we will score it at the end of the year or beginning of next year, I guess.

59
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'll we'll decide at some point when I don't know, will the score based on Metacritic scores?

60
00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:55.520
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So the winner will be the one who has the highest total Metacritic score.

61
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.879
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I will explain all the details of that later on, but that is the general idea.

62
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.079
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: We'll see how well it works.

63
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughs]

64
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.400

<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Kevin's sounding like he has no idea what's happening, and this is brand new to him.

66
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.759
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: We've been talking about this for about a month and a half, I think.

67
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.319
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, I know I know I'm just like here in the long term play and this figuring out I like it. This is good.

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: here and i'm like right so i'll add some decorations I don't design anything so uh yeah kevin what have you been up to?

89
00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.279
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: door sure

90
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ah, that's good. What have I been up to so a Kirby?

91
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.800
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Airriders? My own file. I played the single player mode for the first time.

92
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:30.680
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Let's call it a road trip mode. It's basically doing lots of mini events and races

93
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.879
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: just in succession, because that's the game. But some of them get really hard.

94
00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:42.839
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So if you increase the difficulty, it'll retry a few of them. And it's also...

95
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.399
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So you're driving along the road and there's basically three options. They'll give you

96
00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:53.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: my left, right, middle. And the reward changes. You get different boosts and modifiers for your

97
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.519
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: vehicles and your overall character stats and so on. But each option is a different event.

98
00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:05.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So you have to balance, "Well, am I going to be good at this event? Or do I really want this

99
00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:11.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: reward?" etc, etc. And so you just keep doing that a handful of times. There's branching paths.

100
00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:13.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So it was cute. It was fun.

101
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:34.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: The story is kind of existentially horrifying when you think about it too much, because, yeah, it's interesting because curvy stories are no stranger to cosmic eldritch horrors and whatnot, but this one was a smaller scale story and I guess because it was a little more personal.

102
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I ha- I ha- I ha- I haired about that.

103
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: And I didn't feel comfortable with that, that living robot being torn to pieces like as it's still conscious. That wasn't fun.

104
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:56.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But, but yeah, no, good stuff. I like the curb air ride. When else have I been up to? That's probably really all I've been very busy with work on tired people.

105
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's all I can think of really. What about you, Alex, been going on?

106
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So I've been continuing trying to get my Pokemon Sword and Shield decks done in Pokemon home.

107
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.019
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: My plan is to get that done.

108
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:37.059
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think I have 400 left, but it's actually probably less than that because the the the app I'm using has the DLCs in there, the DLC decks in there as well because obviously you have to get that for the Pokemon home thing, but there's duplicate Pokemon so I haven't gone through and like checked off the ones that are duplicate that I haven't caught yet, right.

109
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:46.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: But like for, you know, for example, like I call what was it? I can't remember. Let's say it was a power to it. I don't think it was. I think power to it was only in one

110
00:08:46.500 --> 00:09:04.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: deck, but I caught a palpitode and it was in two of the decks. So that's actually two, not just one. So yeah, there's quite a few still to catch, but at most 400 probably like 300, but I've got two weeks left to get it done. Let's see if I do it.

111
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.179
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I'm sure you will, you got this.

112
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:16.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'm not sure I will because the other thing I'm playing and, you know, that can suck up a lot of time is I've bought the full version of star set.

113
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:24.740
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Island after it came out, which here. Oh, yes. So there's a fun story that the slack people already know,

114
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: but I've got to got to talk about it here as well. So loaded up the game on my steam deck,

115
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I was about to bring that up

116
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:37.299
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: bit up and horrifying flashing. I don't even know how to describe it. It was like the resolution

117
00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:44.820
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: was changing for part of the screen a couple of times a second. And so on the the loading screen,

118
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Oh, that's it.

119
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: The start-up screen, that just meant like the image was like horrifying and like flash, flash, flash.

120
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: We'd definitely give you an epileptic fit if you had that.

121
00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:07.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And then you go through to the game, and it's like UI elements are bouncing around the screen, like moving a centimeter multiple times a second, basically making it unplayable.

122
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.200
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: [laughs]

123
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughs]

124
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:14.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So that was fun, but I did figure out that if you boot up the game in a lower resolution, then it works.

125
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Works. Great. So I was

126
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughs]

127
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:28.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: playing in what was 800 by 600, I think, on my steam deck. Very low resolution. But the good news is this morning they released an update that fixes the issue. So I'm back to full resolution.

128
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.879
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah. Oh.

129
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.480
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: with oooh oooh oooh is it yeah

130
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah

131
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:40.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Anyway, it's very interesting because there's a bunch of stuff that I talked about in the last episode about how this game works. It is no longer the case.

132
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.419
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: What? What's that for me?

133
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So like for example, I talked about

134
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: the tool wheel, right? Which I thought was good but needed more entries.

135
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: They didn't do that. They just changed to how stargy does tools instead.

136
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:04.919
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay, yeah, it just you it only needed one more entry right for the for the skateboard

137
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:08.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'm like, okay, interesting. It's such a bizarre way of doing things, but whatever.

138
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I do think there is an advantage of this. So it's not quite how stargy does it.

139
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: it's slightly different in the, in your bag, you have your bag slots and

140
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:27.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: you have your toolbar slots. And so if you put your tools in the toolbar slot, they're not taking up space in your normal bag. I mean, that's just a technicality, right? Because the bag can still be the same size, but whatever.

141
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:41.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: But when you're like, you, you can have their two toolbar lines so you can scroll between them. And so it means that you're, it's quite easy to make sure that you're not filling up your toolbar with things like in Stardew.

142
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: If you just pick something up automatically, it goes into your, you know, your first, your top space.

143
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:57.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Whereas here it will go into your first space in the bag and only goes into the toolbar if you specifically ask it to. Right. So it means you don't like fill up your toolbar with stuff that you're never going to use like that.

144
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:12.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So it's interesting. I liked, I kind of liked the tool ring that they had, but I mean, this is, this is fine. It certainly makes it easier to do the seeds as well, which is good.

145
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: The other big thing that I notice the change is the scale of

146
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:25.600
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: How long crops take? So they are still based in hours, but like they seem to have like doubled how long most of them take

147
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.200
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So some things multiple things now do take multiple days

148
00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:38.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Which is not the end of the world, but I was enjoying being like I'm gonna do three different harvests of wheat in one day

149
00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:43.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So you're still you still get things much faster than in stargy, right?

150
00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:46.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: like, I just put something down and it was, it has three days.

151
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:52.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And that's like one of the more expensive ones, whereas in Stardew, I think turnips take three days.

152
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So, like, it's still much faster, but I quite liked how fast it was.

153
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's interesting. I am, I think I'm generally enjoying it.

154
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I have probably a lot more thoughts that I'll put into a full episode on the topic, but I am enjoying it.

155
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:13.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think it's possibly my, the most enjoyable I've found a 3D farming game.

156
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Which isn't a hot...

157
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.980
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: You heard him game of the year, 2026!

158
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:25.700
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: isn't a high bar, because I've not really enjoyed much 3D farming, but yeah, it'll be interesting to see.

159
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:29.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: what would you consider Coral Island a 3D farming game?

160
00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:35.299
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, no, no, by 3D, I don't mean the graphics. I mean like gameplay wise, right? So

161
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay.

162
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay, got it, got it, yep.

163
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.860
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: and you rotate the camera, right?

164
00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:43.059
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: you're rotating the camera and yeah, and you can like, you know, you're visibly going up hills

165
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.139
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Like that's the question.

166
00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:48.419
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: rather than like oh it's just you move left and that it takes you up.

167
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:58.740
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I have a hill sort of thing. Kevin, I have unlocked the roller skates. They are very fun. I'm enjoying them.

168
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.399
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, the grid, yeah. Is there a secret gradient?

169
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay got it

170
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.600
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ah, how are they?

171
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:07.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: They're much quicker to put on than the skateboard, which is ironic. But I know they're definitely an

172
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.159
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, that's okay.

173
00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:12.600
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's interesting. I don't get it either.

174
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.820
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - How?

175
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.360
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - What did they go faster?

176
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:28.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: they are faster. They're just faster to transition, right? Like if you're walking around and you want to jump on your skateboard, you press it and it takes like like the transition is slower and you're speeding up a slower.

177
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Whereas if you're if you've got the skateboard, you just press the button and you're like you transition at the same speed into skating.

178
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So, they're wheelies.

179
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I guess so, but no, I mean visually you have put on roller skates, but they're like a...

180
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.279
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: but they're mechanically, they're wheelies.

181
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: and mechanically they're wheelies. Yeah, I guess I guess they are.

182
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.360
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So it's like the XY ones, basically, that's what it sounds like.

183
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Why not?

184
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, yeah, it's fun. And you can skate into the houses.

185
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.720
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: And you do.

186
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Huh.

187
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.700
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: In houses? Oh my gosh.

188
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh.

189
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:09.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, you can skate into the houses through the door, smash into the house. It's great fun. I'm enjoying it.

190
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:11.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: You get, are there any tricks at all on any of these options?

191
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.799
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: You can jump, but it's not like it's not like, you know.

192
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.679
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: All right.

193
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:27.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Tony Hawk, you're going to grind and stuff like that, but you can jump, which yeah, it's very much movement based rather than like, you know, mechanics based and and it does the jumping is is good.

194
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.120
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm not doing sick kick flips off the rails.

195
00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:25.399
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, I get it.

196
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:42.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I would feel much worse if you didn't have the jumping because you can jump over obstacles and keep your speed up and stuff like that and you know, like I've come down a come down a mountain and jumped over a fence into someone's garden and then jumped over the other side of the fence, don't further down the hill.

197
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.759
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I get just, it makes trans.

198
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.799
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Transporting yourself around the island much quicker.

199
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.179
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Mm-hmm important clarifying question. Do you wear a helmet?

200
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.399
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I have not paid attention. I don't think so.

201
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.580
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh lame boo

202
00:15:54.399 --> 00:16:03.360
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And I think that it, well, so I mean, there is much customization, so you can wear a helmet,

203
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.539
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: What kind of message are we delivering to the

204
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.740
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: What are we saying?

205
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.759
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: if you want, but you're wearing the helmet all the time or you're never wearing.

206
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.980
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: No, you should always have to wear a helmet when you're on wheels.

207
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.399
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, I mean, also wheat doesn't grow in three hours, so

208
00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:18.740
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: See, but that, but the, the helmet though, that's so.

209
00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:21.759
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: can't fall over, Cody.

210
00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:24.580
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Kids aren't going to be going out in forest and wheat, but they will skateboard.

211
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.460
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: If we need to model good skateboard behavior.

212
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:37.240
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: How long, how long is it until we get Tony Hawk cross cottage core it feels like one day we'll get here?

213
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.720
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't know what to tell you.

214
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Like official Tony Hark or just generic skateboarding?

215
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.720
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: No, no, not official like skateboarding is half the mechanics

216
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Twenty twenty eight.

217
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.559
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I'm gonna say never, I'm saying never.

218
00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:54.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: How many? Someone will do it. So, um, whoa, let's start

219
00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:50.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, not never. Come on.

220
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:12.359
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: in island and start saying I like may be the impetus. You never know. Um, cool. I'm glad you're enjoying it. Um, I like that, I like that game looks because I'm a weeb. I know it's nice to know it's good.

221
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:13.140
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, no, it's good. I'm enjoying it. Yeah, if you're being a

222
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.420
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: weeb, there's there's much for you here. Let's put it that way.

223
00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:23.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.220
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: There are there are many knees.

225
00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:28.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Just one thing I noticed is most people's outfits do not go below the knee.

226
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:43.460
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, I thought you went n_i, but no, okay, you're similar to that. Yes, um,

227
00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:33.140
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: There are a few, but not many of them.

228
00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:37.059
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah. I think.

229
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: As in we are the night to see.

230
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't.

231
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't.

232
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:53.440
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: um, reconigone, yeah, yeah, forget it. All right. Oh, good touch.

233
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.160
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: the different type of weeb I'm that I am that kind of weeb

234
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I do.

235
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Well, I mean, if you were expecting a Monty Python reference, there we are.

236
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Moving on.

237
00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:59.200
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: just take a shot

238
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: All right.

239
00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.140
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Actually, wait, can I take the ball back. There's one more thing I, I

240
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:10.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: remember. Um, I don't talk about, um, no, and it's not something I know, although I,

241
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Is it Monty Python?

242
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.619
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I learned about the life of Brian. I didn't actually know what it was, but I

243
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: You didn't know what a long life of Brian was.

244
00:18:13.619 --> 00:18:18.940
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: have to watch it. Anyways, I did it. No, I didn't know what it was. I just, I

245
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's excellent. Do not short. Do not short to your mother.

246
00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:27.140
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: don't know completely once. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, I would go. Yeah, but, uh, yeah,

247
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.259
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: - I have to catch that.

248
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: From what I am aware of you.

249
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah.

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That is, maybe not an airplane movie,

253
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: 'cause I don't think I've seen the airplanes,

254
00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:38.240
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: but I'll find it one day.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.380
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's great. I love it.

256
00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:42.480

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's not something I did, but have you guys been

258
00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:49.359

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: y'all say there's probably a game that might get shadow dropped on Pokemon day. So if that happens,

366
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:42.099
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Probably more I've heard things. I will say this. I believe I may not be right,

367
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.480
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, I mean, we're, we're also talking nonsense. We have no idea what we're talking about.

368
00:23:42.099 --> 00:23:49.619
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: but I do believe something will drop that day. But anyways, but look, going back to Tiny Guard,

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: it's not on the plate. I want to crank this thing for real. That's all that matters.

370
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.779
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: How much would it take for them to invest in a line of toys?

371
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.140
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: It's just to have a little clench up.

372
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.640
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Ah, a lawsuit, probably.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.940
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Are they not affiliated with Tamagatchi or not Tamagatchi? The polypocket?

375
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.140
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ollie pocket?

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh, I didn't know that.

380
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.140
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But, like, how?

381
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.140
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ollie, a legal time.

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: How ironclad is polypocket's patent on the onset of a pocket clamshell toy.

383
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.920
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Not gonna lie it's been so long they might be in the public domain at this point

384
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:28.539
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know.

385
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:37.319
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know, I have to look at a few US patent law fun times because, you know, I'll be

386
00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:39.259
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: right with last a good one.

387
00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:41.259
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'll Mickey just hit public domain.

388
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:48.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I mean, copy, yeah, copyright is like functionally infinite, if something comes out during your lifetime, you, you will not see the end of his copyright.

389
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, 75 years, I believe actually the number Pat and so I don't know the number

390
00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:04.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's, yeah, the, I don't think it's quite as simple as that. It's, it's like, I think it's something like 75 years after their death or 100 years or something weird like that.

391
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I said what I said.

392
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.480
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Let's see U.S. 20 years, apparently. It's the term of Benton in the U.S.

393
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:16.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Hmm, which would, which would make, because it was 1983 was poly pockets were patterned.

394
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.799
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, so there's probably grounds to make it. Come on, Tony Garden Devs. I believe in you make the

395
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:28.859
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah, the freak the game looks pretty cute. I know y'all y'all did it right?

396
00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:32.200
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: physical one. Oh, by one of those, good idea. Yeah. Yeah. I played it. I am played it, but I was on the

397
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.640
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: the episode with him.

398
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's fun. It's fun. It's more like a puzzle type game where you're trying to figure out how to

399
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:44.200
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: get certain things in the effect, plants next to them, and there's different

400
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.359
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: like ground that you need to put in and creating one, putting certain plants in,

401
00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:56.200
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: creates certain ground. It's fun. But it's definitely more puzzle than just like

402
00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:58.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: plant crops, harvest crops.

403
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.460
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, I could give it a Sean switch actually like just looking at the screenshots again

404
00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.680
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I forgot how good it actually looks. I might do it

405
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:14.359
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think it's definitely worth it. I think it's how much is it on this 15. Not bad. Not bad at all.

406
00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:12.480
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: 15 USD, I think they're saying on on switch

407
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, all right. I'm down for that. Yeah, it's not bad good for you, Tanny

408
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Next we have another dude's new dream life value update. They keep coming.

409

411
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:40.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know if I actually see a lady in the chat.

412
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.980
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I love Lady in the Tramp.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: This might be one of my Disney blind spots.

415
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:51.400
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Honestly, the second one's the song from the second one a slap. So 10 out of 10 recommend at least the second one.

416
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.200
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'm sorry the second, there's a second lady in the drum.

417
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.700

424
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:25.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: That's equal and the Lion King sequel are up there for me with matching or better than the predecessor.

425
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:28.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: yeah no there are many good business sequels okay that that flanking is really high but

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: anyways uh let's see what else the Aladdin sequels are pretty good uh

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh, you're right. You're right. I did watch a Prince of Thieves recently.

428
00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:47.440
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Cinderella had its big sequel somehow actually note oh I want this okay

429
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.720
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: No, I'm not, I, I'm not up now. I disagree.

430
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:59.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: But yeah, this, so this is doing to be my valley free update. The puppy love update, uh, include ads, lady and tramp and it adds like the kind of like late 1800s, like fashion.

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So like parasols and somewhat poopy dresses and dapper-ness. So that's real cute.

432
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.160
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: somewhat poofy. Yeah, that's not really poofy at all. Come on

433
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.900
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Bowder hats, I think that's what they're called.

434
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.559
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: This isn't as quiet. This doesn't have like the butt part of the poopy dresses.

435
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:21.859
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, it looks like 1950s Mary Poppins thinking advanced and style clothing. Yeah, make

436
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:32.640
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: There's also stuff that is inspired by the great mouse detective, so that like adds in a possible thing for that.

437
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.960
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's cool.

438
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:40.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I also love that it adds the group mode so you can move more than one thing at a time because there are sometimes when I just want to like shift everything.

439
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:51.759
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Everything a little bit if I'm like trying to move people's houses and you're right. You're right.

440
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.359
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I know it's super easy to say this sort of thing, but like mad that I took them this long to do that.

441
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.160
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: This is, this is, this is, this is a live service game that has been going for years

<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: and is about designing your perfect town and they didn't allow you to move multiple items at once.

445
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh, yeah!

448
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh, I don't know.

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Probably that that's that's a long time. You're right

450
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: And then they have a St. Patrick's Day episode,

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Wait, are there any Irish Disney puppies or characters?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.519
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I guess, it's a bigger issue.

456
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: at clovers so that you can

00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:15.599
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: All right, uh...

487
00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:27.819
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Huh?

488

<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And this adds in a gene system for your, I think it's for crops. Yes.

490
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: that you know what that's oh actually let me look at what this looks like but I like this

491
00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:01.480
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: on concept like certain jeans

492
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.799
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Look, the more we talk about this game, the more I'm like, "Really?"

493
00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:12.200
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: yeah I feel bad because I forget about this game all I remember is that it sounds like

494
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:19.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: do walk and trick but um uh but uh yeah I look at the game every time I see the game well yeah this

495
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.599
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yep, same.

496
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: This isn't bad actually, that's like that art style, I'm genetic.

497
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I mean, we haven't really seen that, nobody's done that like affecting the genes for certain properties or whatever.

498
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, we've had it, we've had it for animals, but I'm not aware of it happening for crops.

499
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's a cool idea.

500
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: There's been like crossbreeding and stuff, but that's quite limited.

501
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah.

<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: This is like actual gene editing feels much more complicated.

503
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah.

506
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: - And don't, don't lock to, it's a perfect place after us.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: - Yeah, yeah, I'm done.

508
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:02.180
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: that's how you know as well and the final update in our list is little witch in the woods

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's not a great name.

512
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:24.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: the fact that I had to stop halfway through and start again, they've added the records archive

513
00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.339
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: in the village.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.819
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I heard records and I was like, oh.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:19.099
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: person I'm here you're building up like the buildings like they just spring up

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: they're just all kind of bouncing non-stop I know I do like that no that's a good

528
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.779
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: You don't like bouncy cows.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.539
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But I'm just kind of saying things as

530
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.240
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know. I think it's the first person thing that throws me off

531
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:43.099
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But I like the idea and we get over cooked but also farming in there. That's what this should be

532
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:53.579
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh like the same amount of like franticness. Yeah. I don't know if that's what they're going for.

533
00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:50.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that's what I want but

534
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.900
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: No, that's what it should we should go for

535
00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:01.440
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But anyways, yeah this one's alright.

536
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.900
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Aside from the bouncy animals, nothing's sticking out to me, they're really bouncy.

537
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah. I'm, I'm kind of enjoying the graphics. I'm not a huge fan of first person in general.

538
00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:19.199
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It almost feels like I'm watching this and thinking this feels like it's designed for VR.

539
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.400
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Does spiel be a very VR. I agree. That's a good one.

540
00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:30.639
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'm not seeing any listing of that, but it, I feel like it must be a consideration,

541
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.599
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: like not just because it's first person, right? Because plenty of first person,

542
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: person games aren't. But just everything.

543
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It feels the R. S.

544
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:45.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, like when you're booking, you're like kind of see the utensils moving in a way that feels VRS. It's like, you know, lifting it.

545
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, and the way you build stuff, I agree.

546
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.079
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: That is scheduled to release in Q2 this year, and next we have bitter harvest.

547
00:34:57.079 --> 00:35:07.679
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Cast out of your rightful farm, you'll scrape, scheme, and rebuild your way to power in this short, satirical farming sim about ambition and payback.

548
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.099
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I was going to say it's not ambition, it's revenge.

549
00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:15.280
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Both, your ambition for revenge. Come on.

550
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

551
00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:18.699
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Wait, wait, do you, do you get to break someone up in this?

552
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.079
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So... I...

553
00:35:18.039 --> 00:35:20.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh,

554
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I mean, it sounds more like murder than...

555
00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:26.679
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Possibly, but yeah, I was about to say, but not not that the the board's like,

556
00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:25.019
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: No.

557
00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:31.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm afraid with a relationship, unless you count them, one of them being dead, then maybe.

558
00:35:30.000 --> 00:36:00.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Well, no, right. So that at actual soul, I found another bit that might give us a clue so bitter harvest is a 2d farming simulation about ambition, reinvention, and quiet revenge Aaron money through crafting farming and odd jobs as you climb from the bottom of the social ladder build relationships with the town folks uncover their secrets and decide how far you're willing to go to take back what was stolen. I mean, I feel like. I.

559
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Break up a marriage!

560
00:35:56.659 --> 00:36:01.480
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Uncover the secrets of the townspeople, one of them's unfaithful!

561
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:30.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I feel like there needs to be something big at least like that, right? Because otherwise it's just like, Oh, no. What they stole a fiber. Like, I don't really know what we're expecting here. Like, I feel like there need to be some proper big scandals that you can uncover and decide what you're going to do.

562
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:24.800
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I mean, sure. I mean, your blackmailing would look earlier. You know, hold the mayor with like some sort

563
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:30.719
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: of unsaved, black male scheme or something. You're getting a cut of something and also cyaniding some

564
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

565
00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:34.320
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: livestock. So, you know, this could be the one.

566
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: This could be it, how this could be here.

567
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, well, I've added it to my wish list, especially I was in when they said short.

568
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.280
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah, that's that's valid.

569
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.360
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: sure. Okay and you know what's really funny me the art style because there's

570
00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.920
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: one of those games where they're like box art cover images while they differ

571
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.719
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: from the the visuals and what's funny is they're both different and they're both

572
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Oh, yeah.

573
00:36:56.719 --> 00:37:02.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: totally dissonant from the the chaotic themes going on because the visuals are

574
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: just you know like a standard 2D Stardew-like QT pixel game and the image is this

575
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.400
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: is like very serene.

576
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:22.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm almost painting image of just a guy farming and someone standing in the back there, so it's really funny because you cannot sell their cyanide in any of this.

577
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:27.440
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I mean, yeah, but I think about what you know about the context here, and that is your character

578
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:35.679
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: holding trash bags in the foreground, watching the farmer who presumably was the one that

579
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:47.900
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Stall your land, like you're not the one in the, in the farm, who is in the trash

580
00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:40.320
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: cast you out of your farm. Like, there's a very sinister undertone to that now.

581
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:46.599
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

582
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.679
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Who's in the trash bags? Sorry, what's in the trash bag?

583
00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:49.739
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, that's correct.

584
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.400
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Look, I really want to be able to merge or someone now, right? Like it makes me want to merge or someone

585
00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:51.340
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: No, that's the question.

586
00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.059
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: We measured title this week.

587
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.340
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: There you go.

588
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.619
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: You heard it here for us kids.

589
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.380
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But yeah, I look, I think there's at least a 50% chance

590
00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.219
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: of you getting to do with that.

591
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.019
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: There are a few steps from where we are.

592
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.960
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I really hope so.

593
00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:13.820
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, we already have access to signing somewhere.

594
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:24.480
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Well, so when you're farming and a lot of the pesticides that you might spray could kill someone,

595
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:31.320
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: a lot of the antibiotics that you would give your animals could really harm someone.

596
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:40.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So there's a lot of access to dangerous materials in fairly innocent things in your life.

597
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:44.619
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Don't take the horse tranquilizer does not cure the COVID,

598
00:38:44.619 --> 00:38:45.019
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: guys.

599
00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:45.380
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Sorry.

600
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:54.219
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: What about their black market peptides from China?

601
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.340
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: No, does not.

602
00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: You also have farm tools.

603
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:59.420
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, bitter harvest, indeed.

604
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:03.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: We were the bitter harvest all along.

605
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.699
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: He too of this year, and all along.

606
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.019
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay, that's the news.

607
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh... a woo!

608
00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:18.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So we are going to do our cottage core slash farming game fantasy draft for the year.

609
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:26.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So just to summarize how this works, we will by the end of it, we will all of chosen five games.

610
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: They have to be unique to us. We can't like all have the same game.

611
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:40.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's a snake draft, which means that the you start off with, I will roll a dice and we'll

612
00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:45.260
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: decide who goes first, who goes second, who goes last, and it starts off with the first person,

613
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.659
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: they choose one game, second person chooses a game, and then the third person chooses two games

614
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay.

615
00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:54.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: before it then goes back to the second person, and then the first person chooses two games,

616
00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:01.820
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: goes back to the second person. So it's like a snake, you're going up and down, and so instead of

617
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.260
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, I see, I see, cool.

618
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: going, instead of going 1-2.

619
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: 3-1-2-3-2-1-1-2-3.

620
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.420
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: B-2-1, whoa, I never heard that, that's cool, I like that.

621
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:17.619
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So, we cannot choose any games that are already out, except we need to have a conversation

622
00:40:17.619 --> 00:40:25.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: about Star Sand Island, has anybody looked at either the Metacurtrix critics page or any

623
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.639
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Nope, I have not other than your no

624
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.539
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: reviews for Star Sand Island?

625
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Nope. Other than what you've said.

626
00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:33.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay, I have also not the reason the reason why we're

627
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.260
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: saying this a listeners is because we were meant to do this a week ago.

628
00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Sarsa and Ireland came out between the when we were meant to record and when we're actually recording.

629
00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So I think we all agreed we would try and avoid that.

630
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And so it sounds like we were all successful and therefore we have no

631
00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:52.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: information about how critically this is going.

632
00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.960
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: mm-hmm I think I also said that I wasn't going to choose it so it's fine

633
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.719
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

634
00:40:52.940 --> 00:41:02.300
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Kevin yeah okay so that's a whole different point.

635
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:10.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay so it is it is the only currently released game that is within the list of games that we can choose.

636
00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:15.019
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So like no choosing stardew, no choosing what else is coming what's what's come out this year.

637
00:41:15.019 --> 00:41:28.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: What else has come out this life's well so yeah so I I was thinking of this so we have to discuss the early access stuff.

638
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:23.219
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Well, some of the stuff that's on this list is we're talking about 1.0, so it could have like

639
00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:33.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think that if it is out in early access, we can't choose either because

640
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.039
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: OK, I need to assess my list.

641
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:40.619
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: it will already have a Metacritic score and it will already have reviews.

642
00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:42.019
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I will, but I didn't look at the Nanocritic score.

643
00:41:40.619 --> 00:41:45.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I know but do we choose what score do we choose and the point is it needs to be a

644
00:41:45.739 --> 00:41:51.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: game that comes out this year right and so what is coming out and at what point do

645
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:57.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: we choose the score we have to choose at the end of the year but then I just I

646
00:41:57.139 --> 00:42:01.780
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: don't know I mean do you two feel strongly about it I mean in that case it

647
00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: need to be if we were to let

648
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.860
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: But when allowing early access games, the 1.0 would need to come out this year, which means

649
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:12.420
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: that the tag on Steam changes from early access to not early access.

650
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Mm-hmm

651
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And it would need to be the Metacritic score at the same time as all the other ones.

652
00:42:16.679 --> 00:42:18.679
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah

653
00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:18.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And...

654
00:42:18.699 --> 00:42:19.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Ahhh.

655
00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:21.099
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So and then the other

656
00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:28.400
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Thing about it, so I'm just going through and seeing if any of mine are actually on the ones that it's so that are already out

657
00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.360
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: What was I gonna say I don't remember Kevin. How do you feel about that?

658
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:43.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's tricky one cuz we like even if we ignore them the meta credit like people have an idea what it's like

659
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.400
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: No, not saying the three of us have an idea what a game is like, but

660
00:42:48.519 --> 00:42:50.519
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: There's familiar

661
00:42:50.519 --> 00:42:54.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Erity bias, but I guess you can just factor that into what you think or what the 1.0

662
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.480
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think this is I think that's my problem with it, right? Like say, let's take fields of mystery

663
00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:07.800
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: or for example. We all, even if we've not looked to Metacritic, we all know that it's going down

664
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:12.519
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: well with people, right? Like we know that the early access is popular. People like it. And so

665
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.199
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: It is, yup.

666
00:43:12.519 --> 00:43:16.360
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: that is an easy one to be like, Oh, I'm pretty sure. And that's going to come out this year. That's

667
00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:23.320
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: going to get me a high score. And I, I, it, that is why I want it to be only games that haven't

668
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.760
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: come out at all yet, excluding demos because like demos.

669
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:35.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: because otherwise that you shouldn't be able to factor in the game as

670
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.360
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: already out and people like it. Does that make sense?

671
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.800
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, well, yeah, okay. So are we going for like highest cumulative

672
00:43:44.679 --> 00:43:48.820
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Metacritic score kind or average? Okay. Yes

673
00:43:45.500 --> 00:44:03.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yes, so the scoring will happen on a specific date sometime early next year, probably, and I suspect that we're probably, I think we should say we take the Metacritic scores on the first of January, and I'm happy to just make sure that I write everything down and, you know, get screenshots so I can prove all that blah blah blah.

674
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Sure.

675
00:44:01.119 --> 00:44:02.119
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay.

676
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.719
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay. Okay.

677
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:11.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And it will be the winner will be the person with the total highest total score.

678
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.380
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: All right, yeah, I trust you.

679
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.940
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay. All right, that makes it easy. Okay. Well, then see then. Yeah. Yeah, cuz like that makes it cuz yeah, fields of mystery is a great one, right?

680
00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:25.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: cuz that's easy pickings. Um cuz we know it's popular and it's doing well. I'm so with it, it's one point

681
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:32.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, just you know, been I'd be doing well probably more well than other games on this list because people are already familiar with it and

682
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.760
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, so I'm I'm I'm very on the fence about the

683
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.400
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Metacritic

684
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.619
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay, we can just do it. I checked, I only had, I actually only had fields of mystery on my list. So

685
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: And I well

686
00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:49.659
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: all of the other, all of the other ones that are on my list are do not have a 1.0 right,

687
00:44:49.659 --> 00:44:54.219
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: or sorry, are not in early access right now. So that was the only one that would have been an issue.

688
00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:05.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay. And the ones on the list on notion, they say 1.0 TBA if they are in early access.

689
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah

690
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.340
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yes, and so and that was that was just the fields of mystery.

691
00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:12.099
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay. Cool. All right. So we'll just do all the games that aren't out yet. We're ignoring demos,

692
00:45:12.099 --> 00:45:16.260
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: because who wants to do the effort of looking into whether the demo is for a game?

693
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Demos different

694
00:45:17.619 --> 00:45:24.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And yeah, but it means that you have to you have to assume like how good is this actually going to be?

695
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:33.860
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: and therefore, how are people going to take it, etc.? No, go for it. If you got questions, no, no, go for it.

696
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.679
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay. What if people look like to go for it?

697
00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:33.440
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: You're probably going to answer the question I'm asking.

698
00:45:34.639 --> 00:45:37.280
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: What if the game does not come out? What happens?

699
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:46.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: And then what if they decide to do it in early access instead of 1.0? It's still still a zero or do

700
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:56.239
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, because if it's early access, then it's then it's out right like so if we're if we're not allowing you to choose games are in early access already then we're defining early access as release

701
00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:46.719
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: or it can be.

702
00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.900
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay sounds good sounds good

703
00:45:56.719 --> 00:45:59.760
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Right, so you get them at whatever Metacritic score they have

704
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:07.579
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: The other thing to bear in mind. So so this is obviously Metacritic scores. Metacritic takes critic review scores and

705
00:46:08.639 --> 00:46:15.039
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It tries to get one number out of that so they do stuff to the bunch of reviews

706
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.599
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And they I don't know whatever the point is we are farming this out to Metacritic who take in reviews and

707
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:27.800
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Givers are number and so we will just use the critic number that Metacritic give us for example

708
00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Stardew Valley has a Metacritic score of 89. These are all out of a hundred

709
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.519
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Sugardew Island on the other hand has a score of 55 which I think is way too high for that game

710
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:44.159
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Tamagotchi Plaza has a score of 43 and just to clarify these are the the Metas score

711
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.260
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Because user scores are about users individually scoring them the Metas score is about critic reviews, which is what we're using for them and

712
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Right right

713
00:46:54.159 --> 00:46:59.840
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Animal Crossing new horizons has 90 it is possible for games not to have a Metacritic score

714
00:46:56.199 --> 00:46:58.199
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay

715
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.460
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: When does that happen?

716
00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:03.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: If the if they have fewer than four critic reviews

717
00:47:04.599 --> 00:47:07.760
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: They do not get a score and we will be doing this

718
00:47:08.039 --> 00:47:11.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So obviously when a game right comes out

719
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.840
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: they will not have a score initially some will get it very quickly some

720
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:32.519
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: will take ages to get it and some will never get it because they just don't have enough people doing that, right? So that's something you need to bear in mind as well. If on the first of January when I look up the games, if they have a TBD, they get that's a zero. Any other questions?

721
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:40.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay. For good.

722
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ah, yes. Um, no, no, no, no, I just answered my question. No, man. Okay.

723
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:51.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So to decide the order, I have a dice app on my phone, which I tested before this call and the others could hear it.

724
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:58.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So I have a d6 because it doesn't have a d3. I have a d6 with each of our names on it twice.

725
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: [laughter]

726
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:02.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And I will roll the dice.

727
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: The first name that appears will be going first.

728
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.480
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: The second name will be going second and the name

729
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:13.960
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: does not happen will be going 3rd so that was Cody Cody is first

730
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.840
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Okay.

731
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:22.239
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: and I'll was the second one so Cody will be going first I will be going second

732
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, dang it, hahaha

733
00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.400
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Okay.

734
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.239
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Oh, dang.

735
00:48:20.039 --> 00:48:22.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ah

736
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.139
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Okay.

737
00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:23.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Kevin will be going 3rd

738
00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:27.639
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, I said to do my, I'm the person to do a double, okay, let me do it

739
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.280
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Okay.

740
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:31.579
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Cody what is your first game?

741
00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.119
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Bookopia.

742
00:48:32.599 --> 00:48:35.719
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Right, it's not fair

743
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.800
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: All right.

744
00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: We already lost out

745
00:48:38.159 --> 00:48:40.800
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Do I have to explain why?

746
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.739
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: No, no, that's, I mean, I think we, I think we know why.

747
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:46.300
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I mean, we can talk about it if you want, but I think just Kevin is very upset with you.

748
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.219
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm going to ensure that Cody wins, but just on that alone.

749
00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:02.300
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay, uh, I will, I think I will choose Star Sand Island.

750
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:05.940
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay. Oh, wow. Reasons.

751
00:49:06.139 --> 00:49:10.619
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think it is good, and I think people will like it.

752
00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:17.099
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: You know, it feels quite as, quite as, like, I think it's one of those.

753
00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:27.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think it could go either way, right? It could either be like, this is a great game, and people really like it, or it feels like people just go, oh, it's just another, you know,

754
00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:37.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: churned out farming game. And, you know, it could go either way, but I think I'm leaning towards, I think people will actually like this game.

755
00:49:38.619 --> 00:49:41.420
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It looks quite generic, but I think eventually it.

756
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:56.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: You know, it's coming out early enough in the year that I think there's enough time to for words of most to get out and people to actually start liking the game and then critics actually go, "Oh, maybe I should do a review on this." And then I think they will I think it will do well.

757
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.940
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I think the challenge here is getting the word out right because I think people are playing and are enjoying it

758
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So that's that's a kicker right if you just get enough people eyeballs on it

759
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.280
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: You'll get that score but it'll be high in that group. Yeah

760
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:21.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, and I think that the announced a few weeks ago that they were doing like a crossover with my time at games, and I think that will help with their word of mouth quite well.

761
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:29.199
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, well. Okay. All right. You know what? Um, both of these. I'm all right. You know,

762
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.780
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah.

763
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:26.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Alright, Kevin, your first game.

764
00:50:29.199 --> 00:50:34.800
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm already going high stakes because I'm actually going both my first two are going to be

765
00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:40.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: to our both on the TVA list. Actually, you're not confirmed for this year. So, so I'm going for

766
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:43.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Oh, okay. Okay, go for it. Go for it. Oh, I think I know what you're gonna do.

767
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:47.920
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: the first one. No, I'm not doing. We don't know what I'm doing.

768
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.900
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Don't do it don't do it don't do it

769
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:54.800
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: thinking, but no, I'm not actually going with that one. I'm going with a real wild card. Um, and that is

770
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.880
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I actually knew you were gonna say, I knew you were gonna say that. I wasn't thinking

771
00:50:52.539 --> 00:50:54.539
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay

772
00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:04.480
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: powerful. Um, oh, oh, I thought you I thought everyone was just assuming I was going to say wild

773
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:07.760
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: on to chocolate here, I was thinking Balfaum. Nope. No, no, no, I wasn't even thinking that.

774
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:13.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: society, but um, okay. All right. Well, you know me well. Oh, that our month of podcasting nonstop

775
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, I was thinking Balfaum, I saw it and I was like, he's gonna go for it.

776
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: as you were synced. (laughs)

777
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.480
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: You guys are on a, on a, you, you understand each other.

778
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughs]

779
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: We'll finish each others.

780
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Time which is...

781
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, finish it, the sentence.

782
00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.019
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Sandwiches.

783
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: There you go. (laughs)

784
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'll finish, I'll send it just.

785
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, but anyways, power farm.

786
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So here's the thing.

787
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Power world for all the nonsense and questionable things involved.

788
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: The game itself technically was competent.

789
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I have faith that our farm will come out similarly.

790
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Again, they're clearly ripping off a lot,

791
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: but is the world of the game be fun?

792
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I think.

793
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: And obviously it's gotten enough, you know,

794
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: then it's got brand recognition of some kind.

795
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Everyone knows power world for better or for worse, how do you feel?

796
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:04.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So, it will be interesting to see.

797
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So I think it's hot people's attention.

798
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I think it's gonna get up there.

799
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:11.380
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Do you know the interesting thing is, they don't have a metacritic score for Power World.

800
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: What?

801
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Really?

802
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.460
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Ooooooohhhh!

803
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, I mean, it's weird.

804
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah.

805
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.019
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Which is surprising?

806
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's very weird.

807
00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:18.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't understand why.

808
00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:24.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: They have a bunch of critic reviews, but none of them seem to have scores.

809
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.179
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's strange. Well, okay

810
00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.460
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: That is weird.

811
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.659
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I wonder if it's like a bug specific to this one page?

812
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:35.400
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Or something and it's not it's not it's not it's not early access thing because plenty of early access games. I'm pretty sure have

813
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.860
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Hmm what well, I mean

814
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.460
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Do they

815
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Hmm. Field's a nice route.

816
00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:40.420
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Give me a give me a game as an early access just now a big one

817
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: There you go bigger one

818
00:52:42.179 --> 00:52:49.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Well, and I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure fields of mystery a dozen but oh it does say

819
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.179
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: TBA

820
00:52:51.179 --> 00:52:55.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Early access so maybe it is maybe you don't get a metric or score when you're in early access

821
00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:03.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, brought myself in the put, 'cause I believe the game would come out, but not out of early access.

822
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.340
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yikes.

823
00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.159
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yikes.

824
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.800
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay, I mean, so, okay, so I guess we need to change our rule then and just go well. It's gonna be

825
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.199
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah.

826
00:53:10.679 --> 00:53:18.519
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Like guess you yeah, I guess you can have our games are in LA access. So Kevin, I'm gonna let you change if you want to change

827
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:24.659
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: all right well dang my second one is also well okay okay all right you know what I will change it

828
00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:28.980
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: i'm gonna wipe that one because yeah all right i'm gonna be having a second one

829
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay

830
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:32.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay, so wait, so the update you're saying is we can, yes.

831
00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.400
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So we're changing the rules we're changing the rules you can choose games

832
00:53:33.559 --> 00:53:39.840
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: There are in early access and are not in 1.0 yet because I feel I feel like we have to have one or the other, right?

833
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:49.239
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: go to 1.0. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That invalidates the thing. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well,

834
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And I think if they if they don't have a score then I guess that's something

835
00:53:49.239 --> 00:53:54.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: you know, I'm changing the fields of mystery. I probably already stole Pupopia. I'm not just

836
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.380
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughing]

837
00:53:54.039 --> 00:54:04.199
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: not in it. Just swiping it right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. So

838
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.860
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: - Well, I mean, fair dies a great choice

839
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.059
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: that is, I think, gonna do very well.

840
00:54:03.219 --> 00:54:06.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I, in fact, I would go so far as to say,

841
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:10.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: excluding, I think that's the GTA 6 of farming games

842
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah

843
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: in terms of like, you know it's gonna have a good high score

844
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:24.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: No, yeah, I'd say haunted chocolate tears are GTA 6, but anyways, but yes, yeah, you get your interest. It's in the same vein

845
00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:14.820
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: 'cause people like it,

846
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:17.219
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: but who knows if it's actually gonna happen this year.

847
00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.300
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: When is it gonna come out? Yeah

848
00:54:17.219 --> 00:54:18.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughing]

849
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, because there's no one even,

850
00:54:25.139 --> 00:54:27.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: no one's even trying to pretend that's coming out this year.

851
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughing]

852
00:54:27.679 --> 00:54:31.599
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, some would say GTA 6 isn't the same boat

853
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.820
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, they're definitely pretending that.

854
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: They're pretending.

855
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.179
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughing]

856
00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:41.440
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's true, um, that's true. Okay, all right, okay, you know what I'm still gonna be bold

857
00:54:36.179 --> 00:54:37.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: All right, what's your second one then?

858
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.280
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Also TVA, but if I'm if it does come out, it's not I don't think it'll be early access and that is a key planet

859
00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.280
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: um

860
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:55.199
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That is the hover's animal crossing type game

861
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.280
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Um, the hover's is big enough that they're

862
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: They've done enough games like I know their consistency and if that gate the question is does the game come out this year?

863
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I do believe they will

864
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: As of yet they haven't had any like huge delays on any other game.

865
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.079
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: They run a tight ship production-wise so I believe it will come out and it's a

866
00:55:19.079 --> 00:55:24.440
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: hoyover scheme their games are polished enough. I think it will do well. So there you go.

867
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:31.719
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Fields of Mystery and Petite Planet. Those are my two. Yeah and I mean it's a huge like

868
00:55:31.719 --> 00:55:38.639
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: already player base right of people playing hoyover so I think that anyways that's me.

869
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.119
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yep. Nope. I think that's a good, good option as well. Um, I need to decide whether I'm keeping

870
00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:47.360
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Star Sand Island. Cause of course that's an early access. Uh, well, yeah, obviously.

871
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:45.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Mmm.

872
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.579
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I'm keeping, I'm keeping Jacobia.

873
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's, that's, that's a yeah. You, yeah, cuz you win.

874
00:55:51.519 --> 00:55:57.119
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think I, I think I will keep Star Sand Island because I feel like if there's any game that might

875
00:55:57.119 --> 00:56:03.280
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: release an, it like, it's come out so early in the year that I, and I feel, so they say on

876
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: steam that expecting it to be an early access for us.

877
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:35.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And obviously it's not going to be in 1.0 in 4 months, but could it be by the end of the year based on what they're saying, I feel like it could, and also it feels quite like they're just like they're going to have a couple of months I think of making, adding all the things that people expected there to be, right, and then adding, and then a few months of adding in all the content they want, it doesn't feel like it's a super early access game in my experience.

878
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.099
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh, that's not, yeah.

879
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:43.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It might happen, we'll see, so I'm going to keep it, I'm going to keep it.

880
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.340
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: - Mm-hmm.

881
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.920
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, hey, gotta risk it for the biscuits sometimes.

882
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:56.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Absolutely, absolutely. Okay, so I need to decide on my second one then. I am going to go with Tomodatche life.

883
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:58.340
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, that's a good one. Yeah, that's going to crush it. Oh, it will.

884
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:03.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Maybe we'll see. Cody, you're second and third, please.

885
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.320
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: my second is haunted chocolate tier. I'm gonna go big and go home.

886
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.239
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughing]

887
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:16.320
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Oh my word, Cody! Oh, I can't believe you've wasted the Pocopia score by going with something that's gonna give you zero, my word.

888
00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:09.780
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's, that's the game full.

889
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.679
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Dude, if I,

890
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.159
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, that's it's a safety net. Gee, can afford it

891
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: what, but if it, but if it comes,

892
00:57:20.079 --> 00:57:26.639
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: exactly I can afford it. Y'all are gonna have mid scores and I'm gonna have at least one big one.

893
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.360
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah

894
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't know about that.

895
00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.800
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, she's right

896
00:57:28.739 --> 00:57:30.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Like, I suspect that hunter geography

897
00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.179
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: might have the problem that it's not stargy.

898
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.599
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I think he'll have enough.

899
00:57:34.179 --> 00:57:36.260
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And people won't like it as much because of that.

900
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:47.480
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: the question, that's the thing. That's the one. That's the gamble. Yeah, I'm not questioning

901
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:38.659
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: It'll be fine.

902
00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: It's also not coming out this year.

903
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Well, you well, that's, that's a,

904
00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:48.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: you don't know that, you don't know that, it's cool.

905
00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:54.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: the quality. The score once it exists, but be when that's the gamble. And, but I believe

906
00:57:50.239 --> 00:57:51.079
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah.

907
00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.840
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah.

908
00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.920
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So I'm gonna, I'm gonna risk it for the biscuit for that.

909
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Cody can afford it.

910
00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.880
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: And then my second one will be my time at Evershine.

911
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.980
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Ooh, okay, okay.

912
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.559
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: My time game, it's an active dev team.

913
00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:11.159
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: They already have a controller update, like,

914
00:58:11.159 --> 00:58:13.920
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: said that they're going, that that's gonna be part of it.

915
00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:17.880
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: There's also possibility that it gets pushed back.

916
00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.519
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So, (laughs)

917
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.480
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: interesting. Yeah, just to give you some context, my time at Porsche got 73 and my time at

918
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:35.679
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Sandrock got 80. So not bad, not bad at all. So yeah, we interesting to see because I don't

919
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.679
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Dang, it was a good one.

920
00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:42.559
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: think they're doing an early access. But and originally they were planning to release this year,

921
00:58:42.559 --> 00:58:51.760
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: spring this year. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. We'll see. We'll see. Okay. So my third one. Oh, goodness.

922
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.719
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: The problem is with all that with the rule change that like that's just mucking up my brain.

923
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:59.739
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Let's see, we got, we got, we're, yeah, yep, we're all changing it on the fly.

924
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:08.559
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I am going to choose which brick, which brick is my number three. I think 2D pixel art games always do well.

925
00:59:08.559 --> 00:59:16.719
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think which games can do well. I think this one has enough buzz behind it that it won't just

926
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:19.960
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: be snapped up as our just another release sort of.

927
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:31.820
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, I think the risk and that one and there's a lot of games on sale on this list that I think had the risk. I think what if it just drops his early access like that's the kicker, but

928
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:35.960
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't think which brick is going to. I don't think which brick is going to. It strikes me as our 1.0.

929
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.260
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, all right

930
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:42.460
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, okay. That's fair. I was I was considering it for but I was unsure about the early access thing. So

931
00:59:43.019 --> 00:59:49.420
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Um, okay fair enough. Oh, that's yes. That's just on contender to I'd say. I think the game will be quality just

932
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:55.179
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, uh, is it my turn again then?

933
00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.420
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yes, this will be your third and fourth.

934
00:59:58.619 --> 01:00:05.659
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, gosh. Um, oh, it's hot. I'll only pick two. So we're gonna finish up before I was that right?

935
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.659
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah. I'll do you want to pick two this time?

936
01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.420
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, I just go pick go and pick two. Let's let's mix it up a little just

937
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:16.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, we're doing it the way it goes because you do your third and fourth and then I do my fourth

938
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.739
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, all right, okay

939
01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:21.820
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Then Cody does their fourth and fifth and then no, I've done my third adjusted my third

940
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: No, then you do your third

941
01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.780
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Oh, okay

942
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:29.820
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Then okay, whatever. Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay. Um, all right

943
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: But I'm literally writing it down in the show notes if you want to have a look at what we are

944
01:00:25.739 --> 01:00:30.940
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay, okay, I was thinking to say if I was like this isn't there

945
01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:34.039
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Nope, it is perfect. It's exactly fair. That's why we're doing it

946
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:36.860
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, okay, I missed one. I thought you were two nevermind it. Okay. Um,

947
01:00:37.179 --> 01:00:40.539
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, I've got Starstand Island Tomadaccia Life in Witchbrick, three games.

948
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.300
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay

949
01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:46.139
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: All right, um, oh, this may be this is a little risky because

950
01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.940
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: We love a risk sometimes.

951
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Where I'm all, I'm risking so much over here.

952
01:00:48.139 --> 01:00:50.139
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah

953
01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:55.260
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Uh, okay, right me down for go-go town

954
01:00:56.059 --> 01:01:04.619
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Um, because yeah, because like obviously I don't have any doubt about the quality. The question will that game ever leave early access

955
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think it's, I think that's a pretty safe bet, personally.

956
01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.579
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think it's, I think it's happening because they, the, they announced last

957
01:01:13.579 --> 01:01:18.380
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: week that they were 1.0 and switch release were coming Q2.

958
01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think that I think I think it's almost there.

959
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:27.099
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay. All right. Well, then let's go for it. I think it's like I am plenty about everything

960
01:01:27.099 --> 01:01:38.300
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I've seen people seem to like it. So yeah, go for it. All right. Okay. Oh, um, I need

961
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:37.900
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Think that's a good choice. And you're a fourth one as well.

962
01:01:39.179 --> 01:01:44.699
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Sorry, it is some of my list changing. Um, I Oh, I know it's really feel like that was going to be

963
01:01:44.699 --> 01:01:51.579
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: an early access game. Um, but I'm running out of options. I feel confident in. So I'm

964
01:01:51.500 --> 01:02:04.539
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: going to have to go for it. I think anyways, oh, put me down for super zoos. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

965
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:05.619

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: when I feel we'll do a score wise, but it's probably not getting the score this year. Oh, but that's

<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: half a year for them to delays and they are consistently putting out good updates and every time

1016
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.699
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Is it is it an anniversary for them?

1017
01:05:02.519 --> 01:05:06.840
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And and just and just to clarify that is not a remake and

1018
01:05:07.139 --> 01:05:09.139
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, Brad knew

1020
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.960
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: game comes out this year. That's what I see.

1021
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay.

1022
01:05:14.139 --> 01:05:20.179
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Not just not just shooting yourself in in the foot with like high caliber now. It just

1023
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: What are some of the more recent scores?

1024
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.579
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So the last - well, that's a good question.

1025
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.760
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: [laughing]

1026
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:32.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Let's have a look, shall we? Let's go into Metacritic.

1027
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.699
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So the reason why I'm certain that a new one is coming out this year is because

1028
01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:44.179
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: pioneers of all of town came out in 2021. So we're five years

1029
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:50.340
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: from a new study of seasons game. And we are consistently getting one game a year.

1030
01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.300
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: it's just all of the ones

1031
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.219
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: It is their 30th anniversary, if I recall.

1032
01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:23.579
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, you might, you might not be as insane as you sound.

1033
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: That's, uh, yeah. That's, uh, he's, he's trust in the process.

1034
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:30.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: it's also just to point out like three years ago the announce that two games were in development

1035
01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:24.579
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Ooh.

1036
01:06:24.579 --> 01:06:26.760
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: [laughs]

1037
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: And okay.

1038
01:06:31.059 --> 01:06:32.659
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, I don't remember that.

1039
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't think both of those will come out this year. I think it would just be one.

1040
01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:33.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Turn it out.

1041
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: All right.

1042
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: So what, okay, what happens if both come out this year, which?

1043
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: That is a good question. So I probably need to.

1044
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Do you want to pick like the first one that comes out or you know what?

1045
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: This is such a bold statement.

1046
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I am going to give you the ability to pick.

1047
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Kevin, how do you feel about that?

1048
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:07.019
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'll find fine weather ever he's a lunatic for doing it sure why not and you know what

1049
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: He's a lunatic.

1050
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:11.139
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'm sorry, I'm sorry the person who chose haunted chocolate ear thinks that I am the

1051
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: This is so unlikely to happen.

1052
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.980
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: No matter

<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I have a doctorate.

1056
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: I know what I'm talking to.

1057
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:25.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: How to chocolates here is releasing 2026, quote, "Dr. Vethas."

1058
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.300
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: [laughter]

1059
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Expert on the field of field.

1060
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.519
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: OK, I-- I think--

1061
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh, here's one.

1062
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:38.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: If we get this more than one score, why don't we average them?

1063
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.400
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: No, I think I just get I think I just I think I just get the first one that comes out

1064
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Okay, fine.

1065
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Pick the one.

1066
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Pick the one.

1067
01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.119
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't think both of them come out this year

1068
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:52.679
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So they announced that they were making a standard new story of seasons game and also that they were making a new multiplayer one

1069
01:07:53.719 --> 01:07:58.119
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I don't really want to narrow it down just in case. It's the multiplayer one that comes out

1070
01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:06.199
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And I want if either of them come out I kind of want like the fact that I'm saying story seasons. I want either of them to count

1071
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:15.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: But yeah, I'm happy to just take the first one. I'm not too fast about that because I don't think it will be I don't think it'll be an issue

1072
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:27.319
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm in panic, dick mode because there's many options for my retakenness.

1073
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.039
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Okay, Kevin what's your final one your fifth and final one?

1074
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughs]

1075
01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:34.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm basically looking at two and they're kind of in reverse problems.

1076
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:41.180
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: One, I believe we'll be quality, but we'll not feel confident we'll come out this year.

1077
01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.020
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: The other one I do believe will come out.

1078
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.359
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But I am questioning its overall quality and and so the the ones I'm waffling here between yeah

1079
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.439
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [whooshing]

1080
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:56.500
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: You get well, so, so just just to say you can say wherever you want now because we've already chosen so walk us through your thought process if you

1081
01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:47.279
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Okay.

1082
01:08:54.239 --> 01:08:57.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, okay

1083
01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Yeah

1084
01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.260
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Starbirds, I believe will hit 1.0 this year

1085
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:07.199
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: And it has a lot going for it, but I don't know if it's gonna solve the ultimate problem. Oh, and I can't with it

1086
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.960
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: But will that but will that matter to other people that's the

1087
01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know if it's

1088
01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Well, maybe

1089
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:28.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: because it was like, I don't know. That's a good question. I don't know. I felt a little, I think about, I look back to and I enjoyed the time, but it still felt like I just lost interest quickly, but with people still give it a high mark marks with that.

1090
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:38.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know, hard to say. And it has so much going on for it, right? It has the art and the charm and everything, like I can't deny that. I might, maybe I'm being too harsh on it.

1091
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.220
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: And it's also going through the whole, you know,

1092
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.880
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: early access process, so maybe it's going to.

1093
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: to fix itself, I could be Ross the other one, which we all know me,

1094
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: but like I have faith in wild society, I think it's going to be well done.

1095
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.039
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughs]

1096
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't, it's not going to be early access, but by that same token,

1097
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I don't know if it's going to drop this year because we've got a trailer,

1098
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: but we haven't heard a peep out of it otherwise.

1099
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:12.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: So that is a big question mark to me as if it'll actually hit 2027 or 2066.

1100
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Excuse me. So these are, yeah, you know, it's outfield.

1101
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: We're going to come. I just want to say that it's not feel a bit waiting so long.

1102
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:31.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But anyways, I think I'm just going to go with the like,

1103
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I'm think I'm by decision. I'm just going to go with what's more concrete,

1104
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: what I actually can see and get a better feeling for.

1105
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.939
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Right, let me down for Starbucks because I believe that's gonna drop this year

1106
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:51.279
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: It does have good things going for it. Maybe not everything, but it does have good stuff going

1107
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:55.739
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah. I think it's a good choice. I think the thing is that yeah, we weren't huge fans of it,

1108
01:10:55.739 --> 01:11:02.539
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: but I would not be surprised if it still does well because you know, some people are looking for that.

1109
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.619
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, and it can't course correct right like it wasn't an unsolvable situation

1110
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.920
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But and maybe they'll get there

1111
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:19.039
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Right the question is with me a reason to play that was like the big one right? I like playing it just it'd be more reason to play more

1112
01:11:20.399 --> 01:11:26.600
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: But and you know what better critics scores our review stuff right for someone reviewing it

1113
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:37.079
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Yeah, well, that's well, and that's the thing. And if a reviewer goes in expecting,

1114
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.600
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Maybe that's enough to get a good score like you know, they don't have to put in

1115
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: [laughter]

1116
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Starbirds, right like they're there

1117
01:11:37.079 --> 01:11:41.479
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: they're not to be like a greater purpose for it, then they're not, they're not going to score it

1118
01:11:41.479 --> 01:11:42.680
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: negatively because of that.

1119
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:43.840
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: That's true.

1120
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.239
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: All right, yeah, I feel better about the Starbirds.

1121
01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:49.920
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Save me, save me from the fact that I put super zoos story

1122
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.439
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: on the stupid list.

1123
01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:54.920
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: All right. Well, that's our draft. I'm just going to go through these

1124
01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.600
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: lists just to do them as a whole. So Cody's five are Pocopia, haunted chocolate here,

1125
01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.880
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: my time and ever shine outbound an autonomica. My games.

1126
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.560
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Mm-hmm, walk it in.

1127
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:10.300
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: - Really out of five of those, strong ones.

1128
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.560
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: My games are Starstand Island, Tomad actually life living the dream,

1129
01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:23.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Witchbrook, Dolaktown, and an as of now unannounced new story of seasons game that is not a remake.

1130
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: and

1131
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.039
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I'm not sure if this is the first one released and Kevin's list is Fields of

1132
01:12:31.039 --> 01:12:36.399
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: Austria, Petite Planet, Google Town, SuperZoo Story and Starbirds.

1133
01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:41.760
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: And at this point, I really, yeah, I have no idea who's wearing this, this is exciting.

1134
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Oh

1135
01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.399
<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: I think this is a great, fun list.

1136
01:12:42.619 --> 01:12:44.619
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, this is great

1137
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:50.000
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I love the different strategies. Oh, yeah, because like I like you feel like you have some

1138
01:12:50.779 --> 01:12:55.659
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Sure-fire hits, you know, like some you know, maybe not the highest high-risk ones, but

1139
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500
<v 3C461FF5-95CA-408A-BDD0-C38ACAFAE5A9>Codey: Mm-hmm.

1140
01:12:56.819 --> 01:12:59.859
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I like your your list. Oh, how do you?

1141
01:13:00.899 --> 01:13:05.300
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: It's a haunted chocolate here like she she built in safety factor for that like

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.020
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: You're welcome. Some of all.

1143
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.500

1147
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.520
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah, um.

<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: I mean, you're not going to be able to save the news for the podcast,

1151
01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:39.399
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: but we're going to be screaming in the slack.

1156
01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.399
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: What did? Oh.

<v 6FC7A04C-0374-44F9-84C8-092F01B5A366>Al: So a bit of a step up from the last one they had

1163
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:27.340
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: hmm I'm at y'all be honest I don't even remember started music that much and I'm not saying it was mark against it I just it's been that long since I played it um

1167
01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500
<v 2B2C33F9-2724-41DD-B2A4-7F87B468965C>Kevin: Yeah
