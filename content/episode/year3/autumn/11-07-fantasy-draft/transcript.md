(36s)

> My name is Kevin.

(39s) **Al:**

> And we're here today to talk about carterscore games and Kevin Donow,

(39s) **Kevin:**

> I'm noticeably not.

(42s) **Al:**

> talk over my introduction!

(44s) **Codey:**

> Oh, woo! An additional human.

(45s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(47s)

> I was just going to say, noticeably not just Alan Kevin.

(51s)

> I hope he's here.

(51s) **Al:**

> This is going to be one of those episodes, isn't it?

(52s) **Kevin:**

> You guys remember that?

(53s)

[laughs]

(57s)

> Yeah.

(58s) **Al:**

> All right. Welcome to specifically Dr. Cody.

(58s) **Kevin:**

> I'll do it.

(59s)

[laughs]

(1m 3s)

> Oh, yeah.

(1m 3s) **Codey:**

> Well, yeah, it was me. I did it.

(1m 5s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(1m 7s) **Al:**

> Congratulations, Dr. Cody.

(1m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, she did it.

(1m 10s) **Codey:**

> Thank you. I did it.

(1m 12s) **Kevin:**

> We can all--

(1m 13s) **Al:**

> Officially the first person with a PhD to appear on this podcast.

(1m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, dang.

(1m 17s) **Codey:**

> I don't I don't know. Is that true or?

(1m 18s) **Kevin:**

> She's an authority more of an authority.

(1m 20s) **Al:**

> Well, who would- who would-

(1m 21s)

> have you been? One of the game developers? Come on.

(1m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, Ray has no-- Ray Chase has no PhD.

(1m 24s) **Codey:**

> Possibly.

(1m 27s)

> The first the first co-host to earn a PhD.

(1m 31s)

> During the podcast

(1m 32s) **Al:**

> Well, that's definitely true. That is very niche.

(1m 33s) **Codey:**

> podcast, it's a great time to be able to do this.

(1m 35s) **Kevin:**

> And, wait, that means literally everything you say, we can quote now, as Dr. Math is quoted saying to whatever.

(1m 43s) **Codey:**

> sure. I mean, you could have, I'm not going to lie. You could have done that before. Like just as a quote

(1m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but now they'll say doctors of people know. Yeah. Yeah, well, people say doctors, so that means things are not in America, but it means things to other sensible people.

(1m 49s) **Codey:**

> that I said, yeah. It's true. I get to do the fun thing now where people say on the airplane,

(2m 1s) **Kevin:**

[groans]

(2m 4s) **Codey:**

> "Is there a doctor here?" And I'll stand up and say, "I'm an entomologist." And people can say, "He's dying,"

(2m 5s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(2m 8s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(2m 10s) **Codey:**

> and I'll say I'll get the pinning supplies.

(2m 13s)

[laughs]

(2m 17s) **Al:**

> All right, Cody and Kev are both here

(2m 20s)

> because we're gonna do a new thing.

(2m 22s)

> We're gonna try a cottagecore of fantasy draft.

(2m 28s)

> I will explain fully how this works

(2m 30s)

> when we get to them after the news,

(2m 32s)

> but essentially we are going to choose games

(2m 35s)

> that we hope will come out this year.

(2m 38s)

> And we will score it at the end of the year or beginning of next year, I guess.

(2m 43s)

> I'll we'll decide at some point when I don't know, will the score based on Metacritic scores?

(2m 51s)

> So the winner will be the one who has the highest total Metacritic score.

(2m 55s)

> I will explain all the details of that later on, but that is the general idea.

(3m)

> We'll see how well it works.

(3m 2s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(3m 3s) **Kevin:**

> All right, I like this. Now this is this is good. I like this. This is good.

(3m 8s) **Al:**

> Kevin's sounding like he has no idea what's happening, and this is brand new to him.

(3m 12s)

> We've been talking about this for about a month and a half, I think.

(3m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I know I know I'm just like here in the long term play and this figuring out I like it. This is good.

(3m 23s) **Al:**

> Before that we have a bunch of news, but first of all, Cody, what have you been up to, Dr. Cody?

## What Have We Been Up To

(3m 28s) **Codey:**

> woo me um why I defended my dissertation and did that and then so I'm still like finishing up the writing aspect of it and applying to jobs which is horrifying um but i've also been playing I started playing colt of the lamb oh yeah my first time playing colt of the lamb um

(3m 32s) **Al:**

> Whoo!

(3m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Oh yeah.

(3m 51s) **Al:**

> Wooooo! And your thoughts?

(3m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, is this your first time?

(3m 58s) **Codey:**

> I am really enjoying it I so I got the pack that has all of it it's it's the pack that's like called the one who waits and it includes includes wool haven which just came out and like a bunch of other dlc's but i'm only playing like the base game right now and then i'll play again once I finish it so yeah yeah so very fun loving that I go on quests to get things for these people and then I come

(4m 15s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's a good way to do it. Yeah, see what the game was like without the

(4m 28s) **Codey:**

> back and they hate me because one of them died or something um they decide to get sick also the like you know when you're on your crusades sometimes the like gods that you're making mad will just be like all of your people are sick now and you're like cool now i'm stuck in this crusade and i'm just need to try and get out as soon as possible so that my people don't die because I don't have the ability to get out right now

(4m 29s) **Al:**

> >> How dare they care about that?

(4m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you're right.

(4m 53s)

> Yeah. Oh, that's. Yeah.

(4m 58s) **Codey:**

> um I think I have to find that so yeah it's still really fun it's still really cute like I love when they come at me and they're so happy and they're just like beloved leader I just really want to eat poop and i'm like oh you because if you say no you like they lose faith in you and it's like it okay um so

(5m 1s) **Al:**

> It's definitely low on the cozy.

(5m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(5m 15s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(5m 28s) **Codey:**

> that's that's fun also been playing slay the spire still um and yeah just doing specimens I don't really I feel like there was something I wanted to talk about that I may use probably just cold with lamb um I just stuck with colts of the lamb I didn't i'm not original I don't I mean every now and then they they come up to me and they're like please the colt looks lame can you make a they get pretty

(5m 43s) **Kevin:**

> What did you what did you call your call? What do you remember wouldn't think what's the name?

(5m 50s)

> Okay

(5m 57s)

> Yeah

(5m 58s) **Codey:**

> here and i'm like right so i'll add some decorations I don't design anything so uh yeah kevin what have you been up to?

(6m 4s) **Kevin:**

> door sure

(6m 9s)

> Ah, that's good. What have I been up to so a Kirby?

(6m 13s)

> Airriders? My own file. I played the single player mode for the first time.

(6m 18s)

> Let's call it a road trip mode. It's basically doing lots of mini events and races

(6m 30s)

> just in succession, because that's the game. But some of them get really hard.

(6m 36s)

> So if you increase the difficulty, it'll retry a few of them. And it's also...

(6m 43s)

> So you're driving along the road and there's basically three options. They'll give you

(6m 47s)

> my left, right, middle. And the reward changes. You get different boosts and modifiers for your

(6m 53s)

> vehicles and your overall character stats and so on. But each option is a different event.

(7m)

> So you have to balance, "Well, am I going to be good at this event? Or do I really want this

(7m 5s)

> reward?" etc, etc. And so you just keep doing that a handful of times. There's branching paths.

(7m 11s)

> So it was cute. It was fun.

(7m 13s)

> The story is kind of existentially horrifying when you think about it too much, because, yeah, it's interesting because curvy stories are no stranger to cosmic eldritch horrors and whatnot, but this one was a smaller scale story and I guess because it was a little more personal.

(7m 18s) **Al:**

> I ha- I ha- I ha- I haired about that.

(7m 34s) **Kevin:**

> And I didn't feel comfortable with that, that living robot being torn to pieces like as it's still conscious. That wasn't fun.

(7m 44s)

> But, but yeah, no, good stuff. I like the curb air ride. When else have I been up to? That's probably really all I've been very busy with work on tired people.

(7m 56s)

> That's all I can think of really. What about you, Alex, been going on?

(8m 3s) **Al:**

> So I've been continuing trying to get my Pokemon Sword and Shield decks done in Pokemon home.

(8m 9s)

> My plan is to get that done.

(8m 16s)

> I think I have 400 left, but it's actually probably less than that because the the the app I'm using has the DLCs in there, the DLC decks in there as well because obviously you have to get that for the Pokemon home thing, but there's duplicate Pokemon so I haven't gone through and like checked off the ones that are duplicate that I haven't caught yet, right.

(8m 38s)

> But like for, you know, for example, like I call what was it? I can't remember. Let's say it was a power to it. I don't think it was. I think power to it was only in one

(8m 46s)

> deck, but I caught a palpitode and it was in two of the decks. So that's actually two, not just one. So yeah, there's quite a few still to catch, but at most 400 probably like 300, but I've got two weeks left to get it done. Let's see if I do it.

(9m 4s) **Codey:**

> I'm sure you will, you got this.

(9m 6s) **Al:**

> I'm not sure I will because the other thing I'm playing and, you know, that can suck up a lot of time is I've bought the full version of star set.

(9m 16s)

> Island after it came out, which here. Oh, yes. So there's a fun story that the slack people already know,

(9m 24s)

> but I've got to got to talk about it here as well. So loaded up the game on my steam deck,

(9m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I was about to bring that up

(9m 29s) **Al:**

> bit up and horrifying flashing. I don't even know how to describe it. It was like the resolution

(9m 37s)

> was changing for part of the screen a couple of times a second. And so on the the loading screen,

(9m 44s)

> Oh, that's it.

(9m 46s)

> The start-up screen, that just meant like the image was like horrifying and like flash, flash, flash.

(9m 51s)

> We'd definitely give you an epileptic fit if you had that.

(9m 54s)

> And then you go through to the game, and it's like UI elements are bouncing around the screen, like moving a centimeter multiple times a second, basically making it unplayable.

(9m 55s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(10m 5s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(10m 7s) **Al:**

> So that was fun, but I did figure out that if you boot up the game in a lower resolution, then it works.

(10m 14s)

> Works. Great. So I was

(10m 16s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(10m 16s) **Al:**

> playing in what was 800 by 600, I think, on my steam deck. Very low resolution. But the good news is this morning they released an update that fixes the issue. So I'm back to full resolution.

(10m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh.

(10m 27s) **Codey:**

> with oooh oooh oooh is it yeah

(10m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(10m 30s) **Al:**

> Anyway, it's very interesting because there's a bunch of stuff that I talked about in the last episode about how this game works. It is no longer the case.

(10m 42s) **Kevin:**

> What? What's that for me?

(10m 44s) **Al:**

> So like for example, I talked about

(10m 46s)

> the tool wheel, right? Which I thought was good but needed more entries.

(10m 52s)

> They didn't do that. They just changed to how stargy does tools instead.

(10m 58s) **Codey:**

> Okay, yeah, it just you it only needed one more entry right for the for the skateboard

(10m 58s) **Al:**

> I'm like, okay, interesting. It's such a bizarre way of doing things, but whatever.

(11m 8s)

> I do think there is an advantage of this. So it's not quite how stargy does it.

(11m 12s)

> it's slightly different in the, in your bag, you have your bag slots and

(11m 16s)

> you have your toolbar slots. And so if you put your tools in the toolbar slot, they're not taking up space in your normal bag. I mean, that's just a technicality, right? Because the bag can still be the same size, but whatever.

(11m 27s)

> But when you're like, you, you can have their two toolbar lines so you can scroll between them. And so it means that you're, it's quite easy to make sure that you're not filling up your toolbar with things like in Stardew.

(11m 41s)

> If you just pick something up automatically, it goes into your, you know, your first, your top space.

(11m 46s)

> Whereas here it will go into your first space in the bag and only goes into the toolbar if you specifically ask it to. Right. So it means you don't like fill up your toolbar with stuff that you're never going to use like that.

(11m 57s)

> So it's interesting. I liked, I kind of liked the tool ring that they had, but I mean, this is, this is fine. It certainly makes it easier to do the seeds as well, which is good.

(12m 12s)

> The other big thing that I notice the change is the scale of

(12m 16s)

> How long crops take? So they are still based in hours, but like they seem to have like doubled how long most of them take

(12m 26s)

> So some things multiple things now do take multiple days

(12m 31s)

> Which is not the end of the world, but I was enjoying being like I'm gonna do three different harvests of wheat in one day

(12m 39s)

> So you're still you still get things much faster than in stargy, right?

(12m 43s)

> like, I just put something down and it was, it has three days.

(12m 46s)

> And that's like one of the more expensive ones, whereas in Stardew, I think turnips take three days.

(12m 52s)

> So, like, it's still much faster, but I quite liked how fast it was.

(12m 57s)

> It's interesting. I am, I think I'm generally enjoying it.

(13m 1s)

> I have probably a lot more thoughts that I'll put into a full episode on the topic, but I am enjoying it.

(13m 7s)

> I think it's possibly my, the most enjoyable I've found a 3D farming game.

(13m 13s)

> Which isn't a hot...

(13m 14s) **Kevin:**

> You heard him game of the year, 2026!

(13m 16s) **Al:**

> isn't a high bar, because I've not really enjoyed much 3D farming, but yeah, it'll be interesting to see.

(13m 22s) **Codey:**

> what would you consider Coral Island a 3D farming game?

(13m 28s) **Al:**

> No, no, no, by 3D, I don't mean the graphics. I mean like gameplay wise, right? So

(13m 29s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(13m 34s)

> Okay, got it, got it, yep.

(13m 36s) **Kevin:**

> and you rotate the camera, right?

(13m 36s) **Al:**

> you're rotating the camera and yeah, and you can like, you know, you're visibly going up hills

(13m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Like that's the question.

(13m 43s) **Al:**

> rather than like oh it's just you move left and that it takes you up.

(13m 46s)

> I have a hill sort of thing. Kevin, I have unlocked the roller skates. They are very fun. I'm enjoying them.

(13m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, the grid, yeah. Is there a secret gradient?

(13m 48s) **Codey:**

> Okay got it

(13m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Ah, how are they?

(13m 58s) **Al:**

> They're much quicker to put on than the skateboard, which is ironic. But I know they're definitely an

(13m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's okay.

(14m 8s)

> That's interesting. I don't get it either.

(14m 10s) **Codey:**

> - How?

(14m 12s)

> - What did they go faster?

(14m 14s) **Al:**

> they are faster. They're just faster to transition, right? Like if you're walking around and you want to jump on your skateboard, you press it and it takes like like the transition is slower and you're speeding up a slower.

(14m 28s)

> Whereas if you're if you've got the skateboard, you just press the button and you're like you transition at the same speed into skating.

(14m 35s) **Codey:**

> So, they're wheelies.

(14m 37s) **Al:**

> I guess so, but no, I mean visually you have put on roller skates, but they're like a...

(14m 42s) **Codey:**

> but they're mechanically, they're wheelies.

(14m 45s) **Al:**

> and mechanically they're wheelies. Yeah, I guess I guess they are.

(14m 46s) **Kevin:**

> So it's like the XY ones, basically, that's what it sounds like.

(14m 49s) **Al:**

> Why not?

(14m 52s)

> Yeah, yeah, it's fun. And you can skate into the houses.

(14m 53s) **Kevin:**

> And you do.

(14m 56s)

> Huh.

(14m 57s) **Codey:**

> In houses? Oh my gosh.

(14m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Oh.

(14m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah, you can skate into the houses through the door, smash into the house. It's great fun. I'm enjoying it.

(14m 58s) **Kevin:**

> You get, are there any tricks at all on any of these options?

(15m 9s) **Al:**

> You can jump, but it's not like it's not like, you know.

(15m 11s) **Kevin:**

> All right.

(15m 14s) **Al:**

> Tony Hawk, you're going to grind and stuff like that, but you can jump, which yeah, it's very much movement based rather than like, you know, mechanics based and and it does the jumping is is good.

(15m 16s) **Kevin:**

> I'm not doing sick kick flips off the rails.

(15m 23s)

> Yeah, I get it.

(15m 27s) **Al:**

> I would feel much worse if you didn't have the jumping because you can jump over obstacles and keep your speed up and stuff like that and you know, like I've come down a come down a mountain and jumped over a fence into someone's garden and then jumped over the other side of the fence, don't further down the hill.

(15m 42s)

> I get just, it makes trans.

(15m 44s)

> Transporting yourself around the island much quicker.

(15m 46s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm important clarifying question. Do you wear a helmet?

(15m 50s) **Al:**

> I have not paid attention. I don't think so.

(15m 52s) **Codey:**

> Oh lame boo

(15m 54s) **Al:**

> And I think that it, well, so I mean, there is much customization, so you can wear a helmet,

(15m 54s) **Kevin:**

> What kind of message are we delivering to the

(15m 56s) **Codey:**

> What are we saying?

(16m 3s) **Al:**

> if you want, but you're wearing the helmet all the time or you're never wearing.

(16m 5s) **Codey:**

> No, you should always have to wear a helmet when you're on wheels.

(16m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, also wheat doesn't grow in three hours, so

(16m 13s) **Codey:**

> See, but that, but the, the helmet though, that's so.

(16m 14s) **Al:**

> can't fall over, Cody.

(16m 20s) **Codey:**

> Kids aren't going to be going out in forest and wheat, but they will skateboard.

(16m 24s)

> If we need to model good skateboard behavior.

(16m 25s) **Kevin:**

> How long, how long is it until we get Tony Hawk cross cottage core it feels like one day we'll get here?

(16m 29s) **Al:**

> I don't know what to tell you.

(16m 37s)

> Like official Tony Hark or just generic skateboarding?

(16m 39s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, not official like skateboarding is half the mechanics

(16m 44s) **Al:**

> Twenty twenty eight.

(16m 46s) **Codey:**

> I'm gonna say never, I'm saying never.

(16m 46s) **Kevin:**

> How many? Someone will do it. So, um, whoa, let's start

(16m 47s) **Al:**

> No, not never. Come on.

(16m 55s) **Kevin:**

> in island and start saying I like may be the impetus. You never know. Um, cool. I'm glad you're enjoying it. Um, I like that, I like that game looks because I'm a weeb. I know it's nice to know it's good.

(17m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah, no, it's good. I'm enjoying it. Yeah, if you're being a

(17m 13s)

> weeb, there's there's much for you here. Let's put it that way.

(17m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(17m 17s) **Al:**

> There are there are many knees.

(17m 24s)

> Just one thing I noticed is most people's outfits do not go below the knee.

(17m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I thought you went n_i, but no, okay, you're similar to that. Yes, um,

(17m 31s) **Al:**

> There are a few, but not many of them.

(17m 35s)

> Yeah. I think.

(17m 36s)

> As in we are the night to see.

(17m 38s)

> I don't.

(17m 40s)

> I don't.

(17m 43s) **Kevin:**

> um, reconigone, yeah, yeah, forget it. All right. Oh, good touch.

(17m 44s) **Codey:**

> the different type of weeb I'm that I am that kind of weeb

(17m 45s) **Al:**

> I do.

(17m 52s)

> Well, I mean, if you were expecting a Monty Python reference, there we are.

(17m 56s)

> Moving on.

(17m 56s) **Codey:**

> just take a shot

(18m) **Al:**

> All right.

(18m) **Kevin:**

> Actually, wait, can I take the ball back. There's one more thing I, I

(18m 4s)

> remember. Um, I don't talk about, um, no, and it's not something I know, although I,

(18m 6s) **Al:**

> Is it Monty Python?

(18m 10s) **Kevin:**

> I learned about the life of Brian. I didn't actually know what it was, but I

(18m 13s) **Al:**

> You didn't know what a long life of Brian was.

(18m 13s) **Kevin:**

> have to watch it. Anyways, I did it. No, I didn't know what it was. I just, I

(18m 17s) **Al:**

> It's excellent. Do not short. Do not short to your mother.

(18m 18s) **Kevin:**

> don't know completely once. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, I would go. Yeah, but, uh, yeah,

(18m 27s)

> - I have to catch that.

(18m 27s) **Al:**

> From what I am aware of you.

(18m 29s)

> Yeah.

(18m 30s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, that is correct.

(18m 31s)

> Yes, that is correct.

(18m 33s)

> That is, maybe not an airplane movie,

(18m 35s)

(21m 22s) **Al:**

> All right. I was expecting something like horrifying that was like AI powered or

(21m 23s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, no, it's just, I know it's just genuinely cute.

(21m 26s) **Al:**

(22m 12s) **Codey:**

> Oh, woo! I'm in Aries!

(22m 15s) **Al:**

> We I'm a Virgo, I was about to say I'm a virgin because I wasn't what do you mean that tracks?

(22m 18s) **Codey:**

> Attracts. That's...

(22m 22s)

> Uh, that's not a bad thing.

(22m 22s) **Al:**

> What does that mean?

(22m 25s)

> I don't know if it is or no, I just think

(22m 26s) **Codey:**

> My husband also a Virgo.

(22m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Well there you look at that. That's hyper reason. I hear can't it cancers or the one thing that I don't get. Well, I'm with my excuse, maybe. Yeah. I don't know. I imagine it varies. Well, that too. Yeah, that's not a good one.

(22m 38s) **Codey:**

> No, I hear Pisces.

(22m 39s)

> Oh, that you don't get along.

(22m 43s) **Al:**

> I mean, I don't like cancer, just in general, you know?

(22m 47s) **Codey:**

[coughing]

(22m 48s) **Al:**

> All right, we're going to talk about some news. First stop tiny garden. I've announced that their

## Game News

## Tiny Garden

(22m 54s) **Al:**

> switch release is the 26th of February. You got one day before Pokémon Day to play that.

(22m 59s) **Codey:**

> Wooooooh. Yeah.

(23m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Reuben did you um

(23m 7s)

> Well, I just cuz it Pokemon day happens doesn't mean it's you know

(23m 13s)

> You have a few days before pakopia. That's the one right cuz announcements come out, but you have a few days to pakopia

(23m 18s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but if you, but if spoiler alert people haven't listened to y'all's green house episode,

(23m 24s)

> y'all say there's probably a game that might get shadow dropped on Pokemon day. So if that happens,

(23m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Probably more I've heard things. I will say this. I believe I may not be right,

(23m 32s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, we're, we're also talking nonsense. We have no idea what we're talking about.

(23m 42s) **Kevin:**

> but I do believe something will drop that day. But anyways, but look, going back to Tiny Guard,

(23m 49s)

> it's not on the plate. I want to crank this thing for real. That's all that matters.

(23m 54s)

> How much would it take for them to invest in a line of toys?

(23m 58s)

> It's just to have a little clench up.

(23m 59s) **Al:**

> Ah, a lawsuit, probably.

(24m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm.

(24m 3s) **Codey:**

> Are they not affiliated with Tamagatchi or not Tamagatchi? The polypocket?

(24m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Ollie pocket?

(24m 7s) **Al:**

> Probably pocket, of course they're not, of course they're not.

(24m 8s) **Kevin:**

> No.

(24m 9s)

> No.

(24m 10s) **Codey:**

> Oh, I didn't know that.

(24m 10s) **Kevin:**

> But, like, how?

(24m 11s)

> Ollie, a legal time.

(24m 14s)

> How ironclad is polypocket's patent on the onset of a pocket clamshell toy.

(24m 20s) **Codey:**

> Not gonna lie it's been so long they might be in the public domain at this point

(24m 22s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know.

(24m 28s)

> I don't know, I have to look at a few US patent law fun times because, you know, I'll be

(24m 37s)

> right with last a good one.

(24m 39s)

> I'll Mickey just hit public domain.

(24m 39s) **Al:**

> I mean, copy, yeah, copyright is like functionally infinite, if something comes out during your lifetime, you, you will not see the end of his copyright.

(24m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, 75 years, I believe actually the number Pat and so I don't know the number

(24m 52s) **Al:**

> It's, yeah, the, I don't think it's quite as simple as that. It's, it's like, I think it's something like 75 years after their death or 100 years or something weird like that.

(25m 4s) **Codey:**

> I said what I said.

(25m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Let's see U.S. 20 years, apparently. It's the term of Benton in the U.S.

(25m 9s) **Al:**

> Hmm, which would, which would make, because it was 1983 was poly pockets were patterned.

(25m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, so there's probably grounds to make it. Come on, Tony Garden Devs. I believe in you make the

(25m 21s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, the freak the game looks pretty cute. I know y'all y'all did it right?

(25m 21s) **Kevin:**

> physical one. Oh, by one of those, good idea. Yeah. Yeah. I played it. I am played it, but I was on the

(25m 32s)

> the episode with him.

(25m 33s) **Al:**

> It's fun. It's fun. It's more like a puzzle type game where you're trying to figure out how to

(25m 38s)

> get certain things in the effect, plants next to them, and there's different

(25m 45s)

> like ground that you need to put in and creating one, putting certain plants in,

(25m 50s)

> creates certain ground. It's fun. But it's definitely more puzzle than just like

(25m 56s)

> plant crops, harvest crops.

(25m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I could give it a Sean switch actually like just looking at the screenshots again

(26m 2s)

> I forgot how good it actually looks. I might do it

(26m 3s) **Al:**

> I think it's definitely worth it. I think it's how much is it on this 15. Not bad. Not bad at all.

(26m 9s) **Kevin:**

> 15 USD, I think they're saying on on switch

(26m 14s)

> Yeah, yeah, all right. I'm down for that. Yeah, it's not bad good for you, Tanny

## Disney Dreamlight Valley

(26m 19s) **Al:**

> Next we have another dude's new dream life value update. They keep coming.

(26m 24s) **Codey:**

> But it's, but it's a good one, it's Lady, it's Lady in the China.

(26m 27s) **Al:**

> It's called Poppy Love because valentines

(26m 33s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know if I actually see a lady in the chat.

(26m 33s) **Codey:**

> I love Lady in the Tramp.

(26m 40s) **Al:**

> Gaaahh! Caffa!

(26m 40s) **Kevin:**

> This might be one of my Disney blind spots.

(26m 42s) **Codey:**

> Honestly, the second one's the song from the second one a slap. So 10 out of 10 recommend at least the second one.

(26m 51s) **Al:**

> I'm sorry the second, there's a second lady in the drum.

(26m 54s) **Codey:**

> Oh, yeah, with their with their son's camp.

(26m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah, dude.

(27m) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(27m 1s) **Kevin:**

> What year did that come out?

(27m 2s)

> Hold on, let me see.

(27m 3s)

> 20, 2001, yep, that was prime directed DVD sequel.

(27m 10s) **Codey:**

> Oh, yeah, I don't think that went through anything, but I love that, um, that's equal.

(27m 15s)

> That's equal and the Lion King sequel are up there for me with matching or better than the predecessor.

(27m 16s) **Kevin:**

> yeah no there are many good business sequels okay that that flanking is really high but

(27m 28s)

> anyways uh let's see what else the Aladdin sequels are pretty good uh

(27m 32s) **Codey:**

> Oh, you're right. You're right. I did watch a Prince of Thieves recently.

(27m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Cinderella had its big sequel somehow actually note oh I want this okay

(27m 40s) **Codey:**

> No, I'm not, I, I'm not up now. I disagree.

(27m 45s)

> But yeah, this, so this is doing to be my valley free update. The puppy love update, uh, include ads, lady and tramp and it adds like the kind of like late 1800s, like fashion.

(27m 59s)

> So like parasols and somewhat poopy dresses and dapper-ness. So that's real cute.

(28m 5s) **Al:**

> somewhat poofy. Yeah, that's not really poofy at all. Come on

(28m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Bowder hats, I think that's what they're called.

(28m 10s) **Codey:**

> This isn't as quiet. This doesn't have like the butt part of the poopy dresses.

(28m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it looks like 1950s Mary Poppins thinking advanced and style clothing. Yeah, make

(28m 21s) **Codey:**

> There's also stuff that is inspired by the great mouse detective, so that like adds in a possible thing for that.

(28m 27s) **Kevin:**

> That's cool.

(28m 33s) **Codey:**

> I also love that it adds the group mode so you can move more than one thing at a time because there are sometimes when I just want to like shift everything.

(28m 40s)

> Everything a little bit if I'm like trying to move people's houses and you're right. You're right.

(28m 45s) **Al:**

> I know it's super easy to say this sort of thing, but like mad that I took them this long to do that.

(28m 51s)

> This is, this is, this is, this is a live service game that has been going for years

(28m 52s) **Kevin:**

> - Okay.

(28m 54s)

> - Yeah, yeah.

(28m 57s) **Al:**

> and is about designing your perfect town and they didn't allow you to move multiple items at once.

(29m 3s) **Codey:**

> Oh, yeah!

(29m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(29m 4s) **Al:**

> Until 20, 20, 20, six. When did this first come out? 21, I think?

(29m 8s) **Codey:**

> Oh, I don't know.

(29m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Probably that that's that's a long time. You're right

(29m 14s) **Codey:**

> And then they have a St. Patrick's Day episode,

(29m 17s)

> or sorry, event coming up March 11th to the March 17th,

(29m 20s)

> and then an Easter event from April 1st to 21st.

(29m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Wait, are there any Irish Disney puppies or characters?

(29m 28s) **Codey:**

> No, I think it, dear, there's just going to be care,

(29m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I guess, it's a bigger issue.

(29m 31s) **Codey:**

> at clovers so that you can

(29m 33s)

> clover themed furniture. Yeah, I don't know.

(29m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(29m 36s)

> Okay.

(29m 38s)

> They're not gonna count the Disney channel original movie.

(29m 41s)

> Fuck with the Irish. I like that one.

(29m 43s)

[laughter]

(29m 46s)

> If you totally get it, I was big fan of those de-cons.

(29m 48s) **Codey:**

> Out, out, out, out. Was that a hockey one? Basketball.

(29m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(29m 52s)

> Oh.

(29m 55s)

> No, that was basketball.

(29m 58s)

> Like, I'm sure they did every sport,

(30m)

> but that was a basketball and he has to...

(30m 1s) **Codey:**

> I think the biggest hockey one

(30m 3s)

> was H.E. double hockey sticks.

(30m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(30m 6s)

> Oh, that way I went a great name.

(30m 8s)

> Oh, and like play.

(30m 9s) **Codey:**

> What a what a time to be alive.

(30m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Good stuff.

(30m 11s)

[laughter]

(30m 12s)

> The '90s, baby.

(30m 14s) **Al:**

> So I, I googled Irish Disney characters and one of them on the list is Daredevil and I'm like that's not really what I'm going for

(30m 14s) **Kevin:**

> All right, uh...

(30m 20s)

[groans]

(30m 22s) **Codey:**

> yeah well that's the that's Disney dream I really I'll be playing it again

(30m 23s) **Al:**

> On two on two accounts there

(30m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Mm.

(30m 35s) **Al:**

> Nice. Next, we have Dollock Town have announced their third major update. Harvest Fusion is out now.

(30m 44s)

> And this adds in a gene system for your, I think it's for crops. Yes.

(30m 53s) **Kevin:**

> that you know what that's oh actually let me look at what this looks like but I like this

(30m 59s)

> on concept like certain jeans

(31m) **Al:**

> Look, the more we talk about this game, the more I'm like, "Really?"

(31m 6s) **Kevin:**

> yeah I feel bad because I forget about this game all I remember is that it sounds like

(31m 12s)

> do walk and trick but um uh but uh yeah I look at the game every time I see the game well yeah this

(31m 14s) **Codey:**

> Yep, same.

(31m 19s) **Kevin:**

> This isn't bad actually, that's like that art style, I'm genetic.

(31m 23s)

> I mean, we haven't really seen that, nobody's done that like affecting the genes for certain properties or whatever.

(31m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah, we've had it, we've had it for animals, but I'm not aware of it happening for crops.

(31m 30s) **Kevin:**

> That's a cool idea.

(31m 34s) **Al:**

> There's been like crossbreeding and stuff, but that's quite limited.

(31m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(31m 38s) **Al:**

> This is like actual gene editing feels much more complicated.

(31m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(31m 43s)

> Yeah, I'm interested.

(31m 45s)

> This might be the one to get that pushed me over to.

(31m 49s)

> - And don't, don't lock to, it's a perfect place after us.

(31m 53s)

> - Yeah, yeah, I'm done.

(32m 26s)

> We also have two new games to talk about. First up, we have farm to table, a farming

(32m 30s) **Codey:**

> Oh, okay.

(32m 32s)

> I thought, well, I thought it was a record store.

(32m 35s)

> I heard records and I was like, oh.

(32m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Let me see.

## New Games

## Farm To Table

> and restaurant management sim where you build your own restaurant from scratch and grow

(32m 54s)

(32m 56s)

> Grow your organic business into a five star restaurant.

(33m 1s) **Codey:**

> Okay, it looks, it looks okay.

(33m 1s) **Kevin:**

> of it's okay so here's the thing this I love this concept I don't this

(33m 9s)

> particular execution I'm kind of lukewarm on because it's 3D it's the first

(33m 13s)

> person I'm here you're building up like the buildings like they just spring up

(33m 19s)

> walls and stuff the cows are very bouncy they show like a pen of animals and

(33m 24s)

> they're just all kind of bouncing non-stop I know I do like that no that's a good

(33m 26s) **Codey:**

> You don't like bouncy cows.

(33m 29s) **Kevin:**

> But I'm just kind of saying things as

(33m 32s)

> I don't know. I think it's the first person thing that throws me off

(33m 35s)

> But I like the idea and we get over cooked but also farming in there. That's what this should be

(33m 43s) **Codey:**

> Oh like the same amount of like franticness. Yeah. I don't know if that's what they're going for.

(33m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's what I want but

(33m 53s)

> No, that's what it should we should go for

(33m 58s)

> But anyways, yeah this one's alright.

(34m 1s)

> Aside from the bouncy animals, nothing's sticking out to me, they're really bouncy.

(34m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I'm, I'm kind of enjoying the graphics. I'm not a huge fan of first person in general.

(34m 12s)

> It almost feels like I'm watching this and thinking this feels like it's designed for VR.

(34m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Does spiel be a very VR. I agree. That's a good one.

(34m 24s) **Al:**

> I'm not seeing any listing of that, but it, I feel like it must be a consideration,

(34m 30s)

> like not just because it's first person, right? Because plenty of first person,

(34m 33s)

> person games aren't. But just everything.

(34m 36s)

> It feels the R. S.

(34m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, like when you're booking, you're like kind of see the utensils moving in a way that feels VRS. It's like, you know, lifting it.

(34m 45s)

> Yeah, and the way you build stuff, I agree.

(34m 49s) **Al:**

> That is scheduled to release in Q2 this year, and next we have bitter harvest.

## Bitter Harvest

(34m 57s) **Al:**

> Cast out of your rightful farm, you'll scrape, scheme, and rebuild your way to power in this short, satirical farming sim about ambition and payback.

(35m 7s) **Codey:**

> I was going to say it's not ambition, it's revenge.

(35m 10s) **Al:**

> Both, your ambition for revenge. Come on.

(35m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah,

(35m 15s) **Codey:**

> Wait, wait, do you, do you get to break someone up in this?

(35m 15s) **Al:**

> So... I...

(35m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Oh,

(35m 19s) **Al:**

> I mean, it sounds more like murder than...

(35m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Possibly, but yeah, I was about to say, but not not that the the board's like,

(35m 23s) **Codey:**

> No.

(35m 26s) **Kevin:**

> I'm afraid with a relationship, unless you count them, one of them being dead, then maybe.

(35m 30s) **Al:**

> Well, no, right. So that at actual soul, I found another bit that might give us a clue so bitter harvest is a 2d farming simulation about ambition, reinvention, and quiet revenge Aaron money through crafting farming and odd jobs as you climb from the bottom of the social ladder build relationships with the town folks uncover their secrets and decide how far you're willing to go to take back what was stolen. I mean, I feel like. I.

(35m 53s) **Codey:**

> Break up a marriage!

(35m 56s)

> Uncover the secrets of the townspeople, one of them's unfaithful!

(36m) **Al:**

> I feel like there needs to be something big at least like that, right? Because otherwise it's just like, Oh, no. What they stole a fiber. Like, I don't really know what we're expecting here. Like, I feel like there need to be some proper big scandals that you can uncover and decide what you're going to do.

(36m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, sure. I mean, your blackmailing would look earlier. You know, hold the mayor with like some sort

(36m 24s)

> of unsaved, black male scheme or something. You're getting a cut of something and also cyaniding some

(36m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, for sure.

(36m 30s) **Kevin:**

> livestock. So, you know, this could be the one.

(36m 31s) **Codey:**

> This could be it, how this could be here.

(36m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, I've added it to my wish list, especially I was in when they said short.

(36m 40s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, that's that's valid.

(36m 41s) **Kevin:**

> sure. Okay and you know what's really funny me the art style because there's

(36m 47s)

> one of those games where they're like box art cover images while they differ

(36m 51s)

> from the the visuals and what's funny is they're both different and they're both

(36m 52s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah.

(36m 56s) **Kevin:**

> totally dissonant from the the chaotic themes going on because the visuals are

(37m 2s)

> just you know like a standard 2D Stardew-like QT pixel game and the image is this

(37m 8s)

> is like very serene.

(37m 11s)

> I'm almost painting image of just a guy farming and someone standing in the back there, so it's really funny because you cannot sell their cyanide in any of this.

(37m 18s) **Al:**

> I mean, yeah, but I think about what you know about the context here, and that is your character

(37m 27s)

> holding trash bags in the foreground, watching the farmer who presumably was the one that

(37m 35s) **Codey:**

> Stall your land, like you're not the one in the, in the farm, who is in the trash

(37m 35s) **Al:**

> cast you out of your farm. Like, there's a very sinister undertone to that now.

(37m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

(37m 44s) **Al:**

> Who's in the trash bags? Sorry, what's in the trash bag?

(37m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's correct.

(37m 49s) **Al:**

> Look, I really want to be able to merge or someone now, right? Like it makes me want to merge or someone

(37m 49s) **Kevin:**

> No, that's the question.

(37m 55s)

> We measured title this week.

(37m 55s) **Codey:**

> There you go.

(37m 56s)

> You heard it here for us kids.

(38m 1s) **Kevin:**

> But yeah, I look, I think there's at least a 50% chance

(38m 6s)

> of you getting to do with that.

(38m 8s)

> There are a few steps from where we are.

(38m 9s) **Al:**

> I really hope so.

(38m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Well, we already have access to signing somewhere.

(38m 15s) **Codey:**

> Well, so when you're farming and a lot of the pesticides that you might spray could kill someone,

(38m 24s)

> a lot of the antibiotics that you would give your animals could really harm someone.

(38m 31s)

> So there's a lot of access to dangerous materials in fairly innocent things in your life.

(38m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Don't take the horse tranquilizer does not cure the COVID,

(38m 44s)

> guys.

(38m 45s)

> Sorry.

(38m 45s) **Al:**

> What about their black market peptides from China?

(38m 46s) **Codey:**

> No, does not.

(38m 50s) **Kevin:**

> You also have farm tools.

(38m 52s)

> Oh, bitter harvest, indeed.

(38m 56s) **Codey:**

> We were the bitter harvest all along.

(38m 59s) **Kevin:**

> He too of this year, and all along.

(39m 3s) **Al:**

> Okay, that's the news.

(39m 3s) **Codey:**

> Oh... a woo!

## Fantasy Draft

(39m 9s) **Al:**

> So we are going to do our cottage core slash farming game fantasy draft for the year.

## Rules

(39m 19s) **Al:**

> So just to summarize how this works, we will by the end of it, we will all of chosen five games.

(39m 27s)

> They have to be unique to us. We can't like all have the same game.

(39m 33s)

> It's a snake draft, which means that the you start off with, I will roll a dice and we'll

(39m 40s)

> decide who goes first, who goes second, who goes last, and it starts off with the first person,

(39m 45s)

> they choose one game, second person chooses a game, and then the third person chooses two games

(39m 50s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(39m 50s) **Al:**

> before it then goes back to the second person, and then the first person chooses two games,

(39m 54s)

> goes back to the second person. So it's like a snake, you're going up and down, and so instead of

(40m) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I see, I see, cool.

(40m 1s) **Al:**

> going, instead of going 1-2.

(40m 3s)

> 3-1-2-3-2-1-1-2-3.

(40m 6s) **Kevin:**

> B-2-1, whoa, I never heard that, that's cool, I like that.

(40m 8s) **Al:**

> So, we cannot choose any games that are already out, except we need to have a conversation

(40m 17s)

> about Star Sand Island, has anybody looked at either the Metacurtrix critics page or any

(40m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Nope, I have not other than your no

(40m 25s) **Al:**

> reviews for Star Sand Island?

(40m 28s) **Codey:**

> Nope. Other than what you've said.

(40m 28s) **Al:**

> Okay, I have also not the reason the reason why we're

(40m 33s)

> saying this a listeners is because we were meant to do this a week ago.

(40m 36s)

> Sarsa and Ireland came out between the when we were meant to record and when we're actually recording.

(40m 41s)

> So I think we all agreed we would try and avoid that.

(40m 45s)

> And so it sounds like we were all successful and therefore we have no

(40m 48s)

> information about how critically this is going.

(40m 52s) **Codey:**

> mm-hmm I think I also said that I wasn't going to choose it so it's fine

(40m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

(40m 52s) **Al:**

> Kevin yeah okay so that's a whole different point.

(41m 3s)

> Okay so it is it is the only currently released game that is within the list of games that we can choose.

(41m 10s)

> So like no choosing stardew, no choosing what else is coming what's what's come out this year.

(41m 15s)

> What else has come out this life's well so yeah so I I was thinking of this so we have to discuss the early access stuff.

(41m 17s) **Codey:**

> Well, some of the stuff that's on this list is we're talking about 1.0, so it could have like

(41m 28s) **Al:**

> I think that if it is out in early access, we can't choose either because

(41m 33s) **Codey:**

> OK, I need to assess my list.

(41m 33s) **Al:**

> it will already have a Metacritic score and it will already have reviews.

(41m 38s) **Codey:**

> I will, but I didn't look at the Nanocritic score.

(41m 40s) **Al:**

> I know but do we choose what score do we choose and the point is it needs to be a

(41m 45s)

> game that comes out this year right and so what is coming out and at what point do

(41m 51s)

> we choose the score we have to choose at the end of the year but then I just I

(41m 57s)

> don't know I mean do you two feel strongly about it I mean in that case it

(42m 1s)

> need to be if we were to let

(42m 3s)

> But when allowing early access games, the 1.0 would need to come out this year, which means

(42m 7s)

> that the tag on Steam changes from early access to not early access.

(42m 12s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(42m 12s) **Al:**

> And it would need to be the Metacritic score at the same time as all the other ones.

(42m 16s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(42m 17s) **Al:**

> And...

(42m 18s)

> Ahhh.

(42m 19s) **Codey:**

> So and then the other

(42m 21s)

> Thing about it, so I'm just going through and seeing if any of mine are actually on the ones that it's so that are already out

(42m 30s)

> What was I gonna say I don't remember Kevin. How do you feel about that?

(42m 35s) **Kevin:**

> That's tricky one cuz we like even if we ignore them the meta credit like people have an idea what it's like

(42m 43s)

> No, not saying the three of us have an idea what a game is like, but

(42m 48s)

> There's familiar

(42m 50s)

> Erity bias, but I guess you can just factor that into what you think or what the 1.0

(42m 57s) **Al:**

> I think this is I think that's my problem with it, right? Like say, let's take fields of mystery

(43m 1s)

> or for example. We all, even if we've not looked to Metacritic, we all know that it's going down

(43m 7s)

> well with people, right? Like we know that the early access is popular. People like it. And so

(43m 9s) **Kevin:**

> It is, yup.

(43m 12s) **Al:**

> that is an easy one to be like, Oh, I'm pretty sure. And that's going to come out this year. That's

(43m 16s)

> going to get me a high score. And I, I, it, that is why I want it to be only games that haven't

(43m 23s)

> come out at all yet, excluding demos because like demos.

(43m 27s)

> because otherwise that you shouldn't be able to factor in the game as

(43m 35s)

> already out and people like it. Does that make sense?

(43m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, yeah, okay. So are we going for like highest cumulative

(43m 44s)

> Metacritic score kind or average? Okay. Yes

(43m 45s) **Al:**

> Yes, so the scoring will happen on a specific date sometime early next year, probably, and I suspect that we're probably, I think we should say we take the Metacritic scores on the first of January, and I'm happy to just make sure that I write everything down and, you know, get screenshots so I can prove all that blah blah blah.

(43m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Sure.

(44m 1s)

> Okay.

(44m 3s)

> Okay. Okay.

(44m 3s) **Al:**

> And it will be the winner will be the person with the total highest total score.

(44m 4s) **Codey:**

> All right, yeah, I trust you.

(44m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. All right, that makes it easy. Okay. Well, then see then. Yeah. Yeah, cuz like that makes it cuz yeah, fields of mystery is a great one, right?

(44m 17s)

> cuz that's easy pickings. Um cuz we know it's popular and it's doing well. I'm so with it, it's one point

(44m 25s)

> Oh, just you know, been I'd be doing well probably more well than other games on this list because people are already familiar with it and

(44m 33s)

> Yeah, so I'm I'm I'm very on the fence about the

(44m 37s)

> Metacritic

(44m 37s) **Codey:**

> Okay, we can just do it. I checked, I only had, I actually only had fields of mystery on my list. So

(44m 42s) **Kevin:**

> And I well

(44m 44s) **Codey:**

> all of the other, all of the other ones that are on my list are do not have a 1.0 right,

(44m 49s)

> or sorry, are not in early access right now. So that was the only one that would have been an issue.

(44m 54s) **Al:**

> Okay. And the ones on the list on notion, they say 1.0 TBA if they are in early access.

(45m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(45m 3s) **Codey:**

> Yes, and so and that was that was just the fields of mystery.

(45m 7s) **Al:**

> Okay. Cool. All right. So we'll just do all the games that aren't out yet. We're ignoring demos,

(45m 12s)

> because who wants to do the effort of looking into whether the demo is for a game?

(45m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Demos different

(45m 17s) **Al:**

> And yeah, but it means that you have to you have to assume like how good is this actually going to be?

(45m 24s)

> and therefore, how are people going to take it, etc.? No, go for it. If you got questions, no, no, go for it.

(45m 28s) **Codey:**

> Okay. What if people look like to go for it?

(45m 31s)

> You're probably going to answer the question I'm asking.

(45m 34s)

> What if the game does not come out? What happens?

(45m 38s)

> And then what if they decide to do it in early access instead of 1.0? It's still still a zero or do

(45m 45s) **Al:**

> No, because if it's early access, then it's then it's out right like so if we're if we're not allowing you to choose games are in early access already then we're defining early access as release

(45m 46s) **Codey:**

> or it can be.

(45m 56s)

> Okay sounds good sounds good

(45m 56s) **Al:**

> Right, so you get them at whatever Metacritic score they have

(46m)

> The other thing to bear in mind. So so this is obviously Metacritic scores. Metacritic takes critic review scores and

(46m 8s)

> It tries to get one number out of that so they do stuff to the bunch of reviews

(46m 15s)

> And they I don't know whatever the point is we are farming this out to Metacritic who take in reviews and

(46m 22s)

> Givers are number and so we will just use the critic number that Metacritic give us for example

(46m 28s)

> Stardew Valley has a Metacritic score of 89. These are all out of a hundred

(46m 32s)

> Sugardew Island on the other hand has a score of 55 which I think is way too high for that game

(46m 38s)

> Tamagotchi Plaza has a score of 43 and just to clarify these are the the Metas score

(46m 45s)

> Because user scores are about users individually scoring them the Metas score is about critic reviews, which is what we're using for them and

(46m 51s) **Codey:**

> Right right

(46m 54s) **Al:**

> Animal Crossing new horizons has 90 it is possible for games not to have a Metacritic score

(46m 56s) **Codey:**

> Okay

(47m)

> When does that happen?

(47m) **Al:**

> If the if they have fewer than four critic reviews

(47m 4s)

> They do not get a score and we will be doing this

(47m 8s)

> So obviously when a game right comes out

(47m 11s)

> they will not have a score initially some will get it very quickly some

(47m 15s)

> will take ages to get it and some will never get it because they just don't have enough people doing that, right? So that's something you need to bear in mind as well. If on the first of January when I look up the games, if they have a TBD, they get that's a zero. Any other questions?

(47m 30s) **Codey:**

> Okay. For good.

(47m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Ah, yes. Um, no, no, no, no, I just answered my question. No, man. Okay.

(47m 38s) **Al:**

> So to decide the order, I have a dice app on my phone, which I tested before this call and the others could hear it.

(47m 51s)

> So I have a d6 because it doesn't have a d3. I have a d6 with each of our names on it twice.

(47m 52s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(47m 58s) **Al:**

> And I will roll the dice.

(48m 2s)

> The first name that appears will be going first.

(48m 5s)

> The second name will be going second and the name

(48m 8s)

> does not happen will be going 3rd so that was Cody Cody is first

(48m 11s) **Codey:**

> - Okay.

(48m 13s) **Al:**

> and I'll was the second one so Cody will be going first I will be going second

(48m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, dang it, hahaha

(48m 15s) **Codey:**

> - Okay.

(48m 16s)

> - Oh, dang.

(48m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Ah

(48m 21s) **Codey:**

> - Okay.

(48m 22s) **Al:**

> Kevin will be going 3rd

(48m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I said to do my, I'm the person to do a double, okay, let me do it

(48m 24s) **Codey:**

> - Okay.

## Draft

(48m 27s) **Al:**

> Cody what is your first game?

(48m 30s) **Codey:**

> - Bookopia.

(48m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Right, it's not fair

(48m 34s) **Al:**

> All right.

(48m 37s) **Kevin:**

> We already lost out

(48m 38s) **Codey:**

> Do I have to explain why?

(48m 41s)

> No, no, that's, I mean, I think we, I think we know why.

(48m 41s) **Al:**

> I mean, we can talk about it if you want, but I think just Kevin is very upset with you.

(48m 49s) **Kevin:**

> I'm going to ensure that Cody wins, but just on that alone.

(48m 55s) **Al:**

> Okay, uh, I will, I think I will choose Star Sand Island.

(48m 56s) **Codey:**

> Okay. Oh, wow. Reasons.

(49m 6s) **Al:**

> I think it is good, and I think people will like it.

(49m 12s)

> You know, it feels quite as, quite as, like, I think it's one of those.

(49m 18s)

> I think it could go either way, right? It could either be like, this is a great game, and people really like it, or it feels like people just go, oh, it's just another, you know,

(49m 28s)

> churned out farming game. And, you know, it could go either way, but I think I'm leaning towards, I think people will actually like this game.

(49m 38s)

> It looks quite generic, but I think eventually it.

(49m 41s)

> You know, it's coming out early enough in the year that I think there's enough time to for words of most to get out and people to actually start liking the game and then critics actually go, "Oh, maybe I should do a review on this." And then I think they will I think it will do well.

(49m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I think the challenge here is getting the word out right because I think people are playing and are enjoying it

(50m 1s)

> So that's that's a kicker right if you just get enough people eyeballs on it

(50m 5s)

> You'll get that score but it'll be high in that group. Yeah

(50m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and I think that the announced a few weeks ago that they were doing like a crossover with my time at games, and I think that will help with their word of mouth quite well.

(50m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, well. Okay. All right. You know what? Um, both of these. I'm all right. You know,

(50m 21s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(50m 21s) **Al:**

> Alright, Kevin, your first game.

(50m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I'm already going high stakes because I'm actually going both my first two are going to be

(50m 34s)

> to our both on the TVA list. Actually, you're not confirmed for this year. So, so I'm going for

(50m 37s) **Al:**

> Oh, okay. Okay, go for it. Go for it. Oh, I think I know what you're gonna do.

(50m 40s) **Kevin:**

> the first one. No, I'm not doing. We don't know what I'm doing.

(50m 43s) **Codey:**

> Don't do it don't do it don't do it

(50m 48s) **Kevin:**

> thinking, but no, I'm not actually going with that one. I'm going with a real wild card. Um, and that is

(50m 50s) **Al:**

> I actually knew you were gonna say, I knew you were gonna say that. I wasn't thinking

(50m 52s) **Codey:**

> Okay

(50m 54s) **Kevin:**

> powerful. Um, oh, oh, I thought you I thought everyone was just assuming I was going to say wild

(50m 58s) **Al:**

> on to chocolate here, I was thinking Balfaum. Nope. No, no, no, I wasn't even thinking that.

(51m 4s) **Kevin:**

> society, but um, okay. All right. Well, you know me well. Oh, that our month of podcasting nonstop

(51m 7s) **Al:**

> No, I was thinking Balfaum, I saw it and I was like, he's gonna go for it.

(51m 13s) **Kevin:**

> as you were synced. (laughs)

(51m 14s) **Codey:**

> You guys are on a, on a, you, you understand each other.

(51m 18s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(51m 19s) **Kevin:**

> We'll finish each others.

(51m 20s) **Al:**

> Time which is...

(51m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, finish it, the sentence.

(51m 22s) **Codey:**

> Sandwiches.

(51m 23s) **Kevin:**

> There you go. (laughs)

(51m 25s)

> I'll finish, I'll send it just.

(51m 27s)

> Okay, but anyways, power farm.

(51m 29s)

> So here's the thing.

(51m 31s)

> Power world for all the nonsense and questionable things involved.

(51m 36s)

> The game itself technically was competent.

(51m 39s)

> I have faith that our farm will come out similarly.

(51m 43s)

> Again, they're clearly ripping off a lot,

(51m 45s)

> but is the world of the game be fun?

(51m 48s)

> I think.

(51m 49s)

> And obviously it's gotten enough, you know,

(51m 52s)

> then it's got brand recognition of some kind.

(51m 55s)

> Everyone knows power world for better or for worse, how do you feel?

(51m 58s) **Al:**

> So, it will be interesting to see.

(51m 59s) **Kevin:**

> So I think it's hot people's attention.

(52m 2s)

> I think it's gonna get up there.

(52m 4s) **Al:**

> Do you know the interesting thing is, they don't have a metacritic score for Power World.

(52m 6s) **Kevin:**

> What?

(52m 10s)

> Really?

(52m 10s) **Codey:**

> Ooooooohhhh!

(52m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Well, I mean, it's weird.

(52m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(52m 13s)

> Which is surprising?

(52m 15s) **Kevin:**

> That's very weird.

(52m 16s) **Al:**

> I don't understand why.

(52m 18s)

> They have a bunch of critic reviews, but none of them seem to have scores.

(52m 22s) **Kevin:**

> That's strange. Well, okay

(52m 24s) **Al:**

> That is weird.

(52m 25s)

> I wonder if it's like a bug specific to this one page?

(52m 28s)

> Or something and it's not it's not it's not it's not early access thing because plenty of early access games. I'm pretty sure have

(52m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm what well, I mean

(52m 35s)

> Do they

(52m 36s) **Codey:**

> Hmm. Field's a nice route.

(52m 37s) **Al:**

> Give me a give me a game as an early access just now a big one

(52m 41s) **Kevin:**

> There you go bigger one

(52m 42s) **Al:**

> Well, and I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure fields of mystery a dozen but oh it does say

(52m 49s)

> TBA

(52m 51s)

> Early access so maybe it is maybe you don't get a metric or score when you're in early access

(52m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Well, brought myself in the put, 'cause I believe the game would come out, but not out of early access.

(52m 57s) **Codey:**

> Yikes.

(52m 58s)

> Yikes.

(53m 3s) **Al:**

> Okay, I mean, so, okay, so I guess we need to change our rule then and just go well. It's gonna be

(53m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(53m 10s) **Al:**

> Like guess you yeah, I guess you can have our games are in LA access. So Kevin, I'm gonna let you change if you want to change

(53m 18s) **Kevin:**

> all right well dang my second one is also well okay okay all right you know what I will change it

(53m 24s)

> i'm gonna wipe that one because yeah all right i'm gonna be having a second one

(53m 26s) **Al:**

> Okay

(53m 27s) **Codey:**

> Okay, so wait, so the update you're saying is we can, yes.

(53m 29s) **Al:**

> So we're changing the rules we're changing the rules you can choose games

(53m 33s)

> There are in early access and are not in 1.0 yet because I feel I feel like we have to have one or the other, right?

(53m 36s) **Kevin:**

> go to 1.0. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That invalidates the thing. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well,

(53m 40s) **Al:**

> And I think if they if they don't have a score then I guess that's something

(53m 49s) **Kevin:**

> you know, I'm changing the fields of mystery. I probably already stole Pupopia. I'm not just

(53m 51s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(53m 54s) **Kevin:**

> not in it. Just swiping it right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. So

(53m 54s) **Al:**

> - Well, I mean, fair dies a great choice

(53m 58s)

> that is, I think, gonna do very well.

(54m 3s)

> I, in fact, I would go so far as to say,

(54m 6s)

> excluding, I think that's the GTA 6 of farming games

(54m 10s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(54m 10s) **Al:**

> in terms of like, you know it's gonna have a good high score

(54m 12s) **Kevin:**

> No, yeah, I'd say haunted chocolate tears are GTA 6, but anyways, but yes, yeah, you get your interest. It's in the same vein

(54m 13s) **Al:**

> 'cause people like it,

(54m 14s)

> but who knows if it's actually gonna happen this year.

(54m 15s) **Codey:**

> When is it gonna come out? Yeah

(54m 17s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(54m 22s)

> No, because there's no one even,

(54m 25s)

> no one's even trying to pretend that's coming out this year.

(54m 27s)

[laughing]

(54m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Well, some would say GTA 6 isn't the same boat

(54m 31s) **Al:**

> No, they're definitely pretending that.

(54m 33s) **Codey:**

> They're pretending.

(54m 33s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(54m 34s) **Kevin:**

> That's true, um, that's true. Okay, all right, okay, you know what I'm still gonna be bold

(54m 36s) **Al:**

> All right, what's your second one then?

(54m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Also TVA, but if I'm if it does come out, it's not I don't think it'll be early access and that is a key planet

(54m 50s)

> um

(54m 51s)

> That is the hover's animal crossing type game

(54m 56s)

> Um, the hover's is big enough that they're

(55m)

> They've done enough games like I know their consistency and if that gate the question is does the game come out this year?

(55m 5s)

> I do believe they will

(55m 8s)

> As of yet they haven't had any like huge delays on any other game.

(55m 12s)

> They run a tight ship production-wise so I believe it will come out and it's a

(55m 19s)

> hoyover scheme their games are polished enough. I think it will do well. So there you go.

(55m 24s)

> Fields of Mystery and Petite Planet. Those are my two. Yeah and I mean it's a huge like

(55m 31s)

> already player base right of people playing hoyover so I think that anyways that's me.

(55m 36s) **Al:**

> Yep. Nope. I think that's a good, good option as well. Um, I need to decide whether I'm keeping

(55m 41s)

> Star Sand Island. Cause of course that's an early access. Uh, well, yeah, obviously.

(55m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm.

(55m 45s) **Codey:**

> I'm keeping, I'm keeping Jacobia.

(55m 47s) **Kevin:**

> That's, that's, that's a yeah. You, yeah, cuz you win.

(55m 51s) **Al:**

> I think I, I think I will keep Star Sand Island because I feel like if there's any game that might

(55m 57s)

> release an, it like, it's come out so early in the year that I, and I feel, so they say on

(56m 3s)

> steam that expecting it to be an early access for us.

(56m 6s)

> And obviously it's not going to be in 1.0 in 4 months, but could it be by the end of the year based on what they're saying, I feel like it could, and also it feels quite like they're just like they're going to have a couple of months I think of making, adding all the things that people expected there to be, right, and then adding, and then a few months of adding in all the content they want, it doesn't feel like it's a super early access game in my experience.

(56m 7s) **Codey:**

> Oh, that's not, yeah.

(56m 36s) **Al:**

> It might happen, we'll see, so I'm going to keep it, I'm going to keep it.

(56m 37s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(56m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Well, hey, gotta risk it for the biscuits sometimes.

(56m 43s) **Al:**

> Absolutely, absolutely. Okay, so I need to decide on my second one then. I am going to go with Tomodatche life.

(56m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's a good one. Yeah, that's going to crush it. Oh, it will.

(56m 56s) **Al:**

> Maybe we'll see. Cody, you're second and third, please.

(57m) **Codey:**

> my second is haunted chocolate tier. I'm gonna go big and go home.

(57m 3s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(57m 6s)

> Oh my word, Cody! Oh, I can't believe you've wasted the Pocopia score by going with something that's gonna give you zero, my word.

(57m 7s) **Kevin:**

> That's, that's the game full.

(57m 10s) **Codey:**

> Dude, if I,

(57m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Well, that's it's a safety net. Gee, can afford it

(57m 16s) **Codey:**

> what, but if it, but if it comes,

(57m 20s)

> exactly I can afford it. Y'all are gonna have mid scores and I'm gonna have at least one big one.

(57m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(57m 25s) **Al:**

> I don't know about that.

(57m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, she's right

(57m 28s) **Al:**

> Like, I suspect that hunter geography

(57m 30s)

> might have the problem that it's not stargy.

(57m 34s) **Codey:**

> I think he'll have enough.

(57m 34s) **Al:**

> And people won't like it as much because of that.

(57m 35s) **Kevin:**

> the question, that's the thing. That's the one. That's the gamble. Yeah, I'm not questioning

(57m 37s) **Codey:**

> It'll be fine.

(57m 38s) **Al:**

> It's also not coming out this year.

(57m 40s) **Codey:**

> Well, you well, that's, that's a,

(57m 43s)

> you don't know that, you don't know that, it's cool.

(57m 47s) **Kevin:**

> the quality. The score once it exists, but be when that's the gamble. And, but I believe

(57m 50s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(57m 52s)

> Yeah.

(57m 53s)

> So I'm gonna, I'm gonna risk it for the biscuit for that.

(57m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Cody can afford it.

(57m 56s) **Codey:**

> And then my second one will be my time at Evershine.

(58m 1s) **Al:**

> Ooh, okay, okay.

(58m 4s) **Codey:**

> My time game, it's an active dev team.

(58m 7s)

> They already have a controller update, like,

(58m 11s)

> said that they're going, that that's gonna be part of it.

(58m 15s)

> There's also possibility that it gets pushed back.

(58m 17s)

> So, (laughs)

(58m 22s) **Al:**

> interesting. Yeah, just to give you some context, my time at Porsche got 73 and my time at

(58m 28s)

> Sandrock got 80. So not bad, not bad at all. So yeah, we interesting to see because I don't

(58m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Dang, it was a good one.

(58m 35s) **Al:**

> think they're doing an early access. But and originally they were planning to release this year,

(58m 42s)

> spring this year. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. We'll see. We'll see. Okay. So my third one. Oh, goodness.

(58m 52s)

> The problem is with all that with the rule change that like that's just mucking up my brain.

(58m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Let's see, we got, we got, we're, yeah, yep, we're all changing it on the fly.

(59m) **Al:**

> I am going to choose which brick, which brick is my number three. I think 2D pixel art games always do well.

(59m 8s)

> I think which games can do well. I think this one has enough buzz behind it that it won't just

(59m 16s)

> be snapped up as our just another release sort of.

(59m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I think the risk and that one and there's a lot of games on sale on this list that I think had the risk. I think what if it just drops his early access like that's the kicker, but

(59m 27s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't think which brick is going to. I don't think which brick is going to. It strikes me as our 1.0.

(59m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, all right

(59m 36s)

> Yeah, okay. That's fair. I was I was considering it for but I was unsure about the early access thing. So

(59m 43s)

> Um, okay fair enough. Oh, that's yes. That's just on contender to I'd say. I think the game will be quality just

(59m 51s)

> Okay, uh, is it my turn again then?

(59m 55s) **Al:**

> Yes, this will be your third and fourth.

(59m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, gosh. Um, oh, it's hot. I'll only pick two. So we're gonna finish up before I was that right?

(1h 5s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. I'll do you want to pick two this time?

(1h 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I just go pick go and pick two. Let's let's mix it up a little just

(1h 10s) **Al:**

> No, we're doing it the way it goes because you do your third and fourth and then I do my fourth

(1h 13s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, all right, okay

(1h 16s) **Al:**

> Then Cody does their fourth and fifth and then no, I've done my third adjusted my third

(1h 17s) **Codey:**

> No, then you do your third

(1h 21s)

> Oh, okay

(1h 21s) **Kevin:**

> Then okay, whatever. Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay. Um, all right

(1h 22s) **Al:**

> But I'm literally writing it down in the show notes if you want to have a look at what we are

(1h 25s) **Codey:**

> Okay, okay, I was thinking to say if I was like this isn't there

(1h 31s) **Al:**

> Nope, it is perfect. It's exactly fair. That's why we're doing it

(1h 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay, I missed one. I thought you were two nevermind it. Okay. Um,

(1h 37s) **Al:**

> No, I've got Starstand Island Tomadaccia Life in Witchbrick, three games.

(1h 38s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(1h 40s)

> All right, um, oh, this may be this is a little risky because

(1h 46s) **Al:**

> We love a risk sometimes.

(1h 48s) **Codey:**

> Where I'm all, I'm risking so much over here.

(1h 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 52s)

> Uh, okay, right me down for go-go town

(1h 56s)

> Um, because yeah, because like obviously I don't have any doubt about the quality. The question will that game ever leave early access

(1h 1m 5s) **Al:**

> I think it's, I think that's a pretty safe bet, personally.

(1h 1m 8s)

> I think it's, I think it's happening because they, the, they announced last

(1h 1m 13s)

> week that they were 1.0 and switch release were coming Q2.

(1h 1m 18s)

> I think that I think I think it's almost there.

(1h 1m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. All right. Well, then let's go for it. I think it's like I am plenty about everything

(1h 1m 27s)

> I've seen people seem to like it. So yeah, go for it. All right. Okay. Oh, um, I need

(1h 1m 29s) **Al:**

> Think that's a good choice. And you're a fourth one as well.

(1h 1m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Sorry, it is some of my list changing. Um, I Oh, I know it's really feel like that was going to be

(1h 1m 44s)

> an early access game. Um, but I'm running out of options. I feel confident in. So I'm

(1h 1m 51s)

> going to have to go for it. I think anyways, oh, put me down for super zoos. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm,

(1h 1m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's yeah, that's that's definitely gonna be early access this year. I don't think I don't think that's coming at one point

(1h 2m 5s)

> Oh, and this year

(1h 2m 5s) **Kevin:**

> no, I don't either. I'm not a certain about the quality of these other. Like, I'm that

(1h 2m 13s)

> when I feel we'll do a score wise, but it's probably not getting the score this year. Oh, but that's

(1h 2m 19s)

> Let's say that's what this is all about.

(1h 2m 21s)

> I risk high rewards, but also probably just shooting myself in the foot here.

(1h 2m 24s) **Al:**

> Yeah, okay. My, my fourth one, I am going to choose door look tone currently in early access.

(1h 2m 28s) **Kevin:**

> All right, Al.

(1h 2m 36s) **Al:**

> They initially said about a year for early access and that was in May of last year. So I've got

(1h 2m 42s)

> half a year for them to delays and they are consistently putting out good updates and every time

(1h 2m 50s)

> we look at it we go yeah that looks good

(1h 2m 54s)

> I just I feel like it's gonna happen this year and I think that it's gonna be good

(1h 2m 59s)

> I think people are gonna like it

(1h 3m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I can see it. Go for it.

(1h 3m 4s) **Al:**

> Cody your fourth and fifth please

(1h 3m 6s) **Codey:**

> Okay, so my fourth one is outbound so that

(1h 3m 12s) **Al:**

> Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that game. Oh, that is a good one

(1h 3m 17s) **Codey:**

> So outbound is the like van life one

(1h 3m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's a bad one. I forgot the name. Wow. That's a great pig.

(1h 3m 22s) **Codey:**

> Yep, and so that it already has pre-orders available

(1h 3m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 3m 28s) **Codey:**

> It has a really cute dog with a backpack van life is a really big thing right now

(1h 3m 30s) **Kevin:**

> It doesn't have.

(1h 3m 33s) **Codey:**

> So that's why I'm going with that

(1h 3m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's a good one.

(1h 3m 36s) **Codey:**

> And then, yeah, y'all thought that I was just going from the

(1h 3m 38s) **Kevin:**

> He's making up for the haunted chocolate here.

(1h 3m 46s) **Codey:**

> student from the hip, but I did research. My last one is

(1h 3m 49s) **Kevin:**

[groans]

(1h 3m 53s) **Codey:**

> Autonomica, which has had alpha updates recently and still on track to be done by the end of the year.

(1h 4m 4s) **Al:**

> I think that's

(1h 4m 7s) **Kevin:**

> I also do like I was considering on and on the cup, but I don't think it's gonna leave early access this year

(1h 4m 14s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(1h 4m 14s) **Kevin:**

> If or alpha whatever that's

(1h 4m 16s)

> See risky for me. I say this as a guy big super zoo story

(1h 4m 18s) **Codey:**

> - Yep.

(1h 4m 20s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 4m 21s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, I literally, like, in my list,

(1h 4m 24s)

> in my list, in case we had to, like, panic pick things

(1h 4m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 4m 28s) **Codey:**

> that weren't on my list, I wrote not super zoos story.

(1h 4m 31s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 4m 33s) **Codey:**

> My notes were a small team a few months

(1h 4m 35s)

> behind the schedule as is expecting it to be pushed to 2020.

(1h 4m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 4m 41s) **Al:**

> Okay, my fifth one and this is my crazy one. I'm gonna go with a new story of seasons game

(1h 4m 51s) **Kevin:**

> What?

(1h 4m 51s) **Codey:**

> What?! What?! An unannounced!

(1h 4m 52s) **Al:**

> and as and as of right now on announced story of seasons game

(1h 4m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm, mmm, mmm.

(1h 4m 59s) **Codey:**

> Wow! You know what? Good for you!

(1h 5m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Is it is it an anniversary for them?

(1h 5m 2s) **Al:**

> And and just and just to clarify that is not a remake and

(1h 5m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, Brad knew

(1h 5m 8s) **Al:**

> a brand new story of seasons.

(1h 5m 11s)

> game comes out this year. That's what I see.

(1h 5m 14s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(1h 5m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Not just not just shooting yourself in in the foot with like high caliber now. It just

(1h 5m 20s) **Codey:**

> What are some of the more recent scores?

(1h 5m 22s) **Al:**

> So the last - well, that's a good question.

(1h 5m 26s) **Kevin:**

[laughing]

(1h 5m 29s) **Al:**

> Let's have a look, shall we? Let's go into Metacritic.

(1h 5m 32s)

> So the reason why I'm certain that a new one is coming out this year is because

(1h 5m 36s)

> pioneers of all of town came out in 2021. So we're five years

(1h 5m 44s)

> from a new study of seasons game. And we are consistently getting one game a year.

(1h 5m 51s)

> it's just all of the ones

(1h 6m 13s) **Kevin:**

> It is their 30th anniversary, if I recall.

(1h 6m 18s)

> Yeah, you might, you might not be as insane as you sound.

(1h 6m 21s) **Codey:**

> That's, uh, yeah. That's, uh, he's, he's trust in the process.

(1h 6m 22s) **Al:**

> it's also just to point out like three years ago the announce that two games were in development

(1h 6m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh.

(1h 6m 24s)

[laughs]

(1h 6m 31s) **Codey:**

> And okay.

(1h 6m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I don't remember that.

(1h 6m 32s) **Al:**

> I don't think both of those will come out this year. I think it would just be one.

(1h 6m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Turn it out.

(1h 6m 36s) **Codey:**

> All right.

(1h 6m 38s)

> So what, okay, what happens if both come out this year, which?

(1h 6m 41s) **Al:**

> That is a good question. So I probably need to.

(1h 6m 46s) **Codey:**

> Do you want to pick like the first one that comes out or you know what?

(1h 6m 51s)

> This is such a bold statement.

(1h 6m 54s)

> I am going to give you the ability to pick.

(1h 6m 58s)

> Kevin, how do you feel about that?

(1h 6m 59s) **Kevin:**

> I'll find fine weather ever he's a lunatic for doing it sure why not and you know what

(1h 7m 2s) **Codey:**

> He's a lunatic.

(1h 7m 2s) **Al:**

> I'm sorry, I'm sorry the person who chose haunted chocolate ear thinks that I am the

(1h 7m 5s) **Codey:**

> This is so unlikely to happen.

(1h 7m 7s) **Kevin:**

> No matter

(1h 7m 11s) **Al:**

> crazy one.

(1h 7m 13s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(1h 7m 14s)

> I have a doctorate.

(1h 7m 16s)

> I know what I'm talking to.

(1h 7m 17s) **Kevin:**

> How to chocolates here is releasing 2026, quote, "Dr. Vethas."

(1h 7m 22s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 7m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Expert on the field of field.

(1h 7m 28s) **Al:**

> OK, I-- I think--

(1h 7m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, here's one.

(1h 7m 32s)

> If we get this more than one score, why don't we average them?

(1h 7m 37s) **Al:**

> No, I think I just get I think I just I think I just get the first one that comes out

(1h 7m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, fine.

(1h 7m 39s)

> Pick the one.

(1h 7m 40s)

> Pick the one.

(1h 7m 42s) **Al:**

> I don't think both of them come out this year

(1h 7m 44s)

> So they announced that they were making a standard new story of seasons game and also that they were making a new multiplayer one

(1h 7m 53s)

> I don't really want to narrow it down just in case. It's the multiplayer one that comes out

(1h 7m 58s)

> And I want if either of them come out I kind of want like the fact that I'm saying story seasons. I want either of them to count

(1h 8m 7s)

> But yeah, I'm happy to just take the first one. I'm not too fast about that because I don't think it will be I don't think it'll be an issue

(1h 8m 13s) **Kevin:**

> I'm in panic, dick mode because there's many options for my retakenness.

(1h 8m 17s) **Al:**

> Okay, Kevin what's your final one your fifth and final one?

(1h 8m 24s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(1h 8m 27s) **Kevin:**

> I'm basically looking at two and they're kind of in reverse problems.

(1h 8m 34s)

> One, I believe we'll be quality, but we'll not feel confident we'll come out this year.

(1h 8m 41s)

> The other one I do believe will come out.

(1h 8m 43s)

> But I am questioning its overall quality and and so the the ones I'm waffling here between yeah

(1h 8m 43s) **Codey:**

[whooshing]

(1h 8m 46s) **Al:**

> You get well, so, so just just to say you can say wherever you want now because we've already chosen so walk us through your thought process if you

(1h 8m 46s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(1h 8m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, okay

(1h 8m 54s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(1h 8m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Starbirds, I believe will hit 1.0 this year

(1h 9m)

> And it has a lot going for it, but I don't know if it's gonna solve the ultimate problem. Oh, and I can't with it

(1h 9m 8s) **Al:**

> But will that but will that matter to other people that's the

(1h 9m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know if it's

(1h 9m 11s)

> Well, maybe

(1h 9m 13s)

> because it was like, I don't know. That's a good question. I don't know. I felt a little, I think about, I look back to and I enjoyed the time, but it still felt like I just lost interest quickly, but with people still give it a high mark marks with that.

(1h 9m 28s)

> I don't know, hard to say. And it has so much going on for it, right? It has the art and the charm and everything, like I can't deny that. I might, maybe I'm being too harsh on it.

(1h 9m 38s)

> And it's also going through the whole, you know,

(1h 9m 40s)

> early access process, so maybe it's going to.

(1h 9m 43s)

> to fix itself, I could be Ross the other one, which we all know me,

(1h 9m 50s)

> but like I have faith in wild society, I think it's going to be well done.

(1h 9m 53s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(1h 9m 54s) **Kevin:**

> I don't, it's not going to be early access, but by that same token,

(1h 9m 59s)

> I don't know if it's going to drop this year because we've got a trailer,

(1h 10m 3s)

> but we haven't heard a peep out of it otherwise.

(1h 10m 6s)

> So that is a big question mark to me as if it'll actually hit 2027 or 2066.

(1h 10m 13s)

> Excuse me. So these are, yeah, you know, it's outfield.

(1h 10m 18s)

> We're going to come. I just want to say that it's not feel a bit waiting so long.

(1h 10m 22s)

> But anyways, I think I'm just going to go with the like,

(1h 10m 31s)

> I'm think I'm by decision. I'm just going to go with what's more concrete,

(1h 10m 34s)

> what I actually can see and get a better feeling for.

(1h 10m 38s)

> Right, let me down for Starbucks because I believe that's gonna drop this year

(1h 10m 43s)

> It does have good things going for it. Maybe not everything, but it does have good stuff going

(1h 10m 49s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I think it's a good choice. I think the thing is that yeah, we weren't huge fans of it,

(1h 10m 55s)

> but I would not be surprised if it still does well because you know, some people are looking for that.

(1h 11m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and it can't course correct right like it wasn't an unsolvable situation

(1h 11m 9s)

> But and maybe they'll get there

(1h 11m 12s)

> Right the question is with me a reason to play that was like the big one right? I like playing it just it'd be more reason to play more

(1h 11m 20s)

> But and you know what better critics scores our review stuff right for someone reviewing it

(1h 11m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, that's well, and that's the thing. And if a reviewer goes in expecting,

(1h 11m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe that's enough to get a good score like you know, they don't have to put in

(1h 11m 30s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(1h 11m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Starbirds, right like they're there

(1h 11m 37s) **Al:**

> they're not to be like a greater purpose for it, then they're not, they're not going to score it

(1h 11m 41s)

> negatively because of that.

(1h 11m 43s) **Kevin:**

> That's true.

(1h 11m 43s)

> All right, yeah, I feel better about the Starbirds.

(1h 11m 46s)

> Save me, save me from the fact that I put super zoos story

(1h 11m 49s)

> on the stupid list.

## Lists

(1h 11m 52s) **Al:**

> All right. Well, that's our draft. I'm just going to go through these

(1h 11m 55s)

> lists just to do them as a whole. So Cody's five are Pocopia, haunted chocolate here,

(1h 12m 2s)

> my time and ever shine outbound an autonomica. My games.

(1h 12m 6s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm, walk it in.

(1h 12m 31s)

> Austria, Petite Planet, Google Town, SuperZoo Story and Starbirds.

(1h 12m 36s)

> And at this point, I really, yeah, I have no idea who's wearing this, this is exciting.

(1h 12m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 12m 41s) **Al:**

> I think this is a great, fun list.

(1h 12m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, this is great

(1h 12m 45s)

> I love the different strategies. Oh, yeah, because like I like you feel like you have some

(1h 12m 50s)

> Sure-fire hits, you know, like some you know, maybe not the highest high-risk ones, but

(1h 12m 56s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 12m 56s) **Kevin:**

> I like your your list. Oh, how do you?

(1h 13m)

> It's a haunted chocolate here like she she built in safety factor for that like

(1h 13m 6s)

> You're welcome. Some of all.

(1h 13m 7s)

> All stars, so she could take the insane.

(1h 13m 10s) **Codey:**

> I mean, but like, how epic is it gonna be, though, if that thumbs up?

(1h 13m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, and herb stuff us.

(1h 13m 14s) **Al:**

> Well, I will. Yeah, sure. If you're going purely around the most insane when possible, then yes. Yes, of course. If Haunted Jokele Fear comes out, you deserve the win.

(1h 13m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, um.

(1h 13m 26s) **Codey:**

> I'm going to be foaming at the mouth of it. It's really, really sincere.

(1h 13m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Well, you got it.

(1h 13m 33s)

> I mean, you're not going to be able to save the news for the podcast,

(1h 13m 37s)

> but we're going to be screaming in the slack.

(1h 13m 39s)

> How cold you want when when concerned about announces.

(1h 13m 40s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's all right, because it's not going to come out this year. So we don't have to worry about

(1h 13m 42s) **Kevin:**

> It drops in one week.

(1h 13m 46s) **Codey:**

> Christmas 2020, 2020, 2020. I'm confident. I believe in my boy, Monica.

(1h 13m 53s) **Kevin:**

> What did? Oh.

(1h 13m 58s) **Al:**

> All right. Oh, that was the other thing I didn't talk about in the while we went up to. I went to the the starchy concert

## Stardew Concert

> Where was this one?

(1h 14m 8s) **Al:**

> This this was in the Glasgow Royal concert hall

(1h 14m 14s)

(1h 14m 26s) **Codey:**

> I turn music off in games.

(1h 14m 26s) **Al:**

> Trust me trust me Kevin when you're sitting in that hole and the music comes on. You're like, oh my word

(1h 14m 35s)

> Transported back to playing this game. It's it's so recognizable just cuz you can't sing it

(1h 14m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 14m 41s) **Codey:**

> How many people in the audience are playing?

(1h 14m 44s) **Al:**

> Wait

(1h 14m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Their games they're switched

(1h 14m 46s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(1h 14m 47s) **Al:**

> Oh, no, no

(1h 14m 49s) **Codey:**

> Just boot up your switch and just mute it and you're still just playing.

(1h 14m 50s) **Al:**

> No, no no definitely not

> All right, well.

(1h 15m 20s)

> No, thank you, Cody and Kevin for joining me for this experiment.

(1h 15m 24s)

> We will see how it goes.

(1h 15m 26s) **Kevin:**

> It's exciting. It doesn't be great. This came out great.

(1h 15m 26s) **Codey:**

> You get it when it's about something that you actually care about.

(1h 15m 40s) **Codey:**

> I get it.

(1h 15m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Most drafts are are you know like a month or maybe a month or whatever right like the March Madness thing, right?

(1h 15m 53s)

> This is a year. It's gonna be us

(1h 15m 54s) **Codey:**

> Now we're in it for the long haul, we're in it for the long haul.

(1h 15m 55s) **Kevin:**

> This is a slow burn right like we don't know when that

(1h 15m 59s)

> When that haunted chocolate's here that story of seasons announced it's gonna drop and when it does just gonna ruin our day out of nowhere

(1h 16m 4s) **Al:**

> Well, that's the thing. I mean, we won't even have a clue how it's going until, you know,
