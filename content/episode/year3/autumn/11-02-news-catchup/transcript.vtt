<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Uh, not not much. I was thinking about that.

15
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.060
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Not terribly much. It's been a busy week. Um, uh, the battle cats. I, I re got that set up again, um,

16
00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.180
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: because I'm look, we all know it. I'm, I'm a huge mark. I'm, uh, I'm a sucker for the thing that

17
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, so tell us what the crossover was this time, then?

18
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.019
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: - You're funny.

19
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.180
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: - Street Fighter is back in Battle Cats.

20
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: What's kind of funny is, the first time they did it,

21
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: it was still Street Fighter 5.

22
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And that was the character designs and the logo they used.

23
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.219
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But now they have upgraded to Street Fighter 6,

24
00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.060
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: which has released last year or whatever.

25
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Does that have new characters?

26
00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.139
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And it does, so here's the funny thing.

27
00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.900
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: all the five characters, including some of the old designs,

28
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.900
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: which are not being used in six,

29
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.620
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: but they added two new characters from what six

30
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.780
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: are in their six designs.

31
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: So it's just really funny 'cause it's Street Fighter 6,

32
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: but just don't look at the five stuff.

33
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:03.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But, but way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, you say, you say designs like it's going to somehow look like the street fighter games, like this is like stick art, basically, right?

34
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Don't worry about it.

35
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.819
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: [laughs]

36
00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, costumes.

37
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Well, I mean, that's the outfits.

38
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I think it would be crossovers actually get proper art.

39
00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.939
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's not just little, you said it's not cartoony,

40
00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: stick figure cats, they'll do some of those,

41
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.060
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: but well, in for instance, Ryu, when you play as Ryu,

42
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.180
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Oh my, okay. Oh wow.

43
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.620
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: it is actually Ryu who looks like Ryu

44
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.659
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: with proper art and animation turn.

45
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: When Sonic the Hedgehog released he was Sonic the Hedgehog,

46
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.020
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: proper art and everything.

47
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.620
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You know, maybe it's not like full 3D

48
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: art style, but they put the work.

49
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.080
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: They make the guest characters look like themselves.

50
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I'm... Cat.

51
00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:46.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: So, so yeah, so Street Fighter 5,

52
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: some of the designs from the outfits in five are being reused,

53
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: even though they're slapping the six logo on and now.

54
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But anyways, it's a lot of fun.

55
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.819
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's a beefy crossover.

56
00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.139
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: There's a total of, sure, it's like almost,

57
00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.900
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: there's like two banners on with eight each,

58
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: it's close to 16.

59
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.379
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, I think it's I think it's 16. Yeah. I will say Cammy, one of the new fighters looks like an off the clock captain Marvel

60
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: - Yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah, she does.

61
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.819
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I can see that she's missing her hat, that's the problem.

62
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.660
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Captain Marvel got bored and decided to go beat up people

63
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, she, yeah, I actually did pull Cammie.

64
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.259
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I did a few pulls and got Cammie, which is fun,

65
00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: but it's a problem 'cause I love Street Fighter

66
00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:33.899
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: and there's a lot of Street Fighter characters.

67
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.300
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And I'm the, I'm the worst luck, my brother Calvin.

68
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: He's already pulled, I was not playing in the last time

69
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.100
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: they did the co-lab, but he was so altogether right now.

70
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: He's at seven characters, I think, from Street Fighter Collection.

71
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.779
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But anyway, so yeah, I'm gonna keep trying to grind

72
00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:53.779
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: and see if I can get something,

73
00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.379
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: but I probably won't, I have very bad luck.

74
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.060
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But I did get some of the cats 'cause they have all the characters

75
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.379
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: and then they have the cat version of the characters,

76
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.899
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Maybe that's maybe that's what I'm thinking of then the cat

77
00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: We're just a little, little brown cat, the...

78
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, because they do have that. They have them cosplaying as the characters, and they're very cute and funny.

79
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But yeah, that's the thing. I mean, it's still a fun game, I like battle cats.

80
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's not hyper predatory, it's fairly decent for a Gotcha.

81
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's running, it's been running for 11 years, which is really impressive for a mobile game, in my opinion.

82
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, so that's the big one. Other than that, I had picked...

83
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Tough animal crossing in Tetris.

84
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.079
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: what now? Oh, Tetris 19. I forget about that. That's still running. Goodness. Okay.

85
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Tetris 99 is doing an event. Yeah.

86
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:54.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, and they'll drop, and you know every time they drop the special weekend theme, it's a reason for me to go in, because I love Tetris.

87
00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And it's fine, and I think some of the other cross, like crossover themes are better.

88
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: dark comedy I'll say that that's the genre go figure out how that fits in good times um let's see I watched

123
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:29.459
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: the naked gun from last year with Liam Neeson okay have you seen the other any of the other naked

126
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:43.120
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Kinds of comedy, right? Like I know the comedy. It's it's going for it's not my favorite kind of comedy, but I get it

127
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.220
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No, sure sure sure. Okay, you know the style of comedy

128
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.940
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, well that kind of like hyper just over the top almost surrealist comedy

129
00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:53.379
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's kind of dead right now

130
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.899
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, airplane style comedy, I guess you could,

131
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:59.019
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, exactly airplane style comedy. Yeah, that's correct. Um, well, you know, it's kind of dead

132
00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:56.340
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: it feels like kind of one of the earlier ones.

133
00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:02.779
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Right now I would say right you know, it's seen that much of it

134
00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.360
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: This one is just line-up homogenically going fool

135
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:14.679
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: back into that style of comedy so they're just you know running like two or three jokes a minute

136
00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:19.980
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: and some of them are very funny when you're just throwing out that many a lot of the

137
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:29.259
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: movements so there's some bangers in there Liam Neeson I enjoy his work and they play because

138
00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:35.700
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: you know he's still playing the super serious rugged grizzly cop character and they play with

139
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.700
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: that well.

140
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's so stupid, but they did it so much it won me over.

141
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: They're just a running gag where people just keep handing them coffee cups out of it.

142
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No way.

143
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I just like out of random places.

144
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And it just lawns.

145
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's like that.

146
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I enjoyed it.

147
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Good times.

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But yeah, I recommend it.

149
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It got chuckles out of me.

150
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, good old naked gun.

151
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Let's see.

152
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: What else?

153
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, oh, this is the 28.

154
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:19.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, I watch that finally, you know, I'm here. I am eight years late to the party. What can I say? It's a good film.

155
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.899
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Oh yes, yep.

156
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Don't worry, I watched it, I only watched it last year.

157
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:35.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, well, there you go. Well, good film. Right? Jordan Peele did do good stuff. Yeah, I don't have much to say. Yeah.

158
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:37.740
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I still I still find it funny that like Jordan peel half of key and peel has become like one of the go-to

159
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

160
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

161
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.080
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: harder produce directors

162
00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.039
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Just just bizarre

163
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

164
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay.

165
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.440
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Get you someone who can do both right?

166
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You know what's bizarre?

167
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, exactly.

168
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

169
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And because he's still like unintentionally or not, he keeps the humor in a lot of his

170
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: movies, right?

171
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Like there's bits and pieces that are like harder or just absurdists, right?

172
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: That make me laugh at least.

173
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But, dude, you know what's bizarre about that whole...

174
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.320
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: thing for me. I didn't really pay attention to key and peel. So, I learned about Jordan

175
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:27.820
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Peel from get out really. So, the one that kills me is, you know, the reaction gift

176
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:22.299
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: and you're like, "Wait, the famed horror director was in our comedy, Jill?"

177
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:34.700
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: of peel just sweating, just copious amounts of sweat. The first time I saw it was after, you know,

178
00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:29.799
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yes.

179
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: like, yeah, I was like, is that trying to peel?

180
00:11:37.500 --> 00:12:07.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Why did somebody get this in their sweaty? Yeah, I mean, that's fine. That's all you need really. But yeah, they're clear. Oh, man. But yeah, I mean, I have gone back and watch the clips. They're phenomenal stuff. We're gonna say. But yeah, all right, that's that's all I got. That's my horrendous movie roundup. What's been going on over there in there?

181
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:48.279
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I've never, like, I've never specifically watched like an episode of their sketch show.

182
00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:51.100
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I just see the clips all the time.

183
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.379
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Let's see, so we're continuing to play Pokemon the DLC

184
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, so frustrating. It's so weird

185
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.879
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, I think I think I would go so far as to say this is the worst DLC they've done

186
00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:29.100
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And and the problem is that it's purely because of just like a couple of decisions

187
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:35.399
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: They made that make it just so frustrating. So obviously the timer on the donuts is one of them. It's very frustrating

188
00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:32.419
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

189
00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:41.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: What I heard it described that is like almost every part of it is random, right?

190
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: like the ingredients you need or the donut.

191
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.620
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yes, yeah, exactly, there's there's there's there's a level of it, right?

192
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:53.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You make is kind of randomized. Okay. Okay.

193
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:55.559
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So you have five different flavors you can have in it and each each berry has a certain amount of flavor and

194
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.700
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: the amount of flavor

195
00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:59.779
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: determines

196
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.179
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: What you will get out of it. What powers you'll get out of it, but

197
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:09.139
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: There's still a lot of RNG, right? So if you put in a lot of sweet, you are

198
00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:12.139
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: likely to get a shining power

199
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: but

200
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:22.639
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's random which type it is for example, right? So like I'm currently trying to get shiny Glimit

201
00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:30.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But I can't seem to for the life of me get a donut with shining power rock or shining power poison

202
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I did get one that was shining power for all types, but it's only level one

203
00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:40.519
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So it really doesn't increase the odds very much and that that is very frustrating. So yeah, that's the other thing

204
00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:43.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's like the timer, the timer in and of itself wouldn't be a problem.

205
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Because the sandwiches had timers in the last game.

206
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No. Yeah. Right. Exactly.

207
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:56.480
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But the problem with the timer is that it's also defining how long you can stay in a specific area.

208
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And also, the fact that there's so many auto saves so you can't just reset in many cases.

209
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So it's like all those things together.

210
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:10.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And the thing that's really been frustrating me the last week, and before anyone says it, yes, I know I don't have to keep playing it shut up.

211
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I have to finish this, right?

212
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: They listen to the show.

213
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I just need to, I just need to, I've got like 20 Pokemon life to go.

214
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But this is the thing that's really frustrating me just now,

215
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: is the Pokemon and the DLC are all in these hyperspace dimensions

216
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: which you get to using the donuts.

217
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And each day or night, there's like a different list of areas.

218
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's kind of like the raids in Scarlet and Violet, right?

219
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: There's a certain amount and then you can reset it and get more.

220
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And each area has specific Pokemon.

221
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And so the problem is that there's still

222
00:14:43.500 --> 00:15:12.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: like a few Pokemon that I can't get, and I have to keep reloading the day to get like different hyperspace areas so that I can actually catch all the Pokemon, but the thing that's really annoying is there's a bunch of legendary Pokemon, which you get through what's called special scans, which you get the special scans once you've done the story of the DLC and you've done the post game story of the DLC, and so you special scans, they will get you like a rare hyperspace area that will have

223
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:41.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: in Pokemon, sometimes we'll have legendary Pokemon on it, sometimes won't, and so you have to do like, you have to do tasks to gain points to be able to do the special scan, which then will give you a special area which may or may not have one of the legendary Pokemon in it, and then once you've done that, or it might just be another area with just like a whole bunch of powerful Venusaur for some reason, or it might be a battle area, both things I don't want right now.

224
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh yeah.

225
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I just want to get the legend

226
00:15:43.500 --> 00:16:10.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: to get a special scan to then do it again and get another one so it's like I don't actually have any of the legendary Pokemon from the special scans and I've done full of them already so it's like I don't it's just so it's the most it's like they went oh we love our people okay it's like they went oh people miss the RNG

227
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, yeah!

228
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: They loved the going into a...

229
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: into the grass and RNG, giving them a Pokemon.

230
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Rather than seeing Pokemon and being able to run into them.

231
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Which, I don't miss.

232
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But they may be saw that some people missed that.

233
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Anyway, that's fine. Let's give them RNG.

234
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Here's all of the RNG. Everything is RNG.

235
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Everything is RNG. The donuts are RNG.

236
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The powers you get from the donuts are RNG.

237
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The hyperspace areas you get are RNG.

238
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The special scans that you get are RNG.

239
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's just everything and it's so

240
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: frustrating and it's taking so long, this might be the hardest

241
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:55.740
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Pokedex to finish. I've ever done. It's just so and it's not even difficult. It's just so time-consuming

242
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.019
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You're just doing the same thing over and over and over again

243
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.100
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The good thing is there are still poucomon I can shiny hunt in this game

244
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.660
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I'm just like that is what is keeping me going right like I'm shiny hunting a poucomon

245
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.859
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And then it's like okay, now I can get a special scan and oh my word

246
00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:20.859
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I don't know how I think really the only reason I'm completing this at this point is because you know there's gonna be a home

247
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.660
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Thing a poucomon home

248
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.660
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Reward for having done the poucomodex

249
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.980
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And so it's like I want that

250
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This DLC is just such baffling decisions

251
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:44.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, Pokemon's been good, been staying strong with that lead, yeah, but it is wild that at least

252
00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:42.299
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Such a frustrating

253
00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:51.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: the like decks completion part of it, you think would be easier. But yeah, what I, I mean,

254
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.660
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: because I know people a lot of people including people listen to this right now here about

255
00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:01.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: shiny hunting and and and you guys are sick of freaks. So, you know, whatever happens to you guys

256
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: That's so weird, but...

257
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Well, yeah, yeah. I know I am the problem here looking at my shiny decks. I've got 72 Pokemon left to go

258
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:23.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, but the fact that, you know, even just acts completion, just hitting those legendarys is so difficult because RNG, that's wild, that is really wild.

259
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I know I'm the problem here

260
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:31.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Um, I don't know. That's a baffling, like you said. Uh, makes you glad that it's poetic.

261
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, make a book, oh yeah.

262
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Ha, ha, ha.

263
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:43.640
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But on on the subject of being a sicko and unhealthy coping mechanisms, I have bought a 3D printer

264
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:56.039
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, that you know what look, I think that's one of the better ones because at least you get a physical thing out of it, right?

265
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.700
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I am one of those people name

266
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:01.839
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: A physical thing, a physical thing that you have to keep putting filament into and creating

267
00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:58.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Like it there is.

268
00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:08.799
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: things that are so unnecessary.

269
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.759
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No, I'm saying the stuff you create is, I mean, it's unnecessary, but it's still a thing like there is a potential for utilitarianism.

270
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:31.400
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But I look, I think 3D printers are one of the coolest pieces of tech that's come out in the last 20 years or so and and to hit the degree of affordability that they are. That's, that's awesome. I say good for you. Good sir. Yeah, I have you fired her up yet.

271
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:44.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I've plugged it all in, but I haven't actually done anything with it yet, because you're finding the time to be like, okay, I'm going to take like two hours and just like focus on this and understand it that's difficult.

272
00:19:45.500 --> 00:20:00.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Try to find the time, but I'll find it soon. I'll find it soon. My, my, my big thing that I want to do this is organizational waste stuff. There's a whole bunch of like grid based things that I want to do in terms of like cable management and stuff like that.

273
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.660
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Be sure, sure.

274
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:07.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: We're having our say again, sorry.

275
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's time to print your own game cases.

276
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.400
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Time to print your own game case.

277
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, I mean, yeah, maybe.

278
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:26.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I, we've got our, we're getting our kitchen redone. It's the last that we moved into this house nine years ago and it's like the last kind of big thing we wanted to do with the house because I had such a tiny kitchen.

279
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.380
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And so we're getting it extended a little bit.

280
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.420
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And so I'm thinking about this.

281
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.299
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: In terms of, you know, there's a bunch of ways I want to organize things more efficiently

282
00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:39.299
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: and make my life better using 3D printed stuff.

283
00:20:39.299 --> 00:20:41.779
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So that is my plan.

284
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.279
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, no, that's cool. Let's see that that's useful at the 3D print your ideal space rack. Go for it

285
00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:43.619
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah.

286
00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:44.619
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Well, exactly.

287
00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:47.619
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That's the thing.

288
00:20:47.619 --> 00:21:01.220
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And then, of course, Craig, my son is like, can we print my craft?

289
00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.640
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Right right and I'm done down to that. You know, I don't think that's right

290
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Every Pokemon

291
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:07.099
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And I'm like, OK, right, I see where you want.

292
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.099
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah time yeah, it's on the make your own amigo good good for you guys

293
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:21.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: All right, shall we get into the news?

294
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.880
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Let's do it cuz I hear things happen

295
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.359
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So as I normally do, when we're doing our news catch-up, and there's a lot of news, I've

296
00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:28.440
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: separated it out into sections.

297
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.279
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I'm going to start with releases.

298
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:37.940
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So first up, we have the Animal Crossing New Horizons Switch 2 Edition and 3.0 coming out soon.

299
00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:46.059
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But we just got some new information yesterday that there is as well as the 3.0 update,

300
00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:52.980
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: which is available for everyone, and the paid Switch 2 update, which is available if you buy it.

301
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.099
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: We're also going to have a free Switch 2 upgrade as well.

302
00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:00.279
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: [laughter]

303
00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:01.440
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Which will-- which--

304
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.480
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Well, upgrade the-- it's all what it says is, visuals optimized for the Nintendo Switch

305
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: to display and improved image quality.

306
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:22.380
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, so what's the the paid part includes the mega phone item I guess

307
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That's all we know.

308
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: [laughter]

309
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:34.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yes, yes, and also, it didn't, so it didn't explicitly say improved resolution on the free update, but the paid one does say improved resolution.

310
00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:42.140
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I don't know what they mean in terms of improved graphics if they don't mean improved resolution, but it's possible. There's a distinction there or something.

311
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:51.460
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But yeah, the paid one gives you the most control support and the megaphone and maybe some more visual improvements on top of the free one.

312
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.700
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Wow, that...

313
00:22:51.500 --> 00:23:11.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like at this point, right, I'm going to need to like not buy the upgrade pack, get the free upgrade, look at it, and then upgrade it and see if it looks any different.

314
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.140
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay. That doesn't sound worth it at all.

315
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.539
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: [laughing]

316
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Oh,

317
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:20.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This is the investigative journalism that you expect from this podcast.

318
00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:18.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: ha, ha, ha. And don't demand, but we do it anyway.

319
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:28.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Nobody has asked for this.

320
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: We need our comparison matrix.

321
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:38.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's so confusing. So yeah, and that comes out the same day. So that's this, in fact, it'll be tomorrow if you listen to this on release day.

322
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh my gosh that's oh my gosh we're almost out of the halfway point of January.

323
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:50.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I've just, so someone says, and I don't know whether this is true or not, that it looks like the improved graphics in the free update is only in portable mode.

324
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The paid version gives you 4K and don't.

325
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.299
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, yeah, and I make that check out. I'll take that

326
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Makes it sound like a big one still

327
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.519
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: We will see, anyway, what a weird decision to make this public.

328
00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:09.079
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: We'll see

329
00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:11.079
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: what else

330
00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:16.200
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: No, and not tell us that they're saying they announced everything else.

331
00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.279
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah

332
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:19.640
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: That's that's classic Nintendo confusion marketing

333
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.680
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Anyway.

334
00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:27.400
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Cozy Caravan, 1.0 is no out, so that was in early access for a while.

335
00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:28.680
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Speaking of animal cross hit with lights

336
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.440
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Speaking of definitely not animal crossing is nothing like animal.

337
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.599
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Now legally mistaken

338
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.440
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So... the...

339
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: They released in early access...

340
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: some time ago.

341
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I can't, in fact, there we go.

342
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:49.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: January 8th. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah

343
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: May last May 2024.

344
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And their 1.0 then came out a couple days ago.

345
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So this is the 1.0.

346
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: They also have announced their Switch release is coming on the 15th.

347
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:14.099
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: that's off to them. I respect that, whoops. Or maybe they'll look like the gay man on top.

348
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Who knows, maybe they will regret it.

349
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Maybe who I doubt it, but we'll see.

350
00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:16.099
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah. Oh.

351
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Next, the farmer was replaced.

352
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This is the coding farming game,

353
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: which I really, really need to play,

354
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: has announced that they are now on Mac OS.

355
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So that's good, because then I can actually play it.

356
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Because I feel like this is not going to work well

357
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: with this game.

358
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.940
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Maybe just you may have difficulty is

359
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Programming on a steam deck.

360
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Whoa, sounds super fun.

361
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.720
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, some of those keys might not bind like you thought

362
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, so, yeah, I'm going to have to get this purchased

363
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: and installed on Mac and play at some point.

364
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It does look fun.

365
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I do have a better problem,

366
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: and that I'm not, I don't tend to program very much

367
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.839
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: program very much inside of work because.

368
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.319
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Well, you know.

369
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.099
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Why would you cook yourself a five star meal when you're already working at a restaurant, right?

370
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:18.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I, well, I mean, that is not a great analogy because you want to eat food.

371
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.839
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No, I know I know I'm just saying you don't want to cook the whole thing

372
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.920
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Like the thing stands

373
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:29.759
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I'm just saying like if you're a chef you probably just microwave a meal at home because you're tired and you don't want to cook anymore

374
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:40.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Oh, I thought he said book, you said cook a five star, I think he said book a five star meal. I was like, I felt like this was saying making the complete opposite point of what you were trying to make here.

375
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:32.960
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

376
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:46.240
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm the opposite. Yeah, exactly. You probably would want to book a meal

377
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.900
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That makes much more sense.

378
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.900
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That makes much more sense.

379
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:56.799
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, I used to do it quite a lot, but then I had kids and then the kids grew up.

380
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:04.819
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: oh that'll do it yeah that's that's why

381
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.299
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And I got tired.

382
00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:08.099
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But this does look fun either way, but yeah, it's now on Mac. There we go.

383
00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:15.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Next, we have Super Farming by have announced that they're coming to Xbox on the 16th.

384
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.880
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I mean, you know, I remember that one that's

385
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Hayotic was a good way of describing it

386
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:27.799
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: With action adventure and there's farming and combos and

387
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.180
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Slots off good for them. Well, I pick it up under the art style. It's still really good. I'll say that super stylish

388
00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:44.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't have an Xbox. Well Microsoft might say I have an Xbox. I don't know. They say a lot of things are an Xbox

389
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This is the next part.

390
00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:47.279
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah

391
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.559
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: So yeah, I don't know if my switch is the next box yet, but but good good for them

392
00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:58.299
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's that's a fun one. I'm gonna try it out on steam at some point. It's cute

393
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Speaking of cute tiny garden have announced that their switch version is coming in cute

394
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: still

395
00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.960
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Excuse me still not the play date. I can't use the crank mechanics. Oh, you know, but but no

396
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.200
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah. That's a whole, that's a bigger deal, porting to the playdate. You got to, you got

397
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.380
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, I know I get it. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's fine

398
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: to rethink how your UI works.

399
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.980
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But hey good for them. There's one thing we know here that

400
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:34.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Rigage core for people usually have a switch and we'll buy things on that so tiny garden

401
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.299
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Switch good for you tiny garden people. It's more money

402
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.240
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Hopefully more than you spent to board it

403
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And the final one in our releases section is outbound,

404
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.799
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: have announced that they are physical and collector's editions

405
00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:51.880
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: are now available to pre-order.

406
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:59.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So they have physical and collector's editions of all the releases

407
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.400
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: that's Switch to PS5 and PC.

408
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.559
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Who's buying a physical game for PC?

409
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:15.900
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: oh my gosh oh people didn't buy back that in the 90s I think good

410
00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.720
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: What's happening here? Are we in the 90s again?

411
00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I really don't understand what's happening here.

412
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.319
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Like shoot presumably.

413
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.160
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Like it does say physical game, but like surely it's a code for Steam, right?

414
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:27.099
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You had hope so. Let's see who's not LRG. I'll say that so good for them

415
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But hey, that's cool. Are they getting physical releases? That's pretty cool

416
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I didn't realize this thing. We're so close to releasing, but yeah, here we are

417
00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:44.259
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: That's pretty that's really impressive all these collective additions all that for them

418
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:50.700
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah so I think they've said that their release of this game is now Q2 this year so that's how close we

419
00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:57.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: are. They've also said that they're expecting that the digital price will be cheaper than the

420
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.900
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: physical price that they've got here which the PC pricing is $30 or 25 pound.

421
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.559
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: which probably makes sense, yeah.

422
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:12.059
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I mean I'm guessing it will be $25 then probably for the game.

423
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.740
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: - Yeah, yeah, that'll be my guess.

424
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.259
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Presumably these physical ones are coming later. I've just, I fact they do keep talking about

425
00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:26.859
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: physical but like they're not going to have a DVD in that PC thing. Are they? Are like a USB stick?

426
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:37.839
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: ha ha ha now that's that I hope that's not a thing that sounds concerning unless they're

427
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.180
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Like do you get physical PC games anymore? Is that a thing?

428
00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:43.880
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: unless you're like and now you know what no no I'm just gonna say no even if you are getting

429
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.799
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: them from a guy in an alleyway it probably still be a code ha ha ha ha ha ha I just

430
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.519
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah. Oh.

431
00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:55.920
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: look I know been following and covering it but how high can you go on out

432
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.559
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: your outbound you're in your RV that's what I need to know can I build a building on

433
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:09.779
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: well we will I will definitely be pushing those limits so it looks like a limited run do USB sticks

434
00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:20.940
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: it yeah we need to know really that's that's wild that's that feels weird I don't

435
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:17.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: apparently apparently so it is fascinating I don't want to

436
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.940
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I think I did comfortable.

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: whether it's on a USB stick or on a DVD. But like, I can't imagine anybody selling games on a DVD

443
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.539
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: - Yeah.

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But I don't want to have to plug it into my computer to play a game.

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You give me 10,000 things and I'm gonna hate you forever that you've given me a list. I can't complete

475
00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:46.420

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But don't not do not give me 10,000 things in a list where I can see them

477
00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:56.339
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That's what I do not want because that is just mean

478
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: [laughs]

479
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:09.699
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yes, I do. Just for clarification, the heart event tracker in this update. So heart events already

480
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:15.139
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: existed. This is just a tracker to tell you what your next one is. And it also lists requirements

481
00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.739
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: for the next heart event. I agreed.

482
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:24.300
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: See that's actually great. That's good. Which I think is the standard in cottagecore now or word we're close to it, right? Some kind of

483
00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:30.340
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I think I wouldn't say standard. I would say that like it's what people want. I don't think it's

484
00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: standard yet sadly. I think there are a lot to give

485
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.940
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, well, we're close to it.

486
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:52.579
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: to make a difference. I'm saying here if you go here something can happen and so it's not telling you

487
00:34:52.579 --> 00:34:58.179
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: what to do and where to and who is with and stuff it just tells you something can happen if you go here

488
00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:02.260
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: which I felt like was kind of the nice it still gave a little bit of mystery right you don't

489
00:35:02.579 --> 00:35:06.820
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: it's going to happen with you don't know what's going to happen we get there but you know that you can

490
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Sure, sure.

491
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:14.260
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: go somewhere to do it so it feels like you're still unlocking things as you go but the ability to go

492
00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:23.219
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: yes yeah I'm going to go deal with that just now I quite like that. Opidum have released their 1.2 update

493
00:35:23.219 --> 00:35:31.940

495
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:41.179
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, is it? Okay, what kind of mini games? Wait, beach punk battle. Oh, there you go. There's the one where you fight all the giant huntsman's

496
00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.739
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Battle arena.

497
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.440
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That'll be in a wave, fight waves of enemies and get rewards.

498
00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:53.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's cool. Wait, wait, wait. What's a benny? Is that an Australian?

499
00:35:53.820 --> 00:36:04.059
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't know what that is. I'm saying because when you play beach punk, the play gets other people or benny's. I don't know what a benny is.

500
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, I don't know what that is. I'll look that up. It might be a thing exclusive to this game. I don't know.

501
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.940
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Who knows, I also haven't played it.

502
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.780

505
00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:41.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This is the one that is the sequel to Everdream Valley, I think.

506
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.719
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, yes, no, remember yes, okay, yes, yes, not dream my valley, it's not

507
00:36:48.000 --> 00:37:10.800
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: making him out. Sure, that's true. Okay, auto run. Oh, yeah, that's great like the one naming convention we still have.

508
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:54.099
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: No, but this one is ever dream village. We don't often get village in a name. So that's different

509
00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:57.940
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Anyway, this is the quality of life improvements

510
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:05.219
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Now don't be confused by it being called the 1.6 update. This game is still in early access. It is not hit 1.0 yet

511
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.840
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay. All right, here.

512
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:32.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: What's the better option here, Al? When you hit, you know, or hit the official release, do you go to two or 3.0, or did you just start over and you go to 1.0, but official release?

513
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I think you start over

514
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:43.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's still we can prepare 1.6 update before and after.

515
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:44.320
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The worst the worst the worst one for me is slime rancher 2 which hit 1.0

516
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Because it's not it's lime rancher 2 how can it be 1.0?

518
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

519
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, good time. Sorry, ever.

520
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Look, ever jambula that you do have cute animals. I'll say that.

521
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Is that enough to us?

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Like I guess it's just the nature of the beast of seeing the sausage made but every time I see these like

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That's why you don't play early access, right?

553
00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:16.079
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, that is actually a big part. Well, I don't play early

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's something about it just being a silhouette that I'm not a fan of

561
00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:47.920
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Hmm, I just not don't fully know

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Each non shiny one can also be slightly different color. It's not like super different

568
00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:16.519
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's not like one day is blue the next is yellow, but it's like the example they show is like different shades of yellow or orange

569
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.400
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, like different shades of orange.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.719
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Well, I'm going to, that's my line in the sand second of all, like, if you're going to do

574
00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:34.880
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Chinese, but then include variants that aren't Chinese, like, I don't know.

575
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.519
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I just feel like you're, you're cheapening the experience here and end.

576
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.360
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, I don't know.

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: We're just, I feel like we're chasing two rabbits here.

578
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:48.260
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I agree with that. I feel like you go one or the other. I also say I think most

579
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.579
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: creature collectors probably shouldn't have shinies because I'm going to be

580
00:41:51.500 --> 00:42:18.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Yeah.

582
00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:04.579
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: put in the time to shiny hunt in your game. Just not going to do it. You know

583
00:42:04.579 --> 00:42:10.739
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: how long it takes to shiny hunt? It takes a long time. I have thousands of

584
00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:13.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I was in, and combined all my Pokemon games.

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: thousands of hours, you will be lucky if I give you a hundred.

586
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.739
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: If I give you, if I give you a hundred hours in your game, you will be one of my most

587
00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:26.980
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: played games, like top 20, right?

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:40.380
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And, and it especially kills me Yeah, it kills me because especially in like more realistic

589
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:33.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I'm not shiny hunting in your game, no one is shiny hunting in your game, sorry.

590
00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.960
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: version variants like this one right where we're you know they're trying to you know actually

591
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.199
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: use bugs and you know real life bugs and stuff like bugs already call their variants

592
00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:55.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: you want to do that to replicate that that's fine that's cool but you know you don't

593
00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:00.079
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: need to go shiny you don't need to give me a purple centimeter or whatever it's

594
00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:09.820
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: fuck I'm I'm content go out by know if anything because that's real that's cool but yeah

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I mean, I'm guessing that's what shiny Pokemon were based.

596
00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:16.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: something like that sure um I'm with ginger it's not a bad idea but like I'm when they

597
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.840
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: call them shit the worst part is a lot of them will just straight up call it shiny right

598
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:25.599
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: like like that's we don't need that we don't need it you don't

599
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.840
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: yeah. Agreed. I like this color variance thing that they're doing much better.

600
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:37.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: need to have a red garidos I do too I agree yeah yeah that's a little personality a little

601
00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:36.320
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Just like everyone you had, just going to be a slightly different color. That's fun.

602
00:43:37.579 --> 00:43:43.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: flavor I like it I agree so good for doing that but not what you didn't have to do

603
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:49.260
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: shiny so just does this I would have been happy as a clam I say as someone who's not played

604
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:52.300
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: [Laughter]

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: and we'll probably not hit his game yeah it's cool

606
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:57.019
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yes, but that's the point of this podcast is to have opinions on games we haven't played.

607
00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:12.219
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: we judge what are we judging next Sal something that probably should wait wait is this

608
00:43:57.019 --> 00:44:00.980
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: [Laughter]

611
00:44:09.699 --> 00:44:14.940
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It is not at 1.0.

612
00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:19.019

613
00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:25.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: of you know you're doing farming cottage core things seasons are important it's sad

614
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:40.260
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: good for you we gonna fall now you know when things are harvested in a farming game yeah

615
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:48.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, it adds seasons. That's not much to say, but look, it's early access. Look, it's, it is what it is, right?

616
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:51.380
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: that's kind of a fundamental let's I feel a little weird it's like I'm yeah yeah yeah I get the

617
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You know where you're getting. If you get at this point, at this point, if you play an early access game and you complain about a fundamental feature,

618
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: not existing, that's your problem.

619
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:04.739
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, no, I'm not again. I'm not trying to complain like that. That's why I avoid early acts just

620
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:13.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: The I don't know the optics are always really funny to me. Hey, I'm making a racing game and I added I don't know boosting or drifting

621
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yes, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get it. I get it.

623
00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, so I'm always going to heckle it because I'm not fond of early access

624
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But it is important. And hey, this is what it's for getting

625
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's right. The game's being worked on. Look at that. That's the thing.

626
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It should be odd. Cool. So yeah, I heckle them. But good for you. Eightes of Kataria.

627
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.199
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Alright, now we're going to new games, I have three new games to talk about, new games

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: that we've never talked about before.

631
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:52.599
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: First up, we have Heart Opia, welcome to Heart Opia, a multiplayer life simulation game

632
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Does it have?

633
00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:58.679
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: crafted for creativity, freedom and peace, build your dream home, explode a wide range

634
00:45:58.679 --> 00:46:03.880
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: of hobbies and forge warm connections with friends in a town full of endless possibility.

635
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Endless possibilities, Kevin.

636
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:15.880
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, and endless, you know, it just kills me that I'm just, I don't know, jaded is the

637
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:22.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: best word here, but like, I see the trailer, I see the description. There's nothing wrong

638
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.280
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: with any of it. It looks competently made. So some of the visuals are quite nice even. There's

639
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:33.639
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: like, oh, wow, that looks like a whale. It's very cute. But good heavens. Are you standing out?

640
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.320
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Other than the fact that your little image looks like that Beatles cover. I don't know what

641
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.960
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: we're off for a year. It does look nice though. It's, I'm not, I don't know if I'm going to

642
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:55.920
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: play. It's not sticking out to me, but, you know what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One thing I don't, I'm not sure.

643
00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:00.679
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: So like, they're building a house and it looks like they're maybe doing it. My craft style

644
00:47:00.679 --> 00:47:03.360
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Will we be able to block my block or piece by piece?

645
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.960
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But it's pretty detailed. That's that's kind of well, I guess I guess like Dragon Quest Builders

646
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:16.820
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah I think I think instead of Minecraft style I think it's more sim style like they're

647
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Are sure that

648
00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:24.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: putting up they're putting a wall up rather than like putting bricks on um it's hard to

649
00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah

650
00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:25.639
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that's probably it. So they have a waffle maker. I like waffles

651
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.159
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: because it's very fast in the trailer.

652
00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:32.059
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It is very fast. Yeah, so I yeah, I don't know the animal look cute

653
00:47:32.059 --> 00:47:34.059
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I think the visuals are nice, but

654
00:47:35.099 --> 00:47:38.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Nothing nothing's you know, really sticking out to me

655
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:55.460
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, and endless possibilities, I. Yeah, I don't really know what else to say about this. It looks fine. I bet I'll never play it.

656
00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:41.059
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's fine endless possibilities

657
00:47:45.059 --> 00:47:47.059
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Can you murder people?

658
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:51.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

659
00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

660
00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:04.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Probably until they, until they guarantee the endless and you can do all that your range nonsense,

661
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: the other game, you're too scared of.

662
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.260
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Here and lies one of the problems.

663
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Then you finally break up couples.

664
00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.019
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Here and lies one of the problems.

665
00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:13.420
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: When they say endless possibilities,

666
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Mmm.

667
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.219
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I go, that's too many possibilities.

668
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You know what? That's fair.

669
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:24.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But it's still, I'd still hit my head.

670
00:48:19.659 --> 00:48:22.099
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Apparently, this is interesting,

671
00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:24.579
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: 'cause it doesn't say on Steam,

672
00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:26.619
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: as far as I'm aware,

673
00:48:26.619 --> 00:48:29.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: but I just went through to their forgive me,

674
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.659
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: their ex account,

675
00:48:32.659 --> 00:48:36.300
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: and it says that it's coming out on the 7th of January.

676
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.539
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That's in the past.

677
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:51.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: that I was about to say what year unless they didn't say a year is this real is this money

678
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:44.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This game is definitely not. This effort is definitely listed as still coming soon.

679
00:48:51.699 --> 00:49:06.260
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: laundering what's going on now okay this getting closer to money

680
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: That's a very good question.

681
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:00.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You can install it on Android, apparently.

682
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:17.760
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: laundering and then we expect it's up oh that that I don't know how much I believe in that software

683
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It looks like it's free on Android and...

684
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.760
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, I can install on my iPhone as well. I am currently installing the game. But it is not available on Steam. It says coming soon on Steam.

685
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.320

688
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, it says developer and publisher.

689
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.900
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't know, or these people.

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Now we're getting somewhere.

693
00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: [laughs]

694
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.079
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's, it's things sometimes are still questionable.

695
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.119
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot. I'm gonna, yeah, I don't know what's happening here.

699
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.079
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's really our endless possibilities here even beyond the game.

700
00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:10.880
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Stay tuned, we may one day find out the legality of this game.

701
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Or the existence part.

702
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: That too.

703
00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:18.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Is their next game actually existing, Aldi, you know?

704
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: No, two seconds. I'm not, I'm not done here. Just you, wait a minute. Just you, wait a minute.

705
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.320
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Ah ha ha yeah! We got a dig. Oh, I just...

706
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:28.699
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You can download the game directly from the website as an exe file.

707
00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:28.559
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh my!

708
00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:32.760
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, he's f***ing off!

709
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:42.719
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, is the risk of our data being collected worth it to see what is going on here?

710
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.139
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: [laughs]

711
00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:43.639
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: This is fascinating.

712
00:50:42.719 --> 00:50:49.280
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I'm coming soon, but make dig drop January 7th on their website.

713
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.599
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Maybe I forgot about Steve, who knows? This is wild.

714
00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:04.699
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Right, I'm gonna have to investigate this, but let's keep going with the podcast, and I'll see if I've got anything new to bring next episode. So next game ancient farm

715
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: the game that apparently actually exists.

716
00:51:08.179 --> 00:51:10.179
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Plow

717
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.719
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Unlike Heartopia question mark.

718
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:20.059
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I'm gonna read out the blurb, but before that I'm gonna describe this as basically first paint first person roots of patcher

719
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:32.039
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, farming simulator 20 or zero. I don't know whatever 2,000 BCs unlike that whatever. Yeah, 2026 BC. There you go

720
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.320
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Plow, plow, plant, water and harvest as you build your ancient Egyptian farm from the ground up.

721
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:47.420
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Begin with nothing, yeah, begin with nothing, and unlock workshops, production buildings and temples through your own hard work.

722
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: All Egyptian specifically.

723
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:51.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Uh, I fun concept that there's no way I'm playing this game.

724
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.559
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: It's out now.

725
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:58.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's it's it's very cool. It looks you can see the Egyptian

726
00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:06.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I'm just I don't know the real realistic visuals are aren't working for me. That's that's probably the biggest problem

727
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, it has mixed steam reviews

728
00:52:10.579 --> 00:52:12.579
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's 71 of them

729
00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:14.559
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: 71 mixed reviews

730
00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.840
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: There you go, that sounds about Mike

731
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.900
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Most people suggesting the game does not include a lot of

732
00:52:22.039 --> 00:52:24.039
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: anything

733
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:39.920
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: stuff to do. Oh, man, I love, oh. Oh, okay. That, you know what? That's something. You

734
00:52:24.039 --> 00:52:27.840
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So it exists, but to what degree does this exist? Oh?

735
00:52:29.119 --> 00:52:33.500
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You can like just slaughter pigs with a knife and cut them up. Oh boy

736
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: You

737
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.960
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I mean, you're not wrong. It is something. I'm not sure if it's good or bad something

738
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:48.840
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: okay. Yeah. Look, if you're at the worst part is like, again, if they're going for like

739
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: this realistic thing, but I know is this, who's developed this?

740
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.199
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: this is like one guy, because it feels like a very neat, specific thing.

741
00:52:57.199 --> 00:53:02.480
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I want to make a realistic farming simulator, but ancient Egypt.

742
00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:05.699
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I don't think it's one guy because if you go to the developer, the developer is apparently A2 softworks

743
00:53:05.699 --> 00:53:11.900
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: and if you go to them on Steam they have 10 games, so I don't think it's gonna be one.

744
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: other stuff

745
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.480
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Well, oh

746
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:22.099
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Looting hits like climber sky is the limit and pirate commander. I love craft. It's okay

747
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:28.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Drill deal demo. There's no normal version of drill deal, just the drill deal demo.

748
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.960
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay

749
00:53:28.719 --> 00:53:35.199
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, and okay. I am I do this is the kind of game you'd expect from this

750
00:53:36.199 --> 00:53:38.199
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: developer

751
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.480
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, yeah it definitely looks like not a huge amount of effort has gone into this game.

752
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:55.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah. Yep. Possibly a lot of stock unity assets in here. Let's say that.

753
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.320
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I think that's probably fair.

754
00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yep. Okay.

755
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.320
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: All right, finally, Kevin, I know you love two things.

756
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Our most real games so far.

757
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:10.480
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: One, I know you love to hyper-analyze over almost no date data.

758
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I... I do enjoy that. You're right.

759
00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:15.639
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: And two, I know you love Minstone Island.

760
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:21.539
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I... do I like a strong word here, but I did enjoy. I beat it. I'll say that.

761
00:54:21.539 --> 00:54:25.619
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Like... I beat it. I haven't beaten other games that I love, so you know what, maybe.

762
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:33.940
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: this here. This here is maybe a new game. I'm not 100% sure, called minstone academy by the minstone

763
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

764
00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:42.659
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: island developers. And that's an all. It does. It does. It looks different enough that I think it's

765
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, that looks like a new game.

766
00:54:42.659 --> 00:54:50.019
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: probably a new game. Like the protagonist is clearly dressed very differently. And the movement,

767
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yup

768
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.820
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, but one of those magic cats

769
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.380
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: the movement is not

770
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:57.699
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: look the same like the way it moves through buildings and up the stairs is not

771
00:54:56.739 --> 00:54:58.739
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, that's a thing

772
00:54:57.699 --> 00:55:00.980
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: home in Stone Island work.

773
00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:05.659
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Nope, Muncho Island is flat flat or climbing like a ladder like it's very clear

774
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:12.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's very like Minecraft grid like let's say that this is there's a building and you're walking through it

775
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I mean still I submit.

776
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:26.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But there's also a by-school confirm by-squas two wheels, which is different for moons on island, which there placed an emphasis on fixing your broom and whatever.

777
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Um, so yeah, this is it.

778
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.460
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: The bike also is flying.

779
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:35.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It is, but a propeller, which is different like I like okay.

780
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:42.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't know why we do that. We had the brooms and you're clearly still going for a magic thing, but okay, whatever.

781
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.440
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Um, that's a new game.

782
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't know what it is.

783
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: We don't know.

784
00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:52.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: There are no monsters or creatures on this little trailer thing.

785
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: So, what kind of game is it?

786
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I have no idea.

787
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Not the slightest.

788
00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:03.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: There's also a big M on like a logo on inside the trailer on the ground.

789
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't think I actually called it some.

790
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.239
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Yeah, I think that's like instead of an H on a helicopter landing pad.

791
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

792
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.500

793
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.920
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So I think this is the runway.

794
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Something like that.

795
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: All right.

796
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:16.500

797
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You know what?

798
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I'm going to.

799
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I'm pointing my bat in here.

800
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I think it's a not just like sequel as it.

801
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's the next game.

802
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:27.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I think like it's going to be chronologically later for Moonstone Island.

803
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: And they built an academy on the island.

804
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

805
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: That's that's my thoughts.

806
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: So what will the gameplay be like?

807
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I don't know.

808
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: But I'm just saying that's I think it's going to be the same setting.

809
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Um, and just different stuff.

812
00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: - Different stuff, you'd hope so.

813
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: You'd hope so.

814
00:56:53.300 --> 00:57:02.179
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: We will bring the news to you at most a week late unless it is a special time like Christmas

<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah.

<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: So, an honesty stall is a stall where it's unmanned and you would have things out and you'd

825
00:57:58.059 --> 00:58:06.659
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: also have a place where you can place money to purchase one of the items.

826
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, no, that's

827
00:58:06.659 --> 00:58:10.059
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Then they have other languages they're planning to localise to.

828
00:58:10.059 --> 00:58:12.320

830
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Let's go ahead. I appreciate that always

831
00:58:20.699 --> 00:58:22.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Mmm

832
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:27.860
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Crafting decorating okay, I just I don't know by

833
00:58:28.219 --> 00:58:30.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: When you add a whole bunch of stuff in other games

834
00:58:30.699 --> 00:58:33.340
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I feel like to start to lose your identity a little. That's all I'm saying

835
00:58:34.219 --> 00:58:37.659
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Because this is the foraging game, right like go out find

836
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.980
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: But what are you doing with those things you're farage if you don't crash?

837
00:58:40.539 --> 00:58:42.539
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Oh, okay fine

838
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.420
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Because in enough both craft sources and I'm crossing

839
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.699
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Okay, you know what the crafting decorating is one thing the gardening

840
00:58:51.579 --> 00:58:56.219
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Now feels a little I guess you need resources you needed arm resources

841
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.239
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: I think it depends on the scale, right? If it stays small, then that's fine. But if you can go, like,

842
00:58:58.059 --> 00:59:00.059
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I guess so

843
00:59:01.239 --> 00:59:08.360
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: full, like, Stardew, I'm going to have a thousand things growing at once, then yeah, that's probably

844
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.239
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: [laughs]

845
00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.000
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: a bit too much.

846
00:59:09.239 --> 00:59:11.159
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, okay.

847

848
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:19.239
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: Finally, we have a new trailer for the Seven Deadly Sins Origin. This came with the game,

849
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:28.460
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: We didn't have it in our Game of the Year episode and award for the most baffling farming game, but this one's still taking it.

850
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:33.860
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: yeah I mean from this trailer there's not a lot of farming happening in this

851
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:47.480
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: trailer there's there's a lot of attacking and defending and a bolt I truly

852
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.500
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: Yeah, you're right.

853
00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:45.900
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: It's combat and moving and flying on flying animals.

854
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:51.219
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: believe there will be some farming in this game but I do not believe it is the

855
00:59:51.219 --> 00:59:54.659
<v 97594BE2-B4E4-47D7-9A2B-2FE3E0C7C395>Al: primary point of this game

856
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.679
<v BC75D77D-B34D-4523-BF08-768127363A69>Kevin: I guess not. I haven't seen the enemy right the monger or whatever. I don't know about this series. Oh, good times.

857
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:10.019
