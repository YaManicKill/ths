(35s) **Kevin:**

> My name is Kevin. Yeah, welcome to 2026 the year of the Kevin and the owl for the Chinese. So react. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(36s) **Al:**

> We're here today to talk about cottage core games

(39s)

> Kevin, we are two episodes in to the month of Kevin and Al

(49s)

> A little bit by little bit behind the scenes in the the the the team chat that I have on Slack

(55s)

> I just need to make that clear. It is not teams chat is a chat for the team

(1m)

> everybody else is busy this month. So it's just me and Kevin all month. But that's, but that's alright because I think the only game releasing this month is animal crossing anyway. Unfortunately all right. Well this episode we're going to do the long awaited newscat shop from the Christmas holidays.

(1m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. Yeah, which will be played. Unfortunately, runs are being held to my head multiple multiple.

(1m 30s) **Al:**

> There's been a lot of news and I didn't want to do all last episode. So now we're going to do the rest of it here. And we'll just we'll see how it goes.

(1m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1m 40s)

> All right. Let's do it.

## What Have We Been Up To

(1m 42s) **Al:**

> but first up Kevin, what have you been up to?

(1m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, not not much. I was thinking about that.

(1m 47s)

> Not terribly much. It's been a busy week. Um, uh, the battle cats. I, I re got that set up again, um,

(1m 55s)

> because I'm look, we all know it. I'm, I'm a huge mark. I'm, uh, I'm a sucker for the thing that

(2m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so tell us what the crossover was this time, then?

(2m 2s) **Kevin:**

> - You're funny.

(2m 5s)

> - Street Fighter is back in Battle Cats.

(2m 11s)

> What's kind of funny is, the first time they did it,

(2m 15s)

> it was still Street Fighter 5.

(2m 18s)

> And that was the character designs and the logo they used.

(2m 23s)

> But now they have upgraded to Street Fighter 6,

(2m 26s)

> which has released last year or whatever.

(2m 30s) **Al:**

> Does that have new characters?

(2m 30s) **Kevin:**

> And it does, so here's the funny thing.

(2m 34s)

> all the five characters, including some of the old designs,

(2m 37s)

> which are not being used in six,

(2m 39s)

> but they added two new characters from what six

(2m 44s)

> are in their six designs.

(2m 45s)

> So it's just really funny 'cause it's Street Fighter 6,

(2m 48s)

> but just don't look at the five stuff.

(2m 50s) **Al:**

> But, but way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, you say, you say designs like it's going to somehow look like the street fighter games, like this is like stick art, basically, right?

(2m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Don't worry about it.

(2m 51s)

[laughs]

(2m 56s)

> Yeah, yeah, costumes.

(3m)

> Well, I mean, that's the outfits.

(3m 4s)

> I think it would be crossovers actually get proper art.

(3m 10s)

> It's not just little, you said it's not cartoony,

(3m 13s)

> stick figure cats, they'll do some of those,

(3m 17s)

> but well, in for instance, Ryu, when you play as Ryu,

(3m 18s) **Al:**

> Oh my, okay. Oh wow.

(3m 21s) **Kevin:**

> it is actually Ryu who looks like Ryu

(3m 23s)

> with proper art and animation turn.

(3m 26s)

> When Sonic the Hedgehog released he was Sonic the Hedgehog,

(3m 29s)

> proper art and everything.

(3m 32s)

> You know, maybe it's not like full 3D

(3m 34s)

> art style, but they put the work.

(3m 37s)

> They make the guest characters look like themselves.

(3m 41s) **Al:**

> I'm... Cat.

(3m 42s) **Kevin:**

> So, so yeah, so Street Fighter 5,

(3m 46s)

> some of the designs from the outfits in five are being reused,

(3m 50s)

> even though they're slapping the six logo on and now.

(3m 53s)

> But anyways, it's a lot of fun.

(3m 55s)

> It's a beefy crossover.

(3m 56s)

> There's a total of, sure, it's like almost,

(4m 1s)

> there's like two banners on with eight each,

(4m 5s)

> it's close to 16.

(4m 5s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think it's I think it's 16. Yeah. I will say Cammy, one of the new fighters looks like an off the clock captain Marvel

(4m 7s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah, she does.

(4m 16s)

> I can see that she's missing her hat, that's the problem.

(4m 19s) **Al:**

> Captain Marvel got bored and decided to go beat up people

(4m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, she, yeah, I actually did pull Cammie.

(4m 26s)

> I did a few pulls and got Cammie, which is fun,

(4m 29s)

> but it's a problem 'cause I love Street Fighter

(4m 32s)

> and there's a lot of Street Fighter characters.

(4m 34s)

> And I'm the, I'm the worst luck, my brother Calvin.

(4m 38s)

> He's already pulled, I was not playing in the last time

(4m 41s)

> they did the co-lab, but he was so altogether right now.

(4m 45s)

> He's at seven characters, I think, from Street Fighter Collection.

(4m 49s)

> But anyway, so yeah, I'm gonna keep trying to grind

(4m 52s)

> and see if I can get something,

(4m 53s)

> but I probably won't, I have very bad luck.

(4m 56s)

> But I did get some of the cats 'cause they have all the characters

(4m 59s)

> and then they have the cat version of the characters,

(5m) **Al:**

> Maybe that's maybe that's what I'm thinking of then the cat

(5m 1s) **Kevin:**

> We're just a little, little brown cat, the...

(5m 5s)

> Yeah, because they do have that. They have them cosplaying as the characters, and they're very cute and funny.

(5m 12s)

> But yeah, that's the thing. I mean, it's still a fun game, I like battle cats.

(5m 17s)

> It's not hyper predatory, it's fairly decent for a Gotcha.

(5m 22s)

> It's running, it's been running for 11 years, which is really impressive for a mobile game, in my opinion.

(5m 28s)

> Yeah, so that's the big one. Other than that, I had picked...

(5m 34s)

> Tough animal crossing in Tetris.

(5m 39s) **Al:**

> what now? Oh, Tetris 19. I forget about that. That's still running. Goodness. Okay.

(5m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Tetris 99 is doing an event. Yeah.

(5m 44s)

> Yeah, yeah, and they'll drop, and you know every time they drop the special weekend theme, it's a reason for me to go in, because I love Tetris.

(5m 54s)

> And it's fine, and I think some of the other cross, like crossover themes are better.

(6m 1s)

> You know, with music, the thing with Tetris, right?

(6m 4s)

> It's going on, a visual, and the music and sound effects, right?

(6m 9s)

> So, you know, you've really got to knock it out of the park.

(6m 11s)

> And then I'm a cross answer.

(6m 12s)

> And they're okay.

(6m 13s)

> They don't hit quite as well as some of the Kirby ones, or even Xenoblade.

(6m 18s)

> Fire Emblem had a really good one.

(6m 20s)

> Oh, anyways.

(6m 21s) **Al:**

> of resounding endorsement.

(6m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah, Tetris 99.

(6m 22s)

> Good stuff.

(6m 23s)

> Yeah.

(6m 24s)

> I like Tetris.

(6m 26s)

> It's like the only game I will climb to be good at.

(6m 29s)

> Oh, but yeah, it's such as an inch out of that. Oh

(6m 34s)

> thing else that I can think. Oh, did I tell you about some of the, um, I recently went on a

(6m 41s)

> work trip. I think I mentioned I watched Superman. Did I ever talk about some of the other

(6m 45s)

> movies I watched on that trip? Okay. Um, yeah, I just occurred to me because of it. I was

(6m 50s)

> talking to someone about it. Um, uh, okay. So I watched Superman. Uh, the last year that was good.

(6m 56s)

> I watched the menu from 20 18 and whatever it was. I don't

(6m 57s) **Al:**

> it is. Oh, good film, 22 I think maybe. It's not that it's not that old. It's not that old.

(7m 4s) **Kevin:**

> remember, it's 20. Is it post COVID? It might be post COVID. Okay. Whatever. Well, you

(7m 7s) **Al:**

> 22, yeah, 22 hours rate. Yeah, I do. Good film. I enjoyed it. Yep. Well, you can't

(7m 10s) **Kevin:**

> know the one, the menu with, I don't remember the actors. Anya Taylor Joy. She's the only one

(7m 15s)

> I remember because she's got her, the eyes. Um, yeah. Oh, I do remember my number his name.

(7m 19s) **Al:**

> think you don't even remember Ray Faim's Faim's. Come on.

(7m 25s) **Kevin:**

> It was phenomenal. I, I do a little, uh, no, it's a little call me a little call.

(7m 27s) **Al:**

> didn't remember or you can't remember how it was pronounced. So you didn't want to say it just in case.

(7m 34s) **Kevin:**

> me. Um, but, uh, but yeah, that, that was a great one. Um, I love a good dark comedy

(7m 43s)

> film. Um, and, and that one does it well. And also like, I just love the lampooning of the

(7m 49s)

> whole gourmet, you know, hyper gourmet world. Um, because it's, it's pretty nonsensical,

(7m 54s)

> but, uh, but yeah, the menu, good, good film for people who don't know it. It's literally

(7m 59s)

> about a super exclusive, there's like what? Just less than 20 people and

(8m 4s)

> a dinner service on an island that's a restaurant home and then I'll leave it at that it's it's

(8m 10s)

> dark comedy I'll say that that's the genre go figure out how that fits in good times um let's see I watched

(8m 20s)

> the naked gun from last year with Liam Neeson okay have you seen the other any of the other naked

(8m 25s) **Al:**

> I have not seen that

(8m 30s)

> No, but I'm aware of the idea and I I have I you know, I have watched various similar

(8m 36s)

> Kinds of comedy, right? Like I know the comedy. It's it's going for it's not my favorite kind of comedy, but I get it

(8m 37s) **Kevin:**

> No, sure sure sure. Okay, you know the style of comedy

(8m 43s)

> Yeah, yeah, well that kind of like hyper just over the top almost surrealist comedy

(8m 51s)

> It's kind of dead right now

(8m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah, airplane style comedy, I guess you could,

(8m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, exactly airplane style comedy. Yeah, that's correct. Um, well, you know, it's kind of dead

(8m 53s) **Al:**

> it feels like kind of one of the earlier ones.

(8m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Right now I would say right you know, it's seen that much of it

(9m 3s)

> This one is just line-up homogenically going fool

(9m 7s)

> back into that style of comedy so they're just you know running like two or three jokes a minute

(9m 14s)

> and some of them are very funny when you're just throwing out that many a lot of the

(9m 19s)

> movements so there's some bangers in there Liam Neeson I enjoy his work and they play because

(9m 29s)

> you know he's still playing the super serious rugged grizzly cop character and they play with

(9m 35s)

> that well.

(9m 38s)

> It's so stupid, but they did it so much it won me over.

(9m 42s)

> They're just a running gag where people just keep handing them coffee cups out of it.

(9m 46s)

> No way.

(9m 47s)

> I just like out of random places.

(9m 49s)

> And it just lawns.

(9m 50s)

> It's like that.

(9m 52s)

> I enjoyed it.

(9m 53s)

> Good times.

(9m 54s)

> But yeah, I recommend it.

(9m 56s)

> It got chuckles out of me.

(9m 58s)

> Yeah, good old naked gun.

(10m 2s)

> Let's see.

(10m 3s)

> What else?

(10m 4s)

> Oh, oh, this is the 28.

(10m 7s)

> Yeah, I watch that finally, you know, I'm here. I am eight years late to the party. What can I say? It's a good film.

(10m 9s) **Al:**

> Oh yes, yep.

(10m 17s)

> Don't worry, I watched it, I only watched it last year.

(10m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, well, there you go. Well, good film. Right? Jordan Peele did do good stuff. Yeah, I don't have much to say. Yeah.

(10m 30s) **Al:**

> I still I still find it funny that like Jordan peel half of key and peel has become like one of the go-to

(10m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(10m 37s)

> Yeah.

(10m 38s) **Al:**

> harder produce directors

(10m 41s)

> Just just bizarre

(10m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(10m 44s)

> Okay.

(10m 45s) **Al:**

> Get you someone who can do both right?

(10m 45s) **Kevin:**

> You know what's bizarre?

(10m 47s)

> Yeah, exactly.

(10m 49s)

> Yeah.

(10m 50s)

> And because he's still like unintentionally or not, he keeps the humor in a lot of his

(10m 55s)

> movies, right?

(10m 56s)

> Like there's bits and pieces that are like harder or just absurdists, right?

(11m 2s)

> That make me laugh at least.

(11m 5s)

> But, dude, you know what's bizarre about that whole...

(11m 7s)

> thing for me. I didn't really pay attention to key and peel. So, I learned about Jordan

(11m 13s)

> Peel from get out really. So, the one that kills me is, you know, the reaction gift

(11m 15s) **Al:**

> and you're like, "Wait, the famed horror director was in our comedy, Jill?"

(11m 27s) **Kevin:**

> of peel just sweating, just copious amounts of sweat. The first time I saw it was after, you know,

(11m 29s) **Al:**

> Yes.

(11m 34s) **Kevin:**

> like, yeah, I was like, is that trying to peel?

(11m 37s)

> Why did somebody get this in their sweaty? Yeah, I mean, that's fine. That's all you need really. But yeah, they're clear. Oh, man. But yeah, I mean, I have gone back and watch the clips. They're phenomenal stuff. We're gonna say. But yeah, all right, that's that's all I got. That's my horrendous movie roundup. What's been going on over there in there?

(11m 40s) **Al:**

> I've never, like, I've never specifically watched like an episode of their sketch show.

(11m 48s)

> I just see the clips all the time.

(12m 9s)

> Let's see, so we're continuing to play Pokemon the DLC

(12m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so frustrating. It's so weird

(12m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think I think I would go so far as to say this is the worst DLC they've done

(12m 24s)

> And and the problem is that it's purely because of just like a couple of decisions

(12m 29s)

> They made that make it just so frustrating. So obviously the timer on the donuts is one of them. It's very frustrating

(12m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(12m 36s)

> What I heard it described that is like almost every part of it is random, right?

(12m 41s)

> like the ingredients you need or the donut.

(12m 43s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah, exactly, there's there's there's there's a level of it, right?

(12m 44s) **Kevin:**

> You make is kind of randomized. Okay. Okay.

(12m 49s) **Al:**

> So you have five different flavors you can have in it and each each berry has a certain amount of flavor and

(12m 55s)

> the amount of flavor

(12m 58s)

> determines

(12m 59s)

> What you will get out of it. What powers you'll get out of it, but

(13m 3s)

> There's still a lot of RNG, right? So if you put in a lot of sweet, you are

(13m 10s)

> likely to get a shining power

(13m 13s)

> but

(13m 14s)

> It's random which type it is for example, right? So like I'm currently trying to get shiny Glimit

(13m 24s)

> But I can't seem to for the life of me get a donut with shining power rock or shining power poison

(13m 31s)

> I did get one that was shining power for all types, but it's only level one

(13m 35s)

> So it really doesn't increase the odds very much and that that is very frustrating. So yeah, that's the other thing

(13m 40s)

> It's like the timer, the timer in and of itself wouldn't be a problem.

(13m 43s)

> Because the sandwiches had timers in the last game.

(13m 45s) **Kevin:**

> No. Yeah. Right. Exactly.

(13m 47s) **Al:**

> But the problem with the timer is that it's also defining how long you can stay in a specific area.

(13m 56s)

> And also, the fact that there's so many auto saves so you can't just reset in many cases.

(14m 2s)

> So it's like all those things together.

(14m 4s)

> And the thing that's really been frustrating me the last week, and before anyone says it, yes, I know I don't have to keep playing it shut up.

(14m 10s)

> I have to finish this, right?

(14m 12s) **Kevin:**

> They listen to the show.

(14m 13s) **Al:**

> I just need to, I just need to, I've got like 20 Pokemon life to go.

(14m 18s)

> But this is the thing that's really frustrating me just now,

(14m 21s)

> is the Pokemon and the DLC are all in these hyperspace dimensions

(14m 26s)

> which you get to using the donuts.

(14m 28s)

> And each day or night, there's like a different list of areas.

(14m 32s)

> It's kind of like the raids in Scarlet and Violet, right?

(14m 35s)

> There's a certain amount and then you can reset it and get more.

(14m 39s)

> And each area has specific Pokemon.

(14m 41s)

> And so the problem is that there's still

(14m 43s)

> like a few Pokemon that I can't get, and I have to keep reloading the day to get like different hyperspace areas so that I can actually catch all the Pokemon, but the thing that's really annoying is there's a bunch of legendary Pokemon, which you get through what's called special scans, which you get the special scans once you've done the story of the DLC and you've done the post game story of the DLC, and so you special scans, they will get you like a rare hyperspace area that will have

(15m 13s)

> in Pokemon, sometimes we'll have legendary Pokemon on it, sometimes won't, and so you have to do like, you have to do tasks to gain points to be able to do the special scan, which then will give you a special area which may or may not have one of the legendary Pokemon in it, and then once you've done that, or it might just be another area with just like a whole bunch of powerful Venusaur for some reason, or it might be a battle area, both things I don't want right now.

(15m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Oh yeah.

(15m 41s) **Al:**

> I just want to get the legend

(15m 43s)

> to get a special scan to then do it again and get another one so it's like I don't actually have any of the legendary Pokemon from the special scans and I've done full of them already so it's like I don't it's just so it's the most it's like they went oh we love our people okay it's like they went oh people miss the RNG

(16m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah!

(16m 10s) **Al:**

> They loved the going into a...

(16m 13s)

> into the grass and RNG, giving them a Pokemon.

(16m 17s)

> Rather than seeing Pokemon and being able to run into them.

(16m 20s)

> Which, I don't miss.

(16m 21s)

> But they may be saw that some people missed that.

(16m 24s)

> Anyway, that's fine. Let's give them RNG.

(16m 26s)

> Here's all of the RNG. Everything is RNG.

(16m 29s)

> Everything is RNG. The donuts are RNG.

(16m 32s)

> The powers you get from the donuts are RNG.

(16m 35s)

> The hyperspace areas you get are RNG.

(16m 38s)

> The special scans that you get are RNG.

(16m 41s)

> It's just everything and it's so

(16m 43s)

> frustrating and it's taking so long, this might be the hardest

(16m 48s)

> Pokedex to finish. I've ever done. It's just so and it's not even difficult. It's just so time-consuming

(16m 55s)

> You're just doing the same thing over and over and over again

(16m 59s)

> The good thing is there are still poucomon I can shiny hunt in this game

(17m 3s)

> So I'm just like that is what is keeping me going right like I'm shiny hunting a poucomon

(17m 7s)

> And then it's like okay, now I can get a special scan and oh my word

(17m 13s)

> I don't know how I think really the only reason I'm completing this at this point is because you know there's gonna be a home

(17m 21s)

> Thing a poucomon home

(17m 23s)

> Reward for having done the poucomodex

(17m 25s)

> And so it's like I want that

(17m 29s)

> This DLC is just such baffling decisions

(17m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, Pokemon's been good, been staying strong with that lead, yeah, but it is wild that at least

(17m 40s) **Al:**

> Such a frustrating

(17m 44s) **Kevin:**

> the like decks completion part of it, you think would be easier. But yeah, what I, I mean,

(17m 51s)

> because I know people a lot of people including people listen to this right now here about

(17m 55s)

> shiny hunting and and and you guys are sick of freaks. So, you know, whatever happens to you guys

(18m 1s)

> That's so weird, but...

(18m 2s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, yeah. I know I am the problem here looking at my shiny decks. I've got 72 Pokemon left to go

(18m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, but the fact that, you know, even just acts completion, just hitting those legendarys is so difficult because RNG, that's wild, that is really wild.

(18m 7s) **Al:**

> So I know I'm the problem here

(18m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Um, I don't know. That's a baffling, like you said. Uh, makes you glad that it's poetic.

(18m 31s)

> Oh, make a book, oh yeah.

(18m 33s)

> Ha, ha, ha.

(18m 35s) **Al:**

> But on on the subject of being a sicko and unhealthy coping mechanisms, I have bought a 3D printer

(18m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that you know what look, I think that's one of the better ones because at least you get a physical thing out of it, right?

(18m 46s) **Al:**

> So I am one of those people name

(18m 55s)

> A physical thing, a physical thing that you have to keep putting filament into and creating

(18m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Like it there is.

(19m 1s) **Al:**

> things that are so unnecessary.

(19m 4s) **Kevin:**

> No, I'm saying the stuff you create is, I mean, it's unnecessary, but it's still a thing like there is a potential for utilitarianism.

(19m 13s)

> But I look, I think 3D printers are one of the coolest pieces of tech that's come out in the last 20 years or so and and to hit the degree of affordability that they are. That's, that's awesome. I say good for you. Good sir. Yeah, I have you fired her up yet.

(19m 31s) **Al:**

> So I've plugged it all in, but I haven't actually done anything with it yet, because you're finding the time to be like, okay, I'm going to take like two hours and just like focus on this and understand it that's difficult.

(19m 45s)

> Try to find the time, but I'll find it soon. I'll find it soon. My, my, my big thing that I want to do this is organizational waste stuff. There's a whole bunch of like grid based things that I want to do in terms of like cable management and stuff like that.

(19m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Be sure, sure.

(20m 1s) **Al:**

> We're having our say again, sorry.

(20m 2s) **Kevin:**

> It's time to print your own game cases.

(20m 7s)

> Time to print your own game case.

(20m 10s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, yeah, maybe.

(20m 14s)

> I, we've got our, we're getting our kitchen redone. It's the last that we moved into this house nine years ago and it's like the last kind of big thing we wanted to do with the house because I had such a tiny kitchen.

(20m 27s)

> And so we're getting it extended a little bit.

(20m 29s)

> And so I'm thinking about this.

(20m 31s)

> In terms of, you know, there's a bunch of ways I want to organize things more efficiently

(20m 35s)

> and make my life better using 3D printed stuff.

(20m 39s)

> So that is my plan.

(20m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, that's cool. Let's see that that's useful at the 3D print your ideal space rack. Go for it

(20m 41s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(20m 43s)

> Well, exactly.

(20m 44s)

> That's the thing.

(20m 47s)

> And then, of course, Craig, my son is like, can we print my craft?

(20m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Right right and I'm done down to that. You know, I don't think that's right

(21m 1s)

> Every Pokemon

(21m 1s) **Al:**

> And I'm like, OK, right, I see where you want.

(21m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah time yeah, it's on the make your own amigo good good for you guys

(21m 7s) **Al:**

> All right, shall we get into the news?

## News

(21m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Let's do it cuz I hear things happen

(21m 21s) **Al:**

> So as I normally do, when we're doing our news catch-up, and there's a lot of news, I've

(21m 26s)

> separated it out into sections.

(21m 28s)

> I'm going to start with releases.

## Game Releases

(21m 31s) **Al:**

> So first up, we have the Animal Crossing New Horizons Switch 2 Edition and 3.0 coming out soon.

## Animal Crossing: New Horizons

(21m 37s) **Al:**

> But we just got some new information yesterday that there is as well as the 3.0 update,

(21m 46s)

> which is available for everyone, and the paid Switch 2 update, which is available if you buy it.

(21m 52s)

> We're also going to have a free Switch 2 upgrade as well.

(21m 58s)

[laughter]

(22m)

> Which will-- which--

(22m 1s)

> Well, upgrade the-- it's all what it says is, visuals optimized for the Nintendo Switch

(22m 7s)

> to display and improved image quality.

(22m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so what's the the paid part includes the mega phone item I guess

(22m 11s) **Al:**

> That's all we know.

(22m 12s)

[laughter]

(22m 21s)

> Yes, yes, and also, it didn't, so it didn't explicitly say improved resolution on the free update, but the paid one does say improved resolution.

(22m 34s)

> So I don't know what they mean in terms of improved graphics if they don't mean improved resolution, but it's possible. There's a distinction there or something.

(22m 42s)

> But yeah, the paid one gives you the most control support and the megaphone and maybe some more visual improvements on top of the free one.

(22m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Wow, that...

(22m 51s) **Al:**

> I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like at this point, right, I'm going to need to like not buy the upgrade pack, get the free upgrade, look at it, and then upgrade it and see if it looks any different.

(22m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. That doesn't sound worth it at all.

(22m 54s)

[laughing]

(23m 8s)

> Yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Oh,

(23m 11s) **Al:**

> This is the investigative journalism that you expect from this podcast.

(23m 14s) **Kevin:**

> ha, ha, ha. And don't demand, but we do it anyway.

(23m 21s) **Al:**

> Nobody has asked for this.

(23m 25s) **Kevin:**

> We need our comparison matrix.

(23m 28s) **Al:**

> It's so confusing. So yeah, and that comes out the same day. So that's this, in fact, it'll be tomorrow if you listen to this on release day.

(23m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh that's oh my gosh we're almost out of the halfway point of January.

(23m 38s) **Al:**

> Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I've just, so someone says, and I don't know whether this is true or not, that it looks like the improved graphics in the free update is only in portable mode.

(23m 51s)

> The paid version gives you 4K and don't.

(23m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, and I make that check out. I'll take that

(24m)

> Makes it sound like a big one still

(24m 5s) **Al:**

> We will see, anyway, what a weird decision to make this public.

(24m 7s) **Kevin:**

> We'll see

(24m 9s)

> what else

(24m 11s) **Al:**

> No, and not tell us that they're saying they announced everything else.

(24m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(24m 16s)

> That's that's classic Nintendo confusion marketing

(24m 16s) **Al:**

> Anyway.

## Cozy Caravan

(24m 21s) **Al:**

> Cozy Caravan, 1.0 is no out, so that was in early access for a while.

(24m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Speaking of animal cross hit with lights

(24m 27s) **Al:**

> Speaking of definitely not animal crossing is nothing like animal.

(24m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Now legally mistaken

(24m 33s) **Al:**

> So... the...

(24m 36s)

> They released in early access...

(24m 39s)

> some time ago.

(24m 41s)

> I can't, in fact, there we go.

(24m 42s) **Kevin:**

> January 8th. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah

(24m 43s) **Al:**

> May last May 2024.

(24m 45s)

> And their 1.0 then came out a couple days ago.

(24m 49s)

> So this is the 1.0.

(24m 51s)

> They also have announced their Switch release is coming on the 15th.

(24m 56s) **Kevin:**

> that's off to them. I respect that, whoops. Or maybe they'll look like the gay man on top.

(25m 4s) **Al:**

> Who knows, maybe they will regret it.

(25m 12s)

> Maybe who I doubt it, but we'll see.

(25m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh.

(25m 15s) **Al:**

> Next, the farmer was replaced.

## The Farmer Was Replaced

(25m 18s) **Al:**

> This is the coding farming game,

(25m 22s)

> which I really, really need to play,

(25m 24s)

> has announced that they are now on Mac OS.

(25m 27s)

> So that's good, because then I can actually play it.

(25m 30s)

> Because I feel like this is not going to work well

(25m 34s)

> with this game.

(25m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe just you may have difficulty is

(25m 37s) **Al:**

> Programming on a steam deck.

(25m 39s)

> Whoa, sounds super fun.

(25m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, some of those keys might not bind like you thought

(25m 50s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so, yeah, I'm going to have to get this purchased

(25m 54s)

> and installed on Mac and play at some point.

(25m 57s)

> It does look fun.

(25m 58s)

> I do have a better problem,

(26m)

> and that I'm not, I don't tend to program very much

(26m 2s)

> program very much inside of work because.

(26m 4s)

> Well, you know.

(26m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Why would you cook yourself a five star meal when you're already working at a restaurant, right?

(26m 11s) **Al:**

> I, well, I mean, that is not a great analogy because you want to eat food.

(26m 19s) **Kevin:**

> No, I know I know I'm just saying you don't want to cook the whole thing

(26m 22s)

> Like the thing stands

(26m 23s)

> I'm just saying like if you're a chef you probably just microwave a meal at home because you're tired and you don't want to cook anymore

(26m 28s) **Al:**

> Oh, I thought he said book, you said cook a five star, I think he said book a five star meal. I was like, I felt like this was saying making the complete opposite point of what you were trying to make here.

(26m 32s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

(26m 32s)

> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm the opposite. Yeah, exactly. You probably would want to book a meal

(26m 42s) **Al:**

> That makes much more sense.

(26m 47s)

> That makes much more sense.

(26m 50s)

> Yeah, I used to do it quite a lot, but then I had kids and then the kids grew up.

(26m 56s) **Kevin:**

> oh that'll do it yeah that's that's why

(26m 58s) **Al:**

> And I got tired.

(27m 3s)

> But this does look fun either way, but yeah, it's now on Mac. There we go.

(27m 8s)

> Next, we have Super Farming by have announced that they're coming to Xbox on the 16th.

## Super Farming Boy

(27m 17s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, you know, I remember that one that's

(27m 19s)

> Hayotic was a good way of describing it

(27m 23s)

> With action adventure and there's farming and combos and

(27m 29s)

> Slots off good for them. Well, I pick it up under the art style. It's still really good. I'll say that super stylish

(27m 36s)

> I don't have an Xbox. Well Microsoft might say I have an Xbox. I don't know. They say a lot of things are an Xbox

(27m 42s) **Al:**

> This is the next part.

(27m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(27m 47s)

> So yeah, I don't know if my switch is the next box yet, but but good good for them

(27m 53s)

> It's that's a fun one. I'm gonna try it out on steam at some point. It's cute

(27m 58s) **Al:**

> Speaking of cute tiny garden have announced that their switch version is coming in cute

## Tiny Garden

(28m 4s) **Kevin:**

> still

(28m 6s)

> Excuse me still not the play date. I can't use the crank mechanics. Oh, you know, but but no

(28m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah. That's a whole, that's a bigger deal, porting to the playdate. You got to, you got

(28m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I know I get it. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's fine

(28m 19s) **Al:**

> to rethink how your UI works.

(28m 23s) **Kevin:**

> But hey good for them. There's one thing we know here that

(28m 28s)

> Rigage core for people usually have a switch and we'll buy things on that so tiny garden

(28m 34s)

> Switch good for you tiny garden people. It's more money

(28m 40s)

> Hopefully more than you spent to board it

## Outbound

(28m 43s) **Al:**

> And the final one in our releases section is outbound,

(28m 47s)

> have announced that they are physical and collector's editions

(28m 49s)

> are now available to pre-order.

(28m 51s)

> So they have physical and collector's editions of all the releases

(28m 59s)

> that's Switch to PS5 and PC.

(29m 3s)

> Who's buying a physical game for PC?

(29m 5s) **Kevin:**

> oh my gosh oh people didn't buy back that in the 90s I think good

(29m 5s) **Al:**

> What's happening here? Are we in the 90s again?

(29m 7s)

> I really don't understand what's happening here.

(29m 9s)

> Like shoot presumably.

(29m 13s)

> Like it does say physical game, but like surely it's a code for Steam, right?

(29m 19s) **Kevin:**

> You had hope so. Let's see who's not LRG. I'll say that so good for them

(29m 28s)

> But hey, that's cool. Are they getting physical releases? That's pretty cool

(29m 33s)

> I didn't realize this thing. We're so close to releasing, but yeah, here we are

(29m 39s)

> That's pretty that's really impressive all these collective additions all that for them

(29m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah so I think they've said that their release of this game is now Q2 this year so that's how close we

(29m 50s)

> are. They've also said that they're expecting that the digital price will be cheaper than the

(29m 57s)

> physical price that they've got here which the PC pricing is $30 or 25 pound.

(30m 4s) **Kevin:**

> which probably makes sense, yeah.

(30m 6s) **Al:**

> So I mean I'm guessing it will be $25 then probably for the game.

(30m 12s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, yeah, that'll be my guess.

(30m 14s) **Al:**

> Presumably these physical ones are coming later. I've just, I fact they do keep talking about

(30m 19s)

> physical but like they're not going to have a DVD in that PC thing. Are they? Are like a USB stick?

(30m 26s) **Kevin:**

> ha ha ha now that's that I hope that's not a thing that sounds concerning unless they're

(30m 27s) **Al:**

> Like do you get physical PC games anymore? Is that a thing?

(30m 37s) **Kevin:**

> unless you're like and now you know what no no I'm just gonna say no even if you are getting

(30m 43s)

> them from a guy in an alleyway it probably still be a code ha ha ha ha ha ha I just

(30m 49s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Oh.

(30m 50s) **Kevin:**

> look I know been following and covering it but how high can you go on out

(30m 56s)

> your outbound you're in your RV that's what I need to know can I build a building on

(30m 58s) **Al:**

> well we will I will definitely be pushing those limits so it looks like a limited run do USB sticks

(31m) **Kevin:**

> it yeah we need to know really that's that's wild that's that feels weird I don't

(31m 10s) **Al:**

> apparently apparently so it is fascinating I don't want to

(31m 20s) **Kevin:**

> I think I did comfortable.

(31m 22s)

> I don't know why.

(31m 23s) **Al:**

> I love this. Well, surely there's no difference here, right? Like, it's just like when we talk

(31m 30s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, it just feels sketchy.

(31m 31s) **Al:**

> about digital and physical, it's all digital. It is all just ones and zeros. It's just about

(31m 36s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(31m 39s) **Al:**

> whether it's on a USB stick or on a DVD. But like, I can't imagine anybody selling games on a DVD

(31m 39s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(31m 43s)

> - Yeah.

(31m 45s) **Al:**

> anymore. Like, nobody has disk drives anymore. I mean, yes, you're before people, right? And yes, of course,

(31m 47s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(31m 53s) **Al:**

> some people do have disk drives. I have a disk drive, a USB blu-ray drive that I can use for things.

(31m 57s)

> But I don't want to have to plug it into my computer to play a game.

(32m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, I, I get that we have moved past even I, notorious, uh,

(32m 10s)

> well, I who digs my heels in and fights back against the, the ongoing wave of the future.

(32m 15s)

> Uh, I, I'm not, yeah, I'm beyond the DVD, how this, uh, fired up on steam.

(32m 22s) **Al:**

> Anyway, next we're gonna talk about updates. So first up we have research story 1.1 the decore

(32m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Look, I still type Google.com to go Google things.

(32m 26s)

> That's how we'll, we'll pledge and stuck in the past from him.

## Game Updates

## Research Story

(32m 37s) **Kevin:**

> What is Cody responsible for this week?

(32m 40s) **Al:**

> Huh the decore and heart event tracker update such a catchy name

(32m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, oh, that's, oh, that excites some people.

(32m 48s) **Al:**

> Can you guess? Can you guess what this update includes, Kevin?

(32m 52s) **Kevin:**

> It includes, this is the, hey, look, we can track things now.

(32m 56s)

> Look at us, look at us, look at us.

(32m 57s)

[laughs]

(32m 59s)

> Cracking stuff with a whole bunch of decor.

(33m 1s)

> That's, oh, look, you know, I know animal crossing technically

(33m 7s)

> catalog, but I'm so thankful they never, ever pushed

(33m 11s)

> for, you know, to like actually complete it.

(33m 14s)

[laughs]

(33m 15s)

> Oh, 'cause that's, that's a dangerous game to play.

(33m 18s)

> Catalog here in record, you're, you're, you're big core.

(33m 21s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(33m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Then it's your, finished your decoration decks.

(33m 25s) **Al:**

> Yes, I think I I understand that for a smaller list of things, right?

(33m 30s)

> Like you give me a couple hundred things I could see myself doing that, right?

(33m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at all those empty spots in that one list. Look at them. Look at them. Look at them. Don't you feel.

(33m 35s) **Al:**

> You give me 10,000 things and I'm gonna hate you forever that you've given me a list. I can't complete

(33m 43s)

> Whereas yeah, like if you just give me things give me things that's fine

(33m 46s)

> But don't not do not give me 10,000 things in a list where I can see them

(33m 52s)

> That's what I do not want because that is just mean

(34m 2s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(34m 2s) **Al:**

> Yes, I do. Just for clarification, the heart event tracker in this update. So heart events already

(34m 9s)

> existed. This is just a tracker to tell you what your next one is. And it also lists requirements

(34m 15s)

> for the next heart event. I agreed.

(34m 16s) **Kevin:**

> See that's actually great. That's good. Which I think is the standard in cottagecore now or word we're close to it, right? Some kind of

(34m 22s) **Al:**

> I think I wouldn't say standard. I would say that like it's what people want. I don't think it's

(34m 30s)

> standard yet sadly. I think there are a lot to give

(34m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, we're close to it.

(34m 32s) **Al:**

> to make a difference. I'm saying here if you go here something can happen and so it's not telling you

(34m 52s)

> what to do and where to and who is with and stuff it just tells you something can happen if you go here

(34m 58s)

> which I felt like was kind of the nice it still gave a little bit of mystery right you don't

(35m 2s)

> it's going to happen with you don't know what's going to happen we get there but you know that you can

(35m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Sure, sure.

(35m 6s) **Al:**

> go somewhere to do it so it feels like you're still unlocking things as you go but the ability to go

(35m 14s)

> yes yeah I'm going to go deal with that just now I quite like that. Opidum have released their 1.2 update

## Oppidum

(35m 23s) **Al:**

> and it includes they have released many games

(35m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Australia, what horrors and the natural world has been unleashed.

(35m 32s)

> Oh, is it? Okay, what kind of mini games? Wait, beach punk battle. Oh, there you go. There's the one where you fight all the giant huntsman's

(35m 41s)

> Battle arena.

(35m 42s) **Al:**

> That'll be in a wave, fight waves of enemies and get rewards.

(35m 47s) **Kevin:**

> It's cool. Wait, wait, wait. What's a benny? Is that an Australian?

(35m 53s)

> I don't know what that is. I'm saying because when you play beach punk, the play gets other people or benny's. I don't know what a benny is.

(36m 5s)

> Yeah, I don't know what that is. I'll look that up. It might be a thing exclusive to this game. I don't know.

(36m 9s) **Al:**

> Who knows, I also haven't played it.

## Everdream Village

(36m 14s) **Al:**

> Evergreen Village have released their 1.6 update.

(36m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Well, okay, wait, which one's this all these names of whom is it see when we start let's talk about all the games the name start blaring together which one's ever doing village, okay, I'm looking okay, it's full 3.

(36m 29s) **Al:**

> This is the one where it's build your ideal cozy farm in a living, come on.

(36m 36s)

> This is the one that is the sequel to Everdream Valley, I think.

(36m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yes, no, remember yes, okay, yes, yes, not dream my valley, it's not

(36m 48s)

> making him out. Sure, that's true. Okay, auto run. Oh, yeah, that's great like the one naming convention we still have.

(36m 48s) **Al:**

> No, but this one is ever dream village. We don't often get village in a name. So that's different

(36m 55s)

> Anyway, this is the quality of life improvements

(36m 58s)

> Now don't be confused by it being called the 1.6 update. This game is still in early access. It is not hit 1.0 yet

(37m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. All right, here.

(37m 18s)

> What's the better option here, Al? When you hit, you know, or hit the official release, do you go to two or 3.0, or did you just start over and you go to 1.0, but official release?

(37m 32s) **Al:**

> I think you start over

(37m 32s) **Kevin:**

> It's still we can prepare 1.6 update before and after.

(37m 36s) **Al:**

> The worst the worst the worst one for me is slime rancher 2 which hit 1.0

(37m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(37m 46s) **Al:**

> Because it's not it's lime rancher 2 how can it be 1.0?

(37m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(37m 54s)

> Oh, good time. Sorry, ever.

(37m 59s)

> Look, ever jambula that you do have cute animals. I'll say that.

(38m 2s) **Al:**

> Is that enough to us?

(38m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe when you reach, maybe when you reach the post 1.6 1.0, well, I play maybe.

(38m 10s) **Al:**

> All right, next, Far Lands have released their 0.7 update and that has quality of life

(38m 16s)

> improvements. Also, a motorbike. Also, I think it's a hoverbike, according, based on the

(38m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Right, that's cool. Why which which

(38m 25s)

> That these aren't not mutually exclusive. I don't okay. I'm looking yeah

(38m 30s) **Al:**

> Well, so here's the problem. Here's here's my problem

(38m 33s)

> hover bike motor bike bike

(38m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(38m 37s) **Al:**

> bicycle by

(38m 39s)

> To what does it have to of this hover bike

(38m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(38m 43s)

> It has two round parts don't know worry about it

(38m 47s) **Al:**

> No, it doesn't it doesn't

(38m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Not this when it has two handles suck no, you're not wrong

(38m 55s) **Al:**

> do you know what do you know in this naming convention the one that annoys me the most is quad bike

(39m) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah

(39m 1s) **Al:**

> a quad bike should actually be called a motor quad cycle or a motor quake

(39m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Right, right, oh, what are you going to roll off the tongue? Yeah, or just a quad cycle right?

(39m 11s)

> Quad cycle just quad cycle that that works enough. Yeah, what bank? Yeah, I get it. You know what that bothers me to

(39m 20s)

> Okay. Well, would you call this hover thing?

(39m 23s) **Al:**

> That's Peter. I think Star Wars solved

(39m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Let's be assured

(39m 27s)

> Sure, yeah, now this is podcast now this is podcasting. Look. I said the thing

(39m 36s)

> 0.7 to oh

(39m 39s) **Al:**

> Oh, I just noticed apparently speeders are actually called speeder bikes. Oh, I give up

(39m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(39m 50s)

> Feet and this is part of the pain of early access

(39m 54s)

> Like I guess it's just the nature of the beast of seeing the sausage made but every time I see these like

(40m)

> Things being added. I'm like, oh good for you. You're adding all these quality of life things that should be in there

(40m 6s)

> Boy, I feel bad for people who are playing without

(40m 9s) **Al:**

> That's why you don't play early access, right?

(40m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that is actually a big part. Well, I don't play early

(40m 17s) **Al:**

> All right, well, an update that's not an early access update,

## Bugaboo Pocket

(40m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(40m 21s) **Al:**

> because this game's already out, is Bugaboo Pocket.

(40m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I'm not a fan of the image. Who's that buggable?

(40m 30s) **Al:**

> is they've released a new bug. It's a bug looking bug.

(40m 34s) **Kevin:**

> It's it's it's what I it looks arachnating nature, and I'm not a big fake

(40m 40s)

> It's something about it just being a silhouette that I'm not a fan of

(40m 45s)

> Hmm, I just not don't fully know

(40m 50s)

> color variants for non shiny. Oh goodness. Wait unique color variants for non

(40m 53s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so more more color variants

(40m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Tiny bugs. Oh my gosh

(40m 58s) **Al:**

> So so they've got so the got shiny they've got shiny bugs right where every rare ones will have a different color but

(41m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(41m 5s) **Al:**

> Each non shiny one can also be slightly different color. It's not like super different

(41m 10s)

> It's not like one day is blue the next is yellow, but it's like the example they show is like different shades of yellow or orange

(41m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, like different shades of orange.

(41m 17s)

> Yeah, which, look, okay, here's the thing I've talked about this before, right?

(41m 23s) **Al:**

> I

(41m 23s) **Kevin:**

> I don't think every creature collect your needs Chinese first.

(41m 25s)

> Well, I'm going to, that's my line in the sand second of all, like, if you're going to do

(41m 30s)

> Chinese, but then include variants that aren't Chinese, like, I don't know.

(41m 34s)

> I just feel like you're, you're cheapening the experience here and end.

(41m 39s)

> Oh, I don't know.

(41m 40s)

> We're just, I feel like we're chasing two rabbits here.

(41m 43s) **Al:**

> I agree with that. I feel like you go one or the other. I also say I think most

(41m 48s)

> creature collectors probably shouldn't have shinies because I'm going to be

(41m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Yeah.

(41m 53s) **Al:**

> honest with you, creature collector. You are not Pokemon. I am I am not going to

(41m 59s)

> put in the time to shiny hunt in your game. Just not going to do it. You know

(42m 4s)

> how long it takes to shiny hunt? It takes a long time. I have thousands of

(42m 10s)

> I was in, and combined all my Pokemon games.

(42m 13s)

> thousands of hours, you will be lucky if I give you a hundred.

(42m 18s)

> If I give you, if I give you a hundred hours in your game, you will be one of my most

(42m 23s)

> played games, like top 20, right?

(42m 25s) **Kevin:**

> And, and it especially kills me Yeah, it kills me because especially in like more realistic

(42m 26s) **Al:**

> I'm not shiny hunting in your game, no one is shiny hunting in your game, sorry.

(42m 40s) **Kevin:**

> version variants like this one right where we're you know they're trying to you know actually

(42m 44s)

> use bugs and you know real life bugs and stuff like bugs already call their variants

(42m 51s)

> you want to do that to replicate that that's fine that's cool but you know you don't

(42m 55s)

> need to go shiny you don't need to give me a purple centimeter or whatever it's

(43m)

> fuck I'm I'm content go out by know if anything because that's real that's cool but yeah

(43m 7s) **Al:**

> I mean, I'm guessing that's what shiny Pokemon were based.

(43m 9s) **Kevin:**

> something like that sure um I'm with ginger it's not a bad idea but like I'm when they

(43m 16s)

> call them shit the worst part is a lot of them will just straight up call it shiny right

(43m 19s)

> like like that's we don't need that we don't need it you don't

(43m 20s) **Al:**

> yeah. Agreed. I like this color variance thing that they're doing much better.

(43m 25s) **Kevin:**

> need to have a red garidos I do too I agree yeah yeah that's a little personality a little

(43m 30s) **Al:**

> Just like everyone you had, just going to be a slightly different color. That's fun.

(43m 37s) **Kevin:**

> flavor I like it I agree so good for doing that but not what you didn't have to do

(43m 43s)

> shiny so just does this I would have been happy as a clam I say as someone who's not played

(43m 46s) **Al:**

[Laughter]

(43m 49s) **Kevin:**

> and we'll probably not hit his game yeah it's cool

(43m 52s) **Al:**

> Yes, but that's the point of this podcast is to have opinions on games we haven't played.

(43m 55s) **Kevin:**

> we judge what are we judging next Sal something that probably should wait wait is this

(43m 57s) **Al:**

[Laughter]

(44m)

> All right. Ages of Kataria have released their 'The Seasons' update.

## Ages Of Cataria

(44m 6s) **Al:**

> Can you guess what's in this update?

(44m 9s)

> It is not at 1.0.

(44m 12s) **Kevin:**

> one at one point I don't remember okay then fine yeah this is important one seasons out

(44m 19s)

> of you know you're doing farming cottage core things seasons are important it's sad

(44m 25s)

> good for you we gonna fall now you know when things are harvested in a farming game yeah

(44m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it adds seasons. That's not much to say, but look, it's early access. Look, it's, it is what it is, right?

(44m 40s) **Kevin:**

> that's kind of a fundamental let's I feel a little weird it's like I'm yeah yeah yeah I get the

(44m 48s) **Al:**

> You know where you're getting. If you get at this point, at this point, if you play an early access game and you complain about a fundamental feature,

(44m 55s)

> not existing, that's your problem.

(44m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, I'm not again. I'm not trying to complain like that. That's why I avoid early acts just

(45m 5s)

> The I don't know the optics are always really funny to me. Hey, I'm making a racing game and I added I don't know boosting or drifting

(45m 12s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I get it. I get it.

(45m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(45m 16s)

> Yeah, yeah, so I'm always going to heckle it because I'm not fond of early access

(45m 20s)

> But it is important. And hey, this is what it's for getting

(45m 24s)

> It's right. The game's being worked on. Look at that. That's the thing.

(45m 28s)

> It should be odd. Cool. So yeah, I heckle them. But good for you. Eightes of Kataria.

## New Games

(45m 34s) **Al:**

> Alright, now we're going to new games, I have three new games to talk about, new games

(45m 37s) **Kevin:**

> New James.

(45m 39s)

> All right. Let's see what games now go on last week's episode.

(45m 40s) **Al:**

> that we've never talked about before.

## Heartopia

(45m 45s) **Al:**

> First up, we have Heart Opia, welcome to Heart Opia, a multiplayer life simulation game

(45m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Does it have?

(45m 52s) **Al:**

> crafted for creativity, freedom and peace, build your dream home, explode a wide range

(45m 58s)

> of hobbies and forge warm connections with friends in a town full of endless possibility.

(46m 4s)

> Endless possibilities, Kevin.

(46m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, and endless, you know, it just kills me that I'm just, I don't know, jaded is the

(46m 15s)

> best word here, but like, I see the trailer, I see the description. There's nothing wrong

(46m 22s)

> with any of it. It looks competently made. So some of the visuals are quite nice even. There's

(46m 27s)

> like, oh, wow, that looks like a whale. It's very cute. But good heavens. Are you standing out?

(46m 35s)

> Other than the fact that your little image looks like that Beatles cover. I don't know what

(46m 39s)

> we're off for a year. It does look nice though. It's, I'm not, I don't know if I'm going to

(46m 43s)

> play. It's not sticking out to me, but, you know what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One thing I don't, I'm not sure.

(46m 55s)

> So like, they're building a house and it looks like they're maybe doing it. My craft style

(47m)

> Will we be able to block my block or piece by piece?

(47m 4s)

> But it's pretty detailed. That's that's kind of well, I guess I guess like Dragon Quest Builders

(47m 4s) **Al:**

> Yeah I think I think instead of Minecraft style I think it's more sim style like they're

(47m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Are sure that

(47m 16s) **Al:**

> putting up they're putting a wall up rather than like putting bricks on um it's hard to

(47m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(47m 21s)

> Yeah, yeah, that's probably it. So they have a waffle maker. I like waffles

(47m 24s) **Al:**

> because it's very fast in the trailer.

(47m 26s) **Kevin:**

> It is very fast. Yeah, so I yeah, I don't know the animal look cute

(47m 32s)

> I think the visuals are nice, but

(47m 35s)

> Nothing nothing's you know, really sticking out to me

(47m 38s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and endless possibilities, I. Yeah, I don't really know what else to say about this. It looks fine. I bet I'll never play it.

(47m 39s) **Kevin:**

> It's fine endless possibilities

(47m 45s)

> Can you murder people?

(47m 46s)

> Yeah.

(47m 51s)

> Yeah.

(47m 53s)

> Probably until they, until they guarantee the endless and you can do all that your range nonsense,

(48m 4s)

> the other game, you're too scared of.

(48m 7s) **Al:**

> Here and lies one of the problems.

(48m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Then you finally break up couples.

(48m 10s) **Al:**

> Here and lies one of the problems.

(48m 12s)

> When they say endless possibilities,

(48m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm.

(48m 13s) **Al:**

> I go, that's too many possibilities.

(48m 17s) **Kevin:**

> You know what? That's fair.

(48m 19s)

> But it's still, I'd still hit my head.

(48m 19s) **Al:**

> Apparently, this is interesting,

(48m 22s)

> 'cause it doesn't say on Steam,

(48m 24s)

> as far as I'm aware,

(48m 26s)

> but I just went through to their forgive me,

(48m 29s)

> their ex account,

(48m 32s)

> and it says that it's coming out on the 7th of January.

(48m 36s)

> That's in the past.

(48m 36s) **Kevin:**

> that I was about to say what year unless they didn't say a year is this real is this money

(48m 38s) **Al:**

> This game is definitely not. This effort is definitely listed as still coming soon.

(48m 51s) **Kevin:**

> laundering what's going on now okay this getting closer to money

(48m 52s) **Al:**

> That's a very good question.

(48m 57s)

> You can install it on Android, apparently.

(49m 6s) **Kevin:**

> laundering and then we expect it's up oh that that I don't know how much I believe in that software

(49m 7s) **Al:**

> It looks like it's free on Android and...

(49m 17s)

> Yeah, I can install on my iPhone as well. I am currently installing the game. But it is not available on Steam. It says coming soon on Steam.

(49m 25s) **Kevin:**

> What is XD International?

(49m 27s)

> I don't, what is this developer?

(49m 28s) **Al:**

> I think they are the publisher.

(49m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, it says developer and publisher.

(49m 32s)

> I don't know, or these people.

(49m 35s) **Al:**

> there are a Chinese game.

(49m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay, you know what?

(49m 39s)

> Now we're getting somewhere.

(49m 41s)

[laughs]

(49m 43s)

> It's, it's things sometimes are still questionable.

(49m 47s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot. I'm gonna, yeah, I don't know what's happening here.

(49m 47s) **Kevin:**

> What is heartopia?

(49m 49s)

> We don't know.

(49m 53s)

> You know what?

(49m 55s)

> It's really our endless possibilities here even beyond the game.

(50m 1s)

> Stay tuned, we may one day find out the legality of this game.

(50m 7s) **Al:**

> Or the existence part.

(50m 10s) **Kevin:**

> That too.

(50m 12s)

> Is their next game actually existing, Aldi, you know?

(50m 16s) **Al:**

> No, two seconds. I'm not, I'm not done here. Just you, wait a minute. Just you, wait a minute.

(50m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Ah ha ha yeah! We got a dig. Oh, I just...

(50m 22s) **Al:**

> You can download the game directly from the website as an exe file.

(50m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my!

(50m 28s)

> Oh, he's f***ing off!

(50m 32s)

> Oh, is the risk of our data being collected worth it to see what is going on here?

(50m 40s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(50m 42s)

> This is fascinating.

(50m 42s) **Kevin:**

> I'm coming soon, but make dig drop January 7th on their website.

(50m 49s)

> Maybe I forgot about Steve, who knows? This is wild.

(50m 54s) **Al:**

> Right, I'm gonna have to investigate this, but let's keep going with the podcast, and I'll see if I've got anything new to bring next episode. So next game ancient farm

## Ancient Farm

(51m 5s) **Kevin:**

> the game that apparently actually exists.

(51m 8s) **Al:**

> Plow

(51m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Unlike Heartopia question mark.

(51m 11s) **Al:**

> So I'm gonna read out the blurb, but before that I'm gonna describe this as basically first paint first person roots of patcher

(51m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, farming simulator 20 or zero. I don't know whatever 2,000 BCs unlike that whatever. Yeah, 2026 BC. There you go

(51m 30s) **Al:**

> Plow, plow, plant, water and harvest as you build your ancient Egyptian farm from the ground up.

(51m 38s)

> Begin with nothing, yeah, begin with nothing, and unlock workshops, production buildings and temples through your own hard work.

(51m 38s) **Kevin:**

> All Egyptian specifically.

(51m 47s) **Al:**

> Uh, I fun concept that there's no way I'm playing this game.

(51m 51s)

> It's out now.

(51m 52s) **Kevin:**

> It's it's it's very cool. It looks you can see the Egyptian

(51m 59s)

> I'm just I don't know the real realistic visuals are aren't working for me. That's that's probably the biggest problem

(52m 5s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it has mixed steam reviews

(52m 10s) **Kevin:**

> It's 71 of them

(52m 12s) **Al:**

> 71 mixed reviews

(52m 14s) **Kevin:**

> There you go, that sounds about Mike

(52m 17s) **Al:**

> Most people suggesting the game does not include a lot of

(52m 22s)

> anything

(52m 23s) **Kevin:**

> stuff to do. Oh, man, I love, oh. Oh, okay. That, you know what? That's something. You

(52m 24s) **Al:**

> So it exists, but to what degree does this exist? Oh?

(52m 29s)

> You can like just slaughter pigs with a knife and cut them up. Oh boy

(52m 36s)

> You

(52m 39s)

> I mean, you're not wrong. It is something. I'm not sure if it's good or bad something

(52m 39s) **Kevin:**

> okay. Yeah. Look, if you're at the worst part is like, again, if they're going for like

(52m 48s)

> this realistic thing, but I know is this, who's developed this?

(52m 53s)

> this is like one guy, because it feels like a very neat, specific thing.

(52m 57s)

> I want to make a realistic farming simulator, but ancient Egypt.

(52m 58s) **Al:**

> I don't think it's one guy because if you go to the developer, the developer is apparently A2 softworks

(53m 5s)

> and if you go to them on Steam they have 10 games, so I don't think it's gonna be one.

(53m 9s) **Kevin:**

> other stuff

(53m 12s)

> Well, oh

(53m 14s)

> Looting hits like climber sky is the limit and pirate commander. I love craft. It's okay

(53m 21s) **Al:**

> Drill deal demo. There's no normal version of drill deal, just the drill deal demo.

(53m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(53m 28s)

> Okay, and okay. I am I do this is the kind of game you'd expect from this

(53m 36s)

> developer

(53m 38s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah it definitely looks like not a huge amount of effort has gone into this game.

(53m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yep. Possibly a lot of stock unity assets in here. Let's say that.

(53m 55s) **Al:**

> I think that's probably fair.

(53m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yep. Okay.

(53m 58s) **Al:**

> All right, finally, Kevin, I know you love two things.

(54m) **Kevin:**

> Our most real games so far.

(54m 5s) **Al:**

> One, I know you love to hyper-analyze over almost no date data.

(54m 10s) **Kevin:**

> I... I do enjoy that. You're right.

(54m 12s) **Al:**

> And two, I know you love Minstone Island.

(54m 15s) **Kevin:**

> I... do I like a strong word here, but I did enjoy. I beat it. I'll say that.

(54m 21s)

> Like... I beat it. I haven't beaten other games that I love, so you know what, maybe.

(54m 22s) **Al:**

> this here. This here is maybe a new game. I'm not 100% sure, called minstone academy by the minstone

## Moonstone Academy

(54m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(54m 33s) **Al:**

> island developers. And that's an all. It does. It does. It looks different enough that I think it's

(54m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that looks like a new game.

(54m 42s) **Al:**

> probably a new game. Like the protagonist is clearly dressed very differently. And the movement,

(54m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yup

(54m 48s)

> Yeah, but one of those magic cats

(54m 51s) **Al:**

> the movement is not

(54m 52s)

> look the same like the way it moves through buildings and up the stairs is not

(54m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's a thing

(54m 57s) **Al:**

> home in Stone Island work.

(54m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Nope, Muncho Island is flat flat or climbing like a ladder like it's very clear

(55m 5s)

> It's very like Minecraft grid like let's say that this is there's a building and you're walking through it

(55m 12s)

> I mean still I submit.

(55m 14s)

> But there's also a by-school confirm by-squas two wheels, which is different for moons on island, which there placed an emphasis on fixing your broom and whatever.

(55m 26s)

> Um, so yeah, this is it.

(55m 28s) **Al:**

> The bike also is flying.

(55m 30s) **Kevin:**

> It is, but a propeller, which is different like I like okay.

(55m 35s)

> I don't know why we do that. We had the brooms and you're clearly still going for a magic thing, but okay, whatever.

(55m 42s)

> Um, that's a new game.

(55m 45s)

> I don't know what it is.
