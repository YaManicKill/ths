(1m 3s)

> We're higher elevation, that's it.

(1m 5s)

> It's kind of the kicker, it gets cold, but yeah, out here, we've hit freezing, or low

(1m 14s)

(1m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. You two Shay, right? Like, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's all scale relative whatever.

(1m 59s)

> Because here's the thing, I've, you know, I spent a large part of my, you know, no, you know,

(2m 5s)

> But all the other places I've lived out in California and Georgia were warmer.

(2m 9s)

> California was milder I would say, I'm not necessarily warm but milder.

(2m 14s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(2m 14s) **Kevin:**

> So we had like, sure, sure, Savannah would be like, I mean it is, sweltering heat out there but I mean for you especially right, like, so that's the thing right compared to where I've lived.

(2m 16s) **Al:**

> I would say warm.

(2m 16s)

> I would say warm.

(2m 17s)

[laughing]

(2m 25s)

> Yeah. Well, let's, let's, let's, let's put it, let's put it this way. When I went to Los Angeles

(2m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(2m 33s)

(2m 37s) **Al:**

> this is hot to me.

(2m 39s) **Kevin:**

> okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see that right like I didn't live in LA I lived in the LA ish area close enough to know the climate and yeah, I can see that I can see us

(2m 50s)

> I want to feel that, but I won't be walking around shorts out here where I am actually today is unseasonally warm so maybe today I would

(3m 1s)

> But anyways, I'm it's called the ice from his and his we're actually not gonna hit that bad up so then like we're not gonna hit by the snow

(3m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(3m 9s) **Kevin:**

> That's when Atlanta crumbles and dies, but ice may be who knows. We'll see

(3m 13s) **Al:**

> Long as long as as long as you keep the power, that's the important thing.

(3m 16s) **Kevin:**

> That's the important one right oh

(3m 17s) **Al:**

> You can, you can, you can, you can heat your home, you can survive.

(3m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, my heart I

(3m 21s) **Al:**

> That's, that's what gets, that's what got Texas a couple of years ago, right?

(3m 25s)

> It was the power that went.

(3m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Was about to say my heart goes out to the Texans because Ted Cruz is in fact on vacation it has been confirmed

(3m 33s) **Al:**

> I don't know

(3m 34s) **Kevin:**

> So you know it is gonna be bad

(3m 35s) **Al:**

(3m 37s)

> I mean, is he ever not on vacation? That's the question

(3m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Now that's all right, but yeah cue that the GTA me right oh here we go again

(3m 48s) **Al:**

> Dear we've got we our our winter storms. We don't really get like

(3m 53s)

> Snowstorms we do it very occasionally like

(3m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(3m 56s) **Al:**

> But I can tell you maybe like three that we've had in my life like three proper when

(4m 1s)

> like snowstorms, no, we get.

(4m 3s)

> When we get winter storms, it's just rain and wind, so much rain, so much wind, like, you know, we get, like last year we had to replace like 10 tiles on our roof, one storm, that it was a pretty bad, that was a pretty bad storm, that was, I think that's the worst we've had since we've been living here for the last 10 years, that was, that was the worst, it's not, we've not had many what we've had to deal with that, but yeah, it's just, it's wind, you know, strapped down the bins,

(4m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh. Yeah. That's, yeah. That's gnarly.

(4m 20s)

> One.

(4m 26s)

> Yeah. Yeah.

(4m 33s) **Al:**

> and a couple of people lose some fences, that's about it.

(4m 38s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(4m 41s)

> Yeah, no, that sounds bad.

(4m 42s)

> I'd say we're--

(4m 44s)

> I don't have to win that bad, but we don't get swinterstones

(4m 47s)

> that much out here.

(4m 48s)

> But anyways, yeah, I'm here.

(4m 52s)

> Everyone marked this recording, because we'll

(4m 55s)

> see in a week where I am.

(4m 57s) **Al:**

> Well, I'm glad I got you before the star, I'm just in case the power goes off.

(4m 57s) **Kevin:**

> If I'm out there hunting, that's the real tragedy, right?

(5m 4s) **Al:**

> I know, imagine that.

(5m 7s) **Kevin:**

> How could I report?

(5m 8s)

> I think I've reached out.

(5m 9s) **Al:**

> All right, we are here today to talk about Animal Crossing, New Horizons 3.0 and Switch 2 updates.

(5m 18s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(5m 18s) **Al:**

> We're going to talk all about them.

(5m 21s)

> I have played all of the features, so I have opinions on everything.

(5m 24s) **Kevin:**

> I haven't played any, but I was just

(5m 26s)

> going to go for the little hanging fruit,

(5m 28s)

> speaking of disasters that come every couple of years.

(5m 30s) **Al:**

> Hello

(5m 31s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(5m 33s)

> I guess that I haven't played, but I just had to.

(5m 35s)

> It was there.

(5m 36s)

[laughter]

(5m 37s) **Al:**

> Well, we're going to talk about that. I'm going to have my opinions and then Kevin will probably agree with me on everything

(5m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, probably.

(5m 43s) **Al:**

> I

(5m 43s) **Kevin:**

> I have opinions.

(5m 44s)

> I can have opinions out playing.

(5m 46s)

> That's the... That's the...

(5m 48s)

> You know, the point of the show, look at the judgment hours.

(5m 50s) **Al:**

> Love how like

(5m 52s)

> I love how I were

(5m 55s)

> What we want out of animal crossing is so very different, but we're both disappointed

(6m)

> in new horizons for different reasons

(6m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Look, there are some things that are universally rough, we'll get there's an article that we got it out.

(6m 10s) **Al:**

> Oh, oh, bye. Oh, yeah. Here we go. All right. We do obviously have some news to talk about as well, but first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?

(6m 14s) **Kevin:**

> So, in lieu of the playing Animal Crossing getting mad at that, I am playing animal urgency and getting mad at that.

## What Have We Been Up To

(6m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I see as a jerk only do you really know I'm

(6m 30s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(6m 31s) **Kevin:**

> have a book I am ring yeah I mean there's problems but excuse me yeah yeah

(6m 32s) **Al:**

> You can be mad at it while also enjoying it.

(6m 35s)

> Both things can be true.

(6m 38s)

> It's basically every Switch Pokemon game, right?

(6m 42s)

> You can enjoy it while also being annoyed with it.

(6m 45s)

[laughing]

(6m 45s) **Kevin:**

> I do not swim shield I'm okay I was okay with but regardless

(6m 50s) **Al:**

> I think, I mean, at the time,

(6m 52s)

> there were certainly a lot of complaints

(6m 53s)

> that I felt were kind of stupid, but.

(6m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah. I mean, that's not forget. That was the exit game, right? Um, good times.

(7m 1s) **Al:**

> It was, it was Dexa game.

(7m 2s)

> It was also Trigate.

(7m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Trigay! Ah! I forgot about Trigay. Ah!

(7m 8s) **Al:**

> And part, and part of the problem with Sword and Shield

(7m 11s)

> was they had some of the most gorgeous looking towns,

(7m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(7m 15s) **Al:**

> but the wild area was pretty, okay?

(7m 19s)

[laughing]

(7m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was well, man. Um,

(7m 20s) **Al:**

> May, like nothing particularly interesting.

(7m 24s)

[laughing]

(7m 25s) **Kevin:**

> The color.

(7m 27s)

> It was great because Paul but yeah while there is a man man I missed those days back back when I was not part of the complaining

(7m 36s) **Al:**

> Yeah, back when you could just be like, "Oh, shut up. Just enjoy your game. It's fun."

(7m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, exactly

(7m 45s)

> Anyways, I'm on rank was it be I just beat just in

(7m 49s)

> Is that he mentioning I don't know super

(7m 51s) **Al:**

> I just didn't, just didn't, just didn't. Yeah, something to have.

(7m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I just didn't yeah

(7m 54s)

> I don't know, whatever, um,

(7m 57s) **Al:**

> If they had voice acting, we would know just saying, we'll find out, we'll find out in

(7m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Well, that was the end of me. Yeah. Yeah. Are they even out of, well, no, there could be a different thing. Yeah. Okay. I don't know about anyway, swear to Google. See,

(8m 3s) **Al:**

> a year when they do something in the anime for it.

(8m 8s)

> So, no, yeah, they're, I mean, they've done a thing the last few seasons where they're

(8m 19s)

> not always in the region, right?

(8m 21s)

> It's not the same as the first few where they were just walking around the region, but also, yeah, but also, I feel like kind of near the end of the can to work, they went to the orange islands and stuff like that, so they've always had some things where they'd gone extra places at the end, but yeah, we're definitely in the, I think, I think at the blueberry academy, just not, I forget, I've not watched the most recent episode that came out two days ago, but I think they were at the blueberry academy.

(8m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, so that way yeah, we're gonna get our ZAR

(8m 34s)

> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Taylor. I'm.

(8m 51s) **Al:**

> And they've kind of, it's complicated, right, because lots of things have happened, which I don't really want to spoil because I'm watching it in Japan time, and obviously English language is about a year behind just now, so I don't want to spoil all of this, but yeah, there's a lot of bizarre stuff that's happened.

(8m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do think it's really like on this funny just this

(9m 22s)

> comparison of you know, during the ash era ash age like what one baby two years or whatever, right?

(9m 28s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm

(9m 29s) **Kevin:**

> But here we have

(9m 31s)

> definite hard progression of time

(9m 33s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they gave us a I was a

(9m 38s)

> Was a one-year time gap between seasons I think and and it was they they all very clearly aged up like they're their

(9m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, yep, yeah, we're in her Pokemon

(9m 47s)

> Come on shampooed in

(9m 48s) **Al:**

> Their character models were definitely older

(9m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Good times good times, um, you know what I probably should have watched that

(9m 58s)

> I haven't watched like any Pokemon anything and forever including Ponzi urge so I need to get to that

(10m 4s)

> But I am intrigued by all that stuff they're doing. Um, I should check out

(10m 10s) **Al:**

> Her license has been quite fun, it started off slow because obviously they were introducing

(10m 14s)

> new characters to it, but I've really enjoyed it and it's gone weird places I never

(10m 20s)

> expected them to go, but I've been enjoying just how bizarre it is.

(10m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, oh man, I saw a bit but I guess

(10m 29s)

> Tiny's the spoilers for whatever. I was living up and he's there is this scene of this lady just hating on a Pikachu

(10m 36s)

> And it's really funny cuz there it was actually what was by equator Tony who's also Pikachu's voice actress

(10m 42s)

> So it was Pikachu hitting on Pikachu

(10m 43s) **Al:**

> Ha ha.

(10m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I need to check that well whenever we get there who at whether it's masters or or the anime one day

(10m 54s)

> How just seems to pronounce and until then on the time saying you but yes

(10m 58s) **Al:**

> Or does masters have voice acting?

(11m) **Kevin:**

> They have voice lines like how you with the or not full voice acting

(11m 3s) **Al:**

> Not food, not food voice acting, but some things, okay.

(11m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, but there's bits and pieces

(11m 7s) **Al:**

> More than just the grunts some gave you,

(11m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(11m 9s) **Al:**

> but less than everything is voiced.

(11m 10s) **Kevin:**

> words

(11m 11s)

> words are said

(11m 11s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(11m 13s) **Kevin:**

> lines full sentences are said at point so

(11m 16s)

> Including other characters will say each other's name. So you can get confirmation on that

(11m 22s)

> But yeah, so

(11m 24s)

> Yeah, wouldn't it that be nice to have our ZAF, um, and I met

(11m 29s) **Al:**

> It's funny as well because like I did you you listen to the

(11m 34s)

> Story season's grand bizari episode

(11m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, I did but that was a while ago, but go ahead

(11m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I I

(11m 40s)

> I think having how how good the voice acting and the conversations in that game worked

(11m 46s)

> Where you could have an auto progressing, right?

(11m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah.

(11m 49s) **Al:**

> So you could just press a button and you could put it down and you could watch and listen to the conversation

(11m 53s)

> And then the conversation ended you could pick it back up and play it again

(11m 56s)

> Right, not having to like press the A button.

(11m 59s)

> To advance the conversation every second actually made me pay attention more right because I wasn't like sitting just tapping the button to get through as fast as possible

(12m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(12m 8s) **Al:**

> I could actually enjoy it and going from that to to Z.A. which was just like you'll get some words on the screen and you'll like it and it's just like what are we doing here?

(12m 18s)

> Why do why I don't and it's funny because it's the first time I was playing someone in front of Rona, and she was like

(12m 26s)

> didn't talk and I'm like, no, they don't talk.

(12m 28s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(12m 29s) **Al:**

> She found it bizarre, she found it so weird that there's no voice acting, and that's

(12m 33s)

> not something that I would have ever pranged her with, right?

(12m 36s)

> She just found it really weird that there was no voice acting in Pokemon.

(12m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(12m 40s)

> Yeah.

(12m 40s) **Al:**

> And I was like, yep, I agree.

(12m 42s) **Kevin:**

> He's here.

(12m 43s) **Al:**

> It's 'cause like five years ago I wasn't finding it weird, but now I am, now I find it really

(12m 43s) **Kevin:**

> I'm going to club.

(12m 47s)

> Yeah.

(12m 49s) **Al:**

> weird when there's no voice acting, because I think it's because of how like high quality

(12m 54s)

> if you will, right?

(12m 55s)

> We don't have to have a discussion about the graphics, but like how high quality it's

(12m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Right.

(12m 59s) **Al:**

> trying to be, and then you just have these people with their modes moving, and you

(13m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, I mean.

(13m 2s)

> Yep.

(13m 2s) **Al:**

> just reading text on a page.

(13m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely.

(13m 7s)

> It was moving to the switch, right?

(13m 9s)

> Because before Pokemon was on the handheld game.

(13m 12s)

> What, you know, what handheld games had voice acting, right?

(13m 16s)

> I mean, I know they did.

(13m 16s)

> But you know, like, it was the expectation was different, right?

(13m 21s)

> But now you're on the same console as the new Xenoblade,

(13m 25s)

> as is Breath of the Wild, as all these other games.

(13m 28s)

> And Breath of Wild's funny, because they don't even have

(13m 30s)

> full voice acting, you know, just certain parts or whatever.

(13m 32s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(13m 33s) **Kevin:**

> But, but you know, now you're running with the big kids

(13m 37s)

> or so the expectations are for that.

(13m 39s)

> And like, and in some ways, they're trying to make that, right?

(13m 42s)

> The visuals, the presentation's certainly different.

(13m 44s)

> It certainly feels grander than anything on the DS or whatever.

(13m 48s) **Al:**

> I think I think Breath of the Wild had the good balance when it was like

(13m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(13m 52s) **Al:**

> Anytime you're like having a story you're talking to the main characters like that's when you get voice acting

(13m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(13m 58s) **Al:**

> But if you're just talking to a rando in the street, they're not gonna have voice acting, right?

(14m 2s)

> I get that that's a lot, right?

(14m 3s) **Kevin:**

> No. Yeah.

(14m 4s) **Al:**

> You know, especially with like how many NPCs there are in Pokemon, right? You don't you don't you don't you don't need the science guy to be having

(14m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, absolutely.

(14m 11s) **Al:**

> You know voice acting. I get how that's fine

(14m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Well, maybe him, but other than that, that's your point.

(14m 14s) **Al:**

> but

(14m 15s)

> Him just for the fun of it. Yeah, but like

(14m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, just two.

(14m 18s) **Al:**

> you don't need every NPC to have it, but like every proper conversation you're having this advancing the story, right? Like that should have

(14m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Or at bare minimum, like Breath of Wild did just voice little punches here there, right? Just an expression or a single word.

(14m 25s) **Al:**

> That should absolutely have

(14m 35s)

> Yeah, I find those weird, to be honest, like that.

(14m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Really? No. Well, okay. Well, regardless, the point being that there's that can do better than what they're doing now, but yeah.

(14m 46s)

> Anyway, so anyway, so.

(14m 48s) **Al:**

> Let's see how we feel in a month with the news of whatever's coming next.

(14m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay. Aside from that, or let's see what I'll wait, Z a what you would have, you know, all those problems inside. Yeah, right. Be that that whole little bit was fun with the tournament and and it's really funny there limited in scope. So boy, let's milk these characters for everything we've got because what else are we going to do.

(15m 3s) **Al:**

> Your rank B is what you were saying.

(15m 17s) **Kevin:**

> So it's been our best battle canary for the third time. Yeah.

(15m 20s) **Al:**

> I'll just you wait and see if you get the DLC.

(15m 24s) **Kevin:**

> But it's good to do. Oh, I can imagine.

(15m 27s) **Al:**

> Oh boy, you'll you'll love battling canari again.

(15m 32s)

> But this time it's double battles.

(15m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I can see they're headed that like I'm surprised I haven't really done it yet because clearly they're lining up, you know, too good.

(15m 43s) **Al:**

> I'll tell you, I'll tell you why they hadn't done it. It's because it's bad. I do not like the double battles in the DLC, the real time, I love the real time battling in general in this game, but the double battles just feel chaotic, have no idea what's happening and I'm just pressing whatever buttons I can press and hoping that hoping that I'm powered up enough that I can kill everyone. Absolutely not.

(15m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. There's no strategy in that world anymore. Yeah. I get it. That's what I expected

(16m 11s)

> and I'm ready for the good times. Um, but yeah, so the kid, the kids, fun, whatever mechanics,

(16m 19s)

> they are what they are. Um, I like Pokemon. I need to like the Pokemon themselves at least. So,

(16m 24s)

> You know, I get happy when I

(16m 26s)

> make a jalooch, that makes me happy every time, of course not. Aside from that, there's

(16m 29s) **Al:**

> I was about to ask you your favourite new mega is now, but like I bet nothing's beaten

(16m 34s)

> her, literally right.

(16m 40s) **Kevin:**

(16m 48s)

> looking. Yeah, yeah, and then we get that, right, cancer. Yeah, I like it.

(16m 49s) **Al:**

> Have you read the Polkadex entry for?

(16m 56s)

> Cancer ray!

(16m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'm a fan that they are embraced. No, they continue because they haven't really

(17m 7s)

> stopped. They continue to brace, you know, it's some existential horror in those decks

(17m 10s) **Al:**

> Hmm. Mm.

(17m 10s) **Kevin:**

> entries and some of the side emissions. I did the lit wickside quest where my life

(17m 16s)

> force is consumed and that wasn't fun. And then immediately after I do a side quest with

(17m 21s)

> the frost last where I go okay I just run into this ghost and fall

(17m 27s)

> and oh I don't like that but okay here we are good times

(17m 32s)

> um anyway yeah that's the it is what it is um okay uh let's see what else um uh oh

(17m 41s)

> discounty I hit credits on discounty boy did we pick the perfect time to

(17m 47s)

> record my thoughts on discounty because now that I hit credits boy I have

(17m 52s)

> thoughts because it's a great game with one huge

(17m 56s)

> problem that you don't see until the end yeah yeah I mean it's it's enough for a

(17m 58s) **Al:**

> Oh, okay. Do we need to do another episode on that then? Or is this...

(18m 5s) **Kevin:**

> topic and there's some post game stuff so I'm finished all that so it's it's

(18m 7s) **Al:**

> All right.

(18m 9s) **Kevin:**

> probably warrants at least a small discussion on another episode at least

(18m 13s) **Al:**

> All right, cool. We'll do that then. We'll schedule that.

(18m 14s) **Kevin:**

> when I finished the post game stuff but so we'll get to it but overall I

(18m 20s)

> like I still enjoy discount even with the the fan of tripping

(18m 26s)

> at the finish line but it's fine yeah just kind of good stuff and yeah that's

(18m 32s)

> what I've been up to what about you though let's go on on over there

(18m 35s) **Al:**

> It's mostly just animal crossing, I think, which obviously we're going to have a big discussion about.

(18m 40s)

> I did. I have played, I've tried again to play heartopia. I've not got very far in that,

(18m 46s)

> but I'm hoping maybe this week I'll get some more time. Now that I'll be pitting animal crossing down.

(18m 51s)

> Probably. We'll see. I don't know. Who knows? Who knows what my brain will decide to do?

(18m 57s)

> Have I played anything else? Not really. I've still got five legendarys to catch and

(19m 2s)

> and I haven't really done that yet.

(19m 5s)

> It's literally the only thing I've got left to do.

(19m 7s)

> I might end up doing that in like the week running up to Pokémon Day just because it will be like I must get this done.

(19m 12s)

> And at some point I need I still need to do the decks for Sword and Shield for home to get the shiny Shaman, not Shaman.

(19m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and clean up now.

(19m 21s) **Al:**

> I still need to do that at some point.

(19m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yay.

(19m 24s) **Al:**

> So maybe I'm hoping I'll get that done sometime soon so that there's enough time between that and the new games coming out that I don't feel burnt out with Pokémon.

(19m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Hey, it's okay. The burnout's going to be cured when

(19m 35s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but that's different. That's the thing right like I'm not gonna it's not exactly so it's it's no I know I get your point, but no it's yeah.

(19m 38s) **Kevin:**

> hypoepia drops. But that's going to restore your faith. That's

(19m 43s)

> different. Yeah, I know. It's not Pokemon the game. I know what

(19m 45s)

> you mean. I'm just I'm being cheeky.

(19m 50s) **Al:**

> I think that's it I've not really played much well if I let's see I've probably got something to talk about TV or film wise let me check what I've been watching.

(19m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. All right.

(20m)

> Yeah, you're watching a lot of stuff. Who watching so many movies?

(20m) **Al:**

> Ooh, I have been playing, uh, no, I've been...

(20m 5s)

> Sorry. I've been watching the new Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.

(20m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so okay. Did you watch the movie? I'm watching the movie yet, but did you watch the movie the

(20m 15s) **Al:**

> I did watch the movie and then I watched the first season of the series. Have you seen what have you seen?

(20m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(20m 20s)

> I haven't seen either to be honest sadly sadly. I know I'm missing out

(20m 21s) **Al:**

> You've not seen it all. You should. It's so good. So good. Excellent.

(20m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, the series is good to

(20m 27s) **Al:**

> So the first season I thought was very good. The second season I'm still enjoying. It's felt a little bit more

(20m 34s)

> disjointed. It feels less like there's kind of like a unified vision of what it is and it's more like there's

(20m 43s)

> kind of three arcs that happened throughout the season.

(20m 45s)

> So it's not like it's not single episode arcs that are like villain of the weak type thing and it's not one whole season story.

(20m 55s)

> It's like three different ones throughout the season. So it's kind of feel the little bit weirdly disjointed because of that.

(21m 2s)

> But other than that, I mean, I've still been enjoying what it is. So yeah.

(21m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay, that sounds good because I alright

(21m 11s) **Al:**

> It's definitely worth, it's definitely worth a watch I think if you like if you like

(21m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I have

(21m 16s)

> All right, I'm gonna ask for other questions. So if you have any interest in this

(21m 20s)

> You know shield your ear, I guess five minutes

(21m 23s) **Al:**

> Skip to the game news if you don't want any spoilers for our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

(21m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(21m 28s) **Al:**

> the most recent film and TV series.

(21m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Seriously, okay, so I don't didn't watch the movie, but I'm aware

(21m 36s)

> I believe Shredder is the arts credit.

(21m 38s)

> I've seen in the movie.

(21m 40s)

> Let me show up in the series.

(21m 43s) **Al:**

> Uh... I don't think so.

(21m 48s) **Kevin:**

> It's wild. Okay. Okay.

(21m 50s)

> Next question.

(21m 52s)

> The leather head in the series.

(21m 54s)

> Oh.

(21m 54s) **Al:**

> Who is Leatherhead?

(21m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I'm so excited.

(22m)

> I love the animation and the series.

(22m 2s)

> And we like gray, but all these questions are very deep.

(22m 6s)

> - There we go.

(22m 6s) **Al:**

> Give me give me a minute. Give me a minute. Give me a minute

(22m 8s) **Kevin:**

> How much, okay, how much turtles have you watched prior?

(22m 10s)

> Like, what other series are content?

(22m 12s) **Al:**

> Not a huge not a huge amount. Um, it's it's something I've always been kind of vaguely aware of

(22m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Now you, okay, 'cause.

(22m 18s) **Al:**

> But it's not something that I've I've kind of like properly watched like I've probably seen some

(22m 24s)

> some stuff from

(22m 27s)

> New York occasional things. I think I saw the the horrifying live action they did

(22m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Oh yeah, it would mean is the my love. Oh, yeah.

(22m 36s) **Al:**

> That was horrible

(22m 38s)

> But I don't think yeah, I'm just double checking. Yeah, he's definitely I didn't think he was in the season

(22m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(22m 45s) **Al:**

> But I just wanted to double check cuz you never know I could have been an idiot, but yeah, no, he's not

(22m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I just checked leatherhead shows up. Um, boys by Rose burn. Oh,

(22m 51s) **Al:**

> Sorry, that was shredder is what we're talking about. Let me check with leatherhead. So his leatherhead oh

(22m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Fred, okay, sorry. Okay. Um, uh, crocodile. It's popping on me.

(22m 59s) **Al:**

> I'm no, I don't I don't remember seeing

(23m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, they have a voice credit. I don't know where, but okay. Um, all right, that's,

(23m 7s)

> that's fine. Well, other heads on my favorite kid, those characters. I mean, a fan of turtles

(23m 13s)

> and consumes different series. Um, not the 80s one. I'm, I'm most kind of a strange, uh,

(23m 19s)

> turtles fan because there's such a huge following for the 80s ones and then obviously so much

(23m 24s)

> attachment and nostalgia for it. But I come, that was before my time and I didn't watch it. So it's

(23m 31s)

> my head. Oh, okay. Well, uh,

(23m 32s) **Al:**

> Uh, so he was in, he was in, leatherhead was in season one apparently.

(23m 38s)

> I don't know, I don't, I don't remember, I was a couple of years ago, so my memory is a bit

(23m 42s)

> fuzzy of it. Um,

(23m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, well say a lot be but yes. Oh, well I do

(23m 49s) **Al:**

> I, yeah, I don't know, I don't know how much of the, like, obviously, I don't want to talk too

(23m 52s)

> much about actual spoilers, but I don't know how much of how many of the characters are like,

(23m 59s) **Kevin:**

> former canon. I mean, is, um, oh my gosh. Hey, you see in it? Nope. Oh, well, okay. Why don't you

(23m 59s) **Al:**

> classic characters, if that makes sense.

(24m 2s)

> I think so. I'm so bad at names.

(24m 8s) **Kevin:**

> have Casey? I'll take that. Casey Jones. Fuck him, ask. Probably. I hopefully. Ideally.

(24m 21s)

> I don't, he might not be in it actually. Is that him? No. Oh, my gosh, he's not.

(24m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, no, I'm not I'm no look I mean this is the problem right like you're you're you're asking me questions like like I would know who these characters where like it's like it's what like it's a Marvel series right like you're like oh what about this casual I don't know who that character is

(24m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Never mind. All right. This is. This is, this is. Yeah. No, it's fine. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

(24m 49s) **Al:**

> is like the part the problem is like I don't is it some is there a character in it that I just don't remember who it was or is

(24m 55s)

> it just like yeah it's

(24m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, here's a thing. Leatherhead is a major, let's say a major supporting character in

(25m 3s)

> a lot of trouble series, right? Not not a list or but a lot of fans wouldn't have a leather head.

(25m 9s)

> Pacey Jones is an A-listers like supposed to be a primary cast member. So

(25m 16s)

> and if it's not in there, well, that's okay. That's interesting. I mean, it has a po-neal, right?

(25m 21s) **Al:**

> Say again, sorry April. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No April. April's I think basically they're their main

(25m 22s) **Kevin:**

> April O'Neill is in the show, right? Okay. Casey Jones.

(25m 26s)

> He's the male equivalent of April O'Neill, the guy they turtles hang out with just as much.

(25m 35s) **Al:**

> Guy in the chair if you will for this certainly for season two

(25m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, which which happens frequently. Yeah. Yeah, in case he Jones is, it's, it's rough equipment. He's not a guy in chair. He's out on the field with them, but he's just a problem in it. Um, so, okay.

(25m 46s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(25m 48s)

> Yeah, I know it's mostly it's mostly just been them out in the field on their own at this point

(25m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Sure. Okay. Like,

(25m 54s) **Al:**

> But then I don't know they might have more plans for for

(25m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, there's nothing inherently wrong with these questions or do these decisions because I'm sure it's still quality, but it's okay. I'm just very surprised. I just, I don't know.

(26m 8s)

> My expectations are set. I don't know what to expect, but that that's fine. I'm happy. It's good because I like the turtles and I like when their stuff is good. I like that they use actual teenagers to voice the turtles that that's well, that was a good idea. Um, yes. Yeah, I believe they did. Um, which is awesome.

(26m 32s)

> But okay, overall, though, I'm happy it's good. That's I'm I'll take that. Um, even if I

(26m 38s)

> I'm not sure what's going on over there.

(26m 38s) **Al:**

> Wait, this says this says leather head was in the seat in season two. I mean oh, oh no, I see right okay. So there's a bit at the beginning of the season where like the

(26m 50s)

> The purple dragons mine control a bunch of mutants and

(26m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Ahh...

(26m 56s) **Al:**

> Leatherhead is apparently in that group of mutants, but not like not specifically as a prominent one. There's quite a few of them and

(26m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Prominent, sure.

(27m 3s)

> Yeah, sure. Okay, that makes sense.

(27m 4s) **Al:**

> And I probably is I suspect if you had been watching it would

(27m 8s)

> stuck out more to you, right? Because you're like, "Oh, that's leatherhead, right?" Whereas I'm just going,

(27m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(27m 12s)

> Yeah.

(27m 13s) **Al:**

> "Oh, it's one of the, one of the mutants, right?" Like, I am aware of some of them and who they are, but not many of

(27m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Mutant peoples, yeah.

(27m 17s)

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(27m 20s)

> Yeah.

(27m 21s) **Al:**

> their names. I know Ray Filet's name, I know Wing Nuts name. Most of the rest of them are just

(27m 28s)

> Mutants to me because I don't know

(27m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, right away. That's a good name. I think that's a new character. I've never heard it,

(27m 35s)

> but that's that's a good name. Unless it was in the 80s series, which might be the case. I don't know.

(27m 41s)

> But yeah, no good good stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I believe it. Sure. Yeah.

(27m 44s) **Al:**

> It looks like he was in the 80 series. Yeah, I character based on Ray. So looks like he was in

(27m 51s)

> in some of the comics

(27m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Cool. Yeah, that's cool. No, man, forget the marble multiverse. Let's talk about the

(27m 54s) **Al:**

> Trying to figure out. I was a he

(27m 59s) **Kevin:**

> powerful multiverse. Well, I mean, that's, I think the majority of the mutants in the turtles' franchise are actually humans to start with, um, really. Okay.

(28m) **Al:**

> Oh, he was Ray Ray was apparently a human who was meeting

(28m 12s)

> No, okay, that's certainly not what has been in tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles most of them are mutated animals

(28m 17s)

> Because and most of the time they've been counted in your when you're like, oh, what were you before and they're always like, you know a cat or fleas or whatever

(28m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, wait, please. Oh, that's that's a great idea. I like that

(28m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's very good. It's all it's one of it

(28m 33s)

> I think the

(28m 34s)

> second of the kind of arcs in the season is a cat called scratch

(28m 40s)

> I don't know if that's our.

(28m 42s)

> standard character or not. And his mutated fleas, the fleas from the cat, it's fun. Yeah. So yeah, I would highly recommend it. It's

(28m 47s) **Kevin:**

> That's so cool. That's a great idea. I love that

(28m 52s) **Al:**

> really fun. It's a good, I don't know. I'll be interested to hear if, you know, what you think about it, being

(29m)

> our turtles fan, right, and how it feels if you actually are aware of the history of these

(29m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, I'll tune in. It's an interesting perspective. I don't know, okay,

(29m 13s)

> it's not as bad as Sonic, but I mean, turtles have had their low points for sure, right?

(29m 17s)

> The live action stuff. Well, I have actually a series in particular. The movies are one thing,

(29m 21s)

> but the series, we had, we had the Michael Bay versions.

(29m 30s)

> Don't forget that.

(29m 33s)

> So it had been through the ringer a few times, so it's, you know, but a lot of highlights, too, so, um,

(29m 38s) **Al:**

> Do you know what I find funny as well? So Seth Rogan was one of the, the, um, the writers on,

(29m 41s) **Kevin:**

> yeah.

(29m 44s) **Al:**

> on this. Um, and he's, I feel like there was a point where he was like kind of a bit of a laughing

(29m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, one of the forces behind it. Yeah.

(29m 50s) **Al:**

> stock, right? Where he was just like, oh, he does stupid things. It doesn't really matter. And now

(29m 54s)

> it's like he is part partly behind like a bunch of really, really good, really popular stuff, right?

(30m 2s)

> Like he's, he's in, I don't know if you probably haven't seen the studio from Apple TV last year.

(30m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(30m 8s)

> No

(30m 8s) **Al:**

> He's excellent and he's like the main character and, um, writing it. Um, and apparently he's, he's done stuff for

(30m 16s)

> invincible and, um, the boys and stuff like that. And he's, he's, he's, he's, he's done the new

(30m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, there was another adaptation.

(30m 22s)

> I can't remember what, but yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

(30m 24s) **Al:**

> muppet show special as well. There's like a whole bunch of stuff that he's, and he's gone from like this,

(30m 29s)

> oh, he just does stupid stuff, isn't he? Like silly to like, no, he's behind someone like the best.

(30m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I think it's cool, right, and I don't know if it was just a type of taster

(30m 42s)

> or whatever.

(30m 43s)

> Because there was definitely a run where you had very, you know, hangover college type

(30m 47s)

> right I think.

(30m 48s) **Al:**

> sausage party. All this stupid stuff. Yeah. Yeah. There was a, there was a series. Yeah.

(30m 49s) **Kevin:**

> That was kind of the, yeah.

(30m 50s)

> It's awesome.

(30m 51s)

> Yeah, it's awesome.

(30m 52s)

> It's party didn't help.

(30m 53s)

> Didn't help at all.

(30m 54s)

> There's other things still going on.

(30m 57s)

> It has a series.

(31m) **Al:**

> I saw that in the list. I just, I just brushed over that.

(31m 1s) **Kevin:**

> It's still ongoing, I believe.

(31m 3s)

> I don't think it's finished.

(31m 5s)

> Yeah, yeah.

(31m 7s)

> Anyways, but yeah, but no,

(31m 9s)

> he does a lot of great work too.

(31m 11s)

> Especially like you said with the writing, I think.

(31m 14s)

> Oh yeah, no, and it probably doesn't help like...

(31m 18s)

> You're... You watch Chip and Dale rescue Rangers the movie the live-action movie or whatever opponent will put live-action

(31m 27s)

> Okay, and there's this just this brief like one second cameo scene of

(31m 33s)

> Like five or six characters. Seth Rojoon has all voiced and they're just the same voice

(31m 39s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(31m 40s) **Kevin:**

> And they all get to say something it's just

(31m 44s)

> Anyway, it's like you know, it's stuff like that. We're right. It feels like it does a lot of the same but

(31m 48s)

> but yeah, now he's doing good work good for yourself. I am happy with how the

(31m 57s) **Al:**

> All right. Well shall we talk about some news?

## Game News

(32m 1s) **Kevin:**

> about non real life news like as long as we stay away from those.

(32m 8s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yes. Agreed. Yeah. It does, you know, you shouldn't have secret police and you shouldn't,

(32m 16s)

> you know, abduct people in the street and kill people apparently today again. So yeah.

(32m 24s) **Kevin:**

> You know what?

(32m 25s)

> And you know what?

(32m 26s)

> It would be cool if the leader of a major power

(32m 30s)

> knew what country was what country?

(32m 32s)

> Wouldn't that be nice?

(32m 33s) **Al:**

> But we're not going to talk about that.

(32m 34s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(32m 38s) **Al:**

> We are going to try and escape that for a while and we're going to talk about some farming

(32m 41s)

> game use.

(32m 42s)

> First up, we have Bubblegum Galaxy, have announced their release date for the 12th of March,

## Bubblegum Galaxy

(32m 51s) **Al:**

> or the 11th of March.

(32m 52s)

> I think I think it might, I wonder if they're Australia-based or somewhere Eastern-based

(32m 58s)

> because it says 11th of March on my steam, but they're posted.

(33m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Oh it says hmm yeah interesting yeah I don't know that's yeah near New Zealanders they

(33m 9s)

> get to release before when it's like I don't know okay what is this okay I'm looking at it because

(33m 14s)

> I don't remember um and I files okay so I'm saying I'm watching the trailer and there's

(33m 15s) **Al:**

> Yes, it's a cozy narrative building game about rebuilding the galaxy.

(33m 26s) **Kevin:**

> there's like two different hits I'm seeing there's like the

(33m 32s)

> the tile gameplay where it's like hexagonal tiles you're placing them and then resources I guess or whatever.

(33m 33s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(33m 38s) **Kevin:**

> But then there's also what feels like the lack of a better way of describing a 3DS style like

(33m 45s)

> you seek characters moving around and interacting with each other and I do I don't know what's going on here.

(33m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's an interesting like yeah, it seems like it's part management game part life sim

(33m 57s)

> And I don't know how those are gonna mesh together

(33m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. And you're an anthropomorphic cat with a house on their head. That's how it matches together.

(34m 5s) **Al:**

> Obviously

(34m 10s) **Kevin:**

> This is fascinating. Oh wow, it's coming to everything. All the consoles and Xboxes.

(34m 17s)

> I like how they're still releasing on the old Gen PS4 and stuff.

(34m 22s) **Al:**

> Look, if you don't need to power a Y bother, it's the same thing with the switch too,

(34m 25s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, no.

(34m 26s) **Al:**

> you shouldn't do it unless you need it.

(34m 28s) **Kevin:**

> No, I agree.

(34m 29s)

> I'm just saying like it's,

(34m 32s)

> there's enough in an audience there to support it.

(34m 34s)

> That's not like my point, right?

(34m 36s) **Al:**

> Well, the beauty of the beauty of that now is that you can just do it on the older one and get it automatically on the newer one, you know, so they don't need a huge audience on the PS4, they just need an audience on the PS5. Same with switch.

(34m 42s) **Kevin:**

> That's true. That's very true.

(34m 49s)

> Most switch to though.

(34m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, they don't need to. That's the thing like look at the graphics. Do you think there's needs a switch to?

(34m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Just the old switch.

(34m 54s)

> Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah.

(34m 59s)

> No, I'm wondering why they're not releasing on the 3DS.

(35m 4s)

> Um, yeah, bubble gum.

(35m 6s) **Al:**

> I think you probably underestimate how slow that device was. It's so old now.

(35m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(35m 12s)

> No, no, that's why I'm bad at dating.

(35m 16s) **Al:**

> The switch is nine years old now.

(35m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, good times, it's time.

(35m 21s) **Al:**

> Was it was it 2011 for the 3DS, so that's 15 years now?

(35m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, holy moly, don't tell you that number.

(35m 27s)

> I don't like that. No, oh no.

(35m 30s) **Al:**

> It's all right. It's all right. Next year will be the 20th anniversary of the week.

(35m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(35m 34s)

> Yeah, okay, that one I can do with, but the 3DS felt.

(35m 37s) **Al:**

> Oh no, it's this year. Oh, it was 2006, not 2007. It was November. November is the 20th anniversary of the week. Goodness me.

(35m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, no, that's right. Yeah.

(35m 42s)

> I can't, yeah, that's fine.

(35m 45s)

> We feels old at this point.

(35m 46s)

> I won't lie. I can move in next.

(35m 48s) **Al:**

> I just felt I just felt my back go. I'm so old.

(35m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay.

(35m 53s)

> Dude, okay.

(35m 55s)

> It achorus on 3DS.

(35m 58s)

> There is this, I believe it's actually like a secret ending.

(36m 1s)

> There's just this one joke that they make.

(36m 4s)

> I'll be like, I guess we'll see you in another 25 years or whatever.

(36m 8s)

> Like the gap between the original and this one.

(36m 9s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(36m 12s) **Kevin:**

> In fact, that we're getting closer to that is making me extremely uncomfortable out.

(36m 20s)

> Cause that was a great game.

(36m 22s)

> And I wanted it to steeple, but not, not actually at the 25 year mark.

(36m 26s)

> No.

(36m 30s) **Al:**

> Fun times all right

(36m 30s) **Kevin:**

> All right.

(36m 31s)

> What else is the next game good times?

(36m 35s) **Al:**

> The ranchers have announced that they're early access is releasing in Q2

## The Ranchers

(36m 39s) **Al:**

> The wording is really funny in this post-strike cuz it was like oh

(36m 44s)

> Where's the wording?

(36m 46s)

> Did we finally have a window for early access? The ranchers were launched in early access in Q2

(36m 52s)

> 2026 the exact release date is locked and will be revealed very soon

(36m 56s)

> If you know when the release date is, if you've locked it.

(36m 58s) **Kevin:**

> why? Yeah, yeah, but don't tell us that. Oh, and that and then you, I don't know how

(37m) **Al:**

> Why don't you just say it? Like, you shouldn't say it. I don't think you should say it.

(37m 4s)

> But don't tell us that you know it and then don't tell us what it is.

(37m 9s)

> Like, just, that's a bizarre.

(37m 14s) **Kevin:**

> we're whatever, they're gonna delay and then how they're gonna look, how they're gonna

(37m 18s)

> look, then point at your bat in the sky and and you struck out. That's rough buddy, but

(37m 26s)

> Um, yeah, that is kind of bizarre.

(37m 28s)

> We know it is, but we won't tell you. Ooh, yeah. Oh, okay. Sure. It's hop down 3D farming game thing that I don't know what else to describe like it's realistic issue in graphics and style and then it that's all I'm seeing.

(37m 31s) **Al:**

> yep apparently this is already in my steam library I must I must have backed on kickstart

(37m 39s)

> and they've already given me the key I guess I don't that's weird I don't remember that

(37m 54s)

> I think if a father if other listeners know the the look of lens island I would say it's very similar to that

(37m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, sure. Um, it's a little. Yeah, it I will say this the farm itself looks very sandboxy like it's a it looks like a very big area to kind of shape that how you want to that looks kind of cool, but it's all my gosh. There's no relationships in this game. I thought we would get away.

(38m 2s) **Al:**

> But it's much more farming rather than exploration

(38m 19s)

> Yeah.

(38m 21s)

> Event.

(38m 26s)

> No, this very much looks like someone went stargy,

(38m 31s)

> but higher graphics.

(38m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh my gosh, there's a bar. Yeah, it's Stardew. Yeah. Yeah, that is kind of cool in

(38m 33s) **Al:**

> Like, and everything else looks the same, basically,

(38m 36s)

> is just higher graphics.

(38m 42s)

> It doesn't look like you can drive-- drive vehicles.

(38m 44s)

> So that's different.

(38m 45s)

> You can go around the town and drive

(38m 49s) **Kevin:**

> like the parking on side of realistic for lack of a better way of describing. Yeah, I don't know

(38m 53s) **Al:**

> looks horrible why we don't want to pack a car, don't make me pack a car.

(38m 56s) **Kevin:**

> either, but they went for it. Um, the combat. Yeah, move it to date. Yeah, this is it.

(38m 57s) **Al:**

> Well there's a hot air balloon.

(39m 4s) **Kevin:**

> There's combat. I'm actually surprised there. Wow, the it is just Stardew with graphics. Um,

(39m 11s)

> yeah, wow. Um, there's you do fight in some cool looking enemies. I'll say that. I don't know how good the

(39m 17s)

> graphics. They're the combat is, but, uh, but okay, there you go. Stardew, but, uh, 3D, I guess. Okay.

(39m 26s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so that's Q2 for early access. Next, we have another update for Everdream Valley. They are

## Everdream Village

(39m 29s) **Kevin:**

> And.

(39m 32s) **Al:**

> sorry Everdream Village. They are throwing these updates out and this is the 1.8 update

(39m 38s)

> decorate the grandparent's house. So you've got grandparent's house and you can decorate it.

(39m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(39m 44s)

> Okay, like it's it's kind of funny specifically your grandparents house, but okay

(39m 46s) **Al:**

> For some reason. Yeah.

(39m 50s) **Kevin:**

> That you look very detailed those a lot of options. It looks like

(39m 56s)

> Yeah, I don't know it's a man. Okay, it's a little side tangent

(40m)

> But you know like you just said right ever dream village is throwing updates left and right right and including this one

(40m 6s)

> How long is Minecraft been going and we get

(40m 9s)

> about two, three updates a year, maybe like one may drop it here at Minecraft. And to this day, they have still not given me a chair I can just sit on.

(40m 18s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(40m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Why? Why? Why does Mojang hate me now?

(40m 22s) **Al:**

> Oh, who knows?

(40m 24s)

> Who knows?

(40m 26s)

> We are only three years away.

(40m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my goodness! I'm sure I get a hug. I'm just going to give up this time. I mean this year alone.

(40m 39s)

> Okay, the one that makes me uncomfortable is the fact that we're approaching 50th anniversaries of things. Like we're not there yet, but Mario is going to be half a century old.

(40m 46s) **Al:**

> Oh, I know. The number of anniversaries this year as well is mad. Like the number of anniversaries this year as well is crazy. Like there's like 10 very big franchise.

(40m 50s) **Kevin:**

> What?

(40m 53s)

> It is pretty crazy.

(41m 1s)

> I've got what Sonic, Zelder, Organons.

(41m 5s)

> Her sona is, oh, there's Pokemon, that's insane to me.

(41m 8s)

> I didn't know that.

(41m 12s) **Al:**

> All right, next we have an update for Starbirds, the Flora and Fauna update.

## Star Birds

(41m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yep.

(41m 16s)

> OK, good.

(41m 17s)

> Probably needed whatever it is.

(41m 20s) **Al:**

> It's the Flora and Fauna update.

(41m 24s)

> It's a new Star system. It's a green Star system.

(41m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, all right. That's the green one. There's there's a fork and knife

(41m 28s) **Al:**

> I'm not seeing anything. I'm not seeing anything that's like fundamentally changing the gameplay

(41m 33s)

> is my problem here, right? Like it's adding more levels, more resources, but not like

(41m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(41m 40s)

> Yep

(41m 41s) **Al:**

> reason to do.

(41m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that is the concern right like that's not addressing the big problem we had right which is so it's that's the point

(41m 49s)

> I will say I'm very uncomfortable with giant stuff. You're a little planetoid, but some of these now have giant

(41m 55s)

> eyeballs looking at you as you're doing stuff. I'm not comfortable with that

(41m 58s) **Al:**

> Are they judging me while I'm harvesting their organs?

(42m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe

(42m 5s)

> There's also a structure with the fork and knife. I don't know what's going on with that, but I don't know if I'm comfortable with that either

(42m 12s)

> There's consumption of something

(42m 14s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so it says you can produce pizza popcorn and rocket fuel, so I'm guessing that's like

(42m 19s)

> for making the pizza the food.

(42m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay, Pete, Pete's a popular rock

(42m 24s)

> and go all from the same structure, that's great, ain't it?

(42m 26s) **Al:**

> I don't get your wires crossed.

(42m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Ah, it's, it's, it's the Simpsons, the, the, the, the beer machine, whatever,

(42m 32s) **Al:**

> My pizza's on fire.

(42m 39s) **Kevin:**

> where it's all coming from the same thing, and just, it's, it's, it's out and today we can take it.

(42m 40s) **Al:**

> Oh yeah!

(42m 42s) **Kevin:**

[Laughter]

(42m 44s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's excellent.

(42m 47s)

> They're best visual gag.

## New Games

(42m 50s) **Al:**

> Alright, finally, we have a new game to talk.

(42m 52s)

> Into the Ambulance of announced a new game called Ambulance Desktop Village.

## Emberlands: Desktop Village

(42m 58s) **Al:**

> A cosy village building game that you can run on the side.

(43m 2s)

> Hey look, it's another rusty lake!

(43m 4s) **Kevin:**

> It's the rusty likes going strong. Although I gotta say I'm seeing I'm looking at the trailer. I'm seeing the game

(43m 14s)

> Where's like the desktop?

(43m 16s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(43m 18s)

> They are very much like maximized the game.

(43m 21s)

> You can see the toolbar at the bottom,

(43m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah do more that's it. That's your desktop

(43m 23s) **Al:**

> but that's the only thing you can see.

(43m 25s)

> Oh, wait, I see at some point they open up our paint,

(43m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, they have the recycle bin icon on there too

(43m 29s) **Al:**

> like a window of paint.

(43m 31s)

> And so it's like, I think it's running

(43m 33s)

> as your entire background and other windows open on top of that.

(43m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I believe that's actually what's happening. Oh, that's so cute

(43m 40s) **Al:**

> Oh, that's weird.

(43m 42s)

> Oh, and some of the things are popping over the windows.

(43m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(43m 47s) **Al:**

> On a word, and then some of the items

(43m 49s)

> are popping over the windows.

(43m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(43m 51s) **Al:**

> What up?

(43m 52s) **Kevin:**

> It is I'm I love and hate this at the same time like partially I think it would drive me nuts

(44m)

> said to have these like elements over the stuff I'm doing but

(44m 4s)

> at the same time it is different and it's making me pay attention.

(44m 10s) **Al:**

> I don't like that. Like, I feel like it's just, it's trying to blur it too much between

(44m 15s)

> it's a small game that you play at the side of your screen or the bottom of your screen

(44m 19s)

> to, like, it's your entire screen and it's also going to cover up some of your windows sometimes.

(44m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah Yeah, you know what but there's some someone at some point from make a game that leans into that and it's like

(44m 24s) **Al:**

> Like, that's a weird way.

(44m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Aggressively annoying and how it how it interact with you like you're doing your stuff and get pop-ups from the game

(44m 41s)

> Just interrupting you. I'd like that. Let's see that. I'm not gonna play it, but I want to see it

(44m 47s)

> Anyways, but that's the rusty like good job rusty you you created on the genre

(44m 54s)

> I know that's not the guy's name, but that's the guys name in my head

## Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0

(44m 59s) **Al:**

> All right, well, that's all the news should we talk about animal crossing new horizons 3.0 and switch to update

(45m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay, I guess.

(45m 9s)

> Let's, okay.

(45m 11s) **Al:**

> Let's okay

(45m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Can we talk, I just want to talk about,

(45m 15s)

> we don't start off with the article.

(45m 18s)

> When the VJ share, did you read it?

(45m 20s) **Al:**

> Yeah, what about it?

(45m 23s) **Kevin:**

> It was an author, who, a writer at IGN,

(45m 27s)

> I believe it was, who described their 90 minute ordeal

(45m 31s)

> to get 12 player multiplayer running on Animal Cross.

(45m 32s) **Al:**

> Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I did. I did see. Yeah. Yeah, don't edge it is bizarre to me that this game

(45m 34s) **Kevin:**

[laughing]

(45m 40s) **Al:**

> They did such a weird way to do online and it's like if you're connecting with one other person

(45m 46s)

> It's fine, right like it's not it's it's a little bit annoying, but it's fine if you're connecting more than like

(45m 53s)

> Three people you just spend most of your time waiting and yeah, 12 people

(45m 58s)

> It's absolutely bizarre that they have it set up that it takes

(46m 2s)

> Individual person has to join the island

(46m 6s)

> Separately and you can't do it at the same time so it like and there's like a whole like 30 second animation as it connects you to the game and

(46m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. This.

(46m 17s) **Al:**

> Anytime someone's trying to come to the island if someone's in a conversation

(46m 20s)

> It delays them from coming so then they have to try again

(46m 23s)

> And but everyone else who isn't in the conversation it stops you doing anything until it realizes that it times out

(46m 29s)

> and it can get the people on the island and

(46m 32s)

> and then any time anybody tries to leave it's the same thing it's just the worst online ever and like maybe maybe

(46m 40s)

> five maybe six years ago it wasn't that annoying because fine whatever we were just getting used to it

(46m 45s)

> and like it was new for Animal Crossing and it was exciting and we were all crazy anyway like that time

(46m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(46m 50s)

> This this I

(46m 52s) **Al:**

> period is just a bizarre time but it's not fun!

(46m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Mean this system this system started like that, you know, that their way of doing on like started on the literally the DS the original DS on

(47m 3s)

> Wildworld and it was meant for four people. Oh, yeah, and it was there's basically the same thing

(47m 5s) **Al:**

> Oh, they had it all the way back then.

(47m 10s)

> And they've not rethought how it works at all.

(47m 13s) **Kevin:**

> No, especially when they went to 12 people

(47m 16s) **Al:**

> And it's not like you can be like, oh, this is how all online's work, right?

(47m 20s)

> Because you do, like, let's take Scarlet and Violet, right?

(47m 22s)

> That game has so many issues, but connecting to their online is super quick and easy.

(47m 26s) **Kevin:**

> that is

(47m 27s) **Al:**

> Again, four people together, you're just typing the code and it pops you in the other person's game.

(47m 30s) **Kevin:**

> yeah well wait I take it back I had some issues with those codes but in general

(47m 35s)

> better than this yes sure yes um okay yes it wasn't perfect but it was it was a better

(47m 43s)

> overall design and industry for sure um oh my gosh it's wild um but hey at least it's okay it's

(47m 52s)

> water landing because this is a sea plane.

(47m 54s) **Al:**

> And then like if one person's switch like disconnects from the internet it crashes and pushes everybody off the other

(47m 56s) **Kevin:**

> The water landing was a big hole.

(48m)

> It was a big hole.

(48m 2s)

> That was part of the article.

(48m 3s)

> It had like two crashes.

(48m 4s)

> People were just trying to trickle in.

(48m 6s)

> They had a couple of points where they had to restart the whole line because they crashed.

(48m 11s)

> Oh, Magnificent.

(48m 12s) **Al:**

> So is it cool that you can now connect 12 people together if they all are on switch twos?

(48m 14s) **Kevin:**

> That was an incredible article.

(48m 21s) **Al:**

> Sure.

(48m 22s)

> I guess.

(48m 23s)

> Should you do it?

(48m 24s)

> No.

(48m 24s) **Kevin:**

> No, they should say that in the game. Please talk

(48m 25s) **Al:**

> You should not.

(48m 28s)

> All right.

(48m 30s)

> Let's talk about the other switch two features first because there's only a couple of them.

(48m 33s)

> So I guess performance and you know graphics.

(48m 36s)

> I've not really noticed a difference.

(48m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah!

(48m 42s) **Al:**

> It is faster I've seen some side by side on loading it definitely is faster, but like we're talking like it still takes like 30 40 seconds to load the game right like I'm not noticing a 10 second difference when it's still taking half a minute right like you're just you're just sitting there going this is taking forever.

(49m 1s)

> I get that it's a complicated like it's because they're all like generate completely you know individually generated and they have to have every single chunk saved and then they have to load it all I get that that's complicated.

(49m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it like that. That's hard. Optimization

(49m 13s) **Al:**

> But like it's I don't it's not it's not noticeably faster unless you're just seeing them side by side.

(49m 22s) **Kevin:**

> is hard, and especially in this kind of situation, like as they were every island and

(49m 25s)

> file is different or whatever. Right. But the problem is they use it as a selling point when they

(49m 30s)

> shouldn't, right? Like they should. I mean, even Pokemon on scarlet violet didn't use it as a

(49m 36s)

> selling point when it was when they absolutely should have. Right. So they just shouldn't have brought

(49m 37s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(49m 43s)

> Yeah.

(49m 44s) **Kevin:**

> it up at all. That's that's the problem here. Yeah. That's my feeling across the board for mouse

(49m 47s) **Al:**

> My smooth, I mean, it does what it says in the 10,

(49m 49s)

> I don't really know what to say.

(49m 50s)

> I still don't wanna use it 'cause I don't,

(49m 59s) **Kevin:**

> mode. It's like just in general. Sure. Sure. Yeah, partially not for me, but yeah, it's it's their

(50m) **Al:**

> But I 100% see why some people would enjoy it.

(50m 6s) **Kevin:**

> mouse mode is there. Yeah. Oh, you tell that was when I was kind of interested in.

(50m 9s) **Al:**

> The megaphone is super, super bad.

(50m 15s)

> It doesn't, it doesn't, I don't know whether this

(50m 18s)

> is a me problem because I'm Scottish,

(50m 22s)

> but it cannot figure out who I'm seeing.

(50m 25s)

> So let me, let me, let me pop up on my switch here

(50m 28s)

> and just do a little test, right?

(50m 29s)

> Where's my megaphone gone?

(50m 30s)

> Oh, give me two seconds.

(50m 33s)

> It's not actually in my bag, I need to go get it.

(50m 36s)

> Give me a minute.

(50m 37s)

> Oh wait, is it too late at night for me to do that?

(50m 39s)

> For people to be up, oh, it's 20 past eight, they should still be up now, right?

(50m 43s)

> I can't remember when people go to bed, right? I'm just getting my megaphone, okay, and then

(50m 50s)

> give me two seconds, let me go outside.

(50m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I am no, no, I'm just I'm looking something up because I just make you think of something

(51m) **Al:**

> Right, I am now standing in the town centre and I have my megaphone, so I'm going to go

(51m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay.

(51m 10s) **Al:**

> Raymond, no response it says. It didn't even get the wrong person at that time. Raymond

(51m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(51m 17s) **Al:**

> and who responded to that? Nobody! No, or some? Coco, no response.

(51m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(51m 26s) **Al:**

> Cocoa, note no response

(51m 30s)

> just nothing right so like this is it's super bad and I think I don't understand why they did this rather than just like showing you them on the map like just show where they are on the map that would be a much better feature and not rely on you know well I guess they couldn't then sell the switch to version right because that's the whole point is a switch to only feature yeah it's super bad I don't use it it's a waste of time don't don't

(51m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. (laughs)

(51m 51s)

> Yeah. Yeah.

(51m 56s)

> I, I've really would like to know if this is a U problem, and there is a strong chance it is because this reminds me of the switch to camera struggling to recognize people, you know, people melanin.

(52m 14s) **Al:**

> yeah I don't know I I I okay let's go on to the 3.0 features cuz I actually

(52m 24s)

> have some positive things to say but listeners please tell us if you have

(52m 29s)

> successfully used the megaphone cuz I just can't get it to work

(52m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Let's know how much the systemic recisima extends.

(52m 38s)

[laugh]

(52m 40s) **Al:**

> I'll probably not racism, but anyway. (laughs)

(52m 41s) **Kevin:**

> >> All rise in and fall right over.

(52m 43s)

> Discrimination of some time.

(52m 45s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(52m 45s) **Kevin:**

[laugh]

(52m 46s) **Al:**

> Yeah. (laughs)

(52m 47s)

> Anti Scottish bias.

(52m 49s) **Kevin:**

> >> Yeah.

(52m 51s) **Al:**

> All right.

(52m 52s)

> So, first up, we have the hotel,

(52m 55s)

> which is your happy home designer,

(52m 57s)

> but in a hotel this time.

(53m 1s)

> It's fine.

(53m 1s)

> I mean, I don't particularly enjoy the designing anyway.

(53m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean, it's just happy on Saturday.

(53m 6s)

> I think that's all it is.

(53m 7s) **Al:**

> Pretty much, but with the addition that you've got

(53m 10s)

> these things that you can get from the hotel,

(53m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(53m 14s) **Al:**

> the souvenirs and extra things.

(53m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so you're earning like a currency for that. Is that right? Okay, how do you earn the currency?

(53m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(53m 20s)

> Yeah.

(53m 22s)

> So you either earn the currency by designing the rooms,

(53m 25s)

> so you go in once a day and they'll say,

(53m 27s)

> "Oh, can you do this room?"

(53m 28s)

> And you go in and you put in,

(53m 30s)

> they have a theme and you choose what items to put in,

(53m 33s)

> and then they say, "That's great."

(53m 35s)

> And they give you some of the currency.

(53m 37s)

> Or you can also do it by submitting the crafted items

(53m 40s)

> that they want in the box outside.

(53m 44s)

> So it kind of works like the Nukemile stuff

(53m 46s)

> where there will be like four items that they're asking for,

(53m 49s)

> and then when you donate those ones,

(53m 52s)

> it will then pop some new ones in.

(53m 54s)

> So you'll always have four of them,

(53m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just like Nick Miles from what I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

(53m 56s) **Al:**

> but the first four in the day have like double

(54m)

> the amount that you get for them.

(54m 3s)

> Basically exactly how the Nukemile stuff works, yeah.

(54m 7s)

> Why I do like that that they've got two different ways

(54m 10s)

> to get the currency, right?

(54m 11s)

> because I do not care about doing the...

(54m 14s)

> the rooms you have to do the first one to get it going and then be able to use the donation box but after the first one you don't need to do anymore and being able to just crafting is fine I can do some crafting and I can give you some stuff and I can still get the currency to get the souvenir items that's that's fine I'm happy with that and because the crafting menu so if you go if you throw like a crafting table next to the donations box and you

(54m 41s)

> you just go into the crafting tip because you know it's nice

(54m 44s)

> to have it there so you can just craft it and then throw it straight in the donations box. There is a page now on the crafting menu that will show you what it's what their look what is in the requested items as well so you don't even need to go to the donations box to look and what see what there is you can just go straight to the crafting table craft the stuff and then put it in the

(55m 5s)

> box so that's really nice as well there's very little friction there right like once a day I'll go down to the crafting table at the hotel I will craft it.

(55m 14s)

> what it says at once and then I'll throw it in the donations box I get some of the currency I go by whatever's new in the hotel that day.

(55m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, sure, sure, just another daily activity you can do, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, okay.

(55m 24s) **Al:**

> Exactly and then the other thing that this obviously leads to is then there's other villagers walking around the island.

(55m 33s)

> I don't know if it's one pair room per day. It's only up to one pair room per day. I only currently have one room and I think every time.

(55m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Uh-huh.

(55m 44s) **Al:**

> I know every day I'll be on on there has been one person but if I had four rooms I don't know if there would be four every day I'm not sure if that's how it works.

(55m 54s)

> The funny thing is so you can in the hotel lobby they have the mannequins and you can put clothes on the mannequins if you put if you put outfits on the mannequins the villager will choose one of the ones to put on before they start walking around the island.

(56m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(56m 6s)

> Yeah.

(56m 9s) **Al:**

> Because now I just have villagers walking around in the island with bike helmets on.

(56m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

(56m 14s) **Al:**

> Because I just chose random clothes that looked silly.

(56m 18s)

> And so now they're walking around in the bike helmet and yeah, exactly.

(56m 19s) **Kevin:**

> In the octonated into the cold.

(56m 23s) **Al:**

> Exactly. So I think it's, I think it's fun. I get there's some people that are complaining

(56m 28s)

> because they're like, why are these random villagers know one of my island? I had this like,

(56m 30s) **Kevin:**

> They're ruining my aesthetic.

(56m 31s) **Al:**

> curate exactly. And I'm like, sure, fine, then don't do the hotel, right? Like you have to

(56m 38s)

> actively say it up. I think it's, if you're interested in the different villagers and

(56m 44s)

> because like part of the thing about animal crossing is like, there are so many different

(56m 47s)

> villagers and they all have different designs. Like, I think it's fun to occasionally see them.

(56m 49s) **Kevin:**

> so many

(56m 52s) **Al:**

> You know, I don't, I don't think that's a bad thing.

(56m 53s) **Kevin:**

> yes I agree

(56m 55s)

> yeah no I fully agree but I am happy you know some of this

(57m 1s)

> reignited some of that rape and discourse from back in the day um

(57m 4s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(57m 5s) **Kevin:**

> hahaha I thought of happy to see that again um but but I mean I agree because yes there's so

(57m 10s)

> many villagers especially now and and and at least I don't know if it's an majority i'm going to

(57m 15s)

> assume it's an majority we get attached to our villagers right we don't necessarily want to see

(57m 19s)

> so you don't actually get to see that many other designs in game unless you buy amiibo cards

(57m 26s)

> um but no I think I think that's a fun clever way okay their question is there any way to get a

(57m 33s)

> hotel guest to move to your island because I know that's what the campsite is for but I was

(57m 36s)

> wondering if you can do that with a hotel guest at all

(57m 38s) **Al:**

> I have not managed to see that but I don't have any empty house.

(57m 42s) **Kevin:**

> hmm okay yeah that is probably an issue

(57m 46s) **Al:**

> I don't know the answer to that question actually.

(57m 49s) **Kevin:**

> okay because I haven't heard anything of that I don't remember them saying that in the

(57m 53s)

> direct so much so many not but I was just curious if you had seen or to experience anything

(57m 59s)

> but okay yeah that would be my guess because again that's what the campsites were right

(58m) **Al:**

> and it looks like no, that is not possible.

(58m 7s)

> I've talked about most of the crafting improvements, but obviously there's the multi craft as well.

(58m 12s)

> It's fine, I have two issues. One, you have to like,

(58m 16s)

> it's really awkward in that you click on what you want to click, and then you say I want to craft it,

(58m 20s)

> and then you have to press Y, and then you choose how many you want,

(58m 24s)

> rather than just clicking to craft it.

(58m 26s)

> So it's like, I really feel like they could have removed a step, right?

(58m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Oh.

(58m 30s) **Al:**

> if this, then like, show us the screen with the number,

(58m 33s)

> and then you either press A to just craft the one, or you move the number to choose how many you want.

(58m 38s)

> It's the most awkward way to do multi crafting, they could have possibly done.

(58m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Well, it's difficult. No one has figured it out yet, since my first introduction in 2010. I'm sorry. Oh, it's just the way it is.

(58m 43s) **Al:**

> But at least it's there.

(58m 53s)

> I'm glad it's there. I just, I feel like I wish they could have looked at the UX a bit better.

(58m 59s)

> That's all. The other thing is, you can only craft 10 at once. It's a max of 10. Yep.

(59m 6s) **Kevin:**

> That's that's weird that feels arbitrary. That's a problem, right?

(59m 8s) **Al:**

> And I don't know why.

(59m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Well, why tends specifically like what, yeah, yeah.

(59m 13s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Which is especially because some things are multi-crafting, right? So like, I can only craft

(59m 19s)

> say 10 spades at once, but I can actually craft.

(59m 23s)

> 50 fences posts because they get five at a time from them.

(59m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. The bites can't run that high out of it. There's just no room on the data.

(59m 29s) **Al:**

> It's just why such a weird arbitrary restriction. I don't understand why.

(59m 39s)

> I do like that the crafting includes your house and it doesn't matter where your crafting table is.

(59m 44s)

> It still uses this stuff from your storage. That's nice. I like this. This is good.

(59m 47s) **Kevin:**

> That's great. Oh, I know we're joking about how that might not happen, but I'm glad it's okay. It's bad. Anyways, go ahead

(59m 53s) **Al:**

> It has made it just so much easier to deal with these things, right?

(59m 57s)

> Because you go around and you get some wood and you get some all the stuff that you, your daily stuff.

(1h) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 2s) **Al:**

> And then you throw them in, you throw them in your house storage and you don't think about them again.

(1h 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 6s) **Al:**

> And then you go to craft something and everything's just there. It's really nice.

(1h 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, isn't it wonderful? I'd no longer have to dedicate a whole bro inventory to

(1h 15s)

> It's random junk, it crashed.

(1h 15s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1h 17s) **Kevin:**

> If I needed to, uh-huh.

(1h 19s) **Al:**

> So yeah, I think the crafting improvements overall just generally good just.

(1h 23s)

> Fix your UX and let's craft more than 10 what weird restriction.

(1h 27s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(1h 30s) **Al:**

> I'm Rosetti.

(1h 31s) **Kevin:**

> If you buy this paid Switch 2 expansion,

(1h 35s)

> well you get 20. (laughs)

(1h 38s) **Al:**

> Rosetti.

(1h 41s)

> He's fine.

(1h 42s)

> I think there's one there's one weird thing for me in that he won't pick up anything that's naturally occurring.

(1h 53s)

> I accept flowers and I think I can't remember if you choose trees or not, but you doesn't do anything else.

(1h 59s)

> Like if you get them to clear the beach, he won't pick up the shells.

(1h 1m 3s)

> If you get them to clear up somewhere else, he won't pick up the weeds because that's leaf's job apparently.

(1h 1m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Ha ha ha yeah

(1h 1m 10s) **Al:**

> It's such a weird and I'm also like I personally just don't think I'll ever use him because the one time I thought about using him I was like I'd really like him to be able to do landscaping.

(1h 1m 23s)

> I was recovering my island from when I had was doing my most, yeah, when I was most recently doing my moving of rocks and so my island was almost entirely water.

(1h 1m 25s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, water world.

(1h 1m 34s) **Al:**

> But no, he won't do landscaping it's just cleaning things up and it's only unnatural things and flowers.

(1h 1m 43s)

> Like what a weird restriction. Like I would talk to him every day to get him to clean up the beach to get all my shells, but no, you won't do that.

(1h 1m 50s)

> And so I just I just don't see when am I ever going to use?

(1h 1m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's you, you use him when you started the update and, and you were going to redo your whole island, but you didn't, you know, you specifically weren't in that situation, but, but that was.

(1h 2m 4s) **Al:**

> But here's, but here's the thing because they've created the other feature that means you're never going to redo your whole island because now they have slumber islands.

(1h 2m 13s)

> So when you get the like, oh, I really want to do this as an island because here's an interesting idea I have, you're going to use the slumber islands then you're not going to clear your entire island.

(1h 2m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Anytime we discuss Animal Crossing New Horizon, I think it's important to

(1h 2m 29s)

> remember they added the a video tour to the the other little islands that you

(1h 2m 35s)

> visit to move stuff to your storage but only for our silent

(1h 2m 39s)

> and that's decided yeah yeah

(1h 2m 41s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I would love to hear the meetings and where they make these decisions and they're like,

(1h 2m 50s)

> "Oh, what's the most annoying version of this feature that we can do?"

(1h 2m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, hi.

(1h 2m 55s) **Al:**

> So bizarre, so bizarre. So, I mean, yeah, it's a cool idea and I guess it's cool that they're using

(1h 3m)

> him for something, but I just, I literally cannot, I'm not, I've not even used my free one. I just cannot

(1h 3m 6s)

> see why I would bother you.

(1h 3m 11s) **Kevin:**

> or okay, like, so functionally, yeah, okay, I knew who's going to be like functional limited.

(1h 3m 18s)

> It was going to find certain people and even then, like, maybe using once, maybe twice because

(1h 3m 24s)

> right most people try to keep an island in a certain way or whatever. Like you said, it's even

(1h 3m 29s)

> weird because we have the new dream, sweet sandbox islands or whatever. So it's weird, but okay,

(1h 3m 35s)

> here in my burning questions are the flavor, did reset.

(1h 3m 41s)

> At any point, actually, yeah, we're good in.

(1h 3m 44s) **Al:**

> So he talks about... I can't remember the exact wording, but there's definitely an implication that he's been going to therapy.

(1h 3m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yes, well while on the one hand

(1h 3m 55s) **Al:**

> And he definitely gets... I think there's a bit where he kind of almost gets angry and then he pulls it back.

(1h 4m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yes

(1h 4m 2s) **Al:**

> He's very clearly managing himself. It's kind of amusing.

(1h 4m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(1h 4m 7s)

> Okay, well, you know, I guess like I could maybe I could take that because I do applaud

(1h 4m 12s)

> You know someone trying to maintain you improve themselves and go into therapy. That's always admirable

(1h 4m 16s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 4m 17s) **Kevin:**

> But at the same time, I want those

(1h 4m 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1h 4m 20s) **Kevin:**

> scarring verbal abuse that was given to us in the original.

(1h 4m 25s)

> Okay, second question. Do you see it?

(1h 4m 30s)

> Absolutely, that's the name of his brother.

(1h 4m 32s) **Al:**

> No, at least I've not seen him, but I haven't used Rosetti so I don't know whether he's

(1h 4m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Nope, darn it!

(1h 4m 36s)

> Okay, oh, yeah.

(1h 4m 39s)

> Okay, fine.

(1h 4m 41s)

> It's not Louis.

(1h 4m 42s)

> There is a dawn.

(1h 4m 43s)

> I know I think it's dawn.

(1h 4m 44s)

> I'm thinking of Pickman, aren't I?

(1h 4m 49s) **Al:**

> - I don't know.

(1h 4m 50s) **Kevin:**

> It's dawn, yeah.

(1h 4m 52s)

> Okay, a dawn's of the brother.

(1h 4m 54s)

> Anyway, okay.

(1h 4m 55s)

> Well, that's fun.

(1h 4m 57s)

> That's fine.

(1h 4m 58s)

> All right, what else we got in there?

(1h 5m) **Al:**

> Alright, well, we're we've got the slumber islands then which I think are great. Oh, apparently. Yeah, so apparently if you do use the

(1h 5m 10s)

> And New Horizons Don is shown to be helping Rosetti with the rescue service covering from him when he's on his break

(1h 5m 17s)

> He speaks to himself for a boost of confidence before transferring the player to their destination when is when's Rosetti on his break from the rescue service?

(1h 5m 26s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know, I forgot, I forgot Rosetti did the rescue service.

(1h 5m 27s) **Al:**

> Apparently, he may pop up in the roost from time to time.

(1h 5m 30s)

> I think this is a great feature that like many things is just missing a few things to make it really, really good.

(1h 5m 33s) **Kevin:**

> I completely forgot about that, but also I don't think you actually see him, right, just the text.

(1h 5m 41s)

> You don't actually see him.

(1h 5m 43s)

> No anyways, but yeah yeah. Um...

(1h 5m 58s)

> Questionable decisions were made

(1h 6m) **Al:**

> The question of both decisions were made.

(1h 6m 2s)

> So first of all, fantastic, just in general, right?

(1h 6m 6s)

> So let me play in your little story.

(1h 6m 8s)

> So Craig, my son, my seven year old,

(1h 6m 11s)

> he's really into games just now he's been playing a lot of Minecraft.

(1h 6m 15s)

> He saw me the other day playing Animal Crossing.

(1h 6m 17s)

> I was like, what's this?

(1h 6m 18s)

> This looks like it could be fun.

(1h 6m 19s)

> And I'm like, oh, here we go again.

(1h 6m 21s)

> So I play it and I said, yeah, you can play it.

(1h 6m 24s)

> But he plays on his own switch, right?

(1h 6m 26s)

> So I was like, well, let me show you this.

(1h 6m 30s)

> I get you started on your switch.

(1h 6m 31s)

> So I let him the game digitally and he started playing it and he's like,

(1h 6m 35s)

> I just, I really want to do the terraforming because that's the bit that it's fun.

(1h 6m 39s)

> And it takes a couple of weeks to unlock that in real time, right?

(1h 6m 44s)

> And so I was like, okay, tell you what, what we can do is we can have a slumber island.

(1h 6m 49s)

> So I'll set up a slumber island on mine and you can do whatever you want in there.

(1h 6m 53s)

> And then I don't have to because he was like, can I do it on yours?

(1h 6m 56s)

> Because you've got it unlocked and I didn't, I didn't want him to do that because

(1h 6m 59s)

> I've just been...

(1h 7m)

> been a week trying to get my island back to something that I actually want, so I don't want him to then spend more time doing all that, because he wanted to build a maze, he's really into mazes just now, and so he wanted to build a maze, and I'm like, that's fun!

(1h 7m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, right, right

(1h 7m 12s) **Al:**

> So, sure, let's set you up a slumber island, because I remember to buy that feature, I hadn't used it yet, let's set up a slumber island, and you can go in and do that.

(1h 7m 19s)

> And so he has, he's gone in, and he's done it, and it's great, and he's really getting the hang of the land, the terraforming, and all that.

(1h 7m 26s)

> There's some weird decisions that I don't particularly care about.

(1h 7m 30s)

> But I can see why others would be really annoyed about.

(1h 7m 33s)

> You can't build buildings on the slumber islands.

(1h 7m 37s)

> So there is one building which is your house.

(1h 7m 41s)

> And that's it. There's no other buildings you can build on the island.

(1h 7m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Yeah. Very weird.

(1h 7m 46s) **Al:**

> What a weird idea, right? Because so many people's visions of islands include the buildings, right?

(1h 7m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you're being so right.

(1h 7m 58s)

> Well, yeah, that is confused.

(1h 7m 59s)

> And I remember that was the thing I saw there in the trailer.

(1h 8m 2s)

> I was wondering, I was like, wait, do you get to put other houses or buildings?

(1h 8m 6s)

> Because they only show off the the one house.

(1h 8m 8s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and we assumed it would just be something they weren't showing us like this sounds like a great thing. Why would they not do this? Well, they didn't do it

(1h 8m 17s)

> Secondly, you can change the weather and the time of day, but you cannot change the season

(1h 8m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Can I... What?

(1h 8m 26s) **Al:**

> So the season on your slumber islands is just whatever your current season is, but you can you can set whatever time of day you want

(1h 8m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(1h 8m 34s)

> No.

(1h 8m 34s) **Al:**

> and you can set wherever, whether you want, but you cannot set

(1h 8m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Sorry, I have you.

(1h 8m 38s) **Al:**

> the season. Why? It's a dream. Let me do what I want in my dream.

(1h 8m 41s) **Kevin:**

> No, you are not.

(1h 8m 44s)

> No, you can only dream about summer when it's summer.

(1h 8m 48s)

> It's just like the real world.

(1h 8m 50s)

> That's it.

(1h 8m 51s)

> It's how it is.

(1h 8m 51s) **Al:**

> It's so silly. It's such a bizarre idea. Like, because they had to make a decision to be like,

(1h 8m 52s) **Kevin:**

> It's how it works though.

(1h 8m 59s) **Al:**

> yeah, okay, we'll let you change the time and we'll let you change the weather. Oh, however,

(1h 9m 3s)

> we let them change the season. No, I don't understand how because I

(1h 9m 8s)

> that never came up, in which case, what are they doing or they decided, no, we're not going to do that,

(1h 9m 14s)

> in which case, what are they doing? Why is that not a decision? I don't, if you didn't give

(1h 9m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, there you go.

(1h 9m 18s) **Al:**

> them anything, it's just whatever your current thing is, it's just going to be that. I would

(1h 9m 22s)

> understand that, but they specifically let you set the time and weather.

(1h 9m 28s) **Kevin:**

> There was no room on the UI for the season button now.

(1h 9m 33s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(1h 9m 34s)

> - Pissar, bizarre decision.

(1h 9m 38s)

> They have three sizes of islands.

(1h 9m 40s)

> I was really excited that I thought maybe one of them

(1h 9m 43s)

> would be bigger than your current island,

(1h 9m 44s)

> but no, it's not.

(1h 9m 46s) **Kevin:**

> N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N.

(1h 9m 46s) **Al:**

> The biggest one is just your standard island size.

(1h 9m 48s)

> So whatever, I just, I think that's a mess.

(1h 9m 51s)

> It would be fun to have a bigger island, personally.

(1h 9m 54s) **Kevin:**

> not would be but

(1h 9m 55s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(1h 9m 59s)

> I think other than that, it's mostly fine, right?

(1h 10m 2s)

> like you can you can get.

(1h 10m 3s)

> and you can like reproduce that as many times as you want, which is fun, you don't have to craft your tools or infinite stuff like that.

(1h 10m 13s)

> It's generally pretty good. It's just those are a few decisions that make it bizarre to me that they wouldn't let you do those things. I don't understand.

(1h 10m 23s)

> I also I think three save slots. I would have liked another one maybe two. Like three just feels like it's just quiet.

(1h 10m 33s)

> Not quite enough. Four or five would have been better for me, but I get, you know, the storage space probably takes up a lot for these islands. I get that.

(1h 10m 38s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, yeah, I can manage.

(1h 10m 43s) **Al:**

> So yeah, it's a great thing because that like I just I'd never would have been able to get Craig to do some terraforming without either having him to ruin my island or him get bored of the game after before two weeks was up and he hadn't unlocked.

(1h 10m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, hey, that is cool. Um, yeah, I just and buildings are such a big miss cuz

(1h 11m 4s) **Al:**

> is bizarre bizarre. Oh, and also you can add, you know, your inclines and bridges and they are

(1h 11m 11s)

> added automatically. Well, sorry, straightaway, which is nice. So like, I can see someone using it

(1h 11m 21s)

> either as, so there's like three things essentially. Like what I did, which is Craig wants his own

(1h 11m 27s)

> island, he doesn't want to have put in the effort to unlock everything. Great, there you go.

(1h 11m 31s)

> there's the other one, which is I just want to make a really interesting looking island. I

(1h 11m 34s)

> want to do my on my main island but the third one is I feel like it could also be close to

(1h 11m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yup, testing ground.

(1h 11m 39s) **Al:**

> being good for like testing out for your main island right like oh what if I did this but the problem

(1h 11m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Almost. I love.

(1h 11m 46s) **Al:**

> with that is that because you don't have the buildings you can't do it properly but like being able

(1h 11m 54s)

> to the like oh what if I tried to do this thing with these bridges and inclines you can then go in

(1h 12m)

> and spend half an hour tests all out and go yeah this will work and

(1h 12m 4s)

> then spend the next week waiting a day every time to get your thing to build.

(1h 12m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, it's yeah not having to wait for you know, do all that waiting stuff

(1h 12m 12s) **Al:**

> I could see myself spending more time in the slumber.

(1h 12m 21s)

> I also, I need to double check. I think you can only bring your your villagers that are currently on your island to the slumber islands, which I feel like is a miss. I feel like being able to have like multiple islands of different villagers would be great.

(1h 12m 29s) **Kevin:**

> That is a big miss too at bear

(1h 12m 35s)

> You know that would be a great use case for the hotel guests

(1h 12m 41s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, that'd be good.

(1h 12m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Ones that show up there just end up in a register that you can use on dream mileage, but no say love me. Oh, man. What a that's

(1h 12m 49s)

> Good I baffling decisions every

(1h 12m 55s) **Al:**

> I'm trying to fact-check myself to

(1h 12m 57s)

> Okay, so you can you can invite past villages as well, but not ones that you haven't had

(1h 13m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, let's start I guess but still limiting again if you like if you're happy other crew you don't get the experience that many villagers to begin with

(1h 13m 12s) **Al:**

> but you also can't talk to them.

(1h 13m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah

(1h 13m 15s) **Al:**

> If you talk to them, they'll just stand there

(1h 13m 18s)

> and they might use a reaction, they won't talk.

(1h 13m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's really the end and then you horizon experience. There's Raymond looking in

(1h 13m 25s) **Al:**

> And every, and you have to put the villagers there every time you go, the villagers won't stay there.

(1h 13m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 13m 34s)

> Look at Raymond. He's for the aesthetics

(1h 13m 38s)

> How do you better be in boxes?

(1h 13m 43s)

> Good times all right, what else do we got in this update?

(1h 13m 49s) **Al:**

> "We have strafing, which is great. It's fantastic. It has made terraforming fun rather than a chore."

(1h 13m 57s)

> Like being able to just go along a whole row, just like hold the button, hold the right, and then just press A, press A, press A, press A, it's great.

(1h 14m 6s)

> I love it.

(1h 14m 7s)

> I would like the strafing to be like a toggle rather than a hold, because I do find my hand cramps on long sessions.

(1h 14m 13s) **Kevin:**

> We are at the point we're not just animal crossing any game

(1h 14m 19s)

> Like you just said is a toggle bra and set run for a toggle or whatever you know the comparable example we're at that point. Come on people

(1h 14m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's another yeah, that's another thing that in this game is not a toggle. It's a you have to hold into it. It's such a like they just

(1h 14m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, you gotta stay consistent then don't you?

(1h 14m 33s) **Al:**

> Consistently bad

(1h 14m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well

(1h 14m 37s)

> You get to credit. I couldn't have the other one. I could we don't?

(1h 14m 41s) **Al:**

> Of course not course not

(1h 14m 43s)

> Yeah, I don't really know what else to say. It's great. I don't have anything to complain about this feature

(1h 14m 47s)

> Other than the fact that I'd like it to be a toggle. That's it. It's great. It's a great feature

(1h 14m 54s)

> And Craig picked that up really quickly when I taught him how it works

(1h 14m 57s)

> He now uses it all the time for stuff like I think the thing that I so there's two things that I really great a bit

(1h 15m 3s)

> One is just how quick it makes terraforming now, but the other thing is you know all these videos you got

(1h 15m 9s)

> Years ago about people like trying to dig up a specific thing and they kept missing the one specific patch they needed to

(1h 15m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah!

(1h 15m 15s) **Al:**

> This fixes that because you just point the vague out vague

(1h 15m 20s)

> location, you press the straight button and it lines you up and you now

(1h 15m 23s)

> know where you're going to go. It's, it is such a good feature.

(1h 15m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I need to, I still haven't even like seen that ever heard about it and people talk about it, but I need to see like, I think what it looks like, but that sounds cool.

(1h 15m 37s) **Al:**

> it's super super good. It's such a good feat. Uh, the home storage I have no opinions on because

(1h 15m 43s)

> I've never filled up my storage. But I guess it's good. It's really expensive and you can't use

(1h 15m 49s)

> loans for it. So you have to have 1.2 million bells to get the top storage.

(1h 15m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, really? That's fascinating. That's cool. You know, I actually like them.

(1h 15m 58s) **Al:**

> But at this point, at this point, who doesn't have stupid amounts of bells from selling the

(1h 16m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right.

(1h 16m 2s) **Al:**

> turnips, right? Come on. And I guess it's like it's endgame stuff.

(1h 16m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Absolutely.

(1h 16m 8s) **Al:**

> particularly bad, right? Like, if you're, if you're at the point where you need, was it 12,000

(1h 16m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I agree.

(1h 16m 13s) **Al:**

> storage or whatever it is, like some insane amount? Like, I think you can drop a million bells.

(1h 16m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 16m 17s) **Al:**

> I think you're fine with that. You've probably spent like three times as much getting the

(1h 16m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Don't you call me out like this out?

(1h 16m 24s) **Al:**

> items that you need to store. Yeah, I just, I just don't particularly care about the, yeah, shut up.

(1h 16m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Hey, we don't think about that.

(1h 16m 30s)

> I'm going to think about how that reflects on your real life either.

(1h 16m 37s) **Al:**

> That took me a minute to log what you were saying. Um, and the last thing is, uh, the last thing I'm

(1h 16m 42s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(1h 16m 44s) **Al:**

> really noticing is you can get leaf to remove weeds from your island now. But only if there's a

(1h 16m 51s)

> certain number of them. Was it? I don't think so because it is listed in the patch note.

(1h 16m 54s) **Kevin:**

> was it out here in the thing? That wasn't in the game already.

(1h 17m 1s)

> Well, thing. I'm crazy. I feel like, I don't know.

(1h 17m 4s)

> I mean, maybe I'm just thinking of Earth Day or whatever.

(1h 17m 7s)

> Cause there was a day if you would show up to, Hey, let's remove the weeds.

(1h 17m 13s) **Al:**

> Maybe maybe that's what it was. Yeah, or maybe you could maybe you could only do it when he was visiting the island because now you can do it when you when he's on Harves Island

(1h 17m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe that. Okay. Okay.

(1h 17m 20s) **Al:**

> You can go and ask him to do it when he's not on the island. I

(1h 17m 23s)

> Mean, it's a great feature right because the number of people coming to this have haven't played for two years and their island is covered in

(1h 17m 29s)

> weeds

(1h 17m 30s)

> You can just go and get paid

(1h 17m 33s)

> You know go over to Harves Island and ask leaf to get rid of them all it's good

(1h 17m 37s)

> But again something I probably won't ever use because I

(1h 17m 40s)

> I feel like the amount of effort to go to Harves Island.

(1h 17m 43s)

> So I think to summarize, most of these are at least good additions to the game, if not sometimes with baffling decisions made.

(1h 17m 53s) **Kevin:**

> That's the game!

(1h 18m 9s) **Al:**

> None of it makes me want to play the game.

(1h 18m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Ha ha ha. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no.

(1h 18m 13s) **Al:**

> It doesn't fund it. What was the thing I was complaining about earlier in our chat?

(1h 18m 20s)

> Let me check why I said. Because I got really annoyed the other day.

(1h 18m 24s)

> Oh yeah, the paths and stuff. I still don't understand how this game is designed for a let's make an island look pretty.

(1h 18m 33s)

> Like that's the fundamental point of this game. And I can't get my paths to line up properly.

(1h 18m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Oh yeah.

(1h 18m 39s) **Al:**

> Because I can't why can I not put paths up

(1h 18m 43s)

> an incline or at least to the bottom of the incline with no gap why can't I put them up to up to the the the the side of

(1h 18m 47s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(1h 18m 51s) **Al:**

> Houses why can I not put them up to the beach? Why can I not? Why is the whole point of this game is make this island look pretty and I can't do it?

(1h 18m 55s) **Kevin:**

> We don't have the technology at all.

(1h 19m 3s) **Al:**

> Why can I still not buy things from?

(1h 19m 8s)

> The the adb I cannot buy things from the adb use

(1h 19m 13s)

> the adb balance. I have to take money out of the adb have it in my bag which by the way you can still only have a hundred thousand in your wallet and then and then you have lists sets of a hundred K in your bag which takes up so much space. Sorry, 99k rounding up and all of this I don't understand why the money management is still so bad in this game.

(1h 19m 28s) **Kevin:**

> $9,000, $9,000, $9,000.

(1h 19m 32s)

> I'd love to say just to make it more awkward.

(1h 19m 40s) **Al:**

> Especially when you have to have a, you have to have one point.

(1h 19m 43s)

> It's 2 million bells in your bag to buy the most recent the highest storage upgrade, so you have to have a bag full of money.

(1h 19m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, how they don't live in a casual society. Well,

(1h 19m 57s) **Al:**

> It's more than it's 13 stacks of money you have to have to buy the highest thing.

(1h 19m 58s) **Kevin:**

> I also are they going to validate that you have those bells. They, they have to count

(1h 20m 6s)

> every one of those stacks. No other way.

(1h 20m 7s) **Al:**

> Why can I still only have 10 items?

(1h 20m 13s)

> I don't understand this, I know it's better than previous ones.

(1h 20m 17s)

> This is what made me stop playing new leaf so quickly.

(1h 20m 21s)

> Was just the lack of stacking in the game.

(1h 20m 24s)

> It drove me insane when I first went into that.

(1h 20m 27s)

> I think you could stack them, but you had to manually stack them.

(1h 20m 31s) **Kevin:**

> I believe so. Yeah.

(1h 20m 31s) **Al:**

> Is that how it newly worked?

(1h 20m 33s)

> Absolutely baffling decision there.

(1h 20m 36s)

> I just like, I've spent about half an hour on that game.

(1h 20m 40s)

> The moment I realized you had to manually stack fruit.

(1h 20m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

(1h 20m 44s) **Al:**

> I know, I know that game so fast.

(1h 20m 49s)

> So I'm so glad that you weren't actually had stacking.

(1h 20m 51s)

> But why is it stacks of 10?

(1h 20m 53s)

> I don't understand.

(1h 20m 55s)

> Pokémon's the ageest out of the thing where you can have a thousand stack of shards.

(1h 20m 59s)

> Give me more.

(1h 21m 1s)

> It's literally just a bite.

(1h 21m 4s)

> Give me more of that bite, please.

(1h 21m 7s) **Kevin:**

> They don't have the room for those fights, no go that high, but only for bells, not for those other items where they can go higher.

(1h 21m 8s) **Al:**

> You can't.

(1h 21m 10s)

> you can't you can't

(1h 21m 13s)

> You can't store 10 in a smaller space than you can store 100 in binary in unless you're being insanely obsessive about your storage, which I don't think they are

(1h 21m 28s)

> Happy fun times. This game is still so frustrating and yes, they have improved some of this game, but it is still incredibly frustrating and I

(1h 21m 39s)

> I still can't decide whether I want to play it ever.

(1h 21m 43s)

> You know, like I just- I don't... Ahh.

(1h 21m 44s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(1h 21m 47s) **Al:**

> Frustrates me. Frustrates me, Kevin.

(1h 21m 52s)

> How long till I get frustrated by a new animal crossing game? That's the question.

(1h 21m 56s) **Kevin:**

> oh man oh you know are you familiar with the credit card from cityfolk are you familiar with

(1h 22m 3s) **Al:**

> say say again sorry I am I am not is this a feature that I want in this game

(1h 22m 6s) **Kevin:**

> I think it was called the credit card the bank card from cityfolk

(1h 22m 11s) **Al:**

> that was it that's like three games ago is that right tell me

(1h 22m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, on the Wii, yeah, two, two, two.

(1h 22m 18s)

> I guess we count the updates, maybe two and a half.

(1h 22m 20s)

> Anyways, it was a card, it was a Benny card.

(1h 22m 25s)

> I'm actually a bank card from whatever call,

(1h 22m 27s)

> that you could go and buy something

(1h 22m 30s)

> without having to have all the bells in your inventory,

(1h 22m 34s)

> just in your bank account.

(1h 22m 35s)

> What?

(1h 22m 37s)

> You could only use it at Gracie Grace,

(1h 22m 41s)

> this high-end, greasy, greasy store.

(1h 22m 41s) **Al:**

> I just, I, this is the thing, it's like all these decisions are decisions. None of these

(1h 22m 45s) **Kevin:**

> One day they'll figure it out.

(1h 22m 57s)

> Yeah, right. Yeah.

(1h 22m 57s) **Al:**

> things are accidental. They have had to make decisions about all of these things and I don't

(1h 23m 3s)

> understand why they've made the

(1h 23m 5s) **Kevin:**

> So yeah, that's that exact my thoughts on people, but yeah, no, it's it's

(1h 23m 14s)

> entry. Well, no, I say I say that I'm just far removed. I was about to say it feels

(1h 23m 17s)

> like they've done a lot more of that in this update, but now that's not true.

(1h 23m 21s)

> It's been a while, but 90.

(1h 23m 26s) **Al:**

> Do you think this is the last update?

(1h 23m 27s) **Kevin:**

> minutes. Sorry what genuinely, yes, like all broken and heckling them aside, I do

(1h 23m 29s) **Al:**

> Do you think this is the last update?

(1h 23m 37s) **Kevin:**

> think it is. I think yep, it's stalling.

(1h 23m 39s) **Al:**

> Every time they release an update and delays the new games or like not not and just just for listeners

(1h 23m 45s)

> That doesn't I'm not saying they're taking people away from the other thing that takes it my point is it just my point is when they release an update

(1h 23m 51s)

(1h 23m 55s) **Kevin:**

(1h 24m 22s)

> You're right your

(1h 24m 25s)

> Yeah, you're right, but mmm. It's a good one. I'm gonna lean towards haunted chocolate to your but you I could be dead wrong

(1h 24m 32s) **Al:**

> Are we getting either of them before 2030?

(1h 24m 36s)

> That's the big one. Are either of those games coming out this decade?

(1h 24m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Oh animal crossing definitely not I'm I'm I'm serious five years. That's my that's my bed right now

(1h 24m 45s) **Al:**

(1h 24m 48s) **Kevin:**

> When did he first announce it? Oh

(1h 24m 50s) **Al:**

> 2021, I think.

(1h 24m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Oh no, and you

(1h 24m 55s)

> Okay, do you really thing it would be like hold on I'm gonna check this - because this is this is critical

(1h 25m 4s) **Al:**

> Oh yeah October 2021 was when he announced the game.

(1h 25m 10s)

> We're nearly at five years from an end.

(1h 25m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, okay, definitely haunts chocolate here. I'm gonna give concern date, but I've cried of that he can bring it out before 10 years

(1h 25m 20s) **Al:**

> you think it's coming, you think it's coming within this decade.

(1h 25m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(1h 25m 25s) **Al:**

> "Stake on a year." So obviously it's not this year, it's probably not next year.

(1h 25m 25s) **Kevin:**

> I'm gonna... No, I'll say 29. I'll... I'll 29. I'll be generous.

(1h 25m 32s) **Al:**

> 28 or 29.

(1h 25m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Eight years. Yeah. Yeah, I can see it.

(1h 25m 39s) **Al:**

> As kind of mad that it is taking away, we've taken that long.

(1h 25m 44s)

> If it takes eight years from announcement to release that.

(1h 25m 48s) **Kevin:**

> And it's kind of, well, we're in the age of the silk song psychos and I mean the dead

(1h 25m 55s)

> is not the players.

(1h 25m 56s) **Al:**

> It's sure, sure.

(1h 25m 56s) **Kevin:**

> It's like, concerned it is absolutely among those, right?

(1h 26m 2s)

> Because there's a thing.

(1h 26m 4s)

> I say that 2020 not, but there's also going to be a started update, at least every

(1h 26m 8s)

> other year in between then.

(1h 26m 13s) **Al:**

> So, they announced that Silk Song was going to be its own game in 2019.

(1h 26m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, which in all honesty not that bad

(1h 26m 20s) **Al:**

> That's only that's only two years before Hunter Juglet here was announced.

(1h 26m 29s)

> So we're not long from it being there more time between Hunter Juglet.

(1h 26m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I see it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a good point to you. Yeah. I don't think it's going to come out that soon though. I think it's going to be a little long. I'm going to say this decade, but it's going to be a minute. That's my opinion.

(1h 26m 54s) **Al:**

> already. I will go on record and say it's the other way around. I think, I think we

(1h 26m 55s) **Kevin:**

> But yeah, new, new, new and I'm crossing.

(1h 26m 57s)

> Yeah, definitely not this decade.

(1h 27m 4s) **Al:**

> get a new animal crossing in 2028 and then hunt chocolatier in 29. No, I think we

(1h 27m 10s)

> get them both in 28. Both games, new animal crossing and hunt chocolatier, both

(1h 27m 12s) **Kevin:**

> You think we'll get then two to three years new animal crossing, okay, all right.

(1h 27m 22s) **Al:**

> Yes. Yes. Because I think that I think all of this stuff is back ported from the new game.

(1h 27m 32s)

> And I think they are based on the same engine, the same graphics.

(1h 27m 33s) **Kevin:**

> - Hmm.

(1h 27m 37s)

> - So I'm what have said, happy home designer was,

(1h 27m 40s)

> they're not happy home, though.

(1h 27m 42s)

> Welcome to Mimi update.

(1h 27m 43s)

> - What?

(1h 27m 44s)

> - Not that much.

(1h 27m 46s) **Al:**

> I think they are a couple of years away, I don't I think this is all keep them going for another couple of years and they'll be fine rather than keep them going for half a decade. I don't think it's another half a decade.

(1h 27m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm

(1h 28m)

> Are you I can't wait in next year like during the big summer like in intended direct they announced I'm crossing 4.0 update, and then we're just
