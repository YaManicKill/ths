00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: in new horizons for different reasons

102
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:29.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: So, in lieu of the playing Animal Crossing getting mad at that, I am playing animal urgency and getting mad at that.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Both things can be true.

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can enjoy it while also being annoyed with it.

110
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.139
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughing]

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think, I mean, at the time,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.779
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: there were certainly a lot of complaints

114
00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.420

136
00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:03.639
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: If they had voice acting, we would know just saying, we'll find out, we'll find out in

137
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:14.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, that was the end of me. Yeah. Yeah. Are they even out of, well, no, there could be a different thing. Yeah. Okay. I don't know about anyway, swear to Google. See,

138
00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:08.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: a year when they do something in the anime for it.

139
00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:19.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So, no, yeah, they're, I mean, they've done a thing the last few seasons where they're

140
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.139
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: not always in the region, right?

141
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:50.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's not the same as the first few where they were just walking around the region, but also, yeah, but also, I feel like kind of near the end of the can to work, they went to the orange islands and stuff like that, so they've always had some things where they'd gone extra places at the end, but yeah, we're definitely in the, I think, I think at the blueberry academy, just not, I forget, I've not watched the most recent episode that came out two days ago, but I think they were at the blueberry academy.

142
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.720
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, so that way yeah, we're gonna get our ZAR

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And they've kind of, it's complicated, right, because lots of things have happened, which I don't really want to spoil because I'm watching it in Japan time, and obviously English language is about a year behind just now, so I don't want to spoil all of this, but yeah, there's a lot of bizarre stuff that's happened.

145
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:21.340
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do think it's really like on this funny just this

146
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.360
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: comparison of you know, during the ash era ash age like what one baby two years or whatever, right?

147
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Mm-hmm

148
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.120
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But here we have

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: definite hard progression of time

150
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.100
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they gave us a I was a

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Was a one-year time gap between seasons I think and and it was they they all very clearly aged up like they're their

152
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.600
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yep, yep, yeah, we're in her Pokemon

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Their character models were definitely older

155
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.419
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Good times good times, um, you know what I probably should have watched that

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:03.480
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I haven't watched like any Pokemon anything and forever including Ponzi urge so I need to get to that

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But I am intrigued by all that stuff they're doing. Um, I should check out

158

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Her license has been quite fun, it started off slow because obviously they were introducing

159
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: new characters to it, but I've really enjoyed it and it's gone weird places I never

160
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: expected them to go, but I've been enjoying just how bizarre it is.

161
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.080
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, oh man, I saw a bit but I guess

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:21.379
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Including other characters will say each other's name. So you can get confirmation on that

180
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.360
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But yeah, so

181
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.080
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, wouldn't it that be nice to have our ZAF, um, and I met

182
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's funny as well because like I did you you listen to the

183
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Story season's grand bizari episode

184
00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.399
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yes, I did but that was a while ago, but go ahead

185
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, I I

186
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.700
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think having how how good the voice acting and the conversations in that game worked

187
00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:49.360
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Where you could have an auto progressing, right?

188
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

189
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.600
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So you could just press a button and you could put it down and you could watch and listen to the conversation

190
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.320
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And then the conversation ended you could pick it back up and play it again

191
00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:59.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Right, not having to like press the A button.

192
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.399
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: To advance the conversation every second actually made me pay attention more right because I wasn't like sitting just tapping the button to get through as fast as possible

193
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:18.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I could actually enjoy it and going from that to to Z.A. which was just like you'll get some words on the screen and you'll like it and it's just like what are we doing here?

195
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Why do why I don't and it's funny because it's the first time I was playing someone in front of Rona, and she was like

196
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.919
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: didn't talk and I'm like, no, they don't talk.

197
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laughter]

198
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.659
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: She found it bizarre, she found it so weird that there's no voice acting, and that's

199
00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.240
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: not something that I would have ever pranged her with, right?

200
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: She just found it really weird that there was no voice acting in Pokemon.

201
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.179
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

202
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

203
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.120
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And I was like, yep, I agree.

204
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: He's here.

205
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's 'cause like five years ago I wasn't finding it weird, but now I am, now I find it really

206
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.820
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'm going to club.

207
00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:48.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

208
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: weird when there's no voice acting, because I think it's because of how like high quality

209
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: if you will, right?

210
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.940
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: We don't have to have a discussion about the graphics, but like how high quality it's

211
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.019
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Right.

212
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: trying to be, and then you just have these people with their modes moving, and you

213
00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:01.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, no, I mean.

214
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yep.

215
00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:04.080
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: just reading text on a page.

216
00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:06.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely.

217
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It was moving to the switch, right?

218
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Because before Pokemon was on the handheld game.

219
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.059
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: What, you know, what handheld games had voice acting, right?

220
00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:16.820
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I mean, I know they did.

221
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But you know, like, it was the expectation was different, right?

222
00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:25.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But now you're on the same console as the new Xenoblade,

223
00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:28.659
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: as is Breath of the Wild, as all these other games.

224
00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:30.820
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And Breath of Wild's funny, because they don't even have

225
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: full voice acting, you know, just certain parts or whatever.

226
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.580
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughing]

227
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.139
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But, but you know, now you're running with the big kids

228
00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:39.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: or so the expectations are for that.

229
00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:42.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And like, and in some ways, they're trying to make that, right?

230
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.580
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: The visuals, the presentation's certainly different.

231
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.100
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It certainly feels grander than anything on the DS or whatever.

232
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think I think Breath of the Wild had the good balance when it was like

233
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.820
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

234
00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:58.580
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Anytime you're like having a story you're talking to the main characters like that's when you get voice acting

235
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.580
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But if you're just talking to a rando in the street, they're not gonna have voice acting, right?

237
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.399
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I get that that's a lot, right?

238
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.139
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No. Yeah.

239
00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:10.360
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You know, especially with like how many NPCs there are in Pokemon, right? You don't you don't you don't you don't need the science guy to be having

240
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.860
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, absolutely.

241
00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:13.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You know voice acting. I get how that's fine

242
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, maybe him, but other than that, that's your point.

243
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but

244
00:14:15.759 --> 00:14:17.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Him just for the fun of it. Yeah, but like

245
00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:18.620
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, just two.

246
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.159
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: you don't need every NPC to have it, but like every proper conversation you're having this advancing the story, right? Like that should have

247
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:35.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Or at bare minimum, like Breath of Wild did just voice little punches here there, right? Just an expression or a single word.

248
00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:27.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That should absolutely have

249
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.799
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, I find those weird, to be honest, like that.

250
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:46.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Really? No. Well, okay. Well, regardless, the point being that there's that can do better than what they're doing now, but yeah.

251
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:55.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Anyway, so anyway, so.

252
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.919
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Let's see how we feel in a month with the news of whatever's coming next.

253
00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:17.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, okay. Aside from that, or let's see what I'll wait, Z a what you would have, you know, all those problems inside. Yeah, right. Be that that whole little bit was fun with the tournament and and it's really funny there limited in scope. So boy, let's milk these characters for everything we've got because what else are we going to do.

254
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Your rank B is what you were saying.

255
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:24.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: So it's been our best battle canary for the third time. Yeah.

256
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:27.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'll just you wait and see if you get the DLC.

257
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:33.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But it's good to do. Oh, I can imagine.

258
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh boy, you'll you'll love battling canari again.

259
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But this time it's double battles.

260
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:47.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I can see they're headed that like I'm surprised I haven't really done it yet because clearly they're lining up, you know, too good.

261
00:15:43.500 --> 00:16:11.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'll tell you, I'll tell you why they hadn't done it. It's because it's bad. I do not like the double battles in the DLC, the real time, I love the real time battling in general in this game, but the double battles just feel chaotic, have no idea what's happening and I'm just pressing whatever buttons I can press and hoping that hoping that I'm powered up enough that I can kill everyone. Absolutely not.

262
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:11.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. There's no strategy in that world anymore. Yeah. I get it. That's what I expected

263
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:19.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: and I'm ready for the good times. Um, but yeah, so the kid, the kids, fun, whatever mechanics,

264
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.179
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: they are what they are. Um, I like Pokemon. I need to like the Pokemon themselves at least. So,

265
00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:26.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You know, I get happy when I

266
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:40.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: make a jalooch, that makes me happy every time, of course not. Aside from that, there's

267
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I was about to ask you your favourite new mega is now, but like I bet nothing's beaten

268
00:16:34.539 --> 00:16:35.460

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Cancer ray!

273
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:07.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I'm a fan that they are embraced. No, they continue because they haven't really

274
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.579
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: stopped. They continue to brace, you know, it's some existential horror in those decks

275
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:19.359
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Hmm. Mm.

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: force is consumed and that wasn't fun. And then immediately after I do a side quest with

278
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: the frost last where I go okay I just run into this ghost and fall

279
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:32.819
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: and oh I don't like that but okay here we are good times

280
00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:41.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: um anyway yeah that's the it is what it is um okay uh let's see what else um uh oh

281
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:47.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: discounty I hit credits on discounty boy did we pick the perfect time to

282
00:17:47.539 --> 00:17:52.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: record my thoughts on discounty because now that I hit credits boy I have

283
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: thoughts because it's a great game with one huge

284
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:05.660
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: problem that you don't see until the end yeah yeah I mean it's it's enough for a

285
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh, okay. Do we need to do another episode on that then? Or is this...

286
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: topic and there's some post game stuff so I'm finished all that so it's it's

287
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: All right.

288
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: probably warrants at least a small discussion on another episode at least

289
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: All right, cool. We'll do that then. We'll schedule that.

290
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:20.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: when I finished the post game stuff but so we'll get to it but overall I

291
00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:28.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: like I still enjoy discount even with the the fan of tripping

292
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:32.900
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: at the finish line but it's fine yeah just kind of good stuff and yeah that's

293
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: what I've been up to what about you though let's go on on over there

294
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's mostly just animal crossing, I think, which obviously we're going to have a big discussion about.

295
00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:46.359
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I did. I have played, I've tried again to play heartopia. I've not got very far in that,

296
00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:50.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but I'm hoping maybe this week I'll get some more time. Now that I'll be pitting animal crossing down.

297
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.880
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Probably. We'll see. I don't know. Who knows? Who knows what my brain will decide to do?

298
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Have I played anything else? Not really. I've still got five legendarys to catch and

299
00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:04.839
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and I haven't really done that yet.

300
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's literally the only thing I've got left to do.

301
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:12.640
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I might end up doing that in like the week running up to Pokémon Day just because it will be like I must get this done.

302
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:21.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And at some point I need I still need to do the decks for Sword and Shield for home to get the shiny Shaman, not Shaman.

303
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.200
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, and clean up now.

304
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I still need to do that at some point.

305
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, yay.

306
00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:34.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So maybe I'm hoping I'll get that done sometime soon so that there's enough time between that and the new games coming out that I don't feel burnt out with Pokémon.

307
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.240
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Hey, it's okay. The burnout's going to be cured when

308
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:50.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, but that's different. That's the thing right like I'm not gonna it's not exactly so it's it's no I know I get your point, but no it's yeah.

309
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.119
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: hypoepia drops. But that's going to restore your faith. That's

310
00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:45.279
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: different. Yeah, I know. It's not Pokemon the game. I know what

311
00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:47.319
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: you mean. I'm just I'm being cheeky.

312
00:19:50.440 --> 00:20:00.640
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think that's it I've not really played much well if I let's see I've probably got something to talk about TV or film wise let me check what I've been watching.

313
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.339
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. All right.

314
00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:03.019
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, you're watching a lot of stuff. Who watching so many movies?

315
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.640
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Ooh, I have been playing, uh, no, I've been...

316
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Sorry. I've been watching the new Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.

317
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, so okay. Did you watch the movie? I'm watching the movie yet, but did you watch the movie the

318
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I did watch the movie and then I watched the first season of the series. Have you seen what have you seen?

319
00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:19.839
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay

320
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.720
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I haven't seen either to be honest sadly sadly. I know I'm missing out

321
00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:26.940
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You've not seen it all. You should. It's so good. So good. Excellent.

322
00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:27.759
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, the series is good to

323
00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:34.299
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So the first season I thought was very good. The second season I'm still enjoying. It's felt a little bit more

324
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:42.700
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: disjointed. It feels less like there's kind of like a unified vision of what it is and it's more like there's

325
00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:46.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: kind of three arcs that happened throughout the season.

326
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:55.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So it's not like it's not single episode arcs that are like villain of the weak type thing and it's not one whole season story.

327
00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:02.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's like three different ones throughout the season. So it's kind of feel the little bit weirdly disjointed because of that.

328
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But other than that, I mean, I've still been enjoying what it is. So yeah.

329
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.400
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, okay, that sounds good because I alright

330
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's definitely worth, it's definitely worth a watch I think if you like if you like

331
00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.339
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, I have

332
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: All right, I'm gonna ask for other questions. So if you have any interest in this

333
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.279
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You know shield your ear, I guess five minutes

334
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.720
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Skip to the game news if you don't want any spoilers for our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.519

337
00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:36.039
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Seriously, okay, so I don't didn't watch the movie, but I'm aware

338
00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:38.039
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I believe Shredder is the arts credit.

339
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I've seen in the movie.

340
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Let me show up in the series.

341
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.799
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Uh... I don't think so.

342
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's wild. Okay. Okay.

343
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Next question.

344
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: The leather head in the series.

345
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh.

346
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.940
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Who is Leatherhead?

347
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, I'm so excited.

348
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I love the animation and the series.

349
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And we like gray, but all these questions are very deep.

350
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.839
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: - There we go.

351
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.400
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Give me give me a minute. Give me a minute. Give me a minute

352
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.759
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: How much, okay, how much turtles have you watched prior?

353
00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:12.559
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Like, what other series are content?

354
00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:17.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Not a huge not a huge amount. Um, it's it's something I've always been kind of vaguely aware of

355
00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:15.359
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Now you, okay, 'cause.

356
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:24.240
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But it's not something that I've I've kind of like properly watched like I've probably seen some

357
00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.799
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: some stuff from

358
00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:31.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: New York occasional things. I think I saw the the horrifying live action they did

359
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:39.579
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh yeah, it would mean is the my love. Oh, yeah.

360
00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:38.079
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That was horrible

361
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:44.859
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But I don't think yeah, I'm just double checking. Yeah, he's definitely I didn't think he was in the season

362
00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:43.259
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay.

363
00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:49.619
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But I just wanted to double check cuz you never know I could have been an idiot, but yeah, no, he's not

364
00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:54.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, I just checked leatherhead shows up. Um, boys by Rose burn. Oh,

365
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.680
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Sorry, that was shredder is what we're talking about. Let me check with leatherhead. So his leatherhead oh

366
00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:59.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Fred, okay, sorry. Okay. Um, uh, crocodile. It's popping on me.

367
00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:03.200
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'm no, I don't I don't remember seeing

368
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:07.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, they have a voice credit. I don't know where, but okay. Um, all right, that's,

369
00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:13.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: that's fine. Well, other heads on my favorite kid, those characters. I mean, a fan of turtles

370
00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:19.819
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: and consumes different series. Um, not the 80s one. I'm, I'm most kind of a strange, uh,

371
00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:24.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: turtles fan because there's such a huge following for the 80s ones and then obviously so much

372
00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:30.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: attachment and nostalgia for it. But I come, that was before my time and I didn't watch it. So it's

373
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:38.779
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: my head. Oh, okay. Well, uh,

374
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Uh, so he was in, he was in, leatherhead was in season one apparently.

375
00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:42.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't know, I don't, I don't remember, I was a couple of years ago, so my memory is a bit

376
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: fuzzy of it. Um,

377
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, well say a lot be but yes. Oh, well I do

378
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I, yeah, I don't know, I don't know how much of the, like, obviously, I don't want to talk too

379
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: much about actual spoilers, but I don't know how much of how many of the characters are like,

380
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:08.759
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: former canon. I mean, is, um, oh my gosh. Hey, you see in it? Nope. Oh, well, okay. Why don't you

381
00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:02.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: classic characters, if that makes sense.

382
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:14.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think so. I'm so bad at names.

383
00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:19.640
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: have Casey? I'll take that. Casey Jones. Fuck him, ask. Probably. I hopefully. Ideally.

384
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:27.880
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I don't, he might not be in it actually. Is that him? No. Oh, my gosh, he's not.

385
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:49.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, no, I'm not I'm no look I mean this is the problem right like you're you're you're asking me questions like like I would know who these characters where like it's like it's what like it's a Marvel series right like you're like oh what about this casual I don't know who that character is

386
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:49.720
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay. Never mind. All right. This is. This is, this is. Yeah. No, it's fine. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

387
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: is like the part the problem is like I don't is it some is there a character in it that I just don't remember who it was or is

388
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: it just like yeah it's

389
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:03.779
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, here's a thing. Leatherhead is a major, let's say a major supporting character in

390
00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:08.819
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: a lot of trouble series, right? Not not a list or but a lot of fans wouldn't have a leather head.

391
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.740
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Pacey Jones is an A-listers like supposed to be a primary cast member. So

392
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: and if it's not in there, well, that's okay. That's interesting. I mean, it has a po-neal, right?

393
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:35.019
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Say again, sorry April. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No April. April's I think basically they're their main

394
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.559
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: April O'Neill is in the show, right? Okay. Casey Jones.

395
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: He's the male equivalent of April O'Neill, the guy they turtles hang out with just as much.

396
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.619
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Guy in the chair if you will for this certainly for season two

397
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:50.319
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, which which happens frequently. Yeah. Yeah, in case he Jones is, it's, it's rough equipment. He's not a guy in chair. He's out on the field with them, but he's just a problem in it. Um, so, okay.

398
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah

399
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.720
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, I know it's mostly it's mostly just been them out in the field on their own at this point

400
00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:55.880
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Sure. Okay. Like,

401
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But then I don't know they might have more plans for for

402
00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:07.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, there's nothing inherently wrong with these questions or do these decisions because I'm sure it's still quality, but it's okay. I'm just very surprised. I just, I don't know.

403
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:30.799
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: My expectations are set. I don't know what to expect, but that that's fine. I'm happy. It's good because I like the turtles and I like when their stuff is good. I like that they use actual teenagers to voice the turtles that that's well, that was a good idea. Um, yes. Yeah, I believe they did. Um, which is awesome.

404
00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:38.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But okay, overall, though, I'm happy it's good. That's I'm I'll take that. Um, even if I

405
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'm not sure what's going on over there.

406
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:48.660
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Wait, this says this says leather head was in the seat in season two. I mean oh, oh no, I see right okay. So there's a bit at the beginning of the season where like the

407
00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:54.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The purple dragons mine control a bunch of mutants and

408
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Ahh...

409
00:26:56.339 --> 00:27:03.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Leatherhead is apparently in that group of mutants, but not like not specifically as a prominent one. There's quite a few of them and

410
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay. Prominent, sure.

411
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, sure. Okay, that makes sense.

412
00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:08.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And I probably is I suspect if you had been watching it would

413
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.220
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: stuck out more to you, right? Because you're like, "Oh, that's leatherhead, right?" Whereas I'm just going,

414
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

415
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

416
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:21.059
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: "Oh, it's one of the, one of the mutants, right?" Like, I am aware of some of them and who they are, but not many of

417
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Mutant peoples, yeah.

418
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

420
00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:28.980
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: their names. I know Ray Filet's name, I know Wing Nuts name. Most of the rest of them are just

421
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Mutants to me because I don't know

422
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.640
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, right away. That's a good name. I think that's a new character. I've never heard it,

423
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.279
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: but that's that's a good name. Unless it was in the 80s series, which might be the case. I don't know.

424
00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:50.119
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But yeah, no good good stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I believe it. Sure. Yeah.

425
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.720
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It looks like he was in the 80 series. Yeah, I character based on Ray. So looks like he was in

426
00:27:51.759 --> 00:27:53.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: in some of the comics

427
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.839
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Cool. Yeah, that's cool. No, man, forget the marble multiverse. Let's talk about the

428
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Trying to figure out. I was a he

429
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:16.680
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: powerful multiverse. Well, I mean, that's, I think the majority of the mutants in the turtles' franchise are actually humans to start with, um, really. Okay.

430
00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:05.119
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh, he was Ray Ray was apparently a human who was meeting

431
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.359
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: No, okay, that's certainly not what has been in tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles most of them are mutated animals

432
00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:25.319
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because and most of the time they've been counted in your when you're like, oh, what were you before and they're always like, you know a cat or fleas or whatever

433
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:29.039
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, wait, please. Oh, that's that's a great idea. I like that

434
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:32.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, it's very good. It's all it's one of it

435
00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:34.859
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think the

436
00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:40.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: second of the kind of arcs in the season is a cat called scratch

437
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.779
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't know if that's our.

438
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:52.720
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: standard character or not. And his mutated fleas, the fleas from the cat, it's fun. Yeah. So yeah, I would highly recommend it. It's

439
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.359
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's so cool. That's a great idea. I love that

440
00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:00.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: really fun. It's a good, I don't know. I'll be interested to hear if, you know, what you think about it, being

441
00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:07.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: our turtles fan, right, and how it feels if you actually are aware of the history of these

442
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.160
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, I'll tune in. It's an interesting perspective. I don't know, okay,

443
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: it's not as bad as Sonic, but I mean, turtles have had their low points for sure, right?

444
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.319
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: The live action stuff. Well, I have actually a series in particular. The movies are one thing,

445
00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:30.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: but the series, we had, we had the Michael Bay versions.

446
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Don't forget that.

447
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:41.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: So it had been through the ringer a few times, so it's, you know, but a lot of highlights, too, so, um,

448
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:44.740
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Do you know what I find funny as well? So Seth Rogan was one of the, the, um, the writers on,

449
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: yeah.

450
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: on this. Um, and he's, I feel like there was a point where he was like kind of a bit of a laughing

451
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, one of the forces behind it. Yeah.

452
00:29:50.579 --> 00:29:54.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: stock, right? Where he was just like, oh, he does stupid things. It doesn't really matter. And now

453
00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:02.180
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: it's like he is part partly behind like a bunch of really, really good, really popular stuff, right?

454
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:07.859
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like he's, he's in, I don't know if you probably haven't seen the studio from Apple TV last year.

455
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah

456
00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:10.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No

457
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:16.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: He's excellent and he's like the main character and, um, writing it. Um, and apparently he's, he's done stuff for

458
00:30:16.099 --> 00:30:24.019
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: invincible and, um, the boys and stuff like that. And he's, he's, he's, he's, he's done the new

459
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.039
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, there was another adaptation.

460
00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:29.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I can't remember what, but yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

461
00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:29.220
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: muppet show special as well. There's like a whole bunch of stuff that he's, and he's gone from like this,

462
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:34.980
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: oh, he just does stupid stuff, isn't he? Like silly to like, no, he's behind someone like the best.

463
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:42.640
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I think it's cool, right, and I don't know if it was just a type of taster

464
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.640
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: or whatever.

465
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Because there was definitely a run where you had very, you know, hangover college type

466
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: right I think.

467
00:30:48.500 --> 00:31:00.700
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: sausage party. All this stupid stuff. Yeah. Yeah. There was a, there was a series. Yeah.

468
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That was kind of the, yeah.

469
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's awesome.

470
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, it's awesome.

471
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's party didn't help.

472
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Didn't help at all.

473
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There's other things still going on.

474
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It has a series.

475
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.819
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I saw that in the list. I just, I just brushed over that.

476
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's still ongoing, I believe.

477
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I don't think it's finished.

478
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

479
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Anyways, but yeah, but no,

480
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: he does a lot of great work too.

481
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Especially like you said with the writing, I think.

482
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.059
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh yeah, no, and it probably doesn't help like...

483
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:24.299
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You're... You watch Chip and Dale rescue Rangers the movie the live-action movie or whatever opponent will put live-action

484
00:31:27.059 --> 00:31:32.779
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, and there's this just this brief like one second cameo scene of

485
00:31:33.819 --> 00:31:39.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Like five or six characters. Seth Rojoon has all voiced and they're just the same voice

486
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughter]

487
00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.059
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And they all get to say something it's just

488
00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Anyway, it's like you know, it's stuff like that. We're right. It feels like it does a lot of the same but

489
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:54.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: but yeah, now he's doing good work good for yourself. I am happy with how the

490
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: All right. Well shall we talk about some news?

491
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: about non real life news like as long as we stay away from those.

492
00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:16.759
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah. Yes. Agreed. Yeah. It does, you know, you shouldn't have secret police and you shouldn't,

493
00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:23.799
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: you know, abduct people in the street and kill people apparently today again. So yeah.

494
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.480
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You know what?

495
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And you know what?

496
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.799
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It would be cool if the leader of a major power

497
00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.839
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: knew what country was what country?

498
00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:34.200
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Wouldn't that be nice?

499
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.119
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But we're not going to talk about that.

500
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laughter]

501
00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:41.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: We are going to try and escape that for a while and we're going to talk about some farming

502
00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:42.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: game use.

503
00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:51.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: First up, we have Bubblegum Galaxy, have announced their release date for the 12th of March,

504
00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:52.640
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: or the 11th of March.

505
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:58.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think I think it might, I wonder if they're Australia-based or somewhere Eastern-based

506
00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: because it says 11th of March on my steam, but they're posted.

507
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:09.859
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh it says hmm yeah interesting yeah I don't know that's yeah near New Zealanders they

508
00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:14.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: get to release before when it's like I don't know okay what is this okay I'm looking at it because

509
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:26.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I don't remember um and I files okay so I'm saying I'm watching the trailer and there's

510
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.779
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yes, it's a cozy narrative building game about rebuilding the galaxy.

511
00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:33.700
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: there's like two different hits I'm seeing there's like the

512
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:38.900
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: the tile gameplay where it's like hexagonal tiles you're placing them and then resources I guess or whatever.

513
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.220
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah. Yeah.

514
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:45.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But then there's also what feels like the lack of a better way of describing a 3DS style like

515
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:50.819
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: you seek characters moving around and interacting with each other and I do I don't know what's going on here.

516
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.700
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, it's an interesting like yeah, it seems like it's part management game part life sim

517
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.900
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And I don't know how those are gonna mesh together

518
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:08.880
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. And you're an anthropomorphic cat with a house on their head. That's how it matches together.

519
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.980
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Obviously

520
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:17.840
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: This is fascinating. Oh wow, it's coming to everything. All the consoles and Xboxes.

521
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I like how they're still releasing on the old Gen PS4 and stuff.

522
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.719
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Look, if you don't need to power a Y bother, it's the same thing with the switch too,

523
00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:26.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: - Yeah, no.

524
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: you shouldn't do it unless you need it.

525
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.960
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, I agree.

526
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.159
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'm just saying like it's,

527
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.400
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: there's enough in an audience there to support it.

528
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.400
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's not like my point, right?

529
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:50.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Well, the beauty of the beauty of that now is that you can just do it on the older one and get it automatically on the newer one, you know, so they don't need a huge audience on the PS4, they just need an audience on the PS5. Same with switch.

530
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.019
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's true. That's very true.

531
00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:50.260
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Most switch to though.

532
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, well, they don't need to. That's the thing like look at the graphics. Do you think there's needs a switch to?

533
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Just the old switch.

534
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.579
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah.

535
00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:02.260
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, I'm wondering why they're not releasing on the 3DS.

536
00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:06.739
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Um, yeah, bubble gum.

537
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think you probably underestimate how slow that device was. It's so old now.

538
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

539
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, no, that's why I'm bad at dating.

540
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The switch is nine years old now.

541
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, well, good times, it's time.

542
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Was it was it 2011 for the 3DS, so that's 15 years now?

543
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, holy moly, don't tell you that number.

544
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I don't like that. No, oh no.

545
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's all right. It's all right. Next year will be the 20th anniversary of the week.

546
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay.

547
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, okay, that one I can do with, but the 3DS felt.

548
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh no, it's this year. Oh, it was 2006, not 2007. It was November. November is the 20th anniversary of the week. Goodness me.

549
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, no, no, that's right. Yeah.

550
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I can't, yeah, that's fine.

551
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: We feels old at this point.

552
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I won't lie. I can move in next.

553
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I just felt I just felt my back go. I'm so old.

554
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, okay.

555
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Dude, okay.

556
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It achorus on 3DS.

557
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There is this, I believe it's actually like a secret ending.

558
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There's just this one joke that they make.

559
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'll be like, I guess we'll see you in another 25 years or whatever.

560
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Like the gap between the original and this one.

561
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughs]

562
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: In fact, that we're getting closer to that is making me extremely uncomfortable out.

563
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Cause that was a great game.

564
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And I wanted it to steeple, but not, not actually at the 25 year mark.

565
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No.

566
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Fun times all right

567
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: All right.

568
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: What else is the next game good times?

569
00:36:35.079 --> 00:36:39.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The ranchers have announced that they're early access is releasing in Q2

570
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.400
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The wording is really funny in this post-strike cuz it was like oh

571
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Where's the wording?

572
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.619
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Did we finally have a window for early access? The ranchers were launched in early access in Q2

573
00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:56.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: 2026 the exact release date is locked and will be revealed very soon

574
00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:59.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: If you know when the release date is, if you've locked it.

575
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:14.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: why? Yeah, yeah, but don't tell us that. Oh, and that and then you, I don't know how

576
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Why don't you just say it? Like, you shouldn't say it. I don't think you should say it.

577
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But don't tell us that you know it and then don't tell us what it is.

578
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like, just, that's a bizarre.

579
00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.059
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: we're whatever, they're gonna delay and then how they're gonna look, how they're gonna

580
00:37:18.059 --> 00:37:26.320
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: look, then point at your bat in the sky and and you struck out. That's rough buddy, but

581
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.239
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Um, yeah, that is kind of bizarre.

582
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:58.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: We know it is, but we won't tell you. Ooh, yeah. Oh, okay. Sure. It's hop down 3D farming game thing that I don't know what else to describe like it's realistic issue in graphics and style and then it that's all I'm seeing.

583
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:39.659
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: yep apparently this is already in my steam library I must I must have backed on kickstart

584
00:37:39.659 --> 00:37:44.019
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and they've already given me the key I guess I don't that's weird I don't remember that

585
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.639
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think if a father if other listeners know the the look of lens island I would say it's very similar to that

586
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:28.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, sure. Um, it's a little. Yeah, it I will say this the farm itself looks very sandboxy like it's a it looks like a very big area to kind of shape that how you want to that looks kind of cool, but it's all my gosh. There's no relationships in this game. I thought we would get away.

587
00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:04.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But it's much more farming rather than exploration

588
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah.

589
00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:21.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Event.

590
00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:31.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: No, this very much looks like someone went stargy,

591
00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:33.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but higher graphics.

592
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:49.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Oh my gosh, there's a bar. Yeah, it's Stardew. Yeah. Yeah, that is kind of cool in

593
00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:36.280
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like, and everything else looks the same, basically,

594
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.199
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: is just higher graphics.

595
00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.880
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It doesn't look like you can drive-- drive vehicles.

596
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So that's different.

597
00:38:45.519 --> 00:38:47.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can go around the town and drive

598
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:56.139
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: like the parking on side of realistic for lack of a better way of describing. Yeah, I don't know

599
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.760
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: looks horrible why we don't want to pack a car, don't make me pack a car.

600
00:38:56.139 --> 00:39:03.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: either, but they went for it. Um, the combat. Yeah, move it to date. Yeah, this is it.

601
00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Well there's a hot air balloon.

602
00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:10.300
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There's combat. I'm actually surprised there. Wow, the it is just Stardew with graphics. Um,

603
00:39:11.659 --> 00:39:17.659
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: yeah, wow. Um, there's you do fight in some cool looking enemies. I'll say that. I don't know how good the

604
00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:25.739
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: graphics. They're the combat is, but, uh, but okay, there you go. Stardew, but, uh, 3D, I guess. Okay.

605
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, so that's Q2 for early access. Next, we have another update for Everdream Valley. They are

606
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.900
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And.

607
00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:38.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: sorry Everdream Village. They are throwing these updates out and this is the 1.8 update

608
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.599
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: decorate the grandparent's house. So you've got grandparent's house and you can decorate it.

609
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah

610
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.739
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, like it's it's kind of funny specifically your grandparents house, but okay

611
00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:49.599
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: For some reason. Yeah.

612
00:39:50.739 --> 00:39:54.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That you look very detailed those a lot of options. It looks like

613
00:39:56.059 --> 00:40:00.139
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I don't know it's a man. Okay, it's a little side tangent

614
00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:06.219
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But you know like you just said right ever dream village is throwing updates left and right right and including this one

615
00:40:06.619 --> 00:40:09.280
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: How long is Minecraft been going and we get

616
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:18.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: about two, three updates a year, maybe like one may drop it here at Minecraft. And to this day, they have still not given me a chair I can just sit on.

617

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that is the concern right like that's not addressing the big problem we had right which is so it's that's the point

643
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:55.579
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I will say I'm very uncomfortable with giant stuff. You're a little planetoid, but some of these now have giant

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There's also a structure with the fork and knife. I don't know what's going on with that, but I don't know if I'm comfortable with that either

648
00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:14.619
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There's consumption of something

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't get your wires crossed.

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I did. I did see. Yeah. Yeah, don't edge it is bizarre to me that this game

709
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.840
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laughing]

710
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.900
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: They did such a weird way to do online and it's like if you're connecting with one other person

711
00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:53.280
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's fine, right like it's not it's it's a little bit annoying, but it's fine if you're connecting more than like

712
00:45:53.539 --> 00:45:58.139
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Three people you just spend most of your time waiting and yeah, 12 people

713
00:45:58.139 --> 00:46:01.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's absolutely bizarre that they have it set up that it takes

714
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:06.139
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Individual person has to join the island

715
00:46:06.679 --> 00:46:15.719
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Separately and you can't do it at the same time so it like and there's like a whole like 30 second animation as it connects you to the game and

716
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.400
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. This.

717
00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:20.780
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Anytime someone's trying to come to the island if someone's in a conversation

718
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.800
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It delays them from coming so then they have to try again

719
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.780
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And but everyone else who isn't in the conversation it stops you doing anything until it realizes that it times out

720
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and it can get the people on the island and

721
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:40.659
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and then any time anybody tries to leave it's the same thing it's just the worst online ever and like maybe maybe

722
00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:45.780
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: five maybe six years ago it wasn't that annoying because fine whatever we were just getting used to it

723
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:52.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and like it was new for Animal Crossing and it was exciting and we were all crazy anyway like that time

724
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah

725
00:46:50.699 --> 00:46:52.900
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: This this I

726
00:46:52.099 --> 00:46:56.659
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: period is just a bizarre time but it's not fun!

727
00:46:54.380 --> 00:47:03.820
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Mean this system this system started like that, you know, that their way of doing on like started on the literally the DS the original DS on

728
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:10.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Wildworld and it was meant for four people. Oh, yeah, and it was there's basically the same thing

729
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh, they had it all the way back then.

730
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And they've not rethought how it works at all.

731
00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:15.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, especially when they went to 12 people

732
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And it's not like you can be like, oh, this is how all online's work, right?

733
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because you do, like, let's take Scarlet and Violet, right?

734
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That game has so many issues, but connecting to their online is super quick and easy.

735
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: that is

736
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Again, four people together, you're just typing the code and it pops you in the other person's game.

737
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:35.780
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: yeah well wait I take it back I had some issues with those codes but in general

738
00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:43.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: better than this yes sure yes um okay yes it wasn't perfect but it was it was a better

739
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:52.179
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: overall design and industry for sure um oh my gosh it's wild um but hey at least it's okay it's

740
00:47:52.179 --> 00:47:56.179
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: water landing because this is a sea plane.

741
00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And then like if one person's switch like disconnects from the internet it crashes and pushes everybody off the other

742
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: The water landing was a big hole.

743
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It was a big hole.

744
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That was part of the article.

745
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It had like two crashes.

746
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: People were just trying to trickle in.

747
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:11.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: They had a couple of points where they had to restart the whole line because they crashed.

748
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, Magnificent.

749
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:21.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So is it cool that you can now connect 12 people together if they all are on switch twos?

750
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That was an incredible article.

751
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Sure.

752
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I guess.

753
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Should you do it?

754
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: No.

755
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.340
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, they should say that in the game. Please talk

756
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You should not.

757
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: All right.

758
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Let's talk about the other switch two features first because there's only a couple of them.

759
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I guess performance and you know graphics.

760
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:42.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I've not really noticed a difference.

761
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah!

762
00:48:42.500 --> 00:49:01.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It is faster I've seen some side by side on loading it definitely is faster, but like we're talking like it still takes like 30 40 seconds to load the game right like I'm not noticing a 10 second difference when it's still taking half a minute right like you're just you're just sitting there going this is taking forever.

763
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:12.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I get that it's a complicated like it's because they're all like generate completely you know individually generated and they have to have every single chunk saved and then they have to load it all I get that that's complicated.

764
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:22.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it like that. That's hard. Optimization

765
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:19.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But like it's I don't it's not it's not noticeably faster unless you're just seeing them side by side.

766
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: is hard, and especially in this kind of situation, like as they were every island and

767
00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:30.260
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: file is different or whatever. Right. But the problem is they use it as a selling point when they

768
00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:36.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: shouldn't, right? Like they should. I mean, even Pokemon on scarlet violet didn't use it as a

769
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:44.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: selling point when it was when they absolutely should have. Right. So they just shouldn't have brought

770
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughing]

771
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.320
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah.

772
00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:59.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: it up at all. That's that's the problem here. Yeah. That's my feeling across the board for mouse

773
00:49:47.679 --> 00:49:49.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: My smooth, I mean, it does what it says in the 10,

774
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't really know what to say.

775
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.599
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I still don't wanna use it 'cause I don't,

776
00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:06.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: mode. It's like just in general. Sure. Sure. Yeah, partially not for me, but yeah, it's it's their

777
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But I 100% see why some people would enjoy it.

778
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:17.300
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: mouse mode is there. Yeah. Oh, you tell that was when I was kind of interested in.

779
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The megaphone is super, super bad.

780
00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:18.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It doesn't, it doesn't, I don't know whether this

781
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: is a me problem because I'm Scottish,

782
00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:25.360
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but it cannot figure out who I'm seeing.

783
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So let me, let me, let me pop up on my switch here

784
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.639
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and just do a little test, right?

785
00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:30.639
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Where's my megaphone gone?

786
00:50:30.639 --> 00:50:32.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh, give me two seconds.

787
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.159
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's not actually in my bag, I need to go get it.

788
00:50:36.159 --> 00:50:37.239
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Give me a minute.

789
00:50:37.239 --> 00:50:39.719
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh wait, is it too late at night for me to do that?

790
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.639
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: For people to be up, oh, it's 20 past eight, they should still be up now, right?

791
00:50:43.639 --> 00:50:50.199
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I can't remember when people go to bed, right? I'm just getting my megaphone, okay, and then

792
00:50:50.199 --> 00:50:52.280
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: give me two seconds, let me go outside.

793
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.199
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I am no, no, I'm just I'm looking something up because I just make you think of something

794
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:10.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Right, I am now standing in the town centre and I have my megaphone, so I'm going to go

795
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, okay.

796
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:17.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Raymond, no response it says. It didn't even get the wrong person at that time. Raymond

801
00:51:30.500 --> 00:52:00.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: just nothing right so like this is it's super bad and I think I don't understand why they did this rather than just like showing you them on the map like just show where they are on the map that would be a much better feature and not rely on you know well I guess they couldn't then sell the switch to version right because that's the whole point is a switch to only feature yeah it's super bad I don't use it it's a waste of time don't don't

802
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. (laughs)

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I, I've really would like to know if this is a U problem, and there is a strong chance it is because this reminds me of the switch to camera struggling to recognize people, you know, people melanin.

805
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:24.260
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: yeah I don't know I I I okay let's go on to the 3.0 features cuz I actually

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: successfully used the megaphone cuz I just can't get it to work

808
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:38.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Let's know how much the systemic recisima extends.

809
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laugh]

810
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:43.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'll probably not racism, but anyway. (laughs)

811
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: >> All rise in and fall right over.

<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Discrimination of some time.

813
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughs]

814
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laugh]

815
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah. (laughs)

816
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.880
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Anti Scottish bias.

817
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: >> Yeah.

818
00:52:51.079 --> 00:52:52.079
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: All right.

819
00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:54.400
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So, first up, we have the hotel,

820
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.599
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: which is your happy home designer,

821
00:52:57.599 --> 00:52:59.159
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but in a hotel this time.

822
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:01.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's fine.

823
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I mean, I don't particularly enjoy the designing anyway.

824
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.760
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I mean, it's just happy on Saturday.

825
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I think that's all it is.

826
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.280
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Pretty much, but with the addition that you've got

827
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: these things that you can get from the hotel,

828
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah

829
00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:16.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: the souvenirs and extra things.

830
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:21.760
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, so you're earning like a currency for that. Is that right? Okay, how do you earn the currency?

831
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.480
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah.

832
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.320
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah.

833
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.079
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So you either earn the currency by designing the rooms,

834
00:53:25.079 --> 00:53:27.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: so you go in once a day and they'll say,

835
00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: "Oh, can you do this room?"

836
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.599
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And you go in and you put in,

837
00:53:30.599 --> 00:53:33.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: they have a theme and you choose what items to put in,

838
00:53:33.519 --> 00:53:35.199
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and then they say, "That's great."

839
00:53:35.199 --> 00:53:37.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And they give you some of the currency.

840
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Or you can also do it by submitting the crafted items

841
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.360
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: that they want in the box outside.

842
00:53:44.599 --> 00:53:46.559
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So it kind of works like the Nukemile stuff

843
00:53:46.559 --> 00:53:49.639
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: where there will be like four items that they're asking for,

844
00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:52.280
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and then when you donate those ones,

845
00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.320
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: it will then pop some new ones in.

846
00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.800
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So you'll always have four of them,

847
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:06.320
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just like Nick Miles from what I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

848
00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.599
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but the first four in the day have like double

849
00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.119
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: the amount that you get for them.

850
00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:06.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Basically exactly how the Nukemile stuff works, yeah.

851
00:54:07.719 --> 00:54:10.239
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Why I do like that that they've got two different ways

852
00:54:10.239 --> 00:54:11.239
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: to get the currency, right?

853
00:54:11.239 --> 00:54:13.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: because I do not care about doing the...

854
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:41.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: the rooms you have to do the first one to get it going and then be able to use the donation box but after the first one you don't need to do anymore and being able to just crafting is fine I can do some crafting and I can give you some stuff and I can still get the currency to get the souvenir items that's that's fine I'm happy with that and because the crafting menu so if you go if you throw like a crafting table next to the donations box and you

855
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.940
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: you just go into the crafting tip because you know it's nice

856
00:54:44.000 --> 00:55:05.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: to have it there so you can just craft it and then throw it straight in the donations box. There is a page now on the crafting menu that will show you what it's what their look what is in the requested items as well so you don't even need to go to the donations box to look and what see what there is you can just go straight to the crafting table craft the stuff and then put it in the

857
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:14.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: box so that's really nice as well there's very little friction there right like once a day I'll go down to the crafting table at the hotel I will craft it.

858
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:24.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: what it says at once and then I'll throw it in the donations box I get some of the currency I go by whatever's new in the hotel that day.

859
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:29.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, sure, sure, just another daily activity you can do, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, okay.

860
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:33.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Exactly and then the other thing that this obviously leads to is then there's other villagers walking around the island.

861
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:44.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't know if it's one pair room per day. It's only up to one pair room per day. I only currently have one room and I think every time.

862
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:42.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Uh-huh.

863
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:54.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I know every day I'll be on on there has been one person but if I had four rooms I don't know if there would be four every day I'm not sure if that's how it works.

864
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:09.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The funny thing is so you can in the hotel lobby they have the mannequins and you can put clothes on the mannequins if you put if you put outfits on the mannequins the villager will choose one of the ones to put on before they start walking around the island.

865
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.900
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

866
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.699
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

867
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because now I just have villagers walking around in the island with bike helmets on.

868
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:18.400
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:18.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because I just chose random clothes that looked silly.

870
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.280
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And so now they're walking around in the bike helmet and yeah, exactly.

871
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.300
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: In the octonated into the cold.

872
00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.079
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Exactly. So I think it's, I think it's fun. I get there's some people that are complaining

873
00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:31.440
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: because they're like, why are these random villagers know one of my island? I had this like,

874
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: They're ruining my aesthetic.

875
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:38.239
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: curate exactly. And I'm like, sure, fine, then don't do the hotel, right? Like you have to

876
00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:44.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: actively say it up. I think it's, if you're interested in the different villagers and

877
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: because like part of the thing about animal crossing is like, there are so many different

878
00:56:47.519 --> 00:56:52.719
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: villagers and they all have different designs. Like, I think it's fun to occasionally see them.

879
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: so many

880
00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:56.719
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You know, I don't, I don't think that's a bad thing.

881
00:56:53.079 --> 00:56:55.079
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: yes I agree

882
00:56:55.079 --> 00:57:01.159
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: yeah no I fully agree but I am happy you know some of this

883
00:57:01.159 --> 00:57:04.360
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: reignited some of that rape and discourse from back in the day um

884
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.260
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughs]

885
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:10.519
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: hahaha I thought of happy to see that again um but but I mean I agree because yes there's so

886
00:57:10.519 --> 00:57:15.320
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: many villagers especially now and and and at least I don't know if it's an majority i'm going to

887
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.519
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: assume it's an majority we get attached to our villagers right we don't necessarily want to see

888
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.599
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: so you don't actually get to see that many other designs in game unless you buy amiibo cards

889
00:57:26.039 --> 00:57:33.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: um but no I think I think that's a fun clever way okay their question is there any way to get a

890
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.519
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: hotel guest to move to your island because I know that's what the campsite is for but I was

891
00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:39.320
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: wondering if you can do that with a hotel guest at all

892
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.079
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I have not managed to see that but I don't have any empty house.

893
00:57:42.519 --> 00:57:51.960
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: hmm okay yeah that is probably an issue

894
00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:49.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't know the answer to that question actually.

895
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.559
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: okay because I haven't heard anything of that I don't remember them saying that in the

896
00:57:53.559 --> 00:57:59.239
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: direct so much so many not but I was just curious if you had seen or to experience anything

897
00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:05.639
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: but okay yeah that would be my guess because again that's what the campsites were right

898
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:07.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and it looks like no, that is not possible.

899
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:12.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I've talked about most of the crafting improvements, but obviously there's the multi craft as well.

900
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's fine, I have two issues. One, you have to like,

901
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: it's really awkward in that you click on what you want to click, and then you say I want to craft it,

902
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and then you have to press Y, and then you choose how many you want,

903
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: rather than just clicking to craft it.

904
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So it's like, I really feel like they could have removed a step, right?

905
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.340
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh.

906
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: if this, then like, show us the screen with the number,

907
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:38.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and then you either press A to just craft the one, or you move the number to choose how many you want.

908
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:43.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's the most awkward way to do multi crafting, they could have possibly done.

909
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:52.219
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, it's difficult. No one has figured it out yet, since my first introduction in 2010. I'm sorry. Oh, it's just the way it is.

910
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But at least it's there.

911
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:59.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'm glad it's there. I just, I feel like I wish they could have looked at the UX a bit better.

912
00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:06.860
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That's all. The other thing is, you can only craft 10 at once. It's a max of 10. Yep.

913
00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:11.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's that's weird that feels arbitrary. That's a problem, right?

914
00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.340
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And I don't know why.

915
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:28.800
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, why tends specifically like what, yeah, yeah.

916
00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:19.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah. Which is especially because some things are multi-crafting, right? So like, I can only craft

917
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:23.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: say 10 spades at once, but I can actually craft.

918
00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:29.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: 50 fences posts because they get five at a time from them.

919
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:39.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. The bites can't run that high out of it. There's just no room on the data.

920
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:35.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's just why such a weird arbitrary restriction. I don't understand why.

921
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:44.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I do like that the crafting includes your house and it doesn't matter where your crafting table is.

922
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It still uses this stuff from your storage. That's nice. I like this. This is good.

923
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:54.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's great. Oh, I know we're joking about how that might not happen, but I'm glad it's okay. It's bad. Anyways, go ahead

924
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:57.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It has made it just so much easier to deal with these things, right?

925
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because you go around and you get some wood and you get some all the stuff that you, your daily stuff.

926
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah

927
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And then you throw them in, you throw them in your house storage and you don't think about them again.

928
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.480
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

929
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And then you go to craft something and everything's just there. It's really nice.

930
01:00:09.719 --> 01:00:14.880
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, isn't it wonderful? I'd no longer have to dedicate a whole bro inventory to

931
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's random junk, it crashed.

932
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah.

933
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.900
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: If I needed to, uh-huh.

934
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So yeah, I think the crafting improvements overall just generally good just.

935
01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Fix your UX and let's craft more than 10 what weird restriction.

936
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.760
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laughs]

937
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'm Rosetti.

938
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: If you buy this paid Switch 2 expansion,

939
01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:39.099
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: well you get 20. (laughs)

940
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Rosetti.

941
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: He's fine.

942
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:52.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think there's one there's one weird thing for me in that he won't pick up anything that's naturally occurring.

943
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:59.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I accept flowers and I think I can't remember if you choose trees or not, but you doesn't do anything else.

944
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like if you get them to clear the beach, he won't pick up the shells.

945
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:10.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: If you get them to clear up somewhere else, he won't pick up the weeds because that's leaf's job apparently.

946
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Ha ha ha yeah

947
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:22.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's such a weird and I'm also like I personally just don't think I'll ever use him because the one time I thought about using him I was like I'd really like him to be able to do landscaping.

948
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:34.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I was recovering my island from when I had was doing my most, yeah, when I was most recently doing my moving of rocks and so my island was almost entirely water.

949
01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.199
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: - Yeah, water world.

950
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:43.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But no, he won't do landscaping it's just cleaning things up and it's only unnatural things and flowers.

951
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:50.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like what a weird restriction. Like I would talk to him every day to get him to clean up the beach to get all my shells, but no, you won't do that.

952
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And so I just I just don't see when am I ever going to use?

953
01:01:50.500 --> 01:02:05.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, that's you, you use him when you started the update and, and you were going to redo your whole island, but you didn't, you know, you specifically weren't in that situation, but, but that was.

954
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:13.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But here's, but here's the thing because they've created the other feature that means you're never going to redo your whole island because now they have slumber islands.

955
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:22.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So when you get the like, oh, I really want to do this as an island because here's an interesting idea I have, you're going to use the slumber islands then you're not going to clear your entire island.

956
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:29.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Anytime we discuss Animal Crossing New Horizon, I think it's important to

957
01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:35.820
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: remember they added the a video tour to the the other little islands that you

958
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.940
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: visit to move stuff to your storage but only for our silent

959
01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:52.300
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: and that's decided yeah yeah

960
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:50.179
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, I would love to hear the meetings and where they make these decisions and they're like,

961
01:02:50.179 --> 01:02:53.900
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: "Oh, what's the most annoying version of this feature that we can do?"

962
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:54.739
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, hi.

963
01:02:55.579 --> 01:03:00.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So bizarre, so bizarre. So, I mean, yeah, it's a cool idea and I guess it's cool that they're using

964
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:06.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: him for something, but I just, I literally cannot, I'm not, I've not even used my free one. I just cannot

965
01:03:06.539 --> 01:03:08.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: see why I would bother you.

966
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.280
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: or okay, like, so functionally, yeah, okay, I knew who's going to be like functional limited.

967
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:24.440
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It was going to find certain people and even then, like, maybe using once, maybe twice because

968
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.480
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: right most people try to keep an island in a certain way or whatever. Like you said, it's even

969
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:35.079
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: weird because we have the new dream, sweet sandbox islands or whatever. So it's weird, but okay,

970
01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:41.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: here in my burning questions are the flavor, did reset.

971
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.400
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: At any point, actually, yeah, we're good in.

972
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So he talks about... I can't remember the exact wording, but there's definitely an implication that he's been going to therapy.

973
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yes, yes, well while on the one hand

974
01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And he definitely gets... I think there's a bit where he kind of almost gets angry and then he pulls it back.

975
01:04:00.639 --> 01:04:02.639
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yes

976
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: He's very clearly managing himself. It's kind of amusing.

977
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.280
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yes

978
01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.280
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, well, you know, I guess like I could maybe I could take that because I do applaud

979
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:17.599
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You know someone trying to maintain you improve themselves and go into therapy. That's always admirable

980
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.239
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughing]

981
01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:19.719
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But at the same time, I want those

982
01:04:18.239 --> 01:04:19.079
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah.

983
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: scarring verbal abuse that was given to us in the original.

984
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, second question. Do you see it?

985
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Absolutely, that's the name of his brother.

986
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: No, at least I've not seen him, but I haven't used Rosetti so I don't know whether he's

987
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Nope, darn it!

988
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, oh, yeah.

989
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, fine.

990
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's not Louis.

991
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There is a dawn.

992
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I know I think it's dawn.

993
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'm thinking of Pickman, aren't I?

994
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: - I don't know.

995
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's dawn, yeah.

996
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, a dawn's of the brother.

997
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Anyway, okay.

998
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, that's fun.

999
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's fine.

1000
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: All right, what else we got in there?

1001
01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:09.780
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Alright, well, we're we've got the slumber islands then which I think are great. Oh, apparently. Yeah, so apparently if you do use the

1002
01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:17.139
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And New Horizons Don is shown to be helping Rosetti with the rescue service covering from him when he's on his break

1003
01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:25.980
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: He speaks to himself for a boost of confidence before transferring the player to their destination when is when's Rosetti on his break from the rescue service?

1004
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:33.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I don't know, I forgot, I forgot Rosetti did the rescue service.

1005
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:30.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Apparently, he may pop up in the roost from time to time.

1006
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:57.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think this is a great feature that like many things is just missing a few things to make it really, really good.

1007
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:41.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I completely forgot about that, but also I don't think you actually see him, right, just the text.

1008
01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You don't actually see him.

1009
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.940
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No anyways, but yeah yeah. Um...

1010
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Questionable decisions were made

1011
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The question of both decisions were made.

1012
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.260
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So first of all, fantastic, just in general, right?

1013
01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So let me play in your little story.

1014
01:06:08.099 --> 01:06:11.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So Craig, my son, my seven year old,

1015
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:15.219
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: he's really into games just now he's been playing a lot of Minecraft.

1016
01:06:15.219 --> 01:06:17.300
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: He saw me the other day playing Animal Crossing.

1017
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I was like, what's this?

1018
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.780
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: This looks like it could be fun.

1019
01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And I'm like, oh, here we go again.

1020
01:06:21.579 --> 01:06:24.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I play it and I said, yeah, you can play it.

1021
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.219
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But he plays on his own switch, right?

1022
01:06:26.219 --> 01:06:29.699
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I was like, well, let me show you this.

1023
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.940
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I get you started on your switch.

1024
01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.019
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I let him the game digitally and he started playing it and he's like,

1025
01:06:35.019 --> 01:06:39.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I just, I really want to do the terraforming because that's the bit that it's fun.

1026
01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.860
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And it takes a couple of weeks to unlock that in real time, right?

1027
01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:49.260
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And so I was like, okay, tell you what, what we can do is we can have a slumber island.

1028
01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:53.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I'll set up a slumber island on mine and you can do whatever you want in there.

1029
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And then I don't have to because he was like, can I do it on yours?

1030
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:59.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because you've got it unlocked and I didn't, I didn't want him to do that because

1031
01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.099
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I've just been...

1032
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:12.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: been a week trying to get my island back to something that I actually want, so I don't want him to then spend more time doing all that, because he wanted to build a maze, he's really into mazes just now, and so he wanted to build a maze, and I'm like, that's fun!

1033
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.320
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, right, right

1034
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:19.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So, sure, let's set you up a slumber island, because I remember to buy that feature, I hadn't used it yet, let's set up a slumber island, and you can go in and do that.

1035
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:26.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And so he has, he's gone in, and he's done it, and it's great, and he's really getting the hang of the land, the terraforming, and all that.

1036
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:30.519
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: There's some weird decisions that I don't particularly care about.

1037
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But I can see why others would be really annoyed about.

1038
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:37.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can't build buildings on the slumber islands.

1039
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So there is one building which is your house.

1040
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And that's it. There's no other buildings you can build on the island.

1041
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.840
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay. Yeah. Very weird.

1042
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:54.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: What a weird idea, right? Because so many people's visions of islands include the buildings, right?

1043
01:07:54.639 --> 01:07:56.599
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, you're being so right.

1044
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.519
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, yeah, that is confused.

1045
01:07:59.519 --> 01:08:02.639
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And I remember that was the thing I saw there in the trailer.

1046
01:08:02.639 --> 01:08:06.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I was wondering, I was like, wait, do you get to put other houses or buildings?

1047
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.480
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Because they only show off the the one house.

1048
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:14.260
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, and we assumed it would just be something they weren't showing us like this sounds like a great thing. Why would they not do this? Well, they didn't do it

1049
01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:23.859
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Secondly, you can change the weather and the time of day, but you cannot change the season

1050
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Can I... What?

1051
01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:32.979
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So the season on your slumber islands is just whatever your current season is, but you can you can set whatever time of day you want

1052
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

1053
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No.

1054
01:08:34.659 --> 01:08:38.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and you can set wherever, whether you want, but you cannot set

1055
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Sorry, I have you.

1056
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:51.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: the season. Why? It's a dream. Let me do what I want in my dream.

1057
01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, you are not.

1058
01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: No, you can only dream about summer when it's summer.

1059
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's just like the real world.

1060
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's it.

1061
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's how it is.

1062
01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:59.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's so silly. It's such a bizarre idea. Like, because they had to make a decision to be like,

1063
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's how it works though.

1064
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: yeah, okay, we'll let you change the time and we'll let you change the weather. Oh, however,

1065
01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:08.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: we let them change the season. No, I don't understand how because I

1066
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:14.100
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: that never came up, in which case, what are they doing or they decided, no, we're not going to do that,

1067
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:18.979
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: in which case, what are they doing? Why is that not a decision? I don't, if you didn't give

1068
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, there you go.

1069
01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:22.659
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: them anything, it's just whatever your current thing is, it's just going to be that. I would

1070
01:09:22.659 --> 01:09:26.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: understand that, but they specifically let you set the time and weather.

1071
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:33.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: There was no room on the UI for the season button now.

1072
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughs]

1073
01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.640
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: - Pissar, bizarre decision.

1074
01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.779
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: They have three sizes of islands.

1075
01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:43.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I was really excited that I thought maybe one of them

1076
01:09:43.539 --> 01:09:44.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: would be bigger than your current island,

1077
01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:46.020
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but no, it's not.

1078
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N.

1079
01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.859
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The biggest one is just your standard island size.

1080
01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:51.619
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So whatever, I just, I think that's a mess.

1081
01:09:51.619 --> 01:09:54.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It would be fun to have a bigger island, personally.

1082
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: not would be but

1083
01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.779
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: [laughs]

1084
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.180
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think other than that, it's mostly fine, right?

1085
01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: like you can you can get.

1086
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:13.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and you can like reproduce that as many times as you want, which is fun, you don't have to craft your tools or infinite stuff like that.

1087
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:23.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's generally pretty good. It's just those are a few decisions that make it bizarre to me that they wouldn't let you do those things. I don't understand.

1088
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:33.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I also I think three save slots. I would have liked another one maybe two. Like three just feels like it's just quiet.

1089
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:43.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Not quite enough. Four or five would have been better for me, but I get, you know, the storage space probably takes up a lot for these islands. I get that.

1090
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: - Yeah, yeah, I can manage.

1091
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:57.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So yeah, it's a great thing because that like I just I'd never would have been able to get Craig to do some terraforming without either having him to ruin my island or him get bored of the game after before two weeks was up and he hadn't unlocked.

1092
01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:04.479
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, well, hey, that is cool. Um, yeah, I just and buildings are such a big miss cuz

1093
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:11.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: is bizarre bizarre. Oh, and also you can add, you know, your inclines and bridges and they are

1094
01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:21.300
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: added automatically. Well, sorry, straightaway, which is nice. So like, I can see someone using it

1095
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:27.140
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: either as, so there's like three things essentially. Like what I did, which is Craig wants his own

1096
01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:31.060
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: island, he doesn't want to have put in the effort to unlock everything. Great, there you go.

1097
01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:34.340
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: there's the other one, which is I just want to make a really interesting looking island. I

1098
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:39.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: want to do my on my main island but the third one is I feel like it could also be close to

1099
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.600
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yup, testing ground.

1100
01:11:39.939 --> 01:11:46.979
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: being good for like testing out for your main island right like oh what if I did this but the problem

1101
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:53.479
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Almost. I love.

1102
01:11:46.979 --> 01:11:54.340
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: with that is that because you don't have the buildings you can't do it properly but like being able

1103
01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:00.020
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: to the like oh what if I tried to do this thing with these bridges and inclines you can then go in

1104
01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:04.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and spend half an hour tests all out and go yeah this will work and

1105
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:12.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: then spend the next week waiting a day every time to get your thing to build.

1106
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:21.159
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, it's yeah not having to wait for you know, do all that waiting stuff

1107
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I could see myself spending more time in the slumber.

1108
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:35.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I also, I need to double check. I think you can only bring your your villagers that are currently on your island to the slumber islands, which I feel like is a miss. I feel like being able to have like multiple islands of different villagers would be great.

1109
01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.319
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That is a big miss too at bear

1110
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:40.260
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You know that would be a great use case for the hotel guests

1111
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.520
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, yeah, that'd be good.

1112
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:48.939
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Ones that show up there just end up in a register that you can use on dream mileage, but no say love me. Oh, man. What a that's

1113
01:12:49.579 --> 01:12:51.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Good I baffling decisions every

1114
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I'm trying to fact-check myself to

1115
01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Okay, so you can you can invite past villages as well, but not ones that you haven't had

1116
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:12.180
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, let's start I guess but still limiting again if you like if you're happy other crew you don't get the experience that many villagers to begin with

1117
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:14.199
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: but you also can't talk to them.

1118
01:13:14.699 --> 01:13:16.699
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, yeah

1119
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.159
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: If you talk to them, they'll just stand there

1120
01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:20.300
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: and they might use a reaction, they won't talk.

1121
01:13:20.779 --> 01:13:27.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, that's really the end and then you horizon experience. There's Raymond looking in

1122
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:31.020
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And every, and you have to put the villagers there every time you go, the villagers won't stay there.

1123
01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.020
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh

1124
01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Look at Raymond. He's for the aesthetics

1125
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: How do you better be in boxes?

1126
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.979
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Good times all right, what else do we got in this update?

1127
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:57.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: "We have strafing, which is great. It's fantastic. It has made terraforming fun rather than a chore."

1128
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like being able to just go along a whole row, just like hold the button, hold the right, and then just press A, press A, press A, press A, it's great.

1129
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I love it.

1130
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I would like the strafing to be like a toggle rather than a hold, because I do find my hand cramps on long sessions.

1131
01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:18.340
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: We are at the point we're not just animal crossing any game

1132
01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:26.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Like you just said is a toggle bra and set run for a toggle or whatever you know the comparable example we're at that point. Come on people

1133
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:31.739
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, that's another yeah, that's another thing that in this game is not a toggle. It's a you have to hold into it. It's such a like they just

1134
01:14:29.819 --> 01:14:33.680
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, well, you gotta stay consistent then don't you?

1135
01:14:33.819 --> 01:14:35.819
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Consistently bad

1136
01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.420
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, well

1137
01:14:37.859 --> 01:14:40.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You get to credit. I couldn't have the other one. I could we don't?

1138
01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.220
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Of course not course not

1139
01:14:43.899 --> 01:14:47.859
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yeah, I don't really know what else to say. It's great. I don't have anything to complain about this feature

1140
01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:51.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Other than the fact that I'd like it to be a toggle. That's it. It's great. It's a great feature

1141
01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.819
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And Craig picked that up really quickly when I taught him how it works

1142
01:14:57.819 --> 01:15:03.579
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: He now uses it all the time for stuff like I think the thing that I so there's two things that I really great a bit

1143
01:15:03.579 --> 01:15:08.699
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: One is just how quick it makes terraforming now, but the other thing is you know all these videos you got

1144
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:15.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Years ago about people like trying to dig up a specific thing and they kept missing the one specific patch they needed to

1145
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.859
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah!

1146
01:15:15.899 --> 01:15:19.340
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: This fixes that because you just point the vague out vague

1147
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: location, you press the straight button and it lines you up and you now

1148
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:29.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: know where you're going to go. It's, it is such a good feature.

1149
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:39.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I need to, I still haven't even like seen that ever heard about it and people talk about it, but I need to see like, I think what it looks like, but that sounds cool.

1150
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:43.020
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: it's super super good. It's such a good feat. Uh, the home storage I have no opinions on because

1151
01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:49.500
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I've never filled up my storage. But I guess it's good. It's really expensive and you can't use

1152
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: loans for it. So you have to have 1.2 million bells to get the top storage.

1153
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, really? That's fascinating. That's cool. You know, I actually like them.

1154
01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:02.300
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But at this point, at this point, who doesn't have stupid amounts of bells from selling the

1155
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right.

1156
01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:09.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: turnips, right? Come on. And I guess it's like it's endgame stuff.

1157
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Absolutely.

1158
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:13.420
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: particularly bad, right? Like, if you're, if you're at the point where you need, was it 12,000

1159
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, I agree.

1160
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:17.739
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: storage or whatever it is, like some insane amount? Like, I think you can drop a million bells.

1161
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah.

1162
01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:24.699
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think you're fine with that. You've probably spent like three times as much getting the

1163
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Don't you call me out like this out?

1164
01:16:24.699 --> 01:16:36.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: items that you need to store. Yeah, I just, I just don't particularly care about the, yeah, shut up.

1165
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Hey, we don't think about that.

1166
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'm going to think about how that reflects on your real life either.

1167
01:16:37.899 --> 01:16:44.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That took me a minute to log what you were saying. Um, and the last thing is, uh, the last thing I'm

1168
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.140
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laughter]

1169
01:16:44.539 --> 01:16:51.659
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: really noticing is you can get leaf to remove weeds from your island now. But only if there's a

1170
01:16:51.659 --> 01:17:00.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: certain number of them. Was it? I don't think so because it is listed in the patch note.

1171
01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: was it out here in the thing? That wasn't in the game already.

1172
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.739
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Well, thing. I'm crazy. I feel like, I don't know.

1173
01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:07.020
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I mean, maybe I'm just thinking of Earth Day or whatever.

1174
01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:11.779
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Cause there was a day if you would show up to, Hey, let's remove the weeds.

1175
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Maybe maybe that's what it was. Yeah, or maybe you could maybe you could only do it when he was visiting the island because now you can do it when you when he's on Harves Island

1176
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Maybe that. Okay. Okay.

1177
01:17:20.399 --> 01:17:22.880
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can go and ask him to do it when he's not on the island. I

1178
01:17:23.359 --> 01:17:28.920
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Mean, it's a great feature right because the number of people coming to this have haven't played for two years and their island is covered in

1179
01:17:29.479 --> 01:17:30.680
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: weeds

1180
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can just go and get paid

1181
01:17:33.199 --> 01:17:36.520
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You know go over to Harves Island and ask leaf to get rid of them all it's good

1182
01:17:37.079 --> 01:17:40.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But again something I probably won't ever use because I

1183
01:17:40.479 --> 01:17:42.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I feel like the amount of effort to go to Harves Island.

1184
01:17:43.000 --> 01:18:09.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I think to summarize, most of these are at least good additions to the game, if not sometimes with baffling decisions made.

1185
01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's the game!

1186
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: None of it makes me want to play the game.

1187
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:16.380
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Ha ha ha. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no.

1188
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:20.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It doesn't fund it. What was the thing I was complaining about earlier in our chat?

1189
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Let me check why I said. Because I got really annoyed the other day.

1190
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:33.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh yeah, the paths and stuff. I still don't understand how this game is designed for a let's make an island look pretty.

1191
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Like that's the fundamental point of this game. And I can't get my paths to line up properly.

1192
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh yeah.

1193
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.979
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Because I can't why can I not put paths up

1194
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.840
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: an incline or at least to the bottom of the incline with no gap why can't I put them up to up to the the the the side of

1195
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: [laughter]

1196
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:59.479
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Houses why can I not put them up to the beach? Why can I not? Why is the whole point of this game is make this island look pretty and I can't do it?

1197
01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:02.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: We don't have the technology at all.

1198
01:19:03.199 --> 01:19:07.239
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Why can I still not buy things from?

1199
01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:12.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The the adb I cannot buy things from the adb use

1200
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:40.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: the adb balance. I have to take money out of the adb have it in my bag which by the way you can still only have a hundred thousand in your wallet and then and then you have lists sets of a hundred K in your bag which takes up so much space. Sorry, 99k rounding up and all of this I don't understand why the money management is still so bad in this game.

1201
01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.020
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: $9,000, $9,000, $9,000.

1202
01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.579
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'd love to say just to make it more awkward.

1203
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Especially when you have to have a, you have to have one point.

1204
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:57.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's 2 million bells in your bag to buy the most recent the highest storage upgrade, so you have to have a bag full of money.

1205
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:58.920
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, how they don't live in a casual society. Well,

1206
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:07.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's more than it's 13 stacks of money you have to have to buy the highest thing.

1207
01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:06.760
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I also are they going to validate that you have those bells. They, they have to count

1208
01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.039
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: every one of those stacks. No other way.

1209
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Why can I still only have 10 items?

1210
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't understand this, I know it's better than previous ones.

1211
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: This is what made me stop playing new leaf so quickly.

1212
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Was just the lack of stacking in the game.

1213
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It drove me insane when I first went into that.

1214
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I think you could stack them, but you had to manually stack them.

1215
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I believe so. Yeah.

1216
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Is that how it newly worked?

1217
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Absolutely baffling decision there.

1218
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I just like, I've spent about half an hour on that game.

1219
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: The moment I realized you had to manually stack fruit.

1220
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.600
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1221
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I know, I know that game so fast.

1222
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So I'm so glad that you weren't actually had stacking.

1223
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: But why is it stacks of 10?

1224
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I don't understand.

1225
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Pokémon's the ageest out of the thing where you can have a thousand stack of shards.

1226
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Give me more.

1227
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's literally just a bite.

1228
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Give me more of that bite, please.

1229
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:17.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: They don't have the room for those fights, no go that high, but only for bells, not for those other items where they can go higher.

1230
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can't.

1231
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: you can't you can't

1232
01:21:13.239 --> 01:21:28.399
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: You can't store 10 in a smaller space than you can store 100 in binary in unless you're being insanely obsessive about your storage, which I don't think they are

1233
01:21:28.399 --> 01:21:39.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Happy fun times. This game is still so frustrating and yes, they have improved some of this game, but it is still incredibly frustrating and I

1234
01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.939
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I still can't decide whether I want to play it ever.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:25.319
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Anyways, it was a card, it was a Benny card.

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: I just, I, this is the thing, it's like all these decisions are decisions. None of these

1254
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: One day they'll figure it out.

1255
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:02.060
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, right. Yeah.

1256
01:22:57.579 --> 01:23:03.380
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: things are accidental. They have had to make decisions about all of these things and I don't

1257
01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.060
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: understand why they've made the

1258
01:23:05.619 --> 01:23:14.180
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: So yeah, that's that exact my thoughts on people, but yeah, no, it's it's

1259
01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.659
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: entry. Well, no, I say I say that I'm just far removed. I was about to say it feels

1260
01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:21.060
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: like they've done a lot more of that in this update, but now that's not true.

1261
01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:27.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's been a while, but 90.

1262
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.880
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Do you think this is the last update?

1263
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:37.859
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: minutes. Sorry what genuinely, yes, like all broken and heckling them aside, I do

1264
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Do you think this is the last update?

1265
01:23:37.859 --> 01:23:46.579
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: think it is. I think yep, it's stalling.

1266
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:45.180
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Every time they release an update and delays the new games or like not not and just just for listeners

1267
01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:51.899
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That doesn't I'm not saying they're taking people away from the other thing that takes it my point is it just my point is when they release an update

1268
01:23:51.899 --> 01:23:56.899
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That tells us that the update the new game isn't coming for another couple of years at least right like

1269
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:59.539
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: That's a deconformation of the new classic

1270
01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.779
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Exactly, it's like that is not it's not coming this year

<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Probably not next year either

1273
01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:06.539
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: maybe like

1274
01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.680
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Dude five years. I'm my my money's five years

1276
01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:14.260
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: new animal crossing or hunt chocolatier.

1277
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:20.140
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh, that's a good one. I will say we have evident like we have screenshots of haunted chocolate to your so

1278
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.800
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

1279
01:24:20.899 --> 01:24:22.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You know what

1280
01:24:22.899 --> 01:24:24.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You're right your

1281
01:24:25.619 --> 01:24:32.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, you're right, but mmm. It's a good one. I'm gonna lean towards haunted chocolate to your but you I could be dead wrong

1282
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.800
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Are we getting either of them before 2030?

1283
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:43.039
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That's the big one. Are either of those games coming out this decade?

1284
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:45.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh animal crossing definitely not I'm I'm I'm serious five years. That's my that's my bed right now

1285
01:24:45.279 --> 01:24:48.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Okay, on to Jocletier, this decade.

1286
01:24:48.899 --> 01:24:50.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: When did he first announce it? Oh

1287
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.119
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: 2021, I think.

1288
01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:55.340
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Oh no, and you

1289
01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:03.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, do you really thing it would be like hold on I'm gonna check this - because this is this is critical

1290
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Oh yeah October 2021 was when he announced the game.

1291
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: We're nearly at five years from an end.

1292
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:21.439
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Okay, yeah, okay, definitely haunts chocolate here. I'm gonna give concern date, but I've cried of that he can bring it out before 10 years

1293
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.439
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: you think it's coming, you think it's coming within this decade.

1294
01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yes

1295
01:25:25.439 --> 01:25:31.119
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: "Stake on a year." So obviously it's not this year, it's probably not next year.

1296
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:37.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I'm gonna... No, I'll say 29. I'll... I'll 29. I'll be generous.

1297
01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:33.439
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: 28 or 29.

1298
01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.500
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Eight years. Yeah. Yeah, I can see it.

1299
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: As kind of mad that it is taking away, we've taken that long.

1300
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: If it takes eight years from announcement to release that.

1301
01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:55.220
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: And it's kind of, well, we're in the age of the silk song psychos and I mean the dead

1302
01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.939
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: is not the players.

1303
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: It's sure, sure.

1304
01:25:56.939 --> 01:26:02.779
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: It's like, concerned it is absolutely among those, right?

1305
01:26:02.779 --> 01:26:04.100
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Because there's a thing.

1306
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: I say that 2020 not, but there's also going to be a started update, at least every

1307
01:26:08.899 --> 01:26:11.739
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: other year in between then.

1308
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:20.279
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So, they announced that Silk Song was going to be its own game in 2019.

1309
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:22.779
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, which in all honesty not that bad

1310
01:26:20.279 --> 01:26:29.199
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: That's only that's only two years before Hunter Juglet here was announced.

1311
01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:33.520
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: So we're not long from it being there more time between Hunter Juglet.

1312
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:52.979
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, I see it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a good point to you. Yeah. I don't think it's going to come out that soon though. I think it's going to be a little long. I'm going to say this decade, but it's going to be a minute. That's my opinion.

1313
01:26:54.500 --> 01:27:04.739
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: already. I will go on record and say it's the other way around. I think, I think we

1314
01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:57.260
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: But yeah, new, new, new and I'm crossing.

1315
01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.899
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: Yeah, definitely not this decade.

1316
01:27:04.739 --> 01:27:10.819
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: get a new animal crossing in 2028 and then hunt chocolatier in 29. No, I think we

1317
01:27:10.819 --> 01:27:15.460
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: get them both in 28. Both games, new animal crossing and hunt chocolatier, both

1318
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:24.000
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: You think we'll get then two to three years new animal crossing, okay, all right.

1319
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:32.479
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: Yes. Yes. Because I think that I think all of this stuff is back ported from the new game.

1320
01:27:32.479 --> 01:27:36.960
<v BB1DA204-9A3D-400F-B608-215D6D8C46B9>Al: And I think they are based on the same engine, the same graphics.

1321
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:34.340
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: - Hmm.

1322
01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:40.460
<v 00A42886-020E-4DD2-9C2B-0B3EA7CCB1F9>Kevin: - So I'm what have said, happy home designer was,
