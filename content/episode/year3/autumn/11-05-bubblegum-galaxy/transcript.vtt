<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Would you have stuff to talk about?

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.399
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And we're not ready

16
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Are we ever ready?

<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I don't know. Is anyone ever ready

<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: No, now you're right about that. Um, I'm less ready. I'm just kind of re watching the direct and oh

19
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.799
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, good times

20
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.819
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, well we're gonna talk about that. We're gonna talk about other stuff as well. I played the bubblegum galaxy demo, so I want to talk about that

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know what that is

22
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.799
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, we talked about that game like last week

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: We probably did I don't remember

24
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.640
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So I'm gonna talk about that obviously we have some news

25
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But first of all Kevin what have you been up to?

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:02:03.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, so I hit them them ZA credits. Yeah, the Pokemon. Uh, that ending was okay. It was okay. Kind of weird to highlight your, you know, real-time movement based, you know, fighting system with a completely stationary enemy at the end, but okay.

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: What's what's that?

28
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.439
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: hey that's not true it's not completely stationary the wiggle about a little bit

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, fine. They hide in the ground.

30
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, sure. True. That's very true. Yeah, the Zygarde stuff was cool. Maybe should have done more of that.

31
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:37.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: So much stuff thought just to the crazy thought. Um, but yeah, I'm still playing. I'm doing post game running around doing the mountain emissions. I've got and catching stuff and buying clothes, you know, the real game.

32
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.340
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'm- I still have not fun to show any.

33
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: None at all.

34
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.740
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Says that's my love. None other than the- the mirrory.

35
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: How many hours have you gotten this?

36
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.219
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Um, that's a good question, I have to look it up.

37
00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.939
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know, but at least 20, 30 probably I would guess.

38
00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:56.099
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Um, but yeah, my brother, he, you know, we all know common steals all my luck.

39
00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.579
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: He's found four Chinese before he equated, typically.

40
00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.020
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Um, so yeah, that's me.

41
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.259
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But one day I may find a shiny, probably not, but we'll see.

42
00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.099
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Anyways, but, uh, it's kind of crazy.

43
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Uh, well, okay, you know, back.

44
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:26.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's up on second. So poke one does the one thing that you say is all that doesn't. It's very true. And you like, and it is cool. The world state changes post games. Yeah, that's correct. The thing. Zelda doesn't with the post game world state change.

45
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.520
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: No, so anything that's elder does.

46
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:39.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And that's, uh, I do think it's pretty cool. It's kind of crazy. You see prism tower looking like that, right? But yeah, it's what it is. I'm enjoying.

47
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:57.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I think it was pretty clever to open up three battle zones every night instead of one. That's a fun little change, but, but yeah. Anyways, I do you poke them on. I liked it. It's, it's okay. I give it a thumbs up. Um, yeah, it's.

48
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.879
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So will you now accept that this game is not a

49
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: All right. Well, you know, I haven't put the DLC yet to be seen.

50
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.780
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The game does not suddenly change it's been a year nearly I was talking about

51
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Oh my goodness.

52
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.040
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: this game and and all the way back a year ago you were like I think it's a

53
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:39.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Well, well, you know that that's it's interesting because they framed so much of the marketing and and even in game, right? Like, oh, it's this big restoration project. It's literally just green light curtains going up at places. Very bizarre way of marketing it.

54
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.680
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: city builder and I was like nope no way

55
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah. I mean, I think I did say that I could see things changing, but it changes as the story goes on.

56
00:04:40.500 --> 00:05:05.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's not like you're going to have a choice in that matter, and that's pretty much what happened.

58
00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.199
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But yeah, the scale was lower than I was expecting when they highlighted that.

59
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.100
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah.

60
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.300
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, there we go.

61
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.300
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, it is what it is, thank her music. I'll give it then.

62
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: All right, what about you all? What's going on over there?

63
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.639
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I've also been playing a little bit asier because I still have some Pokémon to catch the

64
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:27.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Legendre's. So I've done the final, like, side quest. So now all of the side quests

65
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.680
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: are done. I won't tell you what that was, obviously. But yeah, the final DLC side quest.

66
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.360
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And I've got another couple of Legendre's. So I'm now down to four Pokémon left to catch.

67
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.959
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So 4 Legendre is left to get.

68
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.279
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: We'll get there eventually.

69
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:54.660
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: oh yeah man it makes sense with such a limited scale game that they had to crank up

70
00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The RNG is killing.

71
00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.639
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: the RNG but ooh if it's brutal it's brutal yeah

72
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.740
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But I feel like at the point that I'm that they could just make it guaranteed by this point

73
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: You're just like just give me the Pokemon. I'm literally nothing else life to do in this game

74
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.339
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And I'm just chugging through doing these pointless tasks. I don't even have any more shinies to get

75
00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:15.459
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: bring me from my prison

76
00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:16.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I have all of the shinies. I need from this game. I just want to finish the decks my word

77
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:24.740
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: oh

78
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Frustrating anyway, whatever nearly done. We'll have a new Pokemon game to obsess over soon

79
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm sure

80
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:33.600
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'm so excited for bakovia get hyped well did you had the pre-order in the news

81
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, that too, I guess

82
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:43.560
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: no we gotta get hyped yeah yeah

83
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I don't know the the four leafed plant preorder

84
00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:48.759
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Weirdest preorder ever like I think the pre-orders for giving to just the items in general is not great

85
00:06:50.120 --> 00:07:01.899
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But whatever and but yeah, it's specifically being a four leafed plant a single potted plant. It's not even an interesting looking plant. It's a generic potted plant

86
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:11.120
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, with no. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's a little less than a week or month away, I'm excited.

87
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Oh goodness me so stupid

88
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Whoo

89
00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:15.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: No more than a month away. It's the fifth March

90
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.959
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, or sorry, other way, I believe hard enough could be less.

91
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Just over a month a month and a

92
00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:27.720
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: 60s as we're recording when this episode comes out it will be a month and one day so

93
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah

94
00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.100
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: There you go. It's close

95
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.800
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Let's just pretend that's what you were talking about. Okay

96
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.980
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, yeah, so I played the bubblegum that guy

97
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.540
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: see demo, I finished it, I'll have lots to say, but well, I have some to say about that later on in the episode.

98
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:50.899
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I also tried another demo, Sky Harvest, and by that, don't play that game.

99
00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:59.060
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, okay, that's a bit unfair. I mean, well, there's not much to talk about with that one,

100
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.199
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, hey, do we want to get into it?

101
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.279
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: so I didn't really want to talk about it in the main section. I'll just talk about it here.

102
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, that's-

103
00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The controller didn't.

104
00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.279
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like at all.

105
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.100
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, yeah!

106
00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:24.399
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like, they don't have like default settings on the Steam Deck that allow you to play it properly and I tried everything, all sorts of combinations of things and I cannot get the game to work at all, like at all, it doesn't register any input whatsoever from my controller.

107
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:34.440
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like, even all of the ways that Steam can like force it to, it still doesn't work, it doesn't, I cannot get it to work at all.

108
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And it's baffling.

109
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.100
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Their feature is and to I controller support

110
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: They went through every length to make sure it doesn't work

111
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:58.919
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, well that's the thing, it's like there's so many different ways you can have controller support and they actively don't work with any of them, even the ways that work with games that don't have any thought process put into it.

112
00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.799
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that's the one like

113
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, oh, that's great failing right at the start good times, but

114
00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.919
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Super bad.

115
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah.

116
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.759
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Now you don't get to experience the three different art styles featured in a single game

117
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah.

118
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:23.399
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I've also been playing some more heartopia and I tried to play that on my Steam Deck, that does work back to the Sky Harvest, but it is not got controller support.

119
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:34.759
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's very much the mobile game, but on our computer, and you can tell, so it's like you can, you can hack it around and you can

120
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

121
00:09:35.000 --> 00:10:03.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: control everything using controls, but it takes a bit of kind of finiggling around the settings and the, I never got a good, so to, I never got a good two joystick solution working, so I got it working where the left joystick moves your control character around as you would expect, but because of the way that the controls work normally, I couldn't figure out getting the right joystick to actually control the camera.

122
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.940
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Wow. Right.

123
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: have to like press another button as well.

124
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:28.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I don't know why you have to like press. Like is it not pretty standard that you just use the mouse to move around. You have to like press a button in many games to move the camera.

125
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Uh huh.

126
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh.

127
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh.

128
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.399
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That's wild.

129
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.899
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, that doesn't sound great.

130
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.799
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know. I genuinely do not know, I don't plan out of my skates.

131
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.360
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: - Well, yeah, me neither.

132
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But yeah, so this game is such a weird game.

133
00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:44.360
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And I don't enjoy playing on mobile, right?

134
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.679
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Because I don't enjoy playing many games like that on mobile.

135
00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:51.120
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Mobile works best for quick, easy input,

136
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: not like I'm running around a world playing

137
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.759
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: a cottage core game, right?

138
00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:58.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like it just does, I don't like it.

139
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But I don't like playing on my Steam deck either

140
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: because the controls don't work well.

141
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.559
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's all to work, but it doesn't work well.

142
00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:11.120
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And the other issue is that it's an always on internet game.

143
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So you have to, so like, you're on your phone, right?

144
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh yeah!

145
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.639
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Play, play, blah, blah, whatever.

146
00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:19.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Okay, swipe away, I'm going away from the game.

147
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.159
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm going to go do something else.

148
00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.440
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Two minutes later, you come back

149
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: and you have to reconnect to the server.

150
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.919
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And it's like, I just, it doesn't encourage you

151
00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:29.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: to keep playing the game, right?

152
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like it's meant to be a mobile jump in, jump out game.

153
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: to the server every time you come to it. I think it's design. It feels like it's

154
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, that's wild.

155
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:46.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: it feels like it's designed to be like multiplayer, right? So like it has to refigure out how the world is

156
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: every time you reconnect. Whereas like, but can you imagine if like you were playing Pokemon Go and

157
00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:55.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: you swiped away to go and check a message and you went back into Pokemon Go and it had to relog

158
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.919
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: you in and reconnect to everything. Like it would just it wouldn't be fun.

159
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:07.879
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: that that sounds good that that reminds me of slight different because it's the

160
00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:12.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: opposite where you know it could be offline but smash bros on 3DS and I think

161
00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:16.559
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Monster Hunter on the 3DS they would restart the OS every time you started the game

162
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.279
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So yeah, it's it's a weird game heartopia. I I'm not really sure like if you I feel like if you want like an always on internet connected

163
00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Cartage core game Palia is right there

164
00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:34.679
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: This just feels like a weird

165
00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:39.639
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Kind of not great version of it. I don't know maybe I'll try and put some more time in

166
00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:45.440
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I've not got enough thoughts to do like a proper deep dive into the game at this point like everything is fine

167
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.919
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: but I just don't enjoy playing it

168
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: because of all the different control schemes are all not good.

169
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.440
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But at least I can play it on my steam deck, unlike Sky Harvest.

170
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, man.

171
00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.919
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Which may as well have just blown my steam deck up.

172
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:07.340
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Sounds to me like you should have just sat down at your desk and played on your desktop computer.

173
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:14.580
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Oh my word, yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about some news. First up, we have Tom Adachi Life

174
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:22.259
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: have announced the game is coming out on the 16th of April and did our 22 minute long direct

175
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:30.419
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: this week. What do you want to talk about this game? I don't let me let me give you my first

176
00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:34.340
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: because this is my like first proper impressions of this because like I've seen some kind of stuff

177
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: around the previous games but not

178
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.960
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: really. I finally figured out that it's it's just the Sims but silly.

179
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.100
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that's correct. That's exactly what is I even so for reference

180
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.059
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I have not played the original Tom about your life Calvin and Melia, but I'm not me

181
00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:54.799
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But I am aware what it is and yeah, it is just the sims, but silly Nintendo and

182
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:06.360
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: but like really silly see see when you get the see when you get the overview of the the island

183
00:13:55.799 --> 00:14:01.600
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And and me's oh, yeah, oh, it's no holds barred over in Tom Adachi world

184
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.399
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Your go for whatever

185
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.399
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: about three and a half and nearly four minutes into the gate into the the direct.

186
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Just I think that looks a lot like pokopia at that point, that overview. It feels like

187
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.799
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: they've got very similar colors and graphics. It doesn't win you obviously when you zoom in,

188
00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.159
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But just on that overview.

189
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: of the island view, I looked at it went, oh, it feels like Pocopia, and why is everything

190
00:14:29.059 --> 00:14:30.080
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: an island just now?

191
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I probably because it's easier to I don't know if that's true at all, but that's my layman's guess

192
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.360
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: but but I think it's because the island is like there's a lot of square elements. It looks almost

193
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: pixly just on you know the big overview. That's probably what it is, but I can see your point

194
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.279
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: but I mean hey that's only for that moment because you know as it starts filling up it's clearly

195
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.080
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Not Tocopia or-

196
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Could be, I don't know, will.

197
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.220
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yes, no, no, yeah, no, I get once once you start adding things if he was less like and most of the game

198
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.700
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: You're not seeing that view, right? You're not seeing the overview like that

199
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:17.120
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It was it was literally just that initial like here's the island and you're like, oh goodness that looks like bo-go be alright now

200
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah

201
00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:20.299
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Just like a small version of it

202
00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:29.679
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I've got to say I think possibly my favorite part of the whole direct is at the start where they have to reintroduce the concept of me's to the people who don't know

203
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:38.240
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But but yeah, it's it seems but okay, I've never played some either so I can't make the comparison, but but

204
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It how should I put this?

205
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.179
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I like to really zoomed in moments direct interactions between people. I don't know if sims is that detailed

206
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:54.139
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It is certainly, yeah, I think even in the Sims 2 had some interactions between the characters.

207
00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:00.379
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I don't know back then whether you could, like, whether they would happen naturally,

208
00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:04.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: you could definitely make it happen. I can't remember whether the Sims 2 had, like,

209
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:12.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: automatic ones or not, but it certainly does in Sims 3 and 4 they certainly do. They live their whole

210
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.960
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: lives and you can just like direct.

211
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.840
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: - Okay.

212
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.919
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah.

213
00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.919
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Well, I mean, hey, like,

214
00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:22.039
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know if I'm gonna get this.

215
00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:22.879
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It looks good.

216
00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:23.720
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'll say that.

217
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.080
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Like, it's bringing all that chaotic energy.

218
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.720
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And, you know, people who I taught at Shefans,

219
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.840
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'm sure you're eating well,

220
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.279
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: 'cause this is exactly what you want.

221
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.360
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's, you know, add your strong,

222
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: make me of all your friends and random celebrities

223
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.360
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: and random animal creatures

224
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: and just have added going chaotic in the world.

225
00:16:44.639 --> 00:16:46.639
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I like the level of customization.

226
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.840
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Well, or, you know, variety and stuff like in,

227
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.799
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: so up at least, yeah.

228
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Should we talk about gender?

229
00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:54.639
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah.

230
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.399
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Well, what is there, are we gonna go, whoa.

231
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: No.

232
00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:58.240
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: - Wow.

233
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I mean, if people don't already realize this podcast is woke then I don't know what to do.

234
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:14.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm obviously not doing my job well enough, but you can be mail, female, or non-binary and then you can choose your dating preferences as any or all or none.

235
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: This is good.

236
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:42.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: it's, you know what, I think it is the first time in Nintendo history they've ever explicitly made those, or at least not binary for sure that's the first time I believe we've ever seen that option, whether or not, ooh me, you know, there's been a few cases where they've dealt with some of the relationships stuff, excuse me, like in Fire Emblem and what, but.

237
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But they it's you know

238
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.259
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: clear steps so that you've been for them.

239
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:51.539
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But it's like in in many of those cases. It's just like you don't really notice it unless you're actively trying to do these things, right?

240
00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:03.599
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: front den center. It's the starting options, yep. Yeah, so yeah, it's pretty cool. I like the

241
00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:56.259
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Whereas this is like it's very clearly like hey, this is a thing

242
00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.380
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: You know

243
00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:09.680
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: elements of like where you can sketch stuff in. The dog, the sketched in dog is really good,

244
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:16.319
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: just completely flat, always from one camera angle. I like that and you know little elements

245
00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:22.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: like putting what's on the TV or unclothing. Um, I think it's pretty fun. Yeah.

246
00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:28.079
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know. Hugh Morris says taking the internet by storm. Sure. He's a clown man, I guess.

247
00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:34.720
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But, uh, but yeah, I don't know. Looks good. Again, I'm not having played the first one. I can't get too

248
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: detailed in thoughts other than it looks good. It looks wild, chaotic, where hot dog costume. There you go.

249
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.079
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah. All right. Yeah. I mean, I feel like I need to try this.

250
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.559
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, is there a demo?

251
00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:53.400
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm very glad. Oh, good question.

252
00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:55.880
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Because I believe the original one actually did on 3DS.

253
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I can't see anything any confirmation of a demo,

254
00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:07.680
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: but there are rumors that there might be a demo.

255
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that seems appropriate, expected, hopefully.

256
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: There's an image claiming to be a screenshot of the demo.

257
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So we will see, I guess.

258
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.799
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm very glad there's a month and a half

259
00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:24.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: between Pocopey are coming out and this coming out.

260
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:35.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Ha ha ha! Well, I'll still be on PCOP, I'm gonna be PCOP for life, but good for all of you and other people who want to move on and play other games.

261
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:45.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: never said I'm moving on. We can play multiple games. It just gives me a month and a half

262
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, you know, I guess so.

263
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:56.920
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: to hyper focus on book up here. Okay, cool. I think that we could have hyper focused on all

264
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Ah, there you go.

265
00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.220
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: of the details in the trailer, but as neither of us have played the older ones, that feels

266
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:08.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, as, oh, you know what, one, one's funny.

267
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.940
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: unnecessary and we can just see how the game is once

268
00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:12.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I like the buildings, like, you know, the grocery store, the library.

269
00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:15.339
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know, just just lots of little details that I like.

270
00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:19.619
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But anyways, but yeah, again, this is basically an outsider's perspective.

271
00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:20.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Look, school, thumbs up.

272
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah it feels it does feel quite detailed everything right like there's there's there's a lot of different things

273
00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:24.380
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah.

274
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:44.420
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yes, shops and buildings, library with the magic broom, and, and, yeah, yeah, no, I'm, I'm, and yeah, very excited to see our

275
00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:38.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah and decorations and other items and stuff like that

276
00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:49.900
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: friends come up with the nonsense and the stories that will, in good, come out of that.

277
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Which one of my me's world romance, who in, in what island I don't know, we'll see?

278
00:20:52.500 --> 00:21:02.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Oh yes, we should talk about the weirdness of them disabling, sharing screenshots and screen

279
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

280
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.099
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: video from this game, it's super weird.

281
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:12.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that is weird right because me especially are the kind of content you want to share and designs I guess right like

282
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:23.099
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, like share your creations like that's a very basic common function and it's a lot of games right Kirby air writers and animal crossing

283
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.720
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And you want it because it gets people more interested in the game, right?

284
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:33.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like, think about how long Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom just stayed in people's thoughts

285
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.400
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: because they kept seeing these weird videos of people doing nonsense in them.

286
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.819
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah.

287
00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:38.920
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That's true.

288
00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:43.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And they're like, "Oh, we don't want these things to be shown out of context. Why not?"

289
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.799
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I don't understand what you're expecting here. Like, "Oh no, we don't want people to think that

290
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.200
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, I'm pretty sure

291
00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:52.839
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: weird things can happen and weird

292
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:10.079
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: if you don't want people to share something that might be a little bit rude

293
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I was about to say I i don't think.

294
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.099
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't think the context helps the situation at all.

295
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:14.880
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: you're like people are going to share it if they really want people to see it they're going to do it

296
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.880
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: they're just gonna have to do it in a different way like you disable the button in the game

297
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

298
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.839
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: it doesn't stop people from sharing things

299
00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:23.319
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, oh

300
00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:30.160
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: On the other hand, it's gonna give a boost to the the YouTube me tutorial panels again. Yeah

301
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: [laughing]

302
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.839
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: - All right, cool.

303
00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:44.420
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But oh, oh, oh, but would you say that this is perhaps by Nintendo once again making a baffling decision?

304
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.119
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: baffling, baffling decisions. Classic Nintendo, let's not even talk about dispatch, which may or may not

305
00:22:47.059 --> 00:22:49.059
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yes

306
00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:51.059
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: We set the clock

307
00:22:51.119 --> 00:23:00.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: be Nintendo, we'd still don't know. All right, next up we have Japanese Ruderal Life, which is a

308
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.079
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: game that was previously, or still is currently exclusive to Apple Arcade, but there are

309
00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:10.400
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: nights a couple months ago and I missed it at the time that it is going to come to Switch and

310
00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.359
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: steam this year. So that's cool.

311
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:20.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That's cool. What is the game on looking at it? It looks like Japanese rule Stardew. It's a farming it

312
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.640
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's a farming game. Japanese is Japanese star. Yeah, pretty much.

313
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:27.700
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's Stardew, but Japan look at those cherry blossoms. That's it. That's all I see

314
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:36.099
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So yeah, I think we talked about it when it came out on Apple Arcade, but as usual, people don't play games when they're on Apple Arcade.

315
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.700
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But we're weeps

316
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:49.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, well, yeah, look, I'm not an Apple person. I'll just leave it at that for and it's those machines are expensive. That's that's that's my point.

317
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:56.460
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah. Yeah. The problem is it is like, do you want to play a subscription for your games?

318
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:57.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That's that's that's that

319
00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.779
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I mean, I guess that's the whole point of game pass, but for some reason it doesn't work when Apple

320
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:06.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: a lot. I'm a PC and he's a Mac.

321
00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:01.420
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: do it. I don't know.

322
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:11.980
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I think there's something specific to cottagecore games that makes me not want to get them

323
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: What's next?

324
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:19.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: on a subscription because I have bought a game pass three

325
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.220
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: on subscription. I'm going to use it some point this year. And I do like the idea because it's like, oh,

326
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:29.339
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.380
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: here's a bunch of games that are on game pass. Let me spend three months playing them all.

328
00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But the problem is the cottagecore games are designed to put like hundreds of hours over months.

329
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.779
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I don't want to keep paying for that. I want to pay once and be done with it and play the game

330
00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:43.660
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: forever, whereas other games like like dispatch that we were talking about, like you could see that

331
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.579
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: sort of thing being on a subscription really good because it's like, oh, let's play through the game.

332
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. That's a good point.

333
00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:49.579
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And then we're done. We're done, play, we're done.

334
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:59.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm finished. Finished with that game and you put it down. And you don't worry about the fact that you're never going to be able to play a game without paying more money because well, I'm done with it.

335
00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.799
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah.

336
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:11.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So yeah, super fun. But anyway, yeah, coming to Steam and Switch sometime this year. So we'll keep you up to date on that.

337
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: All right.

338
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: 2026.

339
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:19.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: All right, next we have some secret news that I have not told what Kevin is happening about. So okay.

340
00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:15.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Secret news.

341
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.759
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I can't know about it.

342
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:34.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Kevin, do you remember, I feel like it was earlier this year, maybe it was late last year. We were given news of a mobile sock in a game.

343
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.400
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:27.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh.

345
00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:30.920
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. No. No.

346
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: All right.

347
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:42.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And at the time, we had no indication as to whether it was going to be coming out outside of Japan.

348
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.319
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, I like it this time!

349
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:50.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: They've announced the release date for the game is next week, fifth of February. And.

350
00:25:49.500 --> 00:26:02.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: we still don't have confirmation as to whether it's coming outside of Japan. However, the app store entry for the game lists two languages, Japan and English Japanese and English.

351
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.559
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Okay. That is...

352
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:10.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So there is a distinct possibility that the day after this episode comes out, the new sack in a game comes out and is available in a game.

353
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.819
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Well, think at least it is possible for me to play

354
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.700
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: This is the mobile one. I will now share with you the link to the Play Store for the game.

355
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.920
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: We're talking about the mobile one, right?

356
00:26:20.599 --> 00:26:22.599
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yes

357
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.700
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The Play Store one doesn't mention English, but presumably if it's in English,

358
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:40.599
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: App Store is on Play Store as well, but I don't think they just don't have the thing for sharing language on that.

359
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:44.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm presumably that's because it's not released yet or something. I don't know.

360
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Wherever it doesn't say

361
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.319
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: but yeah, that's a thing the about the game is also has English language in it

362
00:26:48.500 --> 00:27:02.259
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Okay. Oh, man. Oh, man. I'm, uh, well, I'm double excited because well, one, even if I doesn't get a proper

363
00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.079
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So we there you go

364
00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:10.900
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: English release, um, uh, it's, uh, you know, it'll be English, it'll be somewhat accessible. Right.

365
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.359
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: You could do that thing where you're playing and you have like, was it Google Live Translate

366
00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:21.319
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: on another device and you're seeing the translations, I've done that before.

367
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah

368
00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:25.099
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's a very awkward way to play, but...

369
00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:23.940
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, we got that we got that

370
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.859
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Or or are we past the age where there's the the game facts translation

371
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:39.980
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Where somebody posts the whole game translation on the game facts. We I think we are but anyways

372
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Look, there's there's there's war. There's hope. There's a sliver of hope

373
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Anyways, yeah Wilson

374
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.559
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But also means we've got some screenshots of the game now as well.

375
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:59.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, it's it says chibi looking QTR. I don't know what's going on. It looks honestly. I'll know joke

376
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.240
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: [laughing]

377
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I think it might be a roguelike

378
00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:05.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Because you got a party

379
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.460
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, it's alright, I wasn't gonna play it anyway, because it's not like I enjoyed the first game.

380
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:12.779
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, fine fine fair, but there's a lot of numbers. There's a party

381
00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: [laughing]

382
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's like, "Oh, no, they took a game I didn't like and made it more than I didn't like!"

383
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Let's just tell if I work and on this that's interesting

384
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.720
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That there's a non-zero chance Godzilla will show up

385
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: They also I don't know whether this is just like a translation thing, but they appear to have renamed to it was Henuka's pilgrimage.

386
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I know it seems to be Henuka's spirit journey, but that might just be a weird translation issue and it actually is pilgrimage because a spirit journey is a pilgrimage, like that's what it is.

387
00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That sounds

388
00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:47.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that's what it sounds like translation labels

389
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:56.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So yeah, if they do, if they do release it in English presumably will have a properly translated name on the actual store at some point.

390
00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:54.859
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah

391
00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.819
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: So I'm double excited because obviously yeah, this is cool and thrilling. There might be a chance

392
00:29:02.099 --> 00:29:06.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But also because I was just Google trying to find the news as we brought it up

393
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I forgot they're also working on on the

394
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:17.200
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: another game on Coca-Cola, marvelous. I don't remember that, but I just saw that and like, oh, I forgot about that. I'm excited.

395
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.400
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And there was also one other thing is that they've said this, there is a steam version of the game coming at some point in the future as well.

396
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:49.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Ooh! All right, I probably will play this at some point. To tune in for the full Let's Play, where I I rope Liam into translate for me live as I blame. I love sucking. All right. Next up, water is wet. It's cold outside in the US.

397
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:55.960
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: all right yeah yeah so so okay so uh it looks like concern tape got fed up of

<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: people talking about the game and he's like I want to chocolates here that is

399
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.039

<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: working like always.

402
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.579

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:32.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Hey, everyone. Good news. I've been very productive lately on Honda Chocolate here. Here's a screenshot of what looks like a fishing shop of some kind or something like that. Maybe not fishing. It's got a workbench and we've got some stuff on the wall, but there's a Marlin on the wall.

404
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:42.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: A guy that looks like he could be the, or what's his name, the guy who runs the monster thing in Stardew.

405
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.839
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, yeah, he's got an eye patch. I forget the the guy outside the mines. I forget his name

406
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Adventurers Guild.

407
00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that's the one

408
00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:53.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But he has a hoodie now, um, I don't remember those that is name

409
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:59.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Marlon. Apparently that's his name. So is that just, I don't know, because it's not just

410
00:30:55.559 --> 00:31:00.599
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, so is it that guy is he connected universe?

411
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:05.819
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: the eye patch. It's also, it's also he's got the same facial hair. And the eye, yeah,

412
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It does and the eye patch that is pretty specific

413
00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:10.140
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: he could, and there's a Marlon above him. So it's not a hint that this is actually Marlon.

414
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:21.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Huh? That'd be fun. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! (laughs) That's what we do?

415
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:22.940
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Am I reading too much into this? Probably. Then he says, yep, it's take.

416
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:28.940
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: it's taking a while to finish the game. That's okay. Spelt incorrectly. Then we have another screenshot

417
00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:35.259
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: of the player character at a little pond with a waterfall going into it. And it looks like we're

418
00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:37.019
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: being attacked by a bear.

419
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Okay, to be clear this is not a big giant grizzly bear. It looks like a small round thing

420
00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.599
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But does look like a bit technically it's from behind it could be a different animal front who knows, but it is bear as those bear ears

421
00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:55.299
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: They're oh wait. No, they have the animation underneath. That's

422
00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.240
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's a it's

423
00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:05.279
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: What's a it's a chunk but bear. That's what it is. It's a round thing with legs and ears. That's what it is. There's no neck

424
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.099
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we got a little 3D version.

425
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's the head body thing

426
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's what it looks like a bare thing right

427
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.740
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's a bare head with a tail and legs.

428
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:17.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, that's what it looked that that's what it is. You're being attacked by that you're holding up a stick

429
00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:20.180
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know what that's doing in this situation, but

430
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.299
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It looks like you've been like taken you've been shocked by this like you've got like oh no

431
00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:31.299
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, or you're telling it to go to the left you're trying to direct the bears and it is a work shake take your pig

432
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.880
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Then he says I know I know I shouldn't have announced the game so early, but I had my reasons I

433
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, he was excited

434
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Suspect those reasons are well. Yeah, so the reasons one is excited and two because if we know about the game

435
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.079
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It makes them work quicker theoretically, but who knows

436
00:32:46.859 --> 00:32:48.859
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Nah

437
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.880
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And then we have some portrait

438
00:32:48.859 --> 00:32:51.380
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Game the greatest motivator of all

439
00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:08.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: and sprites of the three characters, including the one in the shop that we saw before, which the beard is more fuller than this than Marlon's one. So maybe it's not Marlon, but he does look very similar.

440
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:20.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Like I just I feel like it is too similar not to be related in some way. He just literally just like Marlon with more beard and a hood-up.

441
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:49.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But no, I don't think it is because the hood would do that to the hair. He just looks so, he also looks very suspicious. We then have a blonde-haired lady with a green dress on, who I mean, will be the, you know, archetype of a specific kind of person in the town.

442
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And that the hair is slightly different, but I can't be art related, I don't know, but it's like it.

443
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I guess so, it does feel a lot like Marlin.

444
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's his brother, Marlin, with an eye.

445
00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:08.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: You know, presumably some, she'll be somebody's daughter, and then we have a judge or, I don't know, he's waiting judge here.

446
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.579
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, we'll see well, she made a dateable. I don't know

447
00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:57.619
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yep

448
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:59.619
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, I

449
00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:02.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Thought it was like a botler

450
00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:08.219
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: He looks he's he looks like a party at judge hair powdered wig with the curls on the side

451
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:21.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah. I mean, maybe, maybe like Thomas Jefferson.

452
00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:12.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't know somebody, you know, not pompous, but

453
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.579
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, something like that. Yeah, it does look like it could be Thomas Jefferson in the game

454
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:29.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I would not, I would not vote again, then I would not bet against that.

455
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh

456
00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:28.219
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, no, I wouldn't either. Yeah, no, all right

457
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:47.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And then he says to debunk a few myths and false assumptions I've seen, quote, haunted chocolate here will be abandoned and the content will be added to Stardew Valley instead. No, first, first, I am not going to abandon haunted chocolate here, but even if I did, I'm not going to add it to Stardew Valley, Stardew Valley and haunted chocolate here separate games.

458
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.980
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It doesn't even make, this is such a developer way of saying.

459
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It doesn't even make sense from a technical perspective as something to talk with here is written from scratch.

461
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's not the same engine as Stardew Valley, you can't just copy and paste onto chocolate ear into Stardew Valley.

462
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.059
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That's a lie. We all know that's a lie.

463
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I just, I just love that he's like, I couldn't even do it if I wanted to.

464
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm not, I'm not going to, I don't want to, but even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

465
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I love all these. Love all these questions.

466
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Quote, the Stardew Valley updates are being used to test out ideas for haunted chocolate ear. Nope.

467
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: When, when working, I just love that he's just like, all I, I'm just going to, I'm just going to call you all out here.

468
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Nope, when working on Stardew Valley, I'm not thinking about haunted chocolate ear and vice versa.

469
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I wouldn't test something out in Stardew Valley because that would be unfair to Stardew Valley.

470
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And also, I don't want to spoil ideas for haunted chocolate ear, but adding them first to Stardew Valley.

471
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Also, Stardew Valley is a different game. So you can't really test something for a haunted chocolate ear in an accurate way.

472
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: accurate weight. This makes it sound like it's going to be more significantly different

473
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: from starchy than people might have been expecting.

474
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:59.219
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Well, I mean, here's the thing in on all reality. Like in all honesty. So I mean, no, he's dedicated his life to start you or whatever

475
00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:04.980
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But this is his first second game. So what that means we don't actually know. So

476
00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:12.260
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Mm-hmm. Also, Stardew has so much like, you know, that could mean anything for a sequel, you know

477
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:15.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: can set quote concern yeah yeah well true quote concern tape is working on a new

478
00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:19.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: starchy valley update because he's burnt out and haunted chocolate here no I'm

479
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.219
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: working on a new starchy valley update because it's a very popular game with a

480
00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:26.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: large ever-growing playerbase and I still have additional ideas under for how to

481
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:31.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: improve it and quote concern tape says it's not coming out until 2030 I didn't

482
00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:35.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: say that I was asked in 2025 if it would come out within the next five

483
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:40.260
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: said I hope so this is very different than saying it's coming out in 2030

484
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: the bottom line is I don't want to give a release date the game will come out

485
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.659
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: when it's done anyway the only thing that really matters is that I keep

486
00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:52.579
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: making progress on the game and release so I'm going to get back to doing that now

487
00:36:52.579 --> 00:36:57.539
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: thank you ape TLDR I'm alive the game is still in development and it will come

488
00:36:57.539 --> 00:37:02.659
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: out when it's ready thank you for your patience which it definitely feels

489
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And search.

490
00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:06.579
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: passive aggressive there. The whole post is the whole post is

491
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:15.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And certain day versus the internet, it's incredible.

492
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: shot up and let me make the game and then he says thank you for your patience.

493
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:23.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Okay, so again, in the big scheme of things, we've gotten almost nothing still in terms of information on the game.

494
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Just a few more screenshots and peaks and stuff.

495
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.059
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But you know what? You know what I find really, but it's still like the most he's ever said on the

496
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.679
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: game it feels like, um, and you know what's really funny and all this, not a

497
00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:43.199
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: crop of crocklet to be seen. Not a drop!

498
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.340
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Hmm. Interesting. I suspect that's deliberate. It doesn't want to give away how the chocolate

499
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.199
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Does it want to give away the in-depth chocolate making mechanics, which

500
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:59.280
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: stuff works. Like, these screenshots are very, very particular and chosen to not give

501
00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:55.320
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: probably actually is very true. I say that snarkly, but

502
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:10.019
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: anything away while also giving you something. So yeah, I, I

503
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.820
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I don't see ghosts either unless it's the gross of Thomas Jefferson

504
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.519
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I mean, I don't think we've got any new information here, except from the screenshots

505
00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:20.199
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: because we were all just assuming that anyway, right? Sensible people were just assuming

506
00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:25.420
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: all of this stuff that he can't stop doing stardew because he just can't stop himself,

507
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yes. Oh, yeah.

508
00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:31.199
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: that he clearly just wants to make the game. He announced it too early, but that's just

509
00:38:31.199 --> 00:38:37.340
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: what he does, right? Like, he announced stardew 1.7 and we know it's not coming out this

510
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.679
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: This is yeah, yeah

511
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.940
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: here, right? Like he just announces things to

512
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: us. And then he says, "Hey, I'm going to go to the

513
00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:54.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And the funny thing is unlike say the the silk song people which were you know different story begin part because money had been given to them up front

514
00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:03.039
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: you know and Sunday delivers like clearly he delivers consistently and constantly like you know you and I

515
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:15.880
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: being reasonable level headed like we know he's gonna deliver and we're not doubting any of this but it is just it's funny to see. It's funny to see people screaming crying the internet and he's just so fed up be responding. Oh

516
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.800
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, I love that this has it's been five years now since he announced it right and he's and he's finally got to the point when he can't deal with people anymore

517
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.400
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And he's just like oh my word would you just let me play the game?

518
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: You know, oh

519
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.280
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Sorry four and a half

520
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Okay, you know what here's

521
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:40.260
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: This just makes me think of random question. We probably discussed it before, but you know looking at it now where we are

522
00:39:40.539 --> 00:39:41.739
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: five years in

523
00:39:41.739 --> 00:39:48.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: How big do you think this game is like is it gonna be start-to-base or is it gonna be start-to-base plus a couple of updates?

524
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:59.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: ooh, that's a good question. So obviously, as he says, they are not the same game and so therefore trying to be like, oh, it'll have this feature or whatever doesn't make any sense, right?

525
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah

526
00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.920
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

527
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:10.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But based on the fact that they'll presumably both be life sims of some kind and obviously systems will be different, but also can kind of be the same in some way.

528
00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.119
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah

529
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I, I suspect there are a lot of like quality of life features that might be the same.

530
00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's actually a rhythm game

531
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:27.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It might exist in Stardew that I don't think he could realistically feel like he could release the game without them because they're something that you would expect.

532
00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:21.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Sure

533
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:37.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: However, in terms of like, obviously most of the like story and stuff is specific to Stardew, so it wouldn't make any sense to be like, oh, well, it has this much.

534
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I feel like map wise, it's got to be at least as big as Stardew because of how he's kind of expected.

535
00:40:47.000 --> 00:41:05.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question.

536
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:54.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Mm-hmm. Sounds to me like he lied and he's just using Stardew to test for schmuck. (laughs)

537
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: [laughs]

538
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:06.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. I'm curious, 'cause I, when did he start working on Stardew? I don't do we know that? I don't know.

539
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:14.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: 2014 I think is what he said is written here. He did right. Give me two seconds. It is on Wikipedia with like a.

540
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.199
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, because at the very least, it feels like a shorter gap between starting and starting

541
00:41:19.199 --> 00:41:20.639
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: to its release, you know?

542
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:33.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, so might be 20 or 11 no 20 he's so he publicly announced it in 2012 and then first version came out in 2016, right? So that's four years

543
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.400
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Which, yeah. So, so, so I make you wonder like.

544
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But he so 2012 was when he announced it, but he

545
00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:50.539
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: graduated from University in 2011 and wasn't able to get a job so presumably in 2011 at some point as

546
00:41:50.500 --> 00:42:00.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: when he started if he announced it in 2012, so we're talking five years from starting to release and

547
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.260
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, so.

548
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.659
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Okay, so.

549
00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:05.300
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: we're near we're a four and a half years from announcement at this point and obviously he was

550
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:12.579
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: working on it before announcement. So it's definitely be in development longer, much longer than

551
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:18.719
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: yeah so when it when it releases in 2030 like you said um it's going to be three times as much

552
00:42:12.579 --> 00:42:23.099
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: starchy. I do.

553
00:42:18.719 --> 00:42:23.119
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: development so it has to be at least three times as big of that logic

554
00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:31.780
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I just feel like if you're going to if you're going to go if you're going to go for 2030 just wait an extra year and have it on the 10th anniversary of the announcement, right? Like at that point.

555
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:49.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, dude. You know, it was the worst one of those ever. Final fantasy 15 came out in 2016, if I recall correctly, which was right in between the year, you know, 2015, which would have been appropriate, right?

556
00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:01.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And 2017, which was the 30th anniversary of Final Fantasy. It's just an original, I think it was originally meant for 2015, but to get the land, but it.

557
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:11.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: was really funny. They don't miss both. Anyways, anyways, yeah. Oh, soccer.

558
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.579
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Anyway, yeah, haunted chocolate here. Still in development. Not abandoned.

559
00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:20.980
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: We also have one new game to talk about. This is called fossil quest. You have always dreamt

560
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.860
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: This is my apico!

561
00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.980
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: of creating your own dinosaur museum. I'm just talking to Kevin here, right?

562
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I have!

563
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.340
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yes, I have!

564
00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:32.739
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And now you finally have the space to do it. That's not true. Dig for fossils,

565
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.099
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Finally!

566
00:43:32.739 --> 00:43:34.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Assemble your exhibits and create.

567
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The museum of your dreams in this relaxing wholesome life set.

568
00:43:39.019 --> 00:43:39.739
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

569
00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:42.300
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That is very exciting!

570
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's basically the, it's the museum from Animal Crossing. The game.

571
00:43:43.099 --> 00:43:43.900
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: So, I was...

572
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, and I'm down for...

573
00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:56.760
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But, but you get, but the digging mechanic looks quite, kind of, how do I describe this? It looks

574
00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:02.440
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: kind of like, what was that game? What was the digging game? Like, old arcade digging game?

575
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:30.900
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'm getting dog, guys, but say, yeah, that's what I'm playing to go, to be honest. But I have played special. There's a deep butt. Are you familiar with Spectro's out? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my gosh, we're gonna get a minute. So I got Spectros. Okay. Originally, first one, I think was. No, Spectro's it's a game.

576
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It's another one I'm talking about. Dig-Dog.

577
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It looks like dig-dog.

578
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.300
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: How's that? Is that spec-trass? Is that what you're saying?

579
00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.659
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Spell it for me?

580
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:45.219
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: P, E, C, E, R, O, B, E, let's expect. And then, yeah, yeah, there was a game made by Disney. It's a Disney IP of all things back when they were trying to do video games.

581
00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.820
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Oh, spec-trubs, right? Okay, cool. Got you. Got you.

582
00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:50.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And it was a monster collector, but you got the monsters by digging up fossils.

583
00:44:51.219 --> 00:45:01.139
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: And the fossil mechanic, very similar to this, because you, you know, you rotate the cameras like 3D and you're digging off the bits and dirt and the rock off the actual fossil part.

584
00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:19.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Anyways, I'm, I'm madly in love with this. So I have a deep, like, we all know Spencer's is the dinosaur kaiju man, but like, I don't talk about it that much, but I still have deep, deep passion for dinosaurs and fossils and dinosaurs. I said it twice, but I don't care.

585
00:45:21.099 --> 00:45:32.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'm so excited by this. This, this genuinely excited of organizing fossils, like, they show that like, organize as, as you know, the highlight and like, yeah, yeah, I don't want to organize.

586
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:50.900
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's a fun fact. One of, I would say one of my most prized material possessions. I actually have a triceratops room before triceratops room fossil. Yeah, good, good stuff. I'm excited.

587
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:55.619
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Cool. I have one of those, um, uh, obviously fake ones that you got, like, like a, like a

588
00:45:55.619 --> 00:46:01.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: thing is, um, I can't even remember what it's called. It's like the little, kind of fan-shaped

589
00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:06.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: fossil, I can't remember, but it's, it's like clearly a mass-produced fake version of it,

590
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:19.760
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited though. Like, the game looks relatively small and

591
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.460
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: rather than an agile, because you're like, you have like a hundred of them sitting in a box at a

592
00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.340
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Museum tape.

593
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.880
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: scale or whatever, but I don't care. Like, I will say the fossil parts look very detailed. Like,

594
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.280
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: you know, they're going all in on descriptions and when you get up close, it looks very detailed

595
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:35.920
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: visually. Um, as opposed to like the more, you know, QT zoomed out the posy life symbol.

596
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.480
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Part where you're running the museum. But, um, yeah, this looks like a game made by people who

597
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.199
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: will care about fossils. And you know what? That's red. Let's do it. When's it coming out? Do we have a date?

598
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.219
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: We do not. Oh, yes, that's what I meant to say about this this in at

599
00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.619
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: What they say in the description. Let me find it for you. This game

600
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.179
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: early stages of the battle.

601
00:46:57.099 --> 00:47:00.019
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: There's fossil quest is in his early stages of development

602
00:47:00.019 --> 00:47:03.539
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: We currently have a public free prototype on itch where you can play and send us feedback

603
00:47:03.539 --> 00:47:05.780
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: We'll be updating the prototype when you content

604
00:47:06.019 --> 00:47:09.820
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Periodically the game is being made by a small husband and wife team

605
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.739
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Which I can't get over the idea of it being a team of small of a small husband and wife

606
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And it's completely independent and self-funded

607
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: There's a post of the large teams of husbands.

608
00:47:20.519 --> 00:47:38.659
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: You'll go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that part, too, or just the husband is small.

609
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:27.300
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: No, no, no, not the not large team large not small team small husband and small wife in a team

610
00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.940
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I just couldn't get over the idea that's what they were saying like oh, we're the team of a small husband and a small wife

611
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.380
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: So I will I will include

612
00:47:38.659 --> 00:47:45.659
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's a good sport, J. It's actually what you're referring to.

613
00:47:41.059 --> 00:47:43.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: A small husband and a large wife I

614
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:51.340
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Will include the link to the itch page as well if anybody wants to try out the demo

615
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:55.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Good, because I am very me, that is actually probably going to be me.

616
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, yeah.

617
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, look, I know game dev is hard.

618
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I want you guys to do well, but I'm going to be, you know, holding it.

619
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: I'm going to be pressuring them.

620
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: This one can't die.

621
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.139
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: [laughs]

622
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: No, not this one.

623
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: This is my haunted chocolate here.

624
00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:12.460
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Oh, righty.

625
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.539
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: That's-- well, that's the news.

626
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.340
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: [laughs]

627
00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:18.039
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Woo.

628
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Woo-hoo, we did it.

629
00:48:18.039 --> 00:48:20.420
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I think Hunter Chocolate here is only taking as long

630
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.260
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, I don't see it.

631
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.219
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: as it does because Stardew made him so much money.

632
00:48:23.219 --> 00:48:25.980
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Right, like Stardew had to be made quicker

633
00:48:23.659 --> 00:48:24.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah.

634
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:26.940
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: because he needed money.

635
00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: [laughs]

636
00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:30.039
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: [laughs]

637
00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:34.179
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: All right, I'm going to talk about the Bubblegum Galaxy demo.

638
00:48:34.179 --> 00:48:36.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: We talked about this couple of times here.

639
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:58.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The game is coming out on the 12th of March in which we talked about the last episode, but they do have a demo available now, and it's it's a pretty contained demo, and maybe spent about an hour, an hour and a half and completed the content on the demo.

640
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, this one!

641
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:06.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: It is got two parts to it as we know there's the like kind of puzzle game with the hexagons that you're putting together.

642
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:22.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: And then there's the you are a person in a world going around an office and basically the concept is that this is your job your job is to make these planets with these hexagons on your computer.

643
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:36.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The actual there's much more of the actual puzzle gameplay than there is the rest of the game in the demo, and the demo basically starts off with you getting.

644
00:49:36.500 --> 00:50:00.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The tutorial and then at the end of the tutorial your gate your computer crashes and that's the kind of majority of the story outside of the puzzles is you're like, oh no, the computer's crash you have to go and talk to people in the office and then you can then start like someone resets the system and you can start doing the puzzle the get the planets again.

645
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:06.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: There's not a huge amount to that the rest of that story in the demo, but I'm guessing there's more.

646
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:13.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: To that in the actual game like it feels like it's set up to actually have some sort of story.

647
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:24.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But I'm not really sure why it feels almost like, so do you remember my complaints about Mario Rabbid's games.

648
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:26.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: the movement felt weird, didn't it, very far?

649
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:36.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, so basically I loved the actual like X-Con battle style battles that you did right they were really fun, but then you had to between all of those levels you had to like do this.

650
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah. Oh, the puzzle part, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yes.

651
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:48.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: another version of the game which is where you're traveling through this world and bad platforming and weird puzzles just to get to the next part of the game that I actually enjoyed and I really kind of feels like that.

652
00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Bad platforming. Yeah.

653
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, remember that.

654
00:50:48.500 --> 00:51:02.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Well, you're just like here's a here's a list of puzzles that you can do and then after you've done one you get to run around an office for a while before you do the next one and it just it seems a little bit disconnected.

655
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.460
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But it's possibly very little of it was

656
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:13.380
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: required, right? Like after the tutorial, you're required to go and talk to a bunch of people before you can do any more, but the rest of them

657
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:19.019
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I generally could just jump into the next level straight away. So maybe it's not really the same the same

658
00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:25.739
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: The I don't know it's hard to know without playing the full game. I did enjoy the puzzles

659
00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:32.059
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: and I do feel like it's probably not something that could grab me for an entire game

660
00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.460
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: but the puzzles are, the idea behind it is.

661
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:42.420
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: You have these tiles, you get like three at a time and you have to decide where to put them on your board and

662
00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:48.599
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: There's like a limited number of puzzles of tiles you get throughout your whole puzzle

663
00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:52.199
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But you only have three at a time, right? And you go, this is the one I'm gonna put down and

664
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:58.760
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Then you have you have to get specific achievements, right? You have to have like

665
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: certain number of

666
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: flowers or a certain size of grid or you have to

667
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.619
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: feel like connect to points or some tiles are glitched and you can fix them by

668
00:52:11.619 --> 00:52:15.659
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: completely surrounding them so you have to like fix three glitches or there's a

669
00:52:15.659 --> 00:52:19.159
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: whole bunch of like possible things that you can do and to complete the

670
00:52:19.159 --> 00:52:23.820
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: puzzle you have to do them all without running out of tiles and then obviously

671
00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.860
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: your score is based on how many tiles you have left at the end and also every

672
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.900
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: tile you put down has a certain amount of score based on like connecting similar

673
00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.179
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: things right so if you got flowers on one tile you want to have another tile

674
00:52:35.179 --> 00:52:38.380
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: next to it that also has

675
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: the sun. So you can get the idea of what the puzzle.

676
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:48.699
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I imagine so something like that right clever lay out basically the puzzle of game

677
00:52:50.099 --> 00:52:52.099
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Which I'm I'm down for that sense

678
00:52:53.579 --> 00:52:55.579
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That sounds fun

679
00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:00.780
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Like overall like I this is the thing we're just talking about it demo, right?

680
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:06.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: It's hard to to fully gauge with the full-scale the ink because I still think there's a lot of

681
00:53:07.019 --> 00:53:10.460
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Just from the visual like the trailer, I still think the

682
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:16.420
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: almost 3DS looking visuals of the the you know office part is charming and that being

683
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: engaging sure probably could be a good character writing but I don't know if that's going to be

684
00:53:20.019 --> 00:53:26.500
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: the case so I don't know it's hard to say and I imagine how I can feel very disgoing to it right because

685
00:53:27.139 --> 00:53:32.340
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: you know you're not seeing like the puzzle parts just a completely different screen everything else is

686
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:38.820
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: gone so I get how that can feel disjointed and it's it's totally tricky to make you know balance it

687
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.719
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: that make it feel, you know.

688
00:53:41.099 --> 00:53:44.260
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: integrated well or whatever, so that's that's a tough ask, but

689
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:51.820
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But again, it's just just to them all right. So fingers still crossed. Um, I mean at least it works, right?

690
00:53:54.739 --> 00:54:03.019
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: We're really certain some bass line benchmarks here. Um, I'd be curious on my one try the puzzle enough says me send

691
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.280
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: it's it's it's definitely a fun enough demo to play I think it's if it makes you think at all

692
00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:20.039
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: like this then you know would be would be good and it's kind of self-contained enough that you're

693
00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:25.480
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: not going to feel like you have to put in hours and hours to get an idea of what it is like

694
00:54:26.039 --> 00:54:32.920
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: it's you've not got much more than an hour in in the game in the demo to complete all

695
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: the content you can I think then you can replay the levels and try and get higher scores and

696
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:48.920
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: stuff like that so you could put in more hours into it if you wanted but

697
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.599
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Sure sure. Yeah, I will see I guess the hope is

698
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Like and the puzzles are good enough. It sounds like they're solid enough like I

699
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.539
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Just hope that it doesn't feel like it should have just been a list of puzzles, you know

700
00:54:55.219 --> 00:54:57.219
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: The other parts good enough

701
00:54:57.219 --> 00:54:58.860
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: The office part

702
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:02.260
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Why are you cat with the house on your head? Is that explaining that demo?

703
00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:03.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: No.

704
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.619
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Start probably will never be explained. That's fine, but I was curious

705
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Yeah, it's fun.

706
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:19.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I do, as I say, I'm unsure as to whether I would be wanting to play a full version of this game.

707
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But I guess that's always my problem with puzzle games, right?

708
00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:29.500
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I start puzzle games and I do a bunch of them and then I'm like, okay, I get the concept done now.

709
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.739
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: - You know.

710
00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.579
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah sure fair enough. I saw.

711
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:37.159
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But if you like puzzle games, it seems like if you like puzzle games,

712
00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:41.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: download the demo, see if it's enough puzzle-y for you, I think.

713
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.519
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, all right.

714
00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:47.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Alright, I think that's everything to say about it, because it's just a demo, as you see.

715
00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:47.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Oh, it's just a demo.

716
00:55:48.519 --> 00:55:51.320
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: But fun to get an idea.

717
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: That's, that's the thing, the big asterisk on the whole situation.

718
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:58.599
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm trying to play more demos, because I feel like if you play a demo, it feels like you get an idea of the game without...

719
00:55:59.679 --> 00:56:01.699
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: I'm more likely to buy a game and not play it.

720
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:07.280
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Where is I? I'm more likely to actually play a demo, so we're going to try and play more demos this year.

721
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:13.960
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that's that's a good point. That's great. We look at it. Yeah, demos are good. That's off to the people who make

722
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.340
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: - Agreed.

723
00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.699

784
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:12.059
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Like that was a banger year and I think that's kind of what really kick started a whole Pokemon day thing because they were kind of doing before

01:00:12.059 --> 01:00:18.139
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: But that's when they're like no, we're locking in so yeah expectations are gonna be big so here. Here's my guess

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
<v D60562D6-0D2F-4408-B8D6-98C29C5679A9>Al: Possibly possible

789
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.860
<v DEA507AD-D6F5-4D6F-A697-C182C0CC1EF7>Kevin: Unless they are now Pokemon separate or not tuning for the episode
