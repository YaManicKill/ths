<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: All right, well, if you want, well, I don't think it's not really covering two topics.

<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And if Kevin hasn't looked through the news don't look through the news now because I want to I want to see your reaction to one of them without you

34
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.259
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: But first of all Kevin what have you been asking?

35
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:16.699
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Uh, well, okay. Uh, discounty, actually, um, man, discount is one of those games. Like,

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sometimes we're forced to play a game to talk about it, or you know how it is, right?

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.719
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Forced is that it for a force feels a little harsh, but yeah

39
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Well, no, yeah, yeah, maybe it's a little harsh, but we sometimes we play it longer than what we would have otherwise, right?

40
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yes, yes, that's fair, that's fair.

41
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sometimes we say I like I want to get through a little more, so I have more thoughts, right?

42
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: This county is not that kind of game. I am playing this county and I am enjoying it now.

43
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: No, it is wild because it is actually competing with another game. I started this week. Um, have you heard of this game called the legends, the Z a.

45
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'll have you heard of it.

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Uh, yes, I have. You've bought it, have you?

47
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:14.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I have. I am now switch to man person with the Z a. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Well, a lot of big changes over here. Um, yeah.

48
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.439
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Wow.

49
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.159
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Wait, so this, is this, is this a your switch to or have you stolen Calvin switch to?

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

53
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Finally, finally, I did it before it doubles in price.

54
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, thank you, AI for everything. Okay. Okay. So I'm okay. I'll be honest, I skipped a lot of the episodes like the greenhouse

55
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: we guys talked about it and I listened to the discourse but not have partaken in it. So I'm sure I'm just gonna be covering old ground at this point.

56
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I just beat the second

57
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: second trio of mega evolutions, I'm about to fight evil or I vote or whatever is named fighting

58
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: clan to give an idea where I am.

59
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Man, boy, this is a game of what feels like extremes, right? A lot of great stuff, a lot of

60
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: not great stuff, right? And it's not that it's awful, but

62
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the worst part about this game is they feel like it feels like they're just

63
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: continuously shooting themselves in the foot, right? Just kneecapping themselves.

64
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:25.660
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I wouldn't say, yeah, yeah, I would describe it as great moments and bizarre decisions.

65
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Bye!

66
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah. So I have heard whispers on the wind that, and you might have discussed this already,

67
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.120
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I don't know, but positively, they were originally planning a year, another year production for this,

68
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:48.720
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: but of development or whatever, but from the the the powers that be higher up, meaning Nintendo,

69
00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:54.079
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: they were told to now we got to we got to bring us really your earlier than you thought,

70
00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.939
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And that would explain a lot.

71
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.899
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But I don't you know, that's hearsay that's a rumor. I don't know if it's true, but it sure feels like it because they got a lot of great stuff, but not a lot of room to use it, right?

72
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:15.300
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But yeah, I mean, again, I'll just try to go quickly. I'm not to get too deep in it. Right. The battle systems. It's all right. I think it's a little hectic, little chaotic.

73
00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:21.199
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: My wish I could be a little more fine tuning. I want out of it, but it's fine. I like it. It's good.

74
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.920
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The part rooftop are occurring probably the best part of the game, right?

75
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:38.639
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The game is fast snappy, overall not as good as Arceus in my opinion, but overall it's still good.

76
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:55.160
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Lumiose is a rough place to be in because they have to recapture the 3DS Lumiose and so it's kind of small and scale and not that it's not memorable, it's hard to...

77
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:25.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: In a moment, I don't know where I am in the city, let's say that, right? I'm much more guided by the minimap than the actual layout of the city, which is kind of unfortunate, but Pokemon is certainly not the only game guilty of that, so yeah, I say lovey, but hey, all those new Mega Pokemon, they're cool, I like that, I'm just trying to think here, it's really funny how like, you know, in Pokemon games,

78
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:39.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: it plays battling competitive, the items usually are an important thing, I don't know what item I'm gonna get my Pokemon, in this game it's all, it's all just Mega Stones, it's literally what Mega Stones do I want to my team?

79
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:55.800
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Because I think the little bar, the systems fill it up, I think it's fun. Yeah, I'll give it one thumbs up, maybe not two, but it's just, yeah, there's, like I said,

80
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: rolling decisions, or unfortunate restrictions, whatever it may be, but...

81
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.720
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, we don't need we don't need to get into that like, you know, I love people love to be like, oh, it's so in so's pro issue

82
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.360
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It's this person's so whatever. I don't we don't need to get into that right like it's the same thing with like Pokemon goal

83
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

84
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

85
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

86
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.399
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I when I complain about obviously not Niantic anymore when I complained about Niantic before

87
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:26.079
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I didn't care whether it was Niantic or whether it was the Pokemon company making decisions the point was I was complaining about the decisions, right?

88
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:50.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's a very fair point. Yeah. So whoever made those decisions. Yeah. Um, oh, I'm trying to think of few minor things. Um, one thing. So you know those mega rogue battles, um, or rogue makers, whatever. Um, I don't know. I'm a little torn on them. I think some of them are fun and creative. That may make a bayonet. That thing has hands. Um, that, that one's chaotic and a lot to keep. I enjoyed that.

89
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So shut up

90
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: that. But it's not.

91
00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:04.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It is kind of not silly, but weird like you have a game that's kind of in part based on it's it's you know the verticality the actual environment right.

92
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:15.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And so to take that away during the megafights that's kind of I don't know I wish they would use that a little more. But but I haven't done them all so maybe that will happen I don't know.

93
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But what we'll see those megas are really big though. I like them. I like to make a vocal matter. Yeah.

94
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It's kind of all I've got so far.

95
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: At least one thumbs up. I am enjoying it. Oh, you know, okay here here's another little.

96
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'm not going to even say complaint, but it's an observation.

97
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think part of the poor design is because you know early on you're really railroaded in comic, right? Like you can't explore a lot of the city, but they also don't really tell you when it opens up.

98
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.980
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But I only have like maybe 15 hours in this game.

99
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.480
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I've just been belying and because that's what they kind of train me to at first and even without that

100
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.440
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I don't know. I just didn't feel much of a urge or itch. I wasn't incentivized to explore. Let's say that

101
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.600
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: because again

102
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.159
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Comparing to you know

103
00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:12.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: bit of an apple orange here, but I mean breath of the wild, right?

104
00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:20.759
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Your curiosities peaked you you go over there. You're get your bread crumb at times or you just see something cool off in the distance and you go explore

105
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Not feeling that in this game

106
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Which isn't the worst, but again, it's just it's just on top of everything. I don't know feels weird

107
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It feels weird to pay the most that this is probably arguably the most expensive vocal mind game for you know

108
00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:39.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Consumer what and it's probably smallest in scale

109
00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:45.720
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But but you know, hey the game works. I like it. It's this or you know

110
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I like the parts of it a lot of parts of it. I like TMZ. I'll say that. That's a cool crew

111
00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:51.919
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Mackie.

112
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:08.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I am happy to start.

113
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.059
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: [laughing]

114
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'm going to join the club.

115
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'll say that.

116
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Other than that, you know, just discounting.

117
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It's not even pulled any other street fighter character.

118
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You're sadly because Calvin has opens up to eight or nine.

119
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, that's because when he was born, he'd stole my look.

120
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Just in general.

121
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:44.740
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: what is going on. Well, I've been 3D printing. Not very much yet. So I'm literally just

122
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, that's all I got.

123
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: What about you?

124
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: What's going on?

125
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: What have you 3D printed?

126
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Tell me, that's cool.

127
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.840
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: like two hours ago. I did my first print because I've been putting off because like, you

128
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.919
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: know, just it's one of these things where you're just like, I need to just like do it.

129
00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:59.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And once you do it, then it's like, oh, now I must do all the all of the things, right?

130
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.940
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So, um, the first thing.

131
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I'm doing well, the very first print was just they have a bunch of like preloaded things and so I printed a boat, it was fun low boat, whatever, doesn't matter.

132
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.100
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: - Okay, okay, sure, sure, sure.

133
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Not the sort of thing I'm going to be printing much because it's just, it's just, you know, random nonsense you don't want just littering your house with.

134
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:31.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: But what I really want to do is, um, there's like organizational systems like grid finity is one of them that I'm looking into, which.

135
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:52.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: allows you to like you put this grid for like your drawers and then you can generate boxes and inserts and stuff that fit on top of that nicely and then you get it just makes organization much easier so I want to do that for a bunch of things so that's what I'm starting to do just now, but, um, so obviously going to take a wee bit.

136
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: That sounds like a great use 3D printing. It's warm and fun

137
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, that's that's that's that's pretty much what I've been doing so far. Not much. We'll see.

138
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I guess where that goes. Maybe I'll have more.

139
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.759
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: to an end next week, when he's printed his shelves, and then 3D printed all the figures that go on it or whatever.

140
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.240
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: [laughing]

141
00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:19.360
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He's 3D printed every other Pokemon that wasn't turned into the the Pokemon Quest Cube 4.

142
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.820
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: - Yeah.

143
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.620
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, what else?

144
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.440
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Well, 28 years later, the Bone Temple, I watched that.

145
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And it's great, I love it, you should go watch it,

146
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.840
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: it's great.

147
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'm just I'm amazed and baffle, but not like but in a good way like

148
00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:43.879
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: That we get this sequel years later and it's kind of fitting because of the name

149
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:49.200
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It wasn't the exact number, but you know what I mean, and then they make a trilogy out of it

150
00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: That's that's kind of ballsy. I like I respect, you know, I tip my head toward that

151
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.080
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I didn't see the 28 months or whatever the second one was but

152
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:20.539
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: weeks. That's all right. You can skip that. It's fine. It's not it's not terrible. I think some people think it's terrible, but I don't think it's dreadful. I think there are definitely worse films, but I mean, just compared to 28 days and 28 years, I know the bone temple. I think it just it's it's it's on a completely different

153
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.720
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay

154
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.360
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I

155
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.039
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sure sure sure I even honestly 20 a days is the only one I've seen and at first I kind of hated it

156
00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:33.919
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But then I thought about it was like no wait. No wait. That was good actually. I thought about it. There's a message there good for that actually

157
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:35.740
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I really loved 28 years later.

158
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:44.700
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It was my favorite film of last year and I bone temple is I think I prefer 28 years later.

159
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh really that good

160
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.059
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I don't think this is quite as good but it's still very good and it definitely I think

161
00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:53.340
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: will be in my top 10 this year.

162
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.320
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: - Okay.

163
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.340
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: favorite film of the year so far, but we are only three weeks in.

164
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:04.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So, it doesn't seem much yet, but no, really, very good.

165
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.799
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: - Rubik said.

166
00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:01.440
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: [laughing]

167
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: - Just County.

168

<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: What else?

172
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.740
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Pokémon, obviously.

173
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.220
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I have now done all of the side quests in the DLC.

174
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I just have five legendary Pokémon life to catch, and then I can be done.

175
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The side quests are fun. I can confirm. I've seen a few fun ones. The produce show is good.

176
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.960
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: just wait till you get to the DLC ones. I think they have some of the best, some of the best writing.

177
00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:37.080
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I hear it. They just kick it up a whole bunch. Yeah.

178
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:44.120
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yo, yo, how about that froki? You know, you see, you see finicking, you see chest pin and it's

179
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:51.799
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: whatever, but then froki. No, you go, go puzzle hard to earn froki. Best for the last,

180
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah

181
00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:53.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Anyways, go ahead.

182
00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:04.360
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And I have picked up Animal Crossing 3.0 updates and I have played a good 20 minutes of it

183
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um...

184
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's enough! Ha ha ha ha!

185
00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:08.899
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So I

186
00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:14.559
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Like so I feel like I'm gonna talk about we'll talk about this in more detail in a future episode

187
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.379
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Because I do want to dig in a bit more to it, but my my first

188
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:27.600
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: thoughts on it are very much like everything they've added to this game. It's a good addition, but I still don't want to play the game.

189
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:49.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, it feels like one of those updates and honestly with animal crossing, I think it's hard to get away from this but more of the same. That's what it would have I'm seeing but, but you know, yeah, that's kind of the challenge the animal crossing. It's kind of limited in scope.

190
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:55.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It's just very good. I would it does, but, but okay. Yeah, sure. That's fair.

191
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'm, we already know all fields.

192
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I already do.

193
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I didn't picked it up yet.

194
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:08.700
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's so I don't particularly care about the hotel, right?

195
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:16.220
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Because I've never, I'm never a huge decorator. But I do like how you can do the DIYs to get the

196
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:23.740
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: tickets instead to get the stuff that the, the, the, the let you get. Um, so that's good.

197
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:30.139
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Uh, the recetti's or recetti stuff is good. Um,

198
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, that seems like a good one.

199
00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:40.220
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I would like one, however, I would like one for, uh, what's it called? Um, landscaping,

200
00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.320
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Nuke your island.

201
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:47.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: terraforming. That's what they call it. I would like one for terraforming as well, because my island

202
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:58.379
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: is still half covered in water. Yeah. I just like, yeah, like get this area. I would like you to

203
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: hmm so would that be research reset to like default I guess

204
00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:01.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: just make it land or something like

205
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:10.700
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: that would be nice. That's all. What else? What else? What the other things they added? I mean

206
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.920
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, sure yeah, okay

207
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.299
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: all the new items and stuff. I think we've already had our opinions on them, right? I can't

208
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.960
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I I mean there's the crossover stuff right Zelda the Splatoon Lego

209
00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:19.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: remember what the other things they added were. Give me two seconds. This is the problem

210
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:26.579
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: with not having written it all up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Again, yeah, it's just it's all like there's

211
00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.900
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: not much to say about it, right? Like if you like it, you like it.

212
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.220
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The game sadly we did not get in game cube emulator

213
00:17:32.500 --> 00:18:00.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, the being able to use your home storage for DIY is great because especially with the addition of the hotel and the DIY requests that it makes, you can just like throw DIY bench next to where you put the items you make into for the hotel and just just do the stuff and because everything's in your house, you can just make everything you need to there and then, which is really nice.

214
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:08.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Oh, yeah, the the strafing very good. It does make the terraforming easier.

215
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.759
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I heard about that. I don't understand it. I'll just I'll see you when I see it.

216
00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:16.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um, yeah, that's what it.

217
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:29.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I think you'll understand when you try it, right? Because it's like, I've done many are terraforming where I've been like trying to get rid of the like a long line of water or a long line of cliff and you like you have to press the button and then you go right and then face the right direction.

218
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: direction since it's like an extra movement ever.

219
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:38.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: You want to move a square where as the strafing just means you just you just hold the button down and moves and it makes it

220
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah

221
00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:42.700
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And we doubt create animal crossing platforming challenge

222
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:58.339
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And I think I was all the big stuff. I think it's all as I say good updates, but I still

223
00:18:45.019 --> 00:18:48.700
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Probably not we'll give her three levels. We'll probably not

224
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:12.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh. Yeah. Oh, heavy. Yeah. Yeah.

225
00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:04.539
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: don't feel the need to play the game very much. So yeah, all the slumber islands. Yeah, that's

226
00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:10.019
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: another good one that I would definitely have used back. I mean, it is what it is, right?

227
00:19:10.019 --> 00:19:12.460
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I think it's, I think it's a good addition.

228
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.460
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I just wish I had to.

229
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:20.299
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I've existed before I wanted to turn my island into a water world and I just would have done that on this lumber island, you know.

230
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.259
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: [laughing]

231
00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:23.900
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Anyway, I think that's all I have on Animal Crossing just now.

232
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:31.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Hopefully we'll have a full episode on it later, but who knows, maybe we're both.

233
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.380
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: All right.

234
00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:28.660
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

235
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.880
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: As mandated by us.

236
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.140
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: [laughing]

237
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yes, what would that be Animal Crossing Episode Number 10 or something?

238
00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:37.099
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sure.

239
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Who knows.

240
00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:39.160
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The 10th harvest.

241
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.400
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: [laughing]

242
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.319
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: All right, should we get into some news?

243
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.880
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I guess so.

244
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:52.140
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: First up, Starstand Island. So some new

245
00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:54.819
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Which, okay, I genuinely do not remember which one that is now.

246
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:55.920
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: [laughing]

247
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.980
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It's the one that people seem to be very excited about for some reason even though it all just looks fine. Like I'm not there's nothing about it. The looks I

248
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Wait, is that the Japanese one?

249
00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:07.119
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Think maybe

250
00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:14.599
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, which is why we always get the news from it by like people posting about it because

251
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I think.

252
00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:17.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: They're not actually got any PR in English

253
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:25.559
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And half of the news we get is just by like Q&amp;A's on random Japanese YouTube channels

254
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.779
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

255
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.200
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, you're right. Okay, it is the Japanese one. Yeah, it is. Okay. Yeah, wait, there are robot cats in this game. I don't remember that

256
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:28.599
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: so

257
00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:32.599
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So

258
00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:38.599
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So this game is meant to be releasing in Q1 this year

259
00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:44.599
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: But it turns out that that release will be early access, which we did not know before

260
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Ah, the fine print! Ah!

261
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.200
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And the console releases will be coming later. So I it sounds like

262
00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:56.839
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: The game's not ready

263
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:09.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: but they didn't want to delay it so they're doing early access did I don't think yeah I don't think they wanted to do this so

264
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:06.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It sounds very much like the game's not right yet, they didn't want to do it or didn't want to.

265
00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:14.319
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, that's that is some slippery slick sales tactics.

266
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.279
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So yeah, super fun I

267
00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:24.119
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Don't think there's anything else to say about that one

268
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:31.799
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Sky harvest have announced their early access is out now surprise

269
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.319
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I have the jetpack. Oh wait, do you?

270
00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:35.259
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: This is

271
00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:44.400
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, it's up. It's a flying one. I just I can't the graphics on this or not it

272
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: They feel like a bass unit.

273
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.839
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: The worst the worst thing about it is not necessarily the graphics it's comparing the graphics to

274
00:21:52.400 --> 00:22:00.759
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: The are on the cover art that they have like that cover art looks amazing and then you look at the grain graphics and you're like oh

275
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:12.279
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah it's oh oh that that literally what's not on the box or whatever um yeah

276
00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.279
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Okay

277
00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:25.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: that's uh can you

278
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.400
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I do like the idea of the jetpack and like going between different islands and stuff, but oh wait

279
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.519
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Oh, sorry. It's not. Sorry. Just just to be clarify. The game is not out as I'm talking. It's coming out tomorrow as we're talking

280
00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:32.319
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So it should be out by the time the episode comes out, but if it's been delayed don't blame me

281
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Wait, can you, what are your crops while flying? That would be cool.

282
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:41.359
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Hmm good question I suspect not

283
00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:45.319
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh my gosh, I like there's an NPC. That, that cover art feels so dissonant.

284
00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:51.799
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Cause there's a, a, I'm looking through the, spoken to the steam, the trail on the steam page.

285
00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:55.319
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: There's like a part where you, there's a character portrait of a guy.

286
00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:02.680
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And that art style feels more accurate to the 3D look, um, is a little more realistic issue.

287
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.400
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, but it's also it's also still different from the game. It's like you got three different art styles there

288
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.279
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Anyways, um,

289
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:18.039
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: but yes, yeah, exactly, exactly that, that's what I'm saying. It's wild. That, okay. Okay. Yeah, that, it's that, it's the title art.

290
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:35.319
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I, I, so there's, it looks like the player character art is different in style to like the NPCs, the NPCs seem much nicer models, yeah.

291
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.220
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, the player character is very generic, bland.

292
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.859
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The one got NPC on C and they got the mustache.

293
00:23:38.859 --> 00:23:40.220
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Like he sees things all right.

294
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.940
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He seems it's like a character on.

295
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:59.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, and it's all the other objects just seem very low fidelity textures, but not like in a Minecraft. This is deliberate sort of way. It almost just feels like they will add the textures later.

296
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yep, base

297
00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.799
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: No base unity assets

298
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah.

299
00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:04.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, well, we'll see the jet package

300
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Anyway, it should be out now. So if you were really excited about that, there you go.

301
00:24:05.779 --> 00:24:07.779
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It's an idea

302
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.700
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Go fly to your heart's content

303
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: We've got an update on heartopia, Gavin, favorite game from our last episode, and that they now are on Steam.

304
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:27.619
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Is it I don't remember oh? Oh, okay, okay. Oh my god. Oh my god. What's the update?

305
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: This was the one that we thought might be a scam.

306
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.519
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So so the update is that it is now on Steam. So when we were talking about the podcast last time

307
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.180
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay

308
00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:38.220
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It was saying that it was available, but it wasn't on Steam

309
00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:46.119
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It was available on Android and iOS on their app stores and as I download on the website

310
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

311
00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:50.599
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Which felt very dodgy so now you can get it on Steam

312
00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:49.579
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay

313
00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:58.140
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, that's a tiny degree more of a legitimacy at least

314
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.440
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It is free to play on all platforms. I have played it

315
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.700
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh

316
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.440
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: For about five minutes

317
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.519
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So I'm

318
00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:15.559
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Because it only came on steam like yesterday. I think so I was playing it on my phone and I don't like playing games like this on a touch screen

319
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.880
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So I think I need to download it on my my ally and try out with a controller and see how it plays

320
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.559
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: But it's fine

321
00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:26.519
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I guess.

322
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.980
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It definitely is a game, it definitely does exist, and you log into it, and it definitely

323
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: [laughter]

324
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.339
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: does things the games do.

325
00:25:35.339 --> 00:25:41.220
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So whether it's a scam or not, it's still yet to be seen, but it isn't completely a scam.

326
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:55.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: a scam, a fair minimum. It's a scam with an actual product. Okay. Okay. All right. What's next?

327
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:58.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, so there we are next. We have an update for Palia Winters Wonder Snowbound Sanctuary.

328
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:07.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: That is a very long name Winters Wonder cool on Snowbound Sanctuary. That is the name for the update for Palia.

329
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.200
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh my oh wow, okay. That's okay.

330
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:14.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It adds a bunch of winter-based stuff. If you're playing Palia, you probably already know about this, but there you go.

331
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: this is going to convince anybody to play this game if you have

332
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:33.220
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: already. And finally we have some Sakuna news. Kevin you can buy replica tools from the game. Mm hmm.

333
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:19.720
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Probably not.

334
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.099
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Don't convince me, I'll be honest.

335
00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:22.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sorry, Paulia.

336
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.279
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: - Whoa!

337
00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:32.880
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Hey, okay, wait a sigh.

338
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.799
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: - Wait, what do we, oh, you can find it?

339
00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Or the, I forget what that thing's called.

340
00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:38.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: The sickle, yeah, whatever.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.660
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think it is.

<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Gas fire only kettle-cooped rice cooker. I think it might be not suitable for induction cooking. It is

380
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.539
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It doesn't say that the knives are suitable for...

384
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: harvesting spots.

385
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.420
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I don't think you're going to be trying.

386
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, probably there.

<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Now the question is, how much would the shipping be for this?

389
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: This is pretty sick.

390
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:30.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Mmm, that might price me out of the little...

391
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the hoe replica.

392
00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:38.319
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I keep getting errors when I try to add to my cart, so I don't know what the issue is here, but good luck.

393
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:50.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Look, wow, look, this, look, I've said a lot of things about wanting to get it, but this may be the first time I'm ordering. Oh, gosh. Oh, okay. Just straight up, you're not being sold to my country. Wow.

394
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.259
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: ahhhhhh

395

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I might actually reach out to Liam about this.

396
00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:53.579
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Thanks Trump

397
00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:56.380
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: [laughs]

398
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Thank you and listeners.

399

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I knew. Oh, I mean, wait, no, Andrew's not Japan anymore. Liam might be my only Japanese contact now. Yeah, stay tuned. Listen. Oh, okay. Well, I'm over here sweating. We can go those. Okay. I'm freaking out about it, but I will. Okay. A little more objectively, I do think these are very nice replicas. They don't look cheap. Yeah, that's all.

400
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:42.579
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: All right, that's all the the game updates. Next we have three new games to talk

401
00:29:42.579 --> 00:29:50.539
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: about. Well, we will find out. So first up, we have farming camp every summer,

402
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Or any of them good?

403
00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:55.819
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: every tree, every tree farming camp searches for the next best ever tree

404
00:29:55.819 --> 00:30:00.700
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: farmer. Someone ready to raise the bar in agriculture. In hopes of a better

405
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, that's it.

406
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.460
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: future young Alessandra enters the contest to claim the title.

407
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.299
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: But she will have to face her peers and discover what it means to be an ever tree farmer.

408
00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:12.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: That's always a good question. What is the thing that you're talking about?

409
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.640
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: There's a lot. I try to unpack here

410
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:25.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, first of all, I do like the comment. Oh, okay a lot of indie you know

411
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.920
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think we bring it up

412
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:34.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But so many of these cottage court indie games. They make so much better to the art for the promotional material than the it gave a art

413
00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:38.359
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But that said the

414
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:42.339
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: However, I don't, I don't look at this one and go, I look at this one and go, yeah, that's

415
00:30:43.119 --> 00:30:46.039
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I was about to say it actually looks fine. It's 2d pick

416
00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:11.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I like it for me camp. I kind of like the premise. I like the little competition thing going on. I like it. One of those characters is just Zelda. That is just Zelda.

417
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.119
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um, okay, if you look at the trailer out around the 12 second mark where the

418
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:26.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: title is, what is is that a fish person I'm looking at? I just I that doesn't look human. I could be wrong, but

419
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Uh, let's have a look.

420
00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:28.099
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Around 12 seconds, did you see?

421
00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:36.319
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: yeah, 1112. Yeah. Yeah. And under the logo, you see some characters. Is that a fish person?

422
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.700
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: The 12 seconds is just a logo.

423
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Oh, I see, okay.

424
00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:37.799
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I'm not thinking a fish, person me.

425
00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:39.799
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: No, I don't know.

426
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.119
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It looks like a Zora to me. Like I feel like there are a lot of

427
00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:52.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think it's expiration this fair because it's not copying, but that feels like one.

428
00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:01.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I think it might be like a bird person, but yeah, I think it's, I think, I think you might be right. I think it might not be a human, unless it's somebody weighing a costume.

429
00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:56.480
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, maybe it's a non-human at bare minimum.

430
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:08.720
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay. And I guess so. Um, yeah, okay. Anyways, yeah, there's a like a little

431
00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:15.839
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So, okay, uh, some of the other things on the trailer than the art. Um, um, uh, there the chickens

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: like a cross between slimes and chickens. I don't know what's going on with them. Yeah.

433
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.740
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah. Look, I love a lot of these designs, right? Like some of the people,

434
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.819
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: does the character designs, they're all really unique. There's like someone with hair that

435
00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:35.920
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: They are. Yeah, there's a character who looks like a Toriyama Goku character. There's a Zelda,

436
00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:29.460
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: goes all the way to their feet. Um,

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I don't think it's going to be hardcore competition, maybe game to gameplay wise, but the premise,

440
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.200
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think it's fun. Um, and clearly you're playing a set character, Alessandro. That's cool. Um,

441
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:07.680
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: you drive a boat at some point. I don't know why, but I'm down for that. Um, I do have. Oh, if you look at, uh, if you look at 30 seconds into

442
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:14.240
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the trailer, you can see the the non-human better. I don't know what they are, but they're not a human.

443
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:18.119
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yes, they definitely I think they look like an eagle person or something like that

444
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:29.359
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, like a jellyfish to me. I don't know. Listeners. The big round blue head part looks like a, the, the, the top of a jellyfish.

445
00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:23.019
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: A jellyfish what are you talking about?

<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: rebuild your community one bottle at a time.

467
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:56.900
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Upgrade your bike, your dairy farm and venture deeper into a once lively region.

468
00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Now, why most excited about this Kevin?

469
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.800
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: See if you scroll down.

470
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:09.179
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It says, features, what milky delivery offers, a short adventure, two to three hours of

471
00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:12.559
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: beautiful landscapes, light management, small decisions, short dialogues.

472
00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:18.880
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I'm in, I'm buying this game day one, give me three hours of gameplay and then go away.

473
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.760
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, you know what? In and out. That's that's sure. Sure. I guess

474
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:30.239
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I am in, so it's a side scrolling game, I think this looks really nice.

475
00:35:28.719 --> 00:35:36.480
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: in spot. I don't know if they said it, but inspired by Kiki's delivery service because of course

476
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: What?

477
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.719
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: because we live in the sphere and every other game has to be inspired by Studio Ghibli filming.

478
00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:49.760
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So I won't say great, huh? But that's it, uh, even if it.

479
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.119
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Falls into that category. It looks nice. The visuals are nice. Um, I'll say that the the bike

480
00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:58.800
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: animation go looks fast. Cool. Um, you know what? For a two to three hour game. Yeah. All right.

481
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:05.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Good for them. She wears a witch hat. That's how you know it's it's Kiki's you get it. You get it out.

482
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, I'm in.

483
00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:18.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Something save me. And it's just ended all. What's next? Okay. Well, the next game is door my faith and anything

484
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.099
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yes. (laughs)

485
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:25.960
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Well, so the next one is technically oh, yes, sorry mochi delivery is coming out this year sometime, but we don't know any more information

486
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.340
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So the next game is called Bell's fanfare. This is not a farming or cortical game

487
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:39.820
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: The reason why I'm including it is purely because it's by Chibi, Chidio who made summer in Mara, etc

488
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.639
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, yeah, I mean, yeah, we, we subscribe to the Chibiverse, absolutely.

489
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.019
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: We do so we're probably not gonna cover this in the podcast because it's not a

490
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:54.059
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Farming or cortical game unless somebody really wants to but I felt like it was worth mentioning it because we love Chibi

491
00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:56.059
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So much and we talk about them

492
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.199
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I'm like when I'm seeing I think, I think.

493
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.460
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Well, so here's interesting. I'm not

494
00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:04.719
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, okay.

495
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:10.340
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I'm checked out so let me let me tell you why I don't like it and then you can tell me why you like it and we'll end on your positive

496
00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:17.300
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: This is doing the let's recreate p.s. One era graphics and

497
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.780
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: I think it just looks bad. I

498
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.699
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Don't I don't like it. Yes. Yeah, it is

499
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:32.119
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Do you think that's intentionally going for that okay sure I'll believe you I yeah I don't know I didn't have a ps1 so

500
00:37:30.699 --> 00:37:35.619
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: It's quite a trend in games the last couple of years is to go back to the ps1 graphics

501
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It is I

502
00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:41.699
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: And I'm like no leave them in the past make your game look nice not make it look old

503
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So I see where you're coming from I don't know if it's in tension. Oh, especially Jimmy. I don't know if it's intentional

504
00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:51.960
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But I can see how you get that take away. Okay.

505
00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.079
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay. Well, okay. So visual also this, at least it looks different from the other

506
00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:06.099
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: chibi games, I think, enough. Well, I say that chibi games are kind of all over the place,

507
00:38:06.099 --> 00:38:15.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: aren't they? So maybe that's powerful, of course, that it's not. But I don't know. There's

508
00:38:15.519 --> 00:38:21.199
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: something, I mean, chibi, again, chibi games also in-game all over the place. We have aliens

509
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.360
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: again, witches and stuff. And, and there's a lot going on in this trailer. You're, I don't know,

510
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.960
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: fighting in an asteroid, I think. I don't know what you're doing going on to your tiny, in some

511
00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:39.199
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: portions. There's a, we'll do it on a stage. There's a really cool horse unicorn person with a pipe on

512
00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:48.639
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: a boat. Um, I just a lot going on here. Um, but, uh, it's called my interest at the release. I don't know

513
00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:51.639

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sure, there is so like the lion guy on the stage who takes a bow and puts on a mask. I don't know

524
00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:36.699
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: There's something very

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: RPG like

526
00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:41.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Final fantasy character about that guy. I just dig it

527
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.300
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But you know that that's fair

528
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:49.019
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I don't know February. Oh kickstarter because of course it's Jimmy of course

529
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.820
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: February 3rd, okay

530
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.119

531
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.860
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Check it out. Have we had a cubic kickstarter fail?

532
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.920
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: No, no, and I think the recent ones have all been like pretty much within an hour. They've been funded

533
00:39:59.739 --> 00:40:01.739
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I didn't think so

534
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:14.219
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, and you know that's fair. I think they've earned it even with rough edges they've earned it. Cool. That's fanfare

535
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: One name. I like that. I don't know what it means for sure. I mean something

536
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.519
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Well, it's the fanfare for Belle, obviously silly question.

537
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, all right

538
00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:30.639
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Alrighty, I think that's all of our new games, so Kevin, we're over to you.

539
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Sure

540
00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:30.219
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Cool. Yeah, all right

541
00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:31.960
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: We are going to talk about discounting.

542
00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:38.619
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, so on our on our notes that we refer to while talking. I'm typing some live

543
00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.940
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And the first one I put in all caps

544
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:46.380
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: This is ladies and gentlemen. This is Jojo Mark the game

545
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: If you ever wanted that, which let's be honest, we've all we've all thought about it, right?

546
00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.860
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um, cuz that's

547
00:40:53.019 --> 00:40:55.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, we have it's it's a constant

548
00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:05.099
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: you can workshop it right and and they've done it um okay so um where to start with okay you know

549
00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:15.579
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: my overall impression I'm giving it maybe even two thumbs up um it is yeah I'll say that it's if nothing

550
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Oh, wild way to start.

551
00:41:15.579 --> 00:41:23.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: else it's very well made game um it's of course it's very specific in what it's trying to do so whether

552
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.260
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: that gameplay jai's with you or not.

553
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You know, that's that's the make or break kind of thing.

554
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I am enjoying the game.

555
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay.

556
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay.

557
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:39.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So let's talk about the gameplay and kind of the premise of the game.

558
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So I don't know how intentional not, but it is.

559
00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:50.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It feels somewhat of a boy play on the start of so many farming games.

560
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um, uh, this time it's your aunt, who is not in.

561
00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:25.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Karenning the whole story to you. She's actually alive and well, your neighbor, um, but she wants you to start working at her store. Um, I can't remember why you would agree to it, but you do. I think it's mostly to help her out because she is getting older, whatever and is seeking help. Um, and so you're, it sounds like more, you're just doing her a favor sort of thing. Um, but she is by, she is clearly the owner of the, the enterprise and making the big decisions. You are literally working here. Um,

562
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:55.380
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: and so much of the game has that feeling. Oh, this is a Wendy's man. Um, but, uh, you, so you move to this small town called Bloom curse. I think it is. Um, it's, it's a small town. It's, um, kind of, uh, not impoverished, but, uh, just, uh, it's, it's seen better days. Let's say that, right. So there's a couple of buildings that are run down or abandoned shops that have been closed, but there's a, you know, there's a small

563
00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:25.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: inner community and then some tight knit, some of them care about the heritage, et cetera, et cetera. Um, anyways. And so yeah, you, you move to this town and you start working. Um, and it is, uh, convenience slash supermarket store, the simulator manager game. Um, you use, lay out your, in like, you know, you have an, you're given an empty space basically. You lay out shelves,

564
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:55.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: chills on them. Um, and then from like, what is a nine AM to buy PM or whatever people come to the store shop and pick stuff up and take it to the register. You check them out at the register and you just kind of rinse and repeat that right. If stuff runs out of a stock inventory, you either got to replenish it from the store room, or you do tell just tell the customer, sorry, we're out. Um,

565
00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:25.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think I talked about this a couple of weeks ago when I first mentioned discounting, um, when you start, you have this, uh, at least on control. It's, it's a pretty painful system of where you have to type in the prices manually on like the grand total. Um, so let's just say an apple is, is 10 coins, right? So if a person grabs three apples, you can either type 30 or you can two 10 times three because it's a little calculator interface. Um, the interface itself is the bigger problem because it's a number pad, but you have, it's still control.

566
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:33.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And not just like highlight the key, it's like you tilt the controller in one direction and that's the the number that you're selecting.

567
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:41.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You know, you have the eight way a directional, yeah, the eight directions right the corners and the up down left right.

568
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:52.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And it's just awkward, especially because you got a line of clients and so customers and so you got to you got to get through the line and put all those numbers in and check them out.

569
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: it kind of gets uh

570
00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:01.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: times it a little overwhelming and a little high pressure because there are clients with um

571
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:07.340
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: or there's like a satisfaction rating right did you take too long did you have everything they want

572
00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:11.739
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: yada yada yada and then at the end of the day all your totals of all the stuff you sold

573
00:45:11.739 --> 00:45:19.739
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: this tally it in the satisfaction of measure yada yada and that's uh and so that's kind of the focus

574
00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:25.340
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: of the gameplay running the store um after hours staff you know outside the the uh time when you're

575
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.860
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: running the story clients are in there you still have to manage inventory you have a computer in

576
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:36.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the back you go back say how you need another box of apples and potatoes or whatever um and then

577
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:41.820
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: stuff gets delivered the store room is kind of the same thing where you're placing boxes and you kind

578
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:47.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: of have to keep it neat and organize just purely for your own sanity um to able to run around and grab

579
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:54.780
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: stuff easily um that sort of stuff really appeals to me like it's almost like a puzzle oh how can I

580
00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.059
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: what's the most efficient layout I can come up with right that's kind of a big appeal the game

581
00:46:00.059 --> 00:46:10.539
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: for me um uh and it right exactly right yeah exactly right it's it's yeah there you go the setting

582
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:07.460
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, that's I mean, that's a big thing that people do in farming games anyway, right? Like how can we make this really efficient?

583
00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:15.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: out your layout of the store in the inventory is very similar to say you're you're farming plots

584
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.059
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: right how are you going to make it efficient where you know you can water x number of tiles

585
00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:25.340
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: easily so what are your patches gonna look like but yeah yeah that's that's great point um it

586
00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:33.179
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: scratches that exact same age um and uh and as you progress you you you get upgrades um this the

587
00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:40.699
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the uh the check out system it's a huge upgrade you get a proper scanner system and instead of typing

588
00:46:40.699 --> 00:46:45.179
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: out the numbers all you have to do is rotate the item in a certain direction to scan it that's it

589
00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:50.699
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: um and so it becomes a non issue at that point it goes from the biggest point to

590
00:46:50.699 --> 00:46:55.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: pain point to just disappearing completely. And what's nice is they introduced

591
00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:00.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: an option in the settings where you can just have that scanner from the

592
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.260
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: beginning or remove the customer satisfaction stuff just to make the game

593
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:10.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: play, you know, shiller on you if you want, right? If you want less pressure. And so

594
00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:13.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: you know, it hats off to them. I certainly wouldn't blame anyone if they use the

595
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.260
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: scanner from the beginning because, oh my god, what a huge quality of life.

596
00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:23.940
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh, great. So yeah, so that's the primary gameplay of running the store.

597
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.940
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: >> Sure.

598
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:33.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Okay, so now let's talk about the characters in the story.

599
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:40.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So you have a small, I would just say close to Stardew sized town and the number of characters

600
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: you can interact with.

601
00:47:43.659 --> 00:47:50.739
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Their personalities are certainly all over the place, very colorful, a lot of them are like

602
00:47:50.739 --> 00:47:56.340
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: start doing a lot of them are not great people, people you don't like.

603
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: A good example, there is a guy named Elmer, I believe his name is.

604
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:05.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He is the guy who runs the the the city hall area.

605
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He is just a represented like a city council representative.

606
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:16.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He, you know, he's he's very low on the on the rung of political power and has no authority of doing stuff.

607
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He likes to just take care of the town part because he loves gardening and he just wants to do that.

608
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But he has to put up with all this other stuff of permits and he doesn't respond well to

609
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:31.739
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: pressure and so he's kind of like a kind of a maybe not weasily, but he's a very timid guy and

610
00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:39.099
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: and sometimes has to deal with the conflicts that he doesn't like. So that's just one example,

611
00:48:39.099 --> 00:48:45.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: a character, but like there's, oh, there's a factory and there's a factory owner, her name's

612
00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:52.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Tammy, she's an awful person who's impatient and just, you know, when you think of a capitalist

613
00:48:52.139 --> 00:48:55.380
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Like, CEO person, that's what Tammy is.

614
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He's not great.

615
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:02.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But you still have to interact with her because one of the kind of mechanics outside

616
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:09.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: of town is there's a handful of suppliers in town.

617
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:14.780
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: This village is a harbor, so there's both farms and fishing people.

618
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.940
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And you can actually interact with, I believe, it's four of them that I've had right now

619
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:24.219
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: to negotiate trade contracts, and they give you like special and unique inventory for

620
00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:26.219
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: for your shop. Uh.

621
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:42.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And so you have to manage that and you can hit targets like sell X number of fish from this one person and then you can get upgrades to their to the trade contract. You have with them. So you can get stuff on them at cheaper prices or bigger quantity so on and so forth.

622
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:57.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And so the social system is I'm going to call it a light social system because you as you talk to you don't actually even give gifts to people you just talk to them.

623
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:05.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And you get to know them. You get to know their stories. Eventually you'll not have little mini events with them. There's no dating in this game. Thank goodness.

624
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:20.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But you get to know each of the characters individually. And so again, a wide variety of opinions. You have people just trying to make business in this little town. You have people care about the heritage and what yada yada yada.

625
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And so that's that's kind of how it goes. The overall arching plot.

626
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:42.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Is is kind of like this conflict that your aunt is creating because she's trying to expand the store so much at first. It's just this one building that she has. She ran a different store, but she.

627
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:56.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: She tries to or turned into a discounty franchise discounties the name of the store itself. And then later on, she, for instance, buys a band in T shop next to her place to take to that building and expands the store there.

628
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:09.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And some people are set by that because that he shop even though it's been abandoned for a number of years and unused still had meaning people, you know, felt to represent the town yada yada yada.

629
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:25.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And so some people have issues with that. And again, you have no control over this as you are not the owner of the store. You are just the manager slash primary employee.

630
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:43.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: This is why like it starts to show I joke about capitalism, but that that's kind of what this is right like the store is growing and growing than the aunt wants to keep expanding and growing and it's and you kind of see the side effects it's going to have on the community.

631
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:57.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: What feels like maybe the climax of the game or at least a big significant event where she's trying to expand again, but she's trying to now get rid of a basically a historical landmark house.

632
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:10.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So like one of the towns of founders or something like that. And it's caused so much discord that there is now full on protesting going outside my store.

633
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:20.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Which is kind of cool to see because usually don't see cottage core games kind of go that far, you know, actual organized protests.

634
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And now you're at odds with many people in town, including some of the trade suppliers I can no longer buy.

635
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:34.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But at the moment, buy anything from them, which again nifty. I think that's cool that they're just tackling all that head on.

636
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:49.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: There's other aspects of the story that I haven't gotten into too deep into like there's an environmental aspect. I don't think that's necessarily there's a result of the discounty thing, but there's again the earnings Tammy the factory owner.

637
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: She's clearly been polluting and it's clearly having an impact on the environment and that's been upsetting some people.

638
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:06.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So yeah, just a lot of stuff like that.

639
00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah

640
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:22.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And and your player character because you're not giving, you know, you put your own name, but they they have a it's not a blank slate character like you can kind of influence your answers a little you have a who multi choice, but generally speaking, they're a decent person.

641
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And they're just trying to get through the work they do their job, but they also

642
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.400
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: don't have to set everyone off, right? Like if they were in control of the

643
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: whole situation, they probably would not be expanding so much, or you know,

644
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:41.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: trying to upset the community. But so they're just trying their best. But, but

645
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:49.800
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: yeah, that's, I'm trying to think here. It's kind of a quick snapshot. And yeah, it

646
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:55.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: really does feel like Georgia marked the game, because yeah, what if you kept

647
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: trying to figure, how's it going to fit start to do Valley, right? That's very

648
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: much what this game feels like. From a technical perspective, the game's

649
00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:13.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: great. It runs great. The art style, it's 2D pixel art, but it's stylish enough.

650
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:19.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I like it. It's appealing. I don't want to try to think how to compare it. It's

651
00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:26.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: certainly not Stardew-esque. It's a little more rounded, a little more poppy, like it.

652
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:33.860
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: it's a little more bouncy than then Stardew, but um, I like it. Um, and I say all this, I guess it

653
00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:39.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: should be, uh, important to note that, uh, this is a couple months after the games out, there's

654
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: been several patches, quality of life stuff. Um, I think for instance, there's a basement U.M.

655
00:54:44.659 --> 00:54:49.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Lockford, like just an additional store room. Um, I believe that was one of the quality of life

656
00:54:49.139 --> 00:54:54.019
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: things and I wasn't there at the beginning. Um, so you know, I'm, I'm playing this probably from a

657
00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:56.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: a decent like perspective or or

658
00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:02.300
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: a lot of those pain points have probably been ironed out but yeah overall I'm

659
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:09.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: enjoying the experience so far oh oh I'm talking about grace I just remembered

660
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:15.579
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: so when you start working you're and already has a woman named Grace working

661
00:55:15.579 --> 00:55:20.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: in the store and she's kind of your boss or seeing you're at the very

662
00:55:20.659 --> 00:55:24.619
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: least right and so she's the one who she's the tutorial character she tells you

663
00:55:24.619 --> 00:55:26.539
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: had to run the store and helps you in

664
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:34.820
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: get out of here. Um, and so Grace is cool. She's a, she's just a friendly, sweet, cool woman. Um, well,

665
00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:41.059
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: guess what? Um, after you've progressed enough in the game, she's fired because hey, guess

666
00:55:41.059 --> 00:55:46.260
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: what? Turns out you're, you were actually turning up to be her replacement because you worked deeper

667
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:55.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: than she did this. So yeah, capitalism and it's fine as baby. Um, uh, yeah. And for a while, you're the only

668
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Hm, oh dear.

669
00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:00.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: employee. Oh. Oh.

670
00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Oh. You do unlock a second like assistant employee at some point.

671
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:05.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: He just basically runs around and stalks the shelves, which does help you

672
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: rule out running the story. It is nice to have him there.

673
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Poor kid lives at the store basically because he's there from son up till son to happen.

674
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Just talking nonstop.

675
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:23.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But, but you know what? He's also a problem child so people are happy with that.

676
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But yeah, that's uh, that's kind of the

677
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:34.179
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the snapshot with this kind of look look at capitalism and it's ugliness doesn't shy away from that and

678
00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:43.699
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I'm I'm enjoying it. Um, I will very likely play this to completion. Um, I don't know how much farther I have to go

679
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:51.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um, I will say like I'm I feel like I passed the halfway point maybe even two birds of the way in

680
00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:56.579
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Um, just based off some of the upgrade paths, I've personally seen.

681
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.019
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But there'd be more stuff done.

682
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:07.019
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: cool it'll be it'll be interesting to hear how it like concludes right because there's a lot

683
00:57:07.019 --> 00:57:13.579
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: to that you know and it could it could go a lot of different

684
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: There yeah

685
00:57:13.679 --> 00:57:16.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, it will or yeah, it can agree

686
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:21.400
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Now I honestly don't know how it's gonna you know how it's gonna play out

687
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:27.760
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You know even if the the actual discounty then stuff of their answer is all you still have that back to your work or

688
00:57:28.519 --> 00:57:30.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Green um

689
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:58.500
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, it's a fun idea, I guess. So here's here's my question around the the kind of gameplay because my my thing is always like shops. I don't tend to find shops fun in games. How does it actually feel? I mean, you talked about a little bit of the the weirdness in terms of like inputting the price, but like more than that, like how does the overall shop feel to to actually run.

690
00:57:30.519 --> 00:57:32.519
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: That's gonna get fixed

691
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.579
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Uh-huh.

692
00:57:53.500 --> 00:58:04.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah. I think I feel, I like it. Once you get the scanner and I'm not

693
00:58:04.139 --> 00:58:08.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: dealing with the pickup nonsense, I think it's great because here's the

694
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.940
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: thing. Like you wake up at the day starts at 6 a.m. the shop opens at 9 a.m.

695
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:16.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: right? So you have three hours you can go into the shop and kind of set stuff up.

696
00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:21.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Right? You line up your your shelves with all your inventory and you're kind of

697
00:58:21.659 --> 00:58:23.659
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: doing in such a way that, you know, you

698
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:32.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: just kind of runs itself, basically. If you do, if you plan and lay out things well, you generally don't run into problems.

699
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:38.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Again, especially when you get the scanner and you don't have to deal with the check-out nonsense, because none issue.

700
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:49.500
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I think it runs fine. It's a very active gameplay, also that. It's not just set and forget. You're still maintaining.

701
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:53.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: sometimes there's you know like a spill on the floor and you have to clean it up and so a little

702
00:58:53.500 --> 00:59:01.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: stuff like that but I like it and it's like a very concrete block of time you know I don't

703
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:07.179
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: know the actual time it's it's funny they actually make a little joke about it how time literally

704
00:59:07.179 --> 00:59:18.300
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: past is faster when the top is open yeah they make a joke about it but so you do it every day and

705
00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:25.260
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: for a certain period of time and and it's fine it's it doesn't feel like it drags on or it's long

706
00:59:24.219 --> 00:59:30.460
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: so as long yeah like I said it's almost feels like a puzzle if you do well setting up your shop

707
00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.420
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: it runs well and that's that's kind of what I can say

708
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.320
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: in terms of like the, is all of the, I don't know whether you've mentioned this, but

709
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:45.840
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: or not, the, like taking, because you talked about taking payments, is that all manual

710
00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.519
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: then, or can you, like, say, I'll be--

711
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:53.199
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I haven't unlocked any automation. You have the scanner you have to run to the

712
00:59:53.199 --> 00:59:59.019
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: register to take care of it. Yeah.

713
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yeah, exactly. I think that's that's the thing that most has put me off it in general, right?

714
00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:04.679
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: The idea that like you have to because it's one of the things I'm not a huge fan of with shops is like

715
01:00:04.679 --> 01:00:09.480
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: the constantly being on edge to have to go and sell stuff to someone.

716
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.960
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, unfortunately then that you might still have an issue with this because it's you are still like said

717
01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It's still active. You still have to

718
01:00:18.519 --> 01:00:23.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Attend to these little things you have to check the customer out. You have to restock a shelf. It's empty

719
01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:25.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You have to clean up the floor

720
01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:32.480
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And and and there I haven't seen like well like I said you unlock one employee and he starts automating the stocks

721
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.099
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Restocking stuff at least sit to a certain degree. It's not as fast as you are for instance, but

722
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: >> You will walk.

723
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:51.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: There are employees who can help you checking stuff out? Maybe I don't know. We'll see. Maybe the store will expand. Maybe I'll get a second employee who doesn't.

724
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: I honestly could not say. At least I where I am right now, you're still doing stuff yourself and there's no automation.

725
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.800
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Right, fair enough. I don't think I have any more questions.

726
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, no, I mean, it's it's a that's fair. It's a

727
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.440
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Straight forward game. Let's say it gets right into it

728
01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:18.900
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You do ramp up the store a little bit, but it still feels faster than say Stardew Valley just the pace of the game

729
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.840
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Yes, which isn't a bad thing.

730
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.880
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Let's see I'm

731
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.679
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: You know, I was just talking about wanting shorter games.

732
01:01:24.679 --> 01:01:26.960
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: So yeah, so how much time have you put into this?

733
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah

734
01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:30.239
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, it's about to say that I'm actually at 10 hours just dust an hour

735
01:01:31.119 --> 01:01:33.119
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Which I might be not a bad time

736
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.800
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Okay, and you feel like you're getting close to the end.

737
01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:38.139
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah, I feel like I might be third if I were to guess

738
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.480
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Just based on the signs. I've seen definitely past the halfway point. I feel confident about that

739
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.360
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: so yeah, and

740
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And I don't know what a post game would look like in this scenario because

741
01:01:52.599 --> 01:01:56.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: One thing I have seen online a lot of people complain about that like yeah, you know

742
01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:02.159
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You can kind of keep playing after the credits, but there's no real reason to if that makes sense

743
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.199
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: But uh, oh, yeah, I don't know like it's it's it's kind of niche. It's specific, but it was

744
01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:19.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: What everything it does well? I think the visuals are fun. Yeah, the game does look like the box art. I'll say that

745
01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:23.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It has charm

746
01:02:24.159 --> 01:02:26.559
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: You know, I think over the characters too much, but

747
01:02:28.239 --> 01:02:31.280
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: They have their works and charms. I like the

748
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.059
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: the hardware store guy they got who sells you.

749
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.960
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: one of the fun things about the layout stuff.

750
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.360
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: As you progress, you unlock different items,

751
01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.159
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: like different kind of shelving units and stuff you can unlock.

752
01:02:41.159 --> 01:02:46.400
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And one of the front ones, there's these items they're called displays.

753
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.719
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And what they do, they have a lot of fun stuff.

754
01:02:49.719 --> 01:02:52.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: They have a lot of fun stuff to do.

755
01:02:52.679 --> 01:02:57.440
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And so they're a lot of fun stuff, but they're a lot of fun stuff.

756
01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And they're a lot of fun stuff, but they're a lot of fun stuff.

757
01:03:01.679 --> 01:03:04.679
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: And what they do, they have a lot.

758
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:25.599
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So for instance, if you put like a produce display and you put, you fill, you put shelves of

759
01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:37.719
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: apples and lettuce around the display, customers will be incentivized to see them and buy them more, so you can get more

760
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:43.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: it and stuff like that, which is a fun element to, again, figure out an efficient layout and whatnot.

761
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
<v 4C314911-187E-4465-8BDE-529A151CE681>Al: Okay

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: Yeah.

<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: So I don't, I don't think this game has done, probably wouldn't.

766
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
<v 7B9B8A74-1441-4B53-A68B-A292BC7B1045>Kevin: It doesn't feel conducive to demo, but I still recommend it.

767
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
