> Yeah, what is it three days in and already things happening on the news and

(55s) **Al:**

> Yeah, super, super fun news day. We'll not talk about that because I don't think this I mean, I don't think that personally. I don't think it's a good plan to invade other countries and steal their, their leaders, even if they are terrible people. I just don't think that's a great thing in general. Just putting that out there.

(59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1m 12s)

> yeah yeah it's it's two two rights don't make wrongs wrongs don't make right

(1m 23s)

(1m 29s) **Al:**

> Wow, let's hope let's hope it's the worst thing that happens this year

(1m 30s) **Kevin:**

> uh you know I was prepared to come in making jokes about both

(1m 36s) **Al:**

> Anyway, we're we're not here

(1m 42s) **Kevin:**

> in results of the the game of the year but I looked at the news

(1m 48s)

> Stanley nah no you know I'm good actually yeah

(1m 53s) **Al:**

> But we're not a politics or a news podcast, so we're not going to talk about that.

(1m 57s)

> We are going to talk about what games, what farming and cottagecore games we are most looking forward to this year.

(2m 4s)

> And from once, it won't be snackle.

(2m 6s) **Kevin:**

> ha yeah oh my goodness oh I'm I'm getting I'll be honest I haven't

(2m 8s) **Al:**

> For the first time since the podcast started, it won't be snackle.

(2m 17s) **Kevin:**

> finished I haven't listened to the episode but I peaked the results in them

(2m 21s)

> I'm all riled up I I had I look especially coming in I had to know

(2m 23s) **Al:**

> Look to the results Kevin. Kevin.

(2m 29s)

> Oh man. Well, look, I feel you'll understand when you listen to the discussion and how we get to that point, you'll understand why we went.

(2m 32s) **Kevin:**

> it's fine it's fine

(2m 39s)

> "I'm--look, here's the thing, it's not a--okay, this is the only comment I want to say, like,

(2m 47s) **Al:**

> Spoilers for the game of the year episode

(2m 50s) **Kevin:**

> it's nothing wrong with snack or nothing--okay, you're spoilers if you haven't listened--there's

(2m 54s)

> nothing wrong with snack, oh, it's a fine game. In fact, in other years, it probably would win,

(2m 59s)

> like I don't have any issue with it. Well, you know, it would win. In my book, it would win, let's

(3m) **Al:**

> What it did win, but okay

(3m 7s) **Kevin:**

> - Let's see that.

(3m 9s)

> - I just think it's not going to be a great farming game,

(3m 12s)

> and I think there will be other great farming games.

(3m 15s)

> Wander stop.

(3m 16s)

> We're only getting one of those every,

(3m 19s)

> I don't know when we're getting the next one.

(3m 21s) **Al:**

> Good. I'm glad. I'm glad we're gonna get another one.

(3m 21s) **Kevin:**

> That's my big, that's my big put, look.

(3m 25s)

> Oh my goodness, okay, we're moving on.

(3m 29s)

[laughing]

(3m 30s) **Al:**

> Look, I am glad that you liked it so much. That is old.

(3m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, all right, moving on.

(3m 37s)

> Well, what have you been up to?

(3m 38s) **Al:**

> So, yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, no way. I haven't said we're gonna have some news.

(3m 39s) **Kevin:**

> I'm putting on you. What's going on?

(3m 44s) **Al:**

> But first of all, yeah, some game news, some name, game,

(3m 44s) **Kevin:**

> What?

(3m 46s)

> The non-bombing kind?

(3m 51s) **Al:**

> news. But first of all, I'm still letting you say it.

(3m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, stuff happens still, apparently.

(3m 58s)

> Wait, what are you being up to?

(4m)

> What are you being up to?

(4m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, there we go. Okay, cool. I haven't been up to huge amounts gaming-wise, because holidays

(4m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, all right, what have you been up to now? I'm putting it on you.

## What Have We Been Up To

(4m 5s) **Kevin:**

> What's going on?

(4m 9s) **Al:**

> are always complicated with kids. But I have been pouring my way through the Pokémon

(4m 15s)

> Legends the AADOC. I finished the main story.

(4m 18s) **Kevin:**

> You made all the donuts now we can feed them to the ampa, yay.

(4m 21s) **Al:**

> Ah. So, here's a couple of things, but they don't ask. First up, I don't, I still don't like

(4m 29s)

> the timers, right? I don't like the timers at all for two reasons. One, I don't like the stress.

(4m 35s)

> And two, when I'm in a place where I've like used done everything and I've used up,

(4m 39s)

> I've done all the things I need to do in that area, and there's nothing left for me to do,

(4m 42s)

> like there's not a Pokémon that I want to show you on. There's no task to get, there's no items to get.

(4m 47s)

> And I'm sitting there with a few minutes left on my timer. That's wasted time I could be doing

(4m 51s)

> something, but there's nothing I can be doing, and it's really annoying. So, it's like you have to

(4m 54s)

> constantly be judging, which is the right donut to do. And it's very frustrating. And if you make

(4m 59s)

> a mistake, it all too saves when you use a donut. So, you can't then just reset it.

(5m 4s)

> Yes, listeners, I know a bit of the backup save. I'm not doing that. It's too much effort.

(5m 9s)

> And I, I just find that is just as frustrating as running out of time, right? Because it's like

(5m 16s)

> wasted time that doesn't feel good? I also... I don't

(5m 17s) **Kevin:**

> You're... or...

(5m 21s) **Al:**

> like how the recipes are not consistent, like they wear for carties and sandwiches. Like if you

(5m 28s)

> use the same berries you get different effects out of it, right? So you can't consistently get

(5m 36s)

> sparkling power for a specific type. You just have to keep doing it and eventually you'll get what

(5m 42s)

> you want. And again, it saves when you create a donut. So you can't even like save scum that. Yes again,

(5m 49s)

> I know about the--

(5m 51s)

> backup save too much effort for making a dora.

(5m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's okay

(5m 56s) **Al:**

> It's just weird decisions. It's like the Pokemon game free continually like to be sure that they don't like us resetting things.

(6m 4s)

> And I just-- I don't get why they would restrict it in that way.

(6m 11s)

> It just seems like such an annoying thing.

(6m 14s)

> Like, I mean, it all comes down from the fact that they didn't allow you not to have auto saves.

(6m 21s)

> It doesn't solve the problem that they want because they still have the backup saves.

(6m 25s)

> And they need the backup saves. They can't get rid of the backup saves.

(6m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(6m 28s) **Al:**

> It just means that it's more effort to do it.

(6m 32s) **Kevin:**

> It's well, I think on the one hand if your game is in such a way that

(6m 40s)

> Players are encouraged to reset like I mean, I don't know personally. I as if I were a game dev

(6m 44s)

> I wouldn't want that

(6m 47s)

> That feels like a flaw, but

(6m 48s) **Al:**

> - Yes, but there's wanting it and going out of your way

(6m 52s)

> to make it difficult.

(6m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's true

(6m 55s)

> Yeah, but yeah, they're not solving it

(6m 56s) **Al:**

> Also, I wouldn't want to reset.

(6m 57s)

> I wouldn't want to reset the donuts

(6m 59s)

> if they were consistent.

(7m)

> Like the other previous things we've done, right?

(7m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's

(7m 2s) **Al:**

> Like I really liked, I really liked how curries and sandwiches.

(7m 6s)

> Well, curries didn't have any effects, right?

(7m 8s)

> But they at least they've made the same thing

(7m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(7m 10s) **Al:**

> when you use the same ingredients.

(7m 11s)

> And sandwiches, if you use the same ingredients,

(7m 13s)

> you've got the same effects.

(7m 15s)

> Like, I don't like this, like, "Oh, make a--"

(7m 18s)

> You know, use up all your donuts on this thing that might make sparkling power three, or it might make humongle power one. Okay, why?

(7m 24s) **Kevin:**

> ha ha ha ha ha ha ha oh yeah it is baffling isn't it and not just this like so many

(7m 32s)

> things a Pokemon does like their refusal to learn from themselves I don't know I don't know um

(7m 41s) **Al:**

> However, other than that, I have been enjoying the DLC.

(7m 47s)

> It's not a particularly interesting story, it's kind of predictable, but what I've said

(7m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(7m 53s) **Al:**

> a couple of times to people is, I think this is the funniest Pokémon has ever been.

(7m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's about to say although I hear that rain is pretty good though

(8m 2s)

> At least on the side stuff the side change

(8m 4s) **Al:**

> Like I'm regularly laughing out loud during dialogue in this game, even more than the

(8m 12s) **Kevin:**

> That's pretty good. Um, that's pretty hype. Um, yeah. I wish they did a little more with this

(8m 19s)

> whole hyper space reality stuff. What? Yeah. I guess I'll take that. I also wish, well, I know,

(8m 25s) **Al:**

> - Yeah.

(8m 27s) **Kevin:**

> I'm, I'm getting into it, but okay, try to judge what's there. It's fine. I guess it would be a good

(8m 33s)

> opportunity for other characters to show up. I'm just saying.

(8m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, they could definitely have done more with it. Um, and I guess it does it does just feel like

(8m 43s)

> another example of, um, the continuation of, okay, we've done enough to sell this game. Let's

(8m 52s)

> move on to the next sort of thing and, okay, sure. I mean, I, this is the thing like I, I still,

(8m 55s) **Kevin:**

> door, door.

(9m 1s) **Al:**

> I'm enjoying it and I am still not regretting my purchase. I, I will continue to

(9m 7s)

> buy the games because I continue to enjoy the games. Um, and, you know, you presumably

(9m 10s) **Kevin:**

> or not yet now, but uh, it's on my list. I would do wish to play the game.

(9m 13s) **Al:**

> still haven't bought the game. Eventually. So yeah, I, it's, yeah, I don't know. Blah. I'm enjoying it. I like it. There you go. But as always, there are

(9m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(9m 27s)

> Uh, black.

(9m 32s)

> Oh, you're not here. Here's a question. Would you give up this game to get

(9m 37s)

> Hope the mon's Z back in 20.

(9m 40s)

> Yeah, I guess, but what it was also X, Y, and those are some dang good games!

(9m 41s) **Al:**

> No, I don't think so

(9m 44s)

> Because I I I mean Pokemon Z would have just been the same, but maybe with one extra story with Zygarde and actually like what we call this was more than that

(9m 58s)

> Much more

(10m 2s)

> There were yeah, but that this Z would have just been the same. I don't want just X and Y again

(10m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I know.

(10m 9s) **Al:**

> Right like I won something different

(10m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Bye, guys. Fine. I can't believe Sandy and Dexia didn't show up. This was their moment to show up.

(10m 11s) **Al:**

> You

(10m 16s)

> There are many people that you question why they didn't turn up

(10m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I've played once a big one too, right? Let's do. Don't worry about it. Let's do it.

(10m 28s) **Al:**

> It's all right. We're in 2026. The Pokémon's 30th anniversary. I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about later in the year.

(10m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Well, yeah, okay. So I have started this county. Um, the, the game that's, that's

(10m 36s) **Al:**

> So that's what I've been up to. What have you been up to, Kevin?

(10m 47s) **Kevin:**

> cottagecore. So guess what? I may speak about that at length in, in the future on this

(10m 52s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(10m 54s) **Kevin:**

> very platform, spoiler. Um, all right. Now I'll, I'll give it a thumbs up so far right now.

(11m)

> It's doing what I want.

(11m 2s)

> - Wow.

(11m 4s)

> There's one glaring spot, like not good.

(11m 11s)

> Okay, and it is the soft management,

(11m 14s)

> like gameplay thing, specifically on controller.

(11m 19s)

> So what it is, the customer brings a number of items

(11m 24s)

> to the register and you have to tally up their total, right?

(11m 28s)

> It's not terribly hard, it's fine, it works for the link,

(11m 32s)

> but on controller.

(11m 34s)

> You have to give you like a little number pad or you have to type in what if you're on controller you have to like move the control stick around in a

(11m 42s)

> It's not even like moving the cursor around. It's like the center of the control stick like you know, neutral position is

(11m 50s)

> Eight or whatever and then you move to the diagonals to get the different number buttons

(11m 54s) **Al:**

> Okay. Yeah, yeah.

(11m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and and they have to hold like what's an LT to put a zero and

(12m 1s)

> And it's not great, it's not a great solution.

(12m 4s) **Al:**

> It's like doing a rotary dial on a phone

(12m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Um, to the... Yeah, basically.

(12m 8s)

> Um, and, and so when...

(12m 8s) **Al:**

> For our younger for our younger listeners rotary dials were old phones that had a circular thing

(12m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh.

(12m 14s) **Al:**

> Where you went from the start to go to the number and then let it run back and go ask your appearance or grandparents about it

(12m 20s)

> I don't know if we actually have any young listeners. We're probably all our age

(12m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, my.

(12m 25s)

> Oh, hopefully.

(12m 29s)

> Dale and go ask your repair.

(12m 34s)

> Anyways, uh, but so it's not a great field to the to the gameplay

(12m 41s)

> mechanic, the primary thing of checking people out.

(12m 44s)

> Um, while other than I'm enjoying it, um,

(12m 48s)

> Yeah, like I said, once I dive deeper into it, well, well.

(12m 51s)

> Who thoughts on it more, but overall not disappointing so far. So yeah, that's this county. Let's see what else. Oh boy, you night. Oh, man. I haven't talked about you night in a minute. Um. Oh wow. Oh

(13m 6s) **Al:**

> Oh yes, well, we got recently. I've not really been paying attention to Pokemon you know in about the last nine months. I've barely heard anything about it

(13m 17s)

> Coincidental date maybe

(13m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so they did a big update in

(13m 21s)

> December I believe it was and they it is the how should I put it so you know it has constantly been on an arms race to take more of your money

(13m 33s)

> um they each yep yeah absolutely right it's a big gacha thing in general but very guilty as they

(13m 34s) **Al:**

> Yep, like all of the Pokémon games, yeah.

(13m 41s)

> Yeah.

(13m 44s)

> My money is sunk into Go and TCG Pocket, so I definitely can't do another one.

(13m 45s) **Kevin:**

> injured there you go

(13m 51s)

> fair enough um so it's been you know it's been clear like yeah here's a 30 more passes for

(13m 58s)

> special costumes and whatever yada yada yada um and while annoying it's been at least for me it was

(14m 6s)

> tolerable um because there's a lot of pop-ups but you can ignore it now they have they broken the

(14m 13s)

> the glott the emergency the emergency glass breaking case of we want more money they have changed the

(14m 21s)

> acquisition system for new pokemon um so before you play the game uh you get there's you know various currencies but

(14m 29s)

> you play enough you get currency enough to buy a pokemon fairly straightforward simple and consider the nature of the

(14m 36s)

> game it's what works you want to play is Geratosia save up enough you buy Geratos and then you play it right

(14m 43s)

> um they have changed it to where you can no longer select the pokemon you want to buy

(14m 49s)

> Umm...

(14m 50s) **Al:**

> What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, did they make you night more capture? I'm sick. I... I... Oh... Oh... Oh...

(14m 52s) **Kevin:**

> You can do that if you have the premium currency where you pay with real...

(14m 59s)

> Oh yeah!

(15m 1s)

> Oh yeah!

(15m 2s)

> Because here's the thing.

(15m 6s)

> Okay, so if you pay money, real money dollars, or the premium currency, you can still buy the book money one.

(15m 12s)

> Of course, they left that on touch, right?

(15m 14s)

> Otherwise, they have...

(15m 16s)

> I forget what they call it, but basically there's a...

(15m 19s)

> There's a bar right and

(15m 21s)

> when you play enough you fill up the bar and when you fill up the bar you can buy a certain license from a select group of Pokemon that they tell you you can buy from like you filled up the bar okay congrats you can now buy three or one of these three Pokemon and if you have them all I forget what you get you you fill up the next bar faster I don't remember exactly what but the point is I cannot just.

(15m 45s) **Al:**

> or it doesn't even show you a list of three that you don't already have.

(15m 50s)

> It doesn't even just show you a list of three that you don't already have.

(15m 52s) **Kevin:**

> No, no it's like.

(15m 54s) **Al:**

> So the three could have be two that you already have and one you don't.

(15m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yes, yep and it's like a ladder sort of thing when you fill up the next pass okay hey here the next level on your pass you can these are the ones you can get in the next round and so on and so forth right.

(16m 11s)

> So I'll just use a concrete example but pour on but pour on release last month it's like the one defender I don't have in an idea you.

(16m 22s)

> You know two months ago I would have just saved up my money and bought up a bore on now I have to wait until the bar says I can buy the poor.

(16m 30s)

> Oh, it is baffling baffling to me because this whole game is predicated on playing the Pokemon you want to play.

(16m 33s) **Al:**

> That's amazing

(16m 42s) **Kevin:**

> So the fact that they've limited this it's oh this this is it it's it feels like then and.

(16m 48s) **Al:**

> I feel like I feel like I would I think it would be less stupid if that was how it always was

(16m 51s) **Kevin:**

> There's times for you night.

(16m 58s) **Al:**

> and it was just like the more you play eventually you'll get to unlock the better characters, right?

(17m 4s)

> Like that doesn't feel like the worst thing in the world. It doesn't feel amazing, but it doesn't feel like the worst thing

(17m 10s)

> But doing it was that like three years into its lifetime

(17m 15s)

> And that's...

(17m 18s)

> It's our decision.

(17m 20s)

> Um, yeah, what?

(17m 23s)

> Oh, goodness.

(17m 24s)

> Like, you could have bought like a whole bunch of them, and now you either have...

(17m 30s)

> And the one you don't have is in the top level.

(17m 33s)

> So because you have bought a whole bunch of them, you're now disadvantaged.

(17m 37s)

> And that you don't get to unlock anything new unless you pay for it until, until you get

(17m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Or yeah, yeah, it's it's not great. Now I'd to be fair. I have not played it at length of this this the license journey update. So I may have some aspects wrong. There might be something I misunderstanding. But in general, like there's like I said, I wanted to buy Vaporean. I couldn't to the shop and I couldn't buy Vaporean.

(17m 42s) **Al:**

> to the very top.

(17m 43s)

> He's dreadful.

(18m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Um, but, uh, yeah.

(18m 9s)

> It's not great. Um, yeah. Yeah, I don't, uh, it's not bueno. No bueno.

(18m 15s)

> So that's, that's great. Not great. And, and is, is genuinely soured my unite experience.

(18m 22s)

> I've been playing that much just because I've been busy, but, uh, again, and like I said,

(18m 27s)

> three years, I've been playing this game for three, four years, however long. And I've, I've enjoyed it.

(18m 32s)

> I very much enjoyed it. And now they did this. So, oh, well, I'll, I'm going to really

(18m 39s)

> feel, you know, in the release hallute show or the new megapalinks or whatever. And then I

(18m 45s)

> can't get it. Um, but we'll see. I don't know.

(18m 46s) **Al:**

> because you know you know the new ones are gonna obviously be you know higher up

(18m 51s)

> they're gonna be like the top ones because otherwise like that's so

(18m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, of course yeah, you know what isn't stupid ball guy. So I might say, but that's why we love him

(19m 6s)

> Because all guy they added a new

(19m 10s)

> Cygnus you ball guy to Pokemon masters

(19m 13s) **Al:**

> Obviously, why wouldn't they?

(19m 15s) **Kevin:**

> From the fenging gears here, but have you seen the new ball guy outfit out?

(19m 20s) **Al:**

> I have no, no. I saw someone mention it on Discord, but I haven't looked at it.

(19m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh

(19m 28s)

> It's it's it's in here. I'm gonna show you the picture

(19m 31s)

> It's incredible. It's it's a new year

(19m 35s)

> New Year event because

(19m 39s)

> I want to call

(19m 41s)

> Masters always does holiday events or whatever and

(19m 45s)

> So we get ball guy, but it looks like a sui and Pokeball and he comes with a sui and electrode and

(19m 49s) **Al:**

> Oh my. Okay.

(19m 52s) **Kevin:**

> And he has a...

(19m 54s)

> kind of a kimono sort of looked to it, not not kimono, I forget what they're called, but that's sort of like traditional Japanese coat sort of thing.

(20m 2s)

> He looks great, it's fantastic. I love Bog, I so much, it's stupid.

(20m 9s)

> And they added him to the... what they call the lodge, which is the kissing booth, as people call it, where you just get to hang out with the trainers and do one-on-one conversations and whatnot.

(20m 21s)

> So yeah, good times in man

(20m 24s)

> They didn't shoot themselves in the foot. I mean they did before but they fixed it already

(20m 31s) **Al:**

> Yeah, fantastic.

(20m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, so that's it's incredible. Great great stuff

(20m 36s)

> I think there was a new one or two, but like what's fine. Whatever. Okay. It's all bald guy. I care about

(20m 41s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(20m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, good times. I wonder I'm genuinely wonder how they're gonna if they're gonna touch

(20m 51s)

> ZA characters at all.

(20m 54s)

> They have Emma like they have but they have XY Emma. How are you gonna add the new Emma?

(20m 54s) **Al:**

> Oh, surely at some point.

(20m 59s)

> Well, do I mean, that's not unusual that they have multiple versions of a character?

(21m 1s) **Kevin:**

> I guess so

(21m 3s)

> Yeah, but that's like future version, you know, that's I don't know whatever. We'll see

(21m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(21m 9s) **Kevin:**

> well

(21m 10s)

> Will we get terrorists?

(21m 10s) **Al:**

> I think there's nothing wrong with that.

(21m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Maple wife professor? I don't know maybe

(21m 16s)

> Maybe I mean you can already hang out with Giovanni in the lodge, so they're not inverse to hanging out the terrace

(21m 23s) **Al:**

> Exactly. Also, she's reformed. Come on.

(21m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, she is. Yeah, it's great. Good size. Oh, that's one of the wins for sure

(21m 30s) **Al:**

> Slash got on a deal, like ways reformed if you can just go on a deal.

(21m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh, okay. That's all I got. That's all they got

## Game News

(21m 38s) **Al:**

> All right, well, let's talk about some news. First up,

## Stardew Valley 1.7

(21m 41s) **Al:**

> Stardew Valley, the Switch 2 update came out while like, well, since the last recording I did,

(21m 48s)

> I can't even remember when that was. Can't remember when this came out.

(21m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, why? Wait, wait, wait. So is it Stardew Valley to do it? Do it? I don't know what's in the update. I don't even know.

(21m 51s) **Al:**

> I just remember to come out sometime in the last...

(22m 1s)

> Well, that's a good question. Does it count as a switch is a starchy value to? No, it's it's just for clarification for people listening. There are no

(22m 12s)

> Additional content. It's just new features based on the switch too. So it has mouse mode. It has game chat of something else. I think I can't remember what it was. I mean most of it is

(22m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Does it have the game chat where I put your face over the character?

(22m 26s) **Al:**

> That is a good question. I don't actually know whether it does that or not

(22m 31s)

> I'm guessing not because I haven't I haven't seen any game to other than a first-party Nintendo game

(22m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Probably not, but it'll be dope.

(22m 37s)

> Yeah, I know the game probably ever will. Maybe among us, maybe.

(22m 42s) **Al:**

> I guess the question is whether they can or not like whether that is available to those games or not because it might be a private API

(22m 48s)

> We don't know anyway

(22m 52s)

> It's free just in case people are listening and are it's it's free update from the switch one update

(22m 58s)

> standard price if you don't already have it.

(23m 1s)

> And there's some significant bugs. So, if you are playing the game, yeah, it's not, no, no, no, no.

(23m 6s) **Kevin:**

> And not the kind you want.

(23m 10s) **Al:**

> Starchy doesn't have bugs. So there's a crafting issue where some things, if you craft

(23m 16s)

> it or randomly get rid of some things in your inventory. So just be careful of that if you are

(23m 23s)

> playing the Switch 2 version of Starchy. We also got some more info on the 1.7 update, which we'll be

(23m 29s)

> coming out sometime.

(23m 30s) **Kevin:**

> What?

(23m 31s) **Al:**

> He said that there will be a new farm type, technically I guess he didn't say that, what

(23m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Concernedape is working on more stardew.

(23m 44s) **Al:**

> he said was it is traditional to include a new farm type, so he's going to add a new farm

(23m 51s)

> type.

(23m 52s)

> But technically he didn't say he was, and it looks like he's focusing on character and

(23m 57s)

> and story-related stuff, so that's cool.

(23m 59s) **Kevin:**

> You know what that's probably one area that it could use a little love right like I don't know maybe I am been keeping up, but

(24m 7s)

> Yes, it's I mean all the stuff we talk about doing stuff with your spouse. Wouldn't that be nice?

(24m 13s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so we'll see what comes out of that, but that is what we know so far. Next, we have the farming simulator signature edition, which is just the switch to edition.

## Farming Simulator Signature Edition

(24m 27s) **Kevin:**

> All right, and you grow piranha plants finally as it should be

(24m 31s) **Al:**

> I don't know why I don't know why they called it the signature edition. I'm just going to ignore that question.

(24m 37s)

> I don't know why they called it the signature edition rather than switch to edition, but

(24m 42s) **Kevin:**

> It's side I can't even come with the witty reason I have no idea either

(24m 48s) **Al:**

> Oh wait, no, no, no, so I think the farming simulator signature edition already existed.

(24m 53s)

> And now this is the switch to edition of the signature edition.

(24m 57s) **Kevin:**

> good times. Don't you love name naming things. Good stuff.

(25m 5s) **Al:**

> Or maybe it isn't. I can't get the, no, I think it is new.

(25m 10s)

> Yes, because the newest one on Switch is farming similarly to 23.

(25m 13s)

> Anyway, people on Reddit, people on Reddit really hate people. No, people on Reddit really hate this version, apparently.

(25m 14s) **Kevin:**

> And Mari, can you farm his Mario?

(25m 20s)

> Okay. You know what? They're probably right. The farming sim people are there. They're a passionate

(25m 27s)

> community. I'll say that.

(25m 29s) **Al:**

> - Yeah.

(25m 29s)

[laughing]

(25m 31s) **Kevin:**

> I won't mess with them. I'll agree with whatever the bread it says.

(25m 32s) **Al:**

> - Net.

(25m 35s)

[laughing]

## Fantasy Life i DLC

(25m 37s) **Al:**

> Next we have fantasy life.

(25m 39s)

> I have released a free DLC,

(25m 41s)

> the Sinister Broker Bizario's schemes.

(25m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(25m 48s) **Al:**

> It's a roguelike mode.

(25m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Which is interesting. That can work. And I haven't played I yet, but I know fancy life version.

(25m 57s)

> You know, pretty well, and you could do a roguelike mode there. Yeah, sure. Why not? I wonder what rewards you can get out of it, but that seems sensible, especially since works better with co-op, I'm sure.

(26m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah, they don't say a huge amount for or about it. Um

(26m 16s)

> The let me just click through to this link because I also haven't played this game yet

(26m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Man

(26m 22s) **Al:**

> though

(26m 24s)

> So it's a dream land apparently

(26m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Is in level

(26m 27s) **Al:**

> The you go to so it's a separate world that you go to to do the roguelite bit and

(26m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Of course makes sense, you know, I

(26m 34s) **Al:**

> It looks like it's car. It's it looks like it's just a combat focused version

(26m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that that makes sense

(26m 39s) **Al:**

> Which presumably the combat's in the over

(26m 43s) **Kevin:**

> It is yeah, I it is a shame because

(26m 48s)

> You know in fantasy life you have these different

(26m 51s)

> jobs or lives or whatever you want to call them. Right you can be a coper, an artist or a

(26m 57s)

> paladin or whatever and all the co-op stuff is focused on the combat because that's the logical

(27m 3s)

> choice that's what you could work but I wish you could do co-op with I don't know cooking or

(27m 9s)

> for blacksmithing or whatever but I don't know how you do that so say lovey go fight stuff

(27m 16s) **Al:**

> Maybe I'll play this game one.

(27m 17s) **Kevin:**

> like fantasy life. I mean I will I know

(27m 21s)

> will on day like locomot. [laughs]

## Cult Of The Lamb Woolhaven

(27m 25s) **Al:**

> Next, we have cult of the lamb will haven this is their next update that is we have a release date

(27m 31s)

> It is coming out on the 22nd of January

(27m 34s)

> And it's a bunch of winter based stuff which we we knew we knew before but

(27m 41s)

> What I did and what we didn't know before was that winter is coming to the village as well

(27m 47s)

> So it's not just like because I assumed it would just be like other winter areas that you would go to with the you know

(27m 53s)

> like you're going down your combo.

(27m 55s)

> You're going to have to get stuff and bring them back. No, it looks like winter is coming here village and you'll have to adapt to surround.

(28m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Um, which, I mean, that's kind of wild because survival could already be hard in that thing, like,

(28m 10s)

> I, I, that seems difficult. You can throw snowballs. That's pretty cool. Like, you know what, good for

(28m 16s)

> color of the lane. Look how long it's, it's still going on this far in and we're still getting new stuff.

(28m 21s)

> That's pretty cool. Well, Haven's a good name. What a messed up little game. I love it.

(28m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and it's free.

(28m 28s)

> Oh, wait, no, it's not free. My bad. We'll have in part, uh, it's a paid DLC.

(28m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Ah, well, that's fine. It's worth it. I promise you it's worth it.

(28m 32s) **Al:**

> My bad. I missed that before.

(28m 36s)

> It is, uh, 15 pounds.

(28m 40s)

> So well, that would be presumably like,

(28m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it sounds about right. Well, let's see, 17 USD. There you go. That little sheet deals with

(28m 48s) **Al:**

> So close.

(28m 52s) **Kevin:**

> a lot of stuff. I just got to say a lot of other course watching the trailer.

(28m 57s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, they're also trying to run a cult. So like don't feel too bad for them.

(29m 1s) **Kevin:**

> That's true. That is very true, bought it on itself.

## Sun Haven 3.0

(29m 7s) **Al:**

> And our final piece of news, we actually have a lot more news, but I decided not to include it in this episode because we're going to have a full

(29m 14s)

> news only, episode catching up on everything soon, but...

(29m 18s)

> The last big piece of news I wanted to cover was Sun Haven have released their 3.0 update, The Great City.

(29m 25s)

> And this adds a whole new region, which is obviously a great city.

(29m 33s)

> And I mean, do I doubt it? That would be an incredible coincidence.

(29m 35s) **Kevin:**

> - Great as war haven.

(29m 41s)

> - Yeah, bye y'all.

(29m 42s) **Al:**

> And obviously, you know, new storyline, new romansibles.

(29m 48s)

> But also new craftable items, new shops, new clothes, furniture, it's...

(29m 53s) **Kevin:**

> I'm almost really torn when I hear new romansibles because that is a cool big thing to add,

(29m 59s)

> but also like, you know, how are you going to integrate that when you're on an existing

(30m 4s)

> file, probably?

(30m 5s)

> I think you've already said, you know, or you're a good, just start a new file.

(30m 8s) **Al:**

> go romance someone else, you know?

(30m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Let's see.

(30m 13s)

> That's the only logical solution to any update ever.

(30m 15s) **Al:**

> Well, I mean, that's that's why I do every stardew update, right?

(30m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(30m 18s)

> Yeah.

(30m 19s)

> See?

(30m 20s)

> See?

(30m 21s)

> You get it.

(30m 23s)

> Oh, no, you're, there's a new farm chai.

(30m 23s) **Al:**

> Oh, let's see if I can succeed in not doing that next time.

(30m 30s)

> Ah, there isn't there, yes, of course. Look, maybe I'll be a farm type I don't want to do.

(30m 30s) **Kevin:**

> What are you going to do?

(30m 33s)

> Not.

(30m 34s)

> Okay.

(30m 34s) **Al:**

> Right, maybe I'll be on another beach farm.

(30m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(30m 38s) **Al:**

> Don't like the beach farm.

(30m 42s)

> So that's all of our news for this episode. As I say, there will be more in the next episode.

## What We Are Looking Forward To In 2026

(30m 48s) **Al:**

> Our main topic for this episode is we are going to talk about what we're looking forward to most

(30m 53s)

> in farming and cottage core games, specifically in 2026. We have quite a few in the list

(31m)

> upcoming this year and quite a lot that might be coming.

(31m 6s)

> Shall we just, how many, how many?

(31m 8s)

> did you have on your list?

(31m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, like maybe three but it's really one and fortunately I try to pick some other ones

(31m 11s) **Al:**

> Okay.

(31m 12s)

> Okay.

(31m 13s)

> Shall I, shall, shall, shall, I will, I will start then and well, no, no, I want, I want to talk

(31m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Or should we just get out of the way the big one?

(31m 23s)

> Okay

(31m 24s) **Al:**

> about that at the end, right?

(31m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay, okay, fine. All right. I mean I can I can give you one

(31m 26s) **Al:**

> So, so let me go for one first and then if you've got another one you can do that and then

(31m 34s)

> I'll bunch my other two together because they're kind of very similar and then we'll

(31m 38s)

> go with the big one at the end.

## Witchbrook

(31m 41s) **Al:**

> So I'm quite looking forward to Witchbrook, which is obviously the Witch farming game.

(31m 47s)

> It is maybe I'm a little bit one trick in some cases but like I really like how the

(31m 55s)

> brooms aspect seems to work in this game, I like that and yeah, it looks really fun.

(32m) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, no, that's fair.

(32m 4s) **Al:**

> It looks like the most freeing--

(32m 8s)

> movement in a 2D farming game, which I'm excited to see how that works.

(32m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, hold on pulling it up, but you know, that's that's a good that's a good point

(32m 20s)

> Because you don't think about movement too much in these 2d farming type games even though it's probably a big deal

(32m 29s)

> Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's fair. Um, well, yeah, I don't know if that's to say others

(32m 36s) **Al:**

> Well, we'll have to see how the, how the, the, the brim actually works because it's possible like everything we see is just like, you're just going faster. So it's possible that it's, it's more limited than I was expecting. But I'm hoping that it is more, you know, nice and flexible and like you can, you know, fly high like.

(32m 56s) **Kevin:**

> you lay in on an upper level, right? That's the winner or that's what you want.

(33m) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'd like, yeah, I'm up high and I want to just like fly over a drop rather than.

(33m 6s)

> you have to go down the stairs and stuff like that. Yeah, like, absolutely. Like, I want to be able to, to do that. I think that would be fun. And presumably you will not start out with the brim. Right. So it becomes our faster. It's like the horse in Stardew. Right. Like you'll get it later on.

(33m 24s)

> But I think it could be really fun. I think being able, having to like start off by walking round everywhere and then eventually you get this room that allows you to move much faster and over shorter distances.

(33m 36s)

> Would be, would be fun.

(33m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, now that that is a one cool thing. I'll say that.

(33m 42s)

> Um, you know, otherwise, it looks fine, which book does it?

(33m 46s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I get why people wouldn't necessarily be excited about it because it's like it's a

(33m 52s)

> Stardew-esque

(33m 54s)

> Farming game. Oh, I did see one where oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. I I've finally seen something in one of the videos

(33m 59s)

> Where they do show someone going up on the broom and over rooftops

(34m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you do but the question is in your land from there. That's that's no kicker for me

(34m 9s) **Al:**

> Look I if I can't land on a rooftop that's fine

(34m 13s)

> But it definitely looks like you better because there's like there's

(34m 16s)

> overlapping bridges and stuff like that like as long as I can get up to those bridges, that's the important thing.

(34m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's fair

(34m 23s) **Al:**

> So we'll see we'll see how that is but I'm always looking for more interesting movement in 2d farming games.

(34m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, that is a that is a good one to look for a good dude mechanic thing to judge to look forward to agree.

(34m 40s) **Al:**

> Alright, what's your other one that you thought of?

(34m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Well, uh, you know what, I'll, I'll

(34m 46s)

> play off the witch thing. And I don't even know if I'm going to play it, but I'm excited about it coming out.

## Neverway

(34m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Neverway looks dang good still. You know, our cottage war scary. I genuinely spooky.

(35m 1s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(35m 2s) **Kevin:**

> You know, it's, it's this spooky one. Um, yeah, I don't even know if I'll get to it, um, but it looks really good. And, um, it's so hopeful. It succeeds because I think the variety in this space is much appreciated. Um, someone putting this much care into the horror aspect of a cottage core game. I like it.

(35m 3s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(35m 28s)

> I don't disagree with you. What I would say is I don't think Stardew but Horder is that original

(35m 34s)

> line A idea. I think it has been been done. But it does, this does have certainly have a unique,

(35m 37s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(35m 39s)

> - Who, who?

(35m 43s) **Al:**

> not necessarily art style, but the color palette makes it feel unique because it's all kind of

(35m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. I agree with that. You're right. It's not, it's not reinventing

(35m 48s) **Al:**

> purpley and dark.

(35m 56s) **Kevin:**

> the wheel, per se. You're right. Other play. I mean, how would you talk about the, what

(36m)

> the way I'm right? Um, like, so it's, it's maybe not hyper novel, but it looks really well

(36m 8s)

> done, if nothing else. Um, yeah, it does.

(36m 10s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, I mean having said that call the lamb does lean into the humor of it right

(36m 14s)

> What is this doesn't look like it's leaning into the humor? This looks like it's truly trying to be harder and

(36m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Now, now the streets poof.

(36m 20s) **Al:**

> The farming stuff is just like a mechanic through this horror RPG

(36m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(36m 26s) **Al:**

> Horror is always a difficult one because it's like what is one person's scary is one person's ah wherever

(36m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(36m 38s)

> I have an idea for new or farming game.

(36m 42s)

> It's one just sitting 20, 26 in America.

(36m 45s) **Al:**

> So I have two that are not definite. One of them is Fields of Mystery, a 1.0. We didn't

(36m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Ah, oh, what else you got on your list, though?

## Fields Of Mistria

(36m 59s) **Al:**

> get that last year. I'm hoping we get it this year, be fun to play more of that.

(37m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Well, Snaggo come out, came out. We need another goal post-mover.

(37m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. I mean, I feel like with what I've seen them doing, I feel like it could well

(37m 15s)

> be the year for Field of Mystery, a 1.0, I guess. We'll see, but I think I'm looking

(37m 20s)

> hopeful at least. I don't think they have a date set. I don't think they're going to

(37m 24s)

> an indication, but we're now sitting at, was it 18 months? Roughly since it's, it entered

(37m 30s)

> early access. So hopefully this year, you know, we'll see what happens.

(37m 37s) **Kevin:**

> We've got the coins with the, you know, the clothing removal coins.

(37m 38s) **Al:**

> Why do we have to, why do we have to talk about that?

(37m 42s) **Kevin:**

> But they can't, you can't.

(37m 45s) **Al:**

> them again? Yeah, clearly. But the, the other one, which is even less certain, is that

(37m 45s) **Kevin:**

> That's works.

(37m 46s)

> Oh, what a good journey.

(37m 49s)

> They have their priorities straight, that's why.

(37m 51s)

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

## Story Of Seasons

(37m 58s) **Al:**

> I would be very surprised if there isn't something story of seasons this year. Mainly

(38m 3s)

> because we haven't had a new main series game since, was it 22 was pioneers of all of

(38m 10s)

> Let me check I was twenty twenty one

(38m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's been that long

(38m 15s) **Al:**

> was the last time we got a new main series, uh, story of seasons game. So we're now at this will be five years this year and

(38m 25s) **Kevin:**

> It's the 30th anniversary, right?

(38m 25s) **Al:**

> It's the 30 it's it is it's the 30th anniversary. So that's the other thing like I feel like they've probably been like aiming for this and

(38m 34s)

> We do know there's stuff because they announced

(38m 37s)

> Things like was it two years ago. They were like. Oh, yeah, we're gonna have two new games

(38m 45s)

> One of which is a traditional story of seasons and one of which is a more I think they said more multiplayer focused

(38m 52s) **Kevin:**

> I think that should game.

(38m 53s) **Al:**

> Well, they didn't they've not really said much about it and they haven't mentioned anything since then

(39m 2s) **Kevin:**

> They're bringing back the four girl series. Yeah!

(39m 7s) **Al:**

> Oh, goodness. Um, so I would be surprised if neither of them came out this year if I had to guess probably the

(39m 15s)

> Standard one will come out this year and the multiplayer one will come out next year or the year after

(39m 20s)

> But I'm very intrigued just what it is. They're doing with the multiplayer one, right?

(39m 24s)

> Well, what is it? What does it mean? Is it an MMO or like what are they doing like the that all they told us was it's going to be more multiplayer focused

(39m 32s)

> That's literally all they said

(39m 35s)

> And then the other one they kind of and the other one they kind of showed like a very short clip of just the cow in the chicken in a field

(39m 36s) **Kevin:**

> So there's Smash Bros.

(39m 45s) **Al:**

> They're like, okay, that tells me nothing. I mean, it looked good, but that doesn't tell you anything

(39m 52s)

> So it'll be interesting to see I'm a little bit more hopeful obviously pioneers of all of time was fine

(39m 57s)

> But none of the like characters or stories were particularly interesting

(40m 3s)

> But I think they've shown with

(40m 5s)

> Grandpa's are last year that they can still do that and so hopefully they will

(40m 10s)

> Still do that. I don't think we'll get a remake this year. I'm

(40m 15s)

> Suspect that but I hope they don't do a remake this year and I hope they're focusing on getting out one of these new games

(40m 22s) **Kevin:**

> story of seasons original remani yeah

(40m 25s) **Al:**

> Look, I mean I look I would be up for a port of that. I don't think it needs to be a remake

(40m 30s)

> I think but I think a

(40m 32s)

> Story season's port to switch would be nice, but

(40m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, now with three item slots.

(40m 36s) **Al:**

> Because I've still not played that one cuz I need to go back

(40m 40s)

> Oh, you mean the original harvest moon you don't mean the original story seasons

(40m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No, no, I'm an original artist.

(40m 45s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah, no, I don't think I don't think we'll get that. I don't I don't

(40m 47s) **Kevin:**

> I'm going to original OG.

(40m 50s)

> I actually, but no, original story of seasons from 3DS.

(40m 52s) **Al:**

> Well, what if you

(40m 54s)

> Yeah, that's so that's why I was thinking that like this I think it would be fun to port the first the three 3DS story of seasons

(40m 54s) **Kevin:**

> That would be a good port.

(41m 5s) **Al:**

> I know like a multi-pack. I think that would be fun like you don't have to change them a huge amount

(41m 9s)

> You just need to figure out the two screen thing that a lot of games have already kind of figured out

(41m 15s)

> And I think most of the story seasons ones. They just used it for a map

(41m 19s)

> So there's probably not a lot they need to do. I think it would be fun to do our

(41m 25s)

> Multi-pack of those the first three story seasons games for 3DS put them over to switch that would be good fun

(41m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that would be.

(41m 30s) **Al:**

> I would definitely play three of tones again. I really loved three of tones

(41m 35s)

> That's still one of my top ones for characters like the characters in that game where we're one of my favorites of any farming games

(41m 43s)

> Obviously, obviously not.

(41m 45s)

> than Stardew, I'm not trying to say that, but like,

(41m 47s)

> certainly it might be second or third. Um, and I, I really do want to play

(41m 52s)

> the first two, but I just haven't, because, you know, 3DS.

(41m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Dory of seasons 30 year phones. We did it ma'am

(42m 4s) **Al:**

> So yeah, so yeah, I don't know what we're getting,

(42m 7s)

> story of seasons this year, but we're getting,

(42m 8s)

> we must be getting something.

(42m 10s)

> And so I'm looking forward to whatever that is,

(42m 11s) **Kevin:**

> I'm down for that. I just you know what just give me a game where I play as a cow. How about that? I'll take that I would venture

(42m 12s) **Al:**

> whether it's the new game, the new multiplayer game.

(42m 18s)

> Maybe that's what the multiplayer game is.

(42m 20s)

> It's just everyone's a cow.

(42m 24s)

> All right, Kevin, take us home.

(42m 26s)

> What's your, what's your, what was you really looking forward to this year?

(42m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, um, you know, I'm going to I'm going to give you two for I came with two other ones one of them

(42m 35s)

> I put a question mark because I don't know if I'm actually excited or not, but maybe

(42m 35s) **Al:**

> Why?

(42m 39s)

> Okay, go for it.

## Artisan Story

(42m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Artisan story looks

(42m 43s)

> Interesting. I guess this is a question mark

(42m 46s)

> So my question mark because I like monster farming ranching. I don't know if they're gonna do it well

(42m 52s)

> Well, that's a cool little you know, Octopathisk art style, so that's kind of cool

(42m 58s)

> But that's kind of all it's got going.

(43m)

> For I don't know how well it's actually going to come out, but it has my an eyebrow race. Let's say that

(43m 7s)

> The other one it's maybe low-hanging fruit, but super zoo story. I like animals. I want to

## Super Zoo Story

(43m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I nearly put the, I nearly put that one on my list, but I didn't, I thought

(43m 20s)

> for it was probably enough for me.

(43m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and I mean like it's it's yeah, it's low hanging fruit like I said

(43m 29s)

> It's just stardew, but to do instead, and you know, all right

(43m 33s) **Al:**

> But that's about, but Kevin, that's a big, that's a big butt, right?

(43m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(43m 37s) **Al:**

> Like a lot of, a lot of these itch stargy butt.

(43m 40s)

> Their butts are small.

(43m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(43m 41s) **Al:**

> This is a big butt, right?

(43m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it is

(43m 43s) **Al:**

> Like this is, this is, this is, you're running a zoo.

(43m 46s)

> That is a huge difference.

(43m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(43m 47s)

> Yeah, it is it is right like I'm I'm yeah, I'm over simplifying here and

(43m 52s)

> You know, come to me to hyperbolicism, whatever

(43m 56s)

> But I mean like even just roots of pacho right start do but pretty starting. No, that was actually good enough to just if I play in that game

(44m 5s)

> And and and and it felt good, right

(44m 8s)

> This feels as big as roots of pacho like that's that's a good premise run a zoo instead

(44m 14s) **Al:**

> I'd say maybe even bigger because like yes, Ritzapatra. I don't think it is just stardew, but prehistoric, right?

(44m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe yeah

(44m 21s) **Al:**

> Like there's a lot that makes that up, but it is if you think about it fundamentally

(44m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(44m 26s) **Al:**

> just kind of like a skin, right on top of it. It's

(44m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that is

(44m 30s) **Al:**

> whereas this is like fundamental differences to how you play

(44m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I agree

(44m 35s) **Al:**

> because you never have to think about the public in your farm. You're farming for yourself.

(44m 41s)

> What is a zoo you are fundamentally

(44m 44s)

> doing for other people's consumption, right?

(44m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, you're right. That's a good point. Yeah, I wonder how that's gonna integrate. I just and then like

(44m 52s) **Al:**

> Really interested. Yeah. I mean, it's possible. It's possible that there's not a huge amount of that

(44m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(44m 57s) **Al:**

> because it's not a management game. So it's not going to be like, you know, rollercoaster tycoon

(45m 2s)

> or whatever. But there has to be something. There has to be something there. Otherwise, it's like,

(45m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Right, right, and that's the interesting part, right?

(45m 9s) **Al:**

> am I doing a zoo or am I just doing a weird farm with different animals, right?

(45m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I guess we'll see, but I mean, yeah, that's why I put on the list though, right? Like that's that's enough to

(45m 23s)

> Are they gonna balance that right cuz on the one hand you have let's make a zoo where it's as you know

(45m 28s)

> It's pure management and you can just have infinite number of animals because you just grow and grow right here

(45m 34s)

> You're not gonna obviously have that

(45m 37s)

> In fact, I'm sure relative to that kind of game. It's gonna be very limited in space and what you can do

(45m 44s)

> So what and.

(45m 45s)

> We'll scan you have how big is it going to be you know how's all that going to operate? I don't know but we'll see. I'm excited. I like animals. I like the idea of running soon taking care of animals and whatnot. So we'll see. But that that's why it's on the list. It has my attention. Okay, but now. Okay, who cares we we said those things that have an episode, but we don't really care because.

(46m 2s) **Al:**

> All right, it's time to talk about the big one, right?

(46m 11s) **Kevin:**

> 2026 is one thing and one thing only

## Pokopia

(46m 15s) **Kevin:**

> you're the PCOPIA baby. Oh.

(46m 17s) **Al:**

> Polcopia. I think the thing is I think the thing is if this game is good

(46m 21s)

> It's it'll be hard to beat at the end of the year

(46m 26s)

> Now that is a that is a big butt a big if that is a big if right because it could be bad

(46m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'm confident. I could be, yeah, it's the bar is going to be very high, assuming it's

(46m 33s) **Al:**

> But if it's good

(46m 36s)

> If it's good it's going to be really hard

(46m 39s)

> For something else to end up

(46m 49s) **Kevin:**

> well done, right? Like, and I, again, I have high hump confidence in octaves. I believe in the

(46m 56s)

> try and quest Bill Bush team. Um, can we take more?

(47m 1s)

> And so yeah, I expect good things and and they're just putting on the the Pokemon paint layered paint job on top and I'm exaggerating because much more than that, but like that's that's just a winning recipe. You know what I want us to do I need.

(47m 17s)

> Um, oh, I and it's so close to two months. That's gonna be your no time. Holy moly.

(47m 25s)

> Um, what a, what a way to start off the year.

(47m 25s) **Al:**

> Yep, and it's going to come out it's going to come out literally a week after Pokemon day, right?

(47m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(47m 31s) **Al:**

> Like we're going to go find out what's happening for the rest of the year with Pokemon and then

(47m 36s)

> boom, Pokepia's out and you're like oh, no

(47m 40s)

> Okay, hello, it's here

(47m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. It's, yeah. Oh, my it's the uncomfortable truth. It very well made to the best

(47m 50s)

> Pokemon date to go. I see it. I mean, and, and you know, we don't, we don't even have to

(47m 53s) **Al:**

> whoa I hope not but

(48m) **Kevin:**

> talk about it because what else, what else, we haven't gotten any trailers. We don't need

(48m 4s)

> anything else. It's, it's, we know what it is. Just give it to me. Just inject into my veins

(48m 4s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(48m 12s)

> I think the thing is that so so I I I liked dragon quest builders too, but I never got through the story because I just I wasn't caring as much about the story, right?

(48m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(48m 22s) **Al:**

> But this is Pokemon

(48m 24s)

> So like I will get through the story because I care about Pokemon

(48m 28s)

> So of course I'm gonna go get through whatever story is

(48m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. No.

(48m 32s) **Al:**

> That doesn't mean the story will be good necessarily. It might be good. It might be bad. We'll see

(48m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(48m 37s) **Al:**

> But I think it's totally expected that I will play this

(48m 42s)

> for a long time, whether it's good or bad.

(48m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and and I'm just excited because I I think the scale might be a lot bigger than we think

(48m 51s)

> Like all the

(48m 52s) **Al:**

> Oh, I think absolutely, there's no way they give us the Dragonite flying without having a large map.

(48m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, in fact, I have earned whispers on the wind. It might be the entire can't so region now

(49m 7s) **Al:**

> That would be interesting, like an entire post-apocalyptic cantor.

(49m 15s)

> Now just cantor, because how do you justify not being able to get to Joto?

(49m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, I I don't know that I'm really big mountains

(49m 23s) **Al:**

> That would be an interesting one.

(49m 27s)

> I really hope that if it actually is cantor, right, like if it actually is cantor,

(49m 32s)

> and it's clearly cantor, I hope that they explain.

(49m 35s)

> like the, the, the, there's a-

(49m 37s)

> it's actually like a thing to it. And it's not just like, oh, we did an area and we just made it look like canto, right? Like if it's just like, oh, it's canto because that's an Easter egg. I'll be really disappointed because I'm like, you could just done anything. Like why would you do this? Like I hope if they actually are doing that, that they have a story to tell about why they're doing it.

(49m 57s) **Kevin:**

> And then the story is Gen one or spring money. That's a story.

(50m 2s) **Al:**

> But if that were but if that no no no no no because if that were the case they would have told us by now

(50m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Um, but I mean, injure that idea or true. I don't know. I mean,

(50m 8s) **Al:**

> Like we don't because cause us obsessive Pokemon fans are gonna notice it, but they don't need

(50m 15s)

> They're gonna get the obsessive Pokefans Pokemon fans no matter what they need to the casual Pokemon fans

(50m 21s)

> And the casual Pokemon fans won't care unless they tell you

(50m 22s) **Kevin:**

> That's true. That's true. Oh, free. Maybe Mount Snorlax is the same Snorlax. I was blocking

(50m 32s)

> that one route. Nobody ever to move.

(50m 33s) **Al:**

> so this oh so this is the this is the world in which red doesn't continue on his journey and and and there for an apocalypse occurs and and that's no likes are still living there.

(50m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Team rocket one. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. See, we figured it out. Team rocket one

(50m 52s) **Al:**

> look if that's the extent of the story if that's the extent of the story.

(50m 53s) **Kevin:**

> and depleted all the resources and people and humanity died and so it's left.

(51m 3s) **Al:**

> that you know what fine i'll take it like it but I i just yeah no seriously I would like I think that would be something right like I just I what I really i'm not really hope not for is for them to be like oh no it's not can't to it just looks like can't.

(51m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. I take it. I say that jokingly, but I take it.

(51m 24s)

> Yeah, yeah

(51m 25s) **Al:**

> that that that that just that just feels like the worst of all options like either make it can to and tell us why we are in this world or make.

(51m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. I mean if nothing else

(51m 33s) **Al:**

> it something different because to make it look like until you have to do that deliberately.

(51m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, and I'm curious like can we you know, let's just assume it is cancer, right? Can we fix up the whole region?

(51m 47s) **Al:**

> Oh, my. Oh, goodness. I mean, if it's like dragon quest builders, too, then yes, it's sandbox. It's sandbox. It's sandbox's sandbox's sandbox, right?

(51m 47s) **Kevin:**

> That's the pretty dope

(51m 53s)

> Yeah, right right like

(51m 57s)

> Yeah, yeah, so that's

(51m 58s) **Al:**

> There are two options. They're okay. There are three options here. One is it's not canto.

(52m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(52m 4s) **Al:**

> Two is two is it's canto and it's entire and it's sandbox. So you can do whatever you want. It's an entire post-apocalyptic world.

(52m 10s)

> Three is it's not a post-apocalyptic world. It's just Sinabar Island that's post-apocalypse and so the only

(52m 17s)

> sandbox is that island and everything else is still normal and you're like, you build up and eventually you go and explore and find out. No, it was just something horrible in Sinabar and the rest of the region is fine.

(52m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. There you go. Well, I could see any of these. You're right. I'm very excited for this game.

(52m 35s) **Al:**

> I too, I'm excited. I think when I'm talking about it, like, because obviously I'm always thinking forward to the game of the year episode, right?

(52m 43s)

> I think the reason why it probably has its best chance is that you know that this will be the game that all three hosts will have played.

(52m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(52m 54s) **Al:**

> And so if it's good, everyone will have it on their list, right? So something has to be something has to be even better.

(52m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah by default

(53m 3s)

> Or I

(53m 5s) **Al:**

> To even get onto two people's list.

(53m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Mean I don't yeah, I don't I don't I don't I don't see it look

(53m 11s)

> I look down our list the list or the list you have of all the 2026 really is there there's nothing in the same fall part is as

(53m 19s)

> Bocopia, I'm sorry

(53m 20s) **Al:**

> If a story of seasons comes out, or fields of mystery, I think those are the only two that could,

(53m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Baby

(53m 28s) **Al:**

> if assuming the Pocopaedas' good, this is obviously assuming that it's good, it could be bad,

(53m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh.

(53m 34s) **Al:**

> we might hate it. But assuming that a Pocopaedas' good, the only things I think that could be to

(53m 41s)

> are a new story of seasons, or fields of mystery.

(53m 45s) **Kevin:**

> oh yeah I guess so but it's it's gonna be good look I saw the trailers it showed me

(53m 51s)

> the trailer says to me this is good

(53m 54s) **Al:**

> Sure. Sure. And trailers have never lied to you before.

(53m 54s) **Kevin:**

> I don't

(54m 2s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think the most interesting thing to me about gay years is not necessarily

(54m 8s)

> look forward to and what I think is going to be good for the year, but what comes out that we

(54m 12s)

> didn't know about, right? Like this time last year, the five that I said I was looking forward to

(54m 13s) **Kevin:**

> I guess sleeper, I mean, you're, yeah.

(54m 22s) **Al:**

> where Snacko 1.0.

(54m 24s)

> Fields of Mystery are 1.0, Starbirds, Hello Kitty Island Adventure and Super Seuss story.

(54m 33s) **Kevin:**

> - Oh yeah.

(54m 34s) **Al:**

> What you said was Tales of Psycue, Hello Kitty, Super Seuss story and Gaucho and the Grasslands.

(54m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay, that wasn't a bad to list

(54m 45s) **Al:**

> This time last year, we didn't know about the story of seasons that ended up being one of my favorite games of the year.

(54m 52s)

> You didn't know about Wunderstop.

(54m 54s) **Kevin:**

> - No.

(54m 54s) **Al:**

> Which ended up being your favorite game of the year?

(54m 57s)

> Like there's all that that's what I find most exciting is there are games that will come out this year that we don't know about yet.

(55m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's true. I forgot tail looks like you're just dead

(55m 8s) **Al:**

> I forget did it come out this year or not I was always a bit like interesting that you chose it at the

(55m 19s)

> time right yeah sure fun is as yeah it's an early access it's not it's not in one point or

(55m 20s) **Kevin:**

> You change in animals. That's pretty cool

(55m 27s)

> Okay, okay, I don't feel bad then, but it's still

(55m 27s) **Al:**

> yet um it's uh yeah yes it's a fun concept but a concept does not a good game

(55m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(55m 35s)

> Yeah, well, true. Oh, that's true. Oh, so I mean you got a point like honestly, it's it was slim pickens this year

(55m 43s)

> in my opinion for looking at the

(55m 46s)

> The list saying they're coming out in 2026. I'm so
