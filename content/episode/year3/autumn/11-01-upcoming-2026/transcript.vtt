<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, super, super fun news day. We'll not talk about that because I don't think this I mean, I don't think that personally. I don't think it's a good plan to invade other countries and steal their, their leaders, even if they are terrible people. I just don't think that's a great thing in general. Just putting that out there.

12
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.939
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

28
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:41.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh man. Well, look, I feel you'll understand when you listen to the discussion and how we get to that point, you'll understand why we went.

29
00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.699

31
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Spoilers for the game of the year episode

32
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.620
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: it's nothing wrong with snack or nothing--okay, you're spoilers if you haven't listened--there's

33
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: nothing wrong with snack, oh, it's a fine game. In fact, in other years, it probably would win,

34
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: like I don't have any issue with it. Well, you know, it would win. In my book, it would win, let's

35
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: What it did win, but okay

36
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Let's see that.

37
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.259
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - I just think it's not going to be a great farming game,

38
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: and I think there will be other great farming games.

39
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.819
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Wander stop.

40
00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.419
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: We're only getting one of those every,

41
00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.620
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I don't know when we're getting the next one.

42
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.080
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Good. I'm glad. I'm glad we're gonna get another one.

43
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's my big, that's my big put, look.

44
00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.099
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh my goodness, okay, we're moving on.

45
00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.360
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: [laughing]

46
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.520
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Look, I am glad that you liked it so much. That is old.

47
00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.860
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, all right, moving on.

48
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Well, what have you been up to?

49
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.159
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So, yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, no way. I haven't said we're gonna have some news.

50
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I'm putting on you. What's going on?

51
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.840
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But first of all, yeah, some game news, some name, game,

52
00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: What?

53
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.460
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: The non-bombing kind?

54
00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:58.680
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: news. But first of all, I'm still letting you say it.

55
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.780
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, stuff happens still, apparently.

56
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.740
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Wait, what are you being up to?

57
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.300
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: What are you being up to?

58
00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:09.960
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, there we go. Okay, cool. I haven't been up to huge amounts gaming-wise, because holidays

59
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, all right, what have you been up to now? I'm putting it on you.

60
00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: What's going on?

61
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.479
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: are always complicated with kids. But I have been pouring my way through the Pokémon

62
00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:21.079
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Legends the AADOC. I finished the main story.

63
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You made all the donuts now we can feed them to the ampa, yay.

64
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:29.720
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Ah. So, here's a couple of things, but they don't ask. First up, I don't, I still don't like

65
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.240
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: the timers, right? I don't like the timers at all for two reasons. One, I don't like the stress.

66
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.879
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And two, when I'm in a place where I've like used done everything and I've used up,

67
00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I've done all the things I need to do in that area, and there's nothing left for me to do,

68
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.399
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: like there's not a Pokémon that I want to show you on. There's no task to get, there's no items to get.

69
00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:50.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And I'm sitting there with a few minutes left on my timer. That's wasted time I could be doing

70
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: something, but there's nothing I can be doing, and it's really annoying. So, it's like you have to

71
00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:59.399
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: constantly be judging, which is the right donut to do. And it's very frustrating. And if you make

72
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:04.279
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: a mistake, it all too saves when you use a donut. So, you can't then just reset it.

73
00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.040
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yes, listeners, I know a bit of the backup save. I'm not doing that. It's too much effort.

74
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And I, I just find that is just as frustrating as running out of time, right? Because it's like

75
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: wasted time that doesn't feel good? I also... I don't

76
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.560
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You're... or...

77
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.279
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: like how the recipes are not consistent, like they wear for carties and sandwiches. Like if you

78
00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:34.360
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: use the same berries you get different effects out of it, right? So you can't consistently get

79
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.040
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: sparkling power for a specific type. You just have to keep doing it and eventually you'll get what

80
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.720
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: you want. And again, it saves when you create a donut. So you can't even like save scum that. Yes again,

81
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.720
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I know about the--

82
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: backup save too much effort for making a dora.

83
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.720
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, that's okay

84
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's just weird decisions. It's like the Pokemon game free continually like to be sure that they don't like us resetting things.

85
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And I just-- I don't get why they would restrict it in that way.

86
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It just seems like such an annoying thing.

87
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like, I mean, it all comes down from the fact that they didn't allow you not to have auto saves.

88
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It doesn't solve the problem that they want because they still have the backup saves.

89
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And they need the backup saves. They can't get rid of the backup saves.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

91
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It just means that it's more effort to do it.

92
00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:39.740
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's well, I think on the one hand if your game is in such a way that

93
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.699
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Players are encouraged to reset like I mean, I don't know personally. I as if I were a game dev

94
00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.699
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I wouldn't want that

95
00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.660
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That feels like a flaw, but

96
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.720
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: - Yes, but there's wanting it and going out of your way

97
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.079
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: to make it difficult.

98
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.860
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, that's true

99
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.040
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, but yeah, they're not solving it

100
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.680
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Also, I wouldn't want to reset.

101
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.199
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I wouldn't want to reset the donuts

102
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.120
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: if they were consistent.

103
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.560
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like the other previous things we've done, right?

104
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.300
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, that's

105
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.399
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like I really liked, I really liked how curries and sandwiches.

106
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.319
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, curries didn't have any effects, right?

107
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.240
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But they at least they've made the same thing

108
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:16.300
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.480
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: when you use the same ingredients.

110
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.800
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And sandwiches, if you use the same ingredients,

111
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.319
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: you've got the same effects.

112
00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like, I don't like this, like, "Oh, make a--"

113
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: You know, use up all your donuts on this thing that might make sparkling power three, or it might make humongle power one. Okay, why?

114
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.079
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha oh yeah it is baffling isn't it and not just this like so many

115
00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:41.839
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: things a Pokemon does like their refusal to learn from themselves I don't know I don't know um

116
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.379
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: However, other than that, I have been enjoying the DLC.

117
00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:53.699
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's not a particularly interesting story, it's kind of predictable, but what I've said

118
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

119
00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:57.459
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: a couple of times to people is, I think this is the funniest Pokémon has ever been.

120
00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:00.819
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, that's about to say although I hear that rain is pretty good though

121
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.899
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: At least on the side stuff the side change

122
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like I'm regularly laughing out loud during dialogue in this game, even more than the

123
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.439
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's pretty good. Um, that's pretty hype. Um, yeah. I wish they did a little more with this

124
00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:27.439
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: whole hyper space reality stuff. What? Yeah. I guess I'll take that. I also wish, well, I know,

125
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.339
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: - Yeah.

126
00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:33.600
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I'm, I'm getting into it, but okay, try to judge what's there. It's fine. I guess it would be a good

127
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.080
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: opportunity for other characters to show up. I'm just saying.

128
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.799
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah. Yeah, they could definitely have done more with it. Um, and I guess it does it does just feel like

129
00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:52.600
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: another example of, um, the continuation of, okay, we've done enough to sell this game. Let's

130
00:08:52.600 --> 00:09:01.159
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: move on to the next sort of thing and, okay, sure. I mean, I, this is the thing like I, I still,

131
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: door, door.

132
00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:06.919
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I'm enjoying it and I am still not regretting my purchase. I, I will continue to

133
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.480
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: buy the games because I continue to enjoy the games. Um, and, you know, you presumably

134
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:20.220
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: or not yet now, but uh, it's on my list. I would do wish to play the game.

135
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:32.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: still haven't bought the game. Eventually. So yeah, I, it's, yeah, I don't know. Blah. I'm enjoying it. I like it. There you go. But as always, there are

136
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.460
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah.

137
00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.620
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Uh, black.

138
00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:37.799
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, you're not here. Here's a question. Would you give up this game to get

139
00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.799
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Hope the mon's Z back in 20.

140
00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:07.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, I guess, but what it was also X, Y, and those are some dang good games!

141
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: No, I don't think so

142
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:56.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Because I I I mean Pokemon Z would have just been the same, but maybe with one extra story with Zygarde and actually like what we call this was more than that

143
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.460
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Much more

144
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.679
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: There were yeah, but that this Z would have just been the same. I don't want just X and Y again

145
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, I know.

146
00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.279
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Right like I won something different

147
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Bye, guys. Fine. I can't believe Sandy and Dexia didn't show up. This was their moment to show up.

148
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: You

149
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.460
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: There are many people that you question why they didn't turn up

150
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, I've played once a big one too, right? Let's do. Don't worry about it. Let's do it.

151
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.600
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's all right. We're in 2026. The Pokémon's 30th anniversary. I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about later in the year.

152
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:47.840
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Well, yeah, okay. So I have started this county. Um, the, the game that's, that's

153
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.320
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So that's what I've been up to. What have you been up to, Kevin?

154
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.279
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: cottagecore. So guess what? I may speak about that at length in, in the future on this

155
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.240
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: [laughs]

156
00:10:54.279 --> 00:11:00.320
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: very platform, spoiler. Um, all right. Now I'll, I'll give it a thumbs up so far right now.

157
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.759
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's doing what I want.

158
00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:03.600
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Wow.

159
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.080
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: There's one glaring spot, like not good.

160
00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:14.559
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, and it is the soft management,

161
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:18.080
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: like gameplay thing, specifically on controller.

162
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:24.200
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So what it is, the customer brings a number of items

163
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.279
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: to the register and you have to tally up their total, right?

164
00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:32.919
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's not terribly hard, it's fine, it works for the link,

165
00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.120
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: but on controller.

166
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.159
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You have to give you like a little number pad or you have to type in what if you're on controller you have to like move the control stick around in a

167
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:50.100
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's not even like moving the cursor around. It's like the center of the control stick like you know, neutral position is

168
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Eight or whatever and then you move to the diagonals to get the different number buttons

169
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Okay. Yeah, yeah.

170
00:11:55.759 --> 00:12:00.559
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, and and they have to hold like what's an LT to put a zero and

171
00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:04.039
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And it's not great, it's not a great solution.

172
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.679
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's like doing a rotary dial on a phone

173
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, to the... Yeah, basically.

174
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, and, and so when...

175
00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:14.080
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: For our younger for our younger listeners rotary dials were old phones that had a circular thing

176
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh my gosh.

177
00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:20.919
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Where you went from the start to go to the number and then let it run back and go ask your appearance or grandparents about it

178
00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:25.200
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I don't know if we actually have any young listeners. We're probably all our age

179
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.279
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Oh, my.

180
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.980
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, hopefully.

181
00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:30.860
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Dale and go ask your repair.

182
00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:41.120
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Anyways, uh, but so it's not a great field to the to the gameplay

183
00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:44.179
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: mechanic, the primary thing of checking people out.

184
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:47.580
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, while other than I'm enjoying it, um,

185
00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:50.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, like I said, once I dive deeper into it, well, well.

186
00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:10.379
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Who thoughts on it more, but overall not disappointing so far. So yeah, that's this county. Let's see what else. Oh boy, you night. Oh, man. I haven't talked about you night in a minute. Um. Oh wow. Oh

187
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:16.100
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh yes, well, we got recently. I've not really been paying attention to Pokemon you know in about the last nine months. I've barely heard anything about it

188
00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:19.159
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Coincidental date maybe

189
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, so they did a big update in

190
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:33.799
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: December I believe it was and they it is the how should I put it so you know it has constantly been on an arms race to take more of your money

191
00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:45.559
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: um they each yep yeah absolutely right it's a big gacha thing in general but very guilty as they

192
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:41.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yep, like all of the Pokémon games, yeah.

193
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah.

194
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:50.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: My money is sunk into Go and TCG Pocket, so I definitely can't do another one.

195
00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:53.720
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: injured there you go

196
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.120
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: fair enough um so it's been you know it's been clear like yeah here's a 30 more passes for

197
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:06.120
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: special costumes and whatever yada yada yada um and while annoying it's been at least for me it was

198
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:13.240
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: tolerable um because there's a lot of pop-ups but you can ignore it now they have they broken the

199
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:19.480
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: the glott the emergency the emergency glass breaking case of we want more money they have changed the

200
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: acquisition system for new pokemon um so before you play the game uh you get there's you know various currencies but

201
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.600
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: you play enough you get currency enough to buy a pokemon fairly straightforward simple and consider the nature of the

202
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.440
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: game it's what works you want to play is Geratosia save up enough you buy Geratos and then you play it right

203
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.799
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: um they have changed it to where you can no longer select the pokemon you want to buy

204
00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:50.799
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Umm...

205
00:14:50.500 --> 00:15:06.419
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, did they make you night more capture? I'm sick. I... I... Oh... Oh... Oh...

206
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You can do that if you have the premium currency where you pay with real...

207
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh yeah!

208
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh yeah!

209
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Because here's the thing.

210
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, so if you pay money, real money dollars, or the premium currency, you can still buy the book money one.

211
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Of course, they left that on touch, right?

212
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Otherwise, they have...

213
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I forget what they call it, but basically there's a...

214
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: There's a bar right and

215
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:50.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: when you play enough you fill up the bar and when you fill up the bar you can buy a certain license from a select group of Pokemon that they tell you you can buy from like you filled up the bar okay congrats you can now buy three or one of these three Pokemon and if you have them all I forget what you get you you fill up the next bar faster I don't remember exactly what but the point is I cannot just.

216
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.539
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: or it doesn't even show you a list of three that you don't already have.

217
00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:53.340
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It doesn't even just show you a list of three that you don't already have.

218
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: No, no it's like.

219
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.940
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So the three could have be two that you already have and one you don't.

220
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:11.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yes, yes, yep and it's like a ladder sort of thing when you fill up the next pass okay hey here the next level on your pass you can these are the ones you can get in the next round and so on and so forth right.

221
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So I'll just use a concrete example but pour on but pour on release last month it's like the one defender I don't have in an idea you.

222
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:30.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You know two months ago I would have just saved up my money and bought up a bore on now I have to wait until the bar says I can buy the poor.

223
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:42.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, it is baffling baffling to me because this whole game is predicated on playing the Pokemon you want to play.

224
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That's amazing

225
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:52.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So the fact that they've limited this it's oh this this is it it's it feels like then and.

226
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:58.600
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I feel like I feel like I would I think it would be less stupid if that was how it always was

227
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: There's times for you night.

228
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.059
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: and it was just like the more you play eventually you'll get to unlock the better characters, right?

229
00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:09.259
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like that doesn't feel like the worst thing in the world. It doesn't feel amazing, but it doesn't feel like the worst thing

230
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But doing it was that like three years into its lifetime

231
00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:18.339
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And that's...

232
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.420
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's our decision.

233
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.539
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Um, yeah, what?

234
00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:24.940
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, goodness.

235
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:30.339
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like, you could have bought like a whole bunch of them, and now you either have...

236
00:17:30.339 --> 00:17:33.900
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And the one you don't have is in the top level.

237
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.940
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So because you have bought a whole bunch of them, you're now disadvantaged.

238
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.779
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And that you don't get to unlock anything new unless you pay for it until, until you get

239
00:17:39.000 --> 00:18:04.240
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Or yeah, yeah, it's it's not great. Now I'd to be fair. I have not played it at length of this this the license journey update. So I may have some aspects wrong. There might be something I misunderstanding. But in general, like there's like I said, I wanted to buy Vaporean. I couldn't to the shop and I couldn't buy Vaporean.

240
00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:43.779
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: to the very top.

241
00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:45.779
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: He's dreadful.

242
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, but, uh, yeah.

243
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.319
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's not great. Um, yeah. Yeah, I don't, uh, it's not bueno. No bueno.

244
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:22.759
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So that's, that's great. Not great. And, and is, is genuinely soured my unite experience.

245
00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:27.319
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I've been playing that much just because I've been busy, but, uh, again, and like I said,

246
00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:32.680
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: three years, I've been playing this game for three, four years, however long. And I've, I've enjoyed it.

247
00:18:32.759 --> 00:18:38.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I very much enjoyed it. And now they did this. So, oh, well, I'll, I'm going to really

248
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: feel, you know, in the release hallute show or the new megapalinks or whatever. And then I

249
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.039
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: can't get it. Um, but we'll see. I don't know.

250
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: because you know you know the new ones are gonna obviously be you know higher up

251
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:59.559
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: they're gonna be like the top ones because otherwise like that's so

252
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:04.680
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, of course yeah, you know what isn't stupid ball guy. So I might say, but that's why we love him

253
00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:10.039
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Because all guy they added a new

254
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.299
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Cygnus you ball guy to Pokemon masters

255
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Obviously, why wouldn't they?

256
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: From the fenging gears here, but have you seen the new ball guy outfit out?

<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I have no, no. I saw someone mention it on Discord, but I haven't looked at it.

258
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.680
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh my gosh

259
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.900

263
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.160

264
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:51.359
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So we get ball guy, but it looks like a sui and Pokeball and he comes with a sui and electrode and

265

267
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:02.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: kind of a kimono sort of looked to it, not not kimono, I forget what they're called, but that's sort of like traditional Japanese coat sort of thing.

268
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: He looks great, it's fantastic. I love Bog, I so much, it's stupid.

269
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:21.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And they added him to the... what they call the lodge, which is the kissing booth, as people call it, where you just get to hang out with the trainers and do one-on-one conversations and whatnot.

270
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So yeah, good times in man

271
00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:30.940
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: They didn't shoot themselves in the foot. I mean they did before but they fixed it already

272
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, fantastic.

273
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, so that's it's incredible. Great great stuff

274
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.279
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I think there was a new one or two, but like what's fine. Whatever. Okay. It's all bald guy. I care about

275
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.400
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: [laughing]

276
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.039
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, good times. I wonder I'm genuinely wonder how they're gonna if they're gonna touch

277
00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:53.599
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: ZA characters at all.

278
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: They have Emma like they have but they have XY Emma. How are you gonna add the new Emma?

279
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, surely at some point.

280
00:20:59.619 --> 00:21:03.859
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, do I mean, that's not unusual that they have multiple versions of a character?

281
00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:03.519
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I guess so

282
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.720
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, but that's like future version, you know, that's I don't know whatever. We'll see

283
00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:07.859
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah.

284
00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:10.359
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: well

285
00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:12.359
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Will we get terrorists?

286
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.180
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I think there's nothing wrong with that.

287
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.599
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Maple wife professor? I don't know maybe

288
00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:22.599
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Maybe I mean you can already hang out with Giovanni in the lodge, so they're not inverse to hanging out the terrace

289
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Exactly. Also, she's reformed. Come on.

290
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.599
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, she is. Yeah, it's great. Good size. Oh, that's one of the wins for sure

291
00:21:30.859 --> 00:21:35.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Slash got on a deal, like ways reformed if you can just go on a deal.

292
00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:38.400
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, oh, okay. That's all I got. That's all they got

293
00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:41.900
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: All right, well, let's talk about some news. First up,

294
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.660
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Stardew Valley, the Switch 2 update came out while like, well, since the last recording I did,

295
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.420
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I can't even remember when that was. Can't remember when this came out.

296
00:21:50.500 --> 00:22:03.940
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, why? Wait, wait, wait. So is it Stardew Valley to do it? Do it? I don't know what's in the update. I don't even know.

297
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.420
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I just remember to come out sometime in the last...

298
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:11.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, that's a good question. Does it count as a switch is a starchy value to? No, it's it's just for clarification for people listening. There are no

299
00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:21.900
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Additional content. It's just new features based on the switch too. So it has mouse mode. It has game chat of something else. I think I can't remember what it was. I mean most of it is

300
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.779
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Does it have the game chat where I put your face over the character?

301
00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:31.420
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That is a good question. I don't actually know whether it does that or not

302
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I'm guessing not because I haven't I haven't seen any game to other than a first-party Nintendo game

303
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.059
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Probably not, but it'll be dope.

304
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.380
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, I know the game probably ever will. Maybe among us, maybe.

305
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.579
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I guess the question is whether they can or not like whether that is available to those games or not because it might be a private API

306
00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:50.579
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: We don't know anyway

307
00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:57.619
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's free just in case people are listening and are it's it's free update from the switch one update

308
00:22:58.539 --> 00:23:02.299
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: standard price if you don't already have it.

309
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:10.460
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And there's some significant bugs. So, if you are playing the game, yeah, it's not, no, no, no, no.

310
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And not the kind you want.

311
00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:16.859
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Starchy doesn't have bugs. So there's a crafting issue where some things, if you craft

312
00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:23.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: it or randomly get rid of some things in your inventory. So just be careful of that if you are

313
00:23:23.019 --> 00:23:29.819
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: playing the Switch 2 version of Starchy. We also got some more info on the 1.7 update, which we'll be

314
00:23:29.819 --> 00:23:30.819
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: coming out sometime.

315
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.339
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: What?

316
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:44.339
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: He said that there will be a new farm type, technically I guess he didn't say that, what

317
00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:37.059
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Concernedape is working on more stardew.

318
00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:51.140
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: he said was it is traditional to include a new farm type, so he's going to add a new farm

319
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.140
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: type.

320
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.740
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But technically he didn't say he was, and it looks like he's focusing on character and

321
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.859
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: and story-related stuff, so that's cool.

322
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:06.779
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You know what that's probably one area that it could use a little love right like I don't know maybe I am been keeping up, but

323
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.779
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yes, it's I mean all the stuff we talk about doing stuff with your spouse. Wouldn't that be nice?

324
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:26.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, so we'll see what comes out of that, but that is what we know so far. Next, we have the farming simulator signature edition, which is just the switch to edition.

325
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:33.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: All right, and you grow piranha plants finally as it should be

326
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.700
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I don't know why I don't know why they called it the signature edition. I'm just going to ignore that question.

327
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I don't know why they called it the signature edition rather than switch to edition, but

328
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.740
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's side I can't even come with the witty reason I have no idea either

329
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.119
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh wait, no, no, no, so I think the farming simulator signature edition already existed.

330
00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:57.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And now this is the switch to edition of the signature edition.

331
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:06.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: good times. Don't you love name naming things. Good stuff.

332
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.640
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Or maybe it isn't. I can't get the, no, I think it is new.

333
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.799
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yes, because the newest one on Switch is farming similarly to 23.

334
00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:19.720
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Anyway, people on Reddit, people on Reddit really hate people. No, people on Reddit really hate this version, apparently.

335
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And Mari, can you farm his Mario?

336
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:27.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay. You know what? They're probably right. The farming sim people are there. They're a passionate

337
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: community. I'll say that.

338
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.839
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: - Yeah.

339
00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:32.339
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: [laughing]

340
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:38.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I won't mess with them. I'll agree with whatever the bread it says.

341
00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:33.180
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: - Net.

342
00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:37.400
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: [laughing]

343
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.039
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Next we have fantasy life.

344
00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:41.480
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I have released a free DLC,

345
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.460
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: the Sinister Broker Bizario's schemes.

346
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay.

347
00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:49.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's a roguelike mode.

348
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:57.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Which is interesting. That can work. And I haven't played I yet, but I know fancy life version.

349
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:12.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You know, pretty well, and you could do a roguelike mode there. Yeah, sure. Why not? I wonder what rewards you can get out of it, but that seems sensible, especially since works better with co-op, I'm sure.

350
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, they don't say a huge amount for or about it. Um

351
00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:20.880
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: The let me just click through to this link because I also haven't played this game yet

352
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Man

353
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.440
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: though

354
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.440
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So it's a dream land apparently

355
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Is in level

356
00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:31.640
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: The you go to so it's a separate world that you go to to do the roguelite bit and

357
00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:33.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Of course makes sense, you know, I

358
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.440
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It looks like it's car. It's it looks like it's just a combat focused version

359
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.220
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, that that makes sense

360
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Which presumably the combat's in the over

361
00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:47.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It is yeah, I it is a shame because

362
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.059
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You know in fantasy life you have these different

363
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.259
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: jobs or lives or whatever you want to call them. Right you can be a coper, an artist or a

364
00:26:57.259 --> 00:27:03.819
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: paladin or whatever and all the co-op stuff is focused on the combat because that's the logical

365
00:27:03.819 --> 00:27:09.740
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: choice that's what you could work but I wish you could do co-op with I don't know cooking or

366
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:15.980
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: for blacksmithing or whatever but I don't know how you do that so say lovey go fight stuff

367
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Maybe I'll play this game one.

368
00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:21.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: like fantasy life. I mean I will I know

369
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.940
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: will on day like locomot. [laughs]

370
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.759
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Next, we have cult of the lamb will haven this is their next update that is we have a release date

371
00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:34.079
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It is coming out on the 22nd of January

372
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.759
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And it's a bunch of winter based stuff which we we knew we knew before but

373
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: What I did and what we didn't know before was that winter is coming to the village as well

374
00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:53.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So it's not just like because I assumed it would just be like other winter areas that you would go to with the you know

375
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: like you're going down your combo.

376
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: You're going to have to get stuff and bring them back. No, it looks like winter is coming here village and you'll have to adapt to surround.

377
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.160
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Um, which, I mean, that's kind of wild because survival could already be hard in that thing, like,

378
00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:16.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I, I, that seems difficult. You can throw snowballs. That's pretty cool. Like, you know what, good for

379
00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:21.079
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: color of the lane. Look how long it's, it's still going on this far in and we're still getting new stuff.

380
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:28.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's pretty cool. Well, Haven's a good name. What a messed up little game. I love it.

381
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.400
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, and it's free.

382
00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:32.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, wait, no, it's not free. My bad. We'll have in part, uh, it's a paid DLC.

383
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:39.559
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Ah, well, that's fine. It's worth it. I promise you it's worth it.

384
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.119
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: My bad. I missed that before.

385
00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:40.160
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It is, uh, 15 pounds.

386
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So well, that would be presumably like,

387
00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:52.359
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, it sounds about right. Well, let's see, 17 USD. There you go. That little sheet deals with

388
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So close.

389
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:57.079
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: a lot of stuff. I just got to say a lot of other course watching the trailer.

390
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, I mean, they're also trying to run a cult. So like don't feel too bad for them.

391
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.079
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's true. That is very true, bought it on itself.

392
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:14.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And our final piece of news, we actually have a lot more news, but I decided not to include it in this episode because we're going to have a full

393
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.299
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: news only, episode catching up on everything soon, but...

394
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:25.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: The last big piece of news I wanted to cover was Sun Haven have released their 3.0 update, The Great City.

395
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:33.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And this adds a whole new region, which is obviously a great city.

396
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:42.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And I mean, do I doubt it? That would be an incredible coincidence.

397
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.900
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Great as war haven.

398
00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:42.460
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Yeah, bye y'all.

399
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:48.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And obviously, you know, new storyline, new romansibles.

400
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But also new craftable items, new shops, new clothes, furniture, it's...

401
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.200
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I'm almost really torn when I hear new romansibles because that is a cool big thing to add,

402
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: but also like, you know, how are you going to integrate that when you're on an existing

403
00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:05.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: file, probably?

404
00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:12.839
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I think you've already said, you know, or you're a good, just start a new file.

405
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.779
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: go romance someone else, you know?

406
00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:13.839
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Let's see.

407
00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:17.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's the only logical solution to any update ever.

408
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.259
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, I mean, that's that's why I do every stardew update, right?

409
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah.

410
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah.

411
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: See?

412
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: See?

413
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You get it.

414
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.640
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, no, you're, there's a new farm chai.

415
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, let's see if I can succeed in not doing that next time.

416
00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:34.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Ah, there isn't there, yes, of course. Look, maybe I'll be a farm type I don't want to do.

417
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.279
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: What are you going to do?

418
00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.759
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Not.

419
00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:35.759
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay.

420
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.660
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Right, maybe I'll be on another beach farm.

421
00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:36.759
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay.

422
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Don't like the beach farm.

423
00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:47.380
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So that's all of our news for this episode. As I say, there will be more in the next episode.

424
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.140
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Our main topic for this episode is we are going to talk about what we're looking forward to most

425
00:30:53.859 --> 00:31:00.259
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: in farming and cottage core games, specifically in 2026. We have quite a few in the list

426
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: upcoming this year and quite a lot that might be coming.

427
00:31:06.819 --> 00:31:08.539
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Shall we just, how many, how many?

428
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.779
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: did you have on your list?

429
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:15.480
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, like maybe three but it's really one and fortunately I try to pick some other ones

430
00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:12.619
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Okay.

431
00:31:12.619 --> 00:31:13.619
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Okay.

432
00:31:13.619 --> 00:31:24.180
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Shall I, shall, shall, shall, I will, I will start then and well, no, no, I want, I want to talk

433
00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.380
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Or should we just get out of the way the big one?

434
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay

435
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.859
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: about that at the end, right?

436
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.180
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, okay, okay, fine. All right. I mean I can I can give you one

437
00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:34.700
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So, so let me go for one first and then if you've got another one you can do that and then

438
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.460
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I'll bunch my other two together because they're kind of very similar and then we'll

439
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: go with the big one at the end.

440
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:47.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So I'm quite looking forward to Witchbrook, which is obviously the Witch farming game.

441
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:55.539
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It is maybe I'm a little bit one trick in some cases but like I really like how the

442
00:31:55.539 --> 00:32:04.059
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: brooms aspect seems to work in this game, I like that and yeah, it looks really fun.

443
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.519
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Yeah, no, that's fair.

444
00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:07.940
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It looks like the most freeing--

445
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: movement in a 2D farming game, which I'm excited to see how that works.

446
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.160
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, hold on pulling it up, but you know, that's that's a good that's a good point

447
00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:27.759
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Because you don't think about movement too much in these 2d farming type games even though it's probably a big deal

448
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:37.240
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's fair. Um, well, yeah, I don't know if that's to say others

449
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:57.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, we'll have to see how the, how the, the, the brim actually works because it's possible like everything we see is just like, you're just going faster. So it's possible that it's, it's more limited than I was expecting. But I'm hoping that it is more, you know, nice and flexible and like you can, you know, fly high like.

450
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:02.660
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: you lay in on an upper level, right? That's the winner or that's what you want.

451
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'd like, yeah, I'm up high and I want to just like fly over a drop rather than.

452
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:23.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: you have to go down the stairs and stuff like that. Yeah, like, absolutely. Like, I want to be able to, to do that. I think that would be fun. And presumably you will not start out with the brim. Right. So it becomes our faster. It's like the horse in Stardew. Right. Like you'll get it later on.

453
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:36.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But I think it could be really fun. I think being able, having to like start off by walking round everywhere and then eventually you get this room that allows you to move much faster and over shorter distances.

454
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Would be, would be fun.

455
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, now that that is a one cool thing. I'll say that.

456
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, you know, otherwise, it looks fine, which book does it?

457
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:52.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, I get why people wouldn't necessarily be excited about it because it's like it's a

458
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.259
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Stardew-esque

459
00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:59.539
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Farming game. Oh, I did see one where oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. I I've finally seen something in one of the videos

460
00:33:59.859 --> 00:34:04.619
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Where they do show someone going up on the broom and over rooftops

461
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.019
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, you do but the question is in your land from there. That's that's no kicker for me

462
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.820
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Look I if I can't land on a rooftop that's fine

463
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But it definitely looks like you better because there's like there's

464
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:23.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: overlapping bridges and stuff like that like as long as I can get up to those bridges, that's the important thing.

465
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.320
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's fair

466
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:32.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So we'll see we'll see how that is but I'm always looking for more interesting movement in 2d farming games.

467
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:40.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, no, that is a that is a good one to look for a good dude mechanic thing to judge to look forward to agree.

468
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Alright, what's your other one that you thought of?

469
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.199
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay. Well, uh, you know what, I'll, I'll

470
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.400
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: play off the witch thing. And I don't even know if I'm going to play it, but I'm excited about it coming out.

471
00:34:53.119 --> 00:35:00.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Neverway looks dang good still. You know, our cottage war scary. I genuinely spooky.

472
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.320
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: [laughing]

473
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:28.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You know, it's, it's this spooky one. Um, yeah, I don't even know if I'll get to it, um, but it looks really good. And, um, it's so hopeful. It succeeds because I think the variety in this space is much appreciated. Um, someone putting this much care into the horror aspect of a cottage core game. I like it.

474
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.159
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah.

475
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.719
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I don't disagree with you. What I would say is I don't think Stardew but Horder is that original

476
00:35:34.719 --> 00:35:41.679
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: line A idea. I think it has been been done. But it does, this does have certainly have a unique,

477
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.840
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Yeah.

478
00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:40.460
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: - Who, who?

479
00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:48.880
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: not necessarily art style, but the color palette makes it feel unique because it's all kind of

480
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:56.239
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. I agree with that. You're right. It's not, it's not reinventing

481
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.239
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: purpley and dark.

482
00:35:56.239 --> 00:36:00.139
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: the wheel, per se. You're right. Other play. I mean, how would you talk about the, what

483
00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:08.239
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: the way I'm right? Um, like, so it's, it's maybe not hyper novel, but it looks really well

484
00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:16.159
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: done, if nothing else. Um, yeah, it does.

485
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.880
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, yeah, I mean having said that call the lamb does lean into the humor of it right

486
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.960
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: What is this doesn't look like it's leaning into the humor? This looks like it's truly trying to be harder and

487
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Now, now the streets poof.

488
00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:25.239
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: The farming stuff is just like a mechanic through this horror RPG

489
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.639
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah.

490
00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:32.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Horror is always a difficult one because it's like what is one person's scary is one person's ah wherever

491
00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:35.239
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

492
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.159
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I have an idea for new or farming game.

493
00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:45.119
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's one just sitting 20, 26 in America.

494
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:59.199
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So I have two that are not definite. One of them is Fields of Mystery, a 1.0. We didn't

495
00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:51.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Ah, oh, what else you got on your list, though?

496
00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:06.260
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: get that last year. I'm hoping we get it this year, be fun to play more of that.

497
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:08.099
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Well, Snaggo come out, came out. We need another goal post-mover.

498
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:14.639
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I feel like with what I've seen them doing, I feel like it could well

499
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: be the year for Field of Mystery, a 1.0, I guess. We'll see, but I think I'm looking

500
00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.679
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: hopeful at least. I don't think they have a date set. I don't think they're going to

501
00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:30.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: an indication, but we're now sitting at, was it 18 months? Roughly since it's, it entered

502
00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:38.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: early access. So hopefully this year, you know, we'll see what happens.

503
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.440
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: We've got the coins with the, you know, the clothing removal coins.

504
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:45.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Why do we have to, why do we have to talk about that?

505
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.739
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: But they can't, you can't.

506
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:58.280
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: them again? Yeah, clearly. But the, the other one, which is even less certain, is that

507
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.739
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's works.

508
00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:49.699
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, what a good journey.

509
00:37:49.699 --> 00:37:51.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: They have their priorities straight, that's why.

510
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.019
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

511
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.239
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I would be very surprised if there isn't something story of seasons this year. Mainly

512
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:10.199
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: because we haven't had a new main series game since, was it 22 was pioneers of all of

513
00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:14.579
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Let me check I was twenty twenty one

514
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, it's been that long

515
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.699
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: was the last time we got a new main series, uh, story of seasons game. So we're now at this will be five years this year and

516
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.300
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's the 30th anniversary, right?

517
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:32.900
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's the 30 it's it is it's the 30th anniversary. So that's the other thing like I feel like they've probably been like aiming for this and

518
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: We do know there's stuff because they announced

519
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:43.760
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Things like was it two years ago. They were like. Oh, yeah, we're gonna have two new games

520
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.760
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: One of which is a traditional story of seasons and one of which is a more I think they said more multiplayer focused

521
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I think that should game.

522
00:38:53.519 --> 00:39:01.199
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, they didn't they've not really said much about it and they haven't mentioned anything since then

523
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: They're bringing back the four girl series. Yeah!

524
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:14.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, goodness. Um, so I would be surprised if neither of them came out this year if I had to guess probably the

525
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.079
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Standard one will come out this year and the multiplayer one will come out next year or the year after

526
00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:24.760
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But I'm very intrigued just what it is. They're doing with the multiplayer one, right?

527
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:32.960
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, what is it? What does it mean? Is it an MMO or like what are they doing like the that all they told us was it's going to be more multiplayer focused

528
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.960
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That's literally all they said

529
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:43.880
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And then the other one they kind of and the other one they kind of showed like a very short clip of just the cow in the chicken in a field

530
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So there's Smash Bros.

531
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.159
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: They're like, okay, that tells me nothing. I mean, it looked good, but that doesn't tell you anything

532
00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:57.880
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So it'll be interesting to see I'm a little bit more hopeful obviously pioneers of all of time was fine

533
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.820
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But none of the like characters or stories were particularly interesting

534
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But I think they've shown with

535
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Grandpa's are last year that they can still do that and so hopefully they will

536
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.480
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Still do that. I don't think we'll get a remake this year. I'm

537
00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:21.559
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Suspect that but I hope they don't do a remake this year and I hope they're focusing on getting out one of these new games

538
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.280
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: story of seasons original remani yeah

539
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Look, I mean I look I would be up for a port of that. I don't think it needs to be a remake

540
00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:32.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I think but I think a

541
00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:35.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Story season's port to switch would be nice, but

542
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.559
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, now with three item slots.

543
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.780
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Because I've still not played that one cuz I need to go back

544
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.719
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, you mean the original harvest moon you don't mean the original story seasons

545
00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:47.159
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. No, no, I'm an original artist.

546
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.800
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, yeah, no, I don't think I don't think we'll get that. I don't I don't

547
00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:48.719
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I'm going to original OG.

548
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.719
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I actually, but no, original story of seasons from 3DS.

549
00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:54.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Well, what if you

550
00:40:54.519 --> 00:41:04.119
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, that's so that's why I was thinking that like this I think it would be fun to port the first the three 3DS story of seasons

551
00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:55.639
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That would be a good port.

552
00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:09.639
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I know like a multi-pack. I think that would be fun like you don't have to change them a huge amount

553
00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:14.320
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: You just need to figure out the two screen thing that a lot of games have already kind of figured out

554
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And I think most of the story seasons ones. They just used it for a map

555
00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:23.800
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So there's probably not a lot they need to do. I think it would be fun to do our

556
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.440
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Multi-pack of those the first three story seasons games for 3DS put them over to switch that would be good fun

557
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.940
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, that would be.

558
00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.440
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I would definitely play three of tones again. I really loved three of tones

559
00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:42.039
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That's still one of my top ones for characters like the characters in that game where we're one of my favorites of any farming games

560
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:44.880
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Obviously, obviously not.

561
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.119
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: than Stardew, I'm not trying to say that, but like,

562
00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:52.480
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: certainly it might be second or third. Um, and I, I really do want to play

563
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: the first two, but I just haven't, because, you know, 3DS.

564
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.760
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Dory of seasons 30 year phones. We did it ma'am

565
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.059
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So yeah, so yeah, I don't know what we're getting,

566
00:42:07.059 --> 00:42:08.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: story of seasons this year, but we're getting,

567
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.179
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: we must be getting something.

568
00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:12.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And so I'm looking forward to whatever that is,

569
00:42:11.159 --> 00:42:18.719
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I'm down for that. I just you know what just give me a game where I play as a cow. How about that? I'll take that I would venture

570
00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:14.820
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: whether it's the new game, the new multiplayer game.

571
00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Maybe that's what the multiplayer game is.

572
00:42:20.019 --> 00:42:21.219
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's just everyone's a cow.

573
00:42:24.659 --> 00:42:26.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: All right, Kevin, take us home.

574
00:42:26.019 --> 00:42:30.260
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: What's your, what's your, what was you really looking forward to this year?

575
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Okay, um, you know, I'm going to I'm going to give you two for I came with two other ones one of them

576
00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:40.019
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: I put a question mark because I don't know if I'm actually excited or not, but maybe

577
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.739
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Why?

578
00:42:39.219 --> 00:42:40.659
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Okay, go for it.

579
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.820
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Artisan story looks

580
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.019
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Interesting. I guess this is a question mark

581
00:42:46.659 --> 00:42:52.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So my question mark because I like monster farming ranching. I don't know if they're gonna do it well

582
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.699
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Well, that's a cool little you know, Octopathisk art style, so that's kind of cool

583
00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: But that's kind of all it's got going.

584
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:06.139
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: For I don't know how well it's actually going to come out, but it has my an eyebrow race. Let's say that

585
00:43:07.019 --> 00:43:15.260
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: The other one it's maybe low-hanging fruit, but super zoo story. I like animals. I want to

586
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:20.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yeah, I nearly put the, I nearly put that one on my list, but I didn't, I thought

587
00:43:20.519 --> 00:43:23.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: for it was probably enough for me.

588
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:29.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, and I mean like it's it's yeah, it's low hanging fruit like I said

589
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:34.099
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's just stardew, but to do instead, and you know, all right

590
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.679
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But that's about, but Kevin, that's a big, that's a big butt, right?

591
00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

592
00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:40.239
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like a lot of, a lot of these itch stargy butt.

593
00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:41.559
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Their butts are small.

594
00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:42.579
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

595
00:43:41.559 --> 00:43:43.760
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: This is a big butt, right?

596
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, it is

597
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.360
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like this is, this is, this is, you're running a zoo.

598
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.960
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That is a huge difference.

599
00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.900
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

600
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.980
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, it is it is right like I'm I'm yeah, I'm over simplifying here and

601
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You know, come to me to hyperbolicism, whatever

602
00:43:56.739 --> 00:44:05.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: But I mean like even just roots of pacho right start do but pretty starting. No, that was actually good enough to just if I play in that game

603
00:44:05.219 --> 00:44:07.820
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And and and and it felt good, right

604
00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:14.139
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: This feels as big as roots of pacho like that's that's a good premise run a zoo instead

605
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.119
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I'd say maybe even bigger because like yes, Ritzapatra. I don't think it is just stardew, but prehistoric, right?

606
00:44:16.139 --> 00:44:18.139
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Maybe yeah

607
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:26.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like there's a lot that makes that up, but it is if you think about it fundamentally

608
00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:28.619
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

609
00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:29.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: just kind of like a skin, right on top of it. It's

610
00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:30.699
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that is

611
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.239
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: whereas this is like fundamental differences to how you play

612
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I agree

613
00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:41.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: because you never have to think about the public in your farm. You're farming for yourself.

614
00:44:41.519 --> 00:44:43.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: What is a zoo you are fundamentally

615
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: doing for other people's consumption, right?

616
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:54.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, you're right. That's a good point. Yeah, I wonder how that's gonna integrate. I just and then like

617
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.800
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Really interested. Yeah. I mean, it's possible. It's possible that there's not a huge amount of that

618
00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.300
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

619
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.079
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: because it's not a management game. So it's not going to be like, you know, rollercoaster tycoon

620
00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:09.360
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: or whatever. But there has to be something. There has to be something there. Otherwise, it's like,

621
00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.179
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Right, right, and that's the interesting part, right?

622
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:15.599
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: am I doing a zoo or am I just doing a weird farm with different animals, right?

623
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:22.300
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I guess we'll see, but I mean, yeah, that's why I put on the list though, right? Like that's that's enough to

624
00:45:23.019 --> 00:45:28.460
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Are they gonna balance that right cuz on the one hand you have let's make a zoo where it's as you know

625
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:34.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: It's pure management and you can just have infinite number of animals because you just grow and grow right here

626
00:45:34.219 --> 00:45:36.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: You're not gonna obviously have that

627
00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:44.139
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: In fact, I'm sure relative to that kind of game. It's gonna be very limited in space and what you can do

628
00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:45.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: So what and.

629
00:45:45.500 --> 00:46:11.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: We'll scan you have how big is it going to be you know how's all that going to operate? I don't know but we'll see. I'm excited. I like animals. I like the idea of running soon taking care of animals and whatnot. So we'll see. But that that's why it's on the list. It has my attention. Okay, but now. Okay, who cares we we said those things that have an episode, but we don't really care because.

630
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: All right, it's time to talk about the big one, right?

631
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.420
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: 2026 is one thing and one thing only

632
00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:21.219
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: you're the PCOPIA baby. Oh.

633
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.420
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Polcopia. I think the thing is I think the thing is if this game is good

634
00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.139
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: It's it'll be hard to beat at the end of the year

635
00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:32.900
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Now that is a that is a big butt a big if that is a big if right because it could be bad

636
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:49.039
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, I'm confident. I could be, yeah, it's the bar is going to be very high, assuming it's

637
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.860
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But if it's good

638
00:46:36.099 --> 00:46:38.380
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: If it's good it's going to be really hard

639
00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: For something else to end up

640
00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:56.239
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: well done, right? Like, and I, again, I have high hump confidence in octaves. I believe in the

641
00:46:56.239 --> 00:47:01.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: try and quest Bill Bush team. Um, can we take more?

642
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:17.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And so yeah, I expect good things and and they're just putting on the the Pokemon paint layered paint job on top and I'm exaggerating because much more than that, but like that's that's just a winning recipe. You know what I want us to do I need.

643
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:25.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, oh, I and it's so close to two months. That's gonna be your no time. Holy moly.

644
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.440
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, what a, what a way to start off the year.

645
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:31.800
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Yep, and it's going to come out it's going to come out literally a week after Pokemon day, right?

646
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.840
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah.

647
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.219
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like we're going to go find out what's happening for the rest of the year with Pokemon and then

648
00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.059
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: boom, Pokepia's out and you're like oh, no

649
00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:42.739
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Okay, hello, it's here

650
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:50.860
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. It's, yeah. Oh, my it's the uncomfortable truth. It very well made to the best

651
00:47:50.860 --> 00:48:00.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Pokemon date to go. I see it. I mean, and, and you know, we don't, we don't even have to

652
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.780
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: whoa I hope not but

653
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: talk about it because what else, what else, we haven't gotten any trailers. We don't need

654
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.739
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: anything else. It's, it's, we know what it is. Just give it to me. Just inject into my veins

655
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.500
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: [laughter]

656
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:22.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I think the thing is that so so I I I liked dragon quest builders too, but I never got through the story because I just I wasn't caring as much about the story, right?

657
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:30.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.320
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But this is Pokemon

659
00:48:24.679 --> 00:48:28.519
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So like I will get through the story because I care about Pokemon

660
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.400
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: So of course I'm gonna go get through whatever story is

661
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. No.

662
00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:36.440
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That doesn't mean the story will be good necessarily. It might be good. It might be bad. We'll see

663
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah.

664
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But I think it's totally expected that I will play this

665
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.639
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: for a long time, whether it's good or bad.

666
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.860
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, and and I'm just excited because I I think the scale might be a lot bigger than we think

667
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.760
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Like all the

668
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.400
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, I think absolutely, there's no way they give us the Dragonite flying without having a large map.

669
00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:09.260
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, in fact, I have earned whispers on the wind. It might be the entire can't so region now

670
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.039
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That would be interesting, like an entire post-apocalyptic cantor.

671
00:49:15.639 --> 00:49:21.079
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Now just cantor, because how do you justify not being able to get to Joto?

672
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:26.820
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yes, I I don't know that I'm really big mountains

673
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.239
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: That would be an interesting one.

674
00:49:27.239 --> 00:49:32.039
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I really hope that if it actually is cantor, right, like if it actually is cantor,

675
00:49:32.039 --> 00:49:35.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: and it's clearly cantor, I hope that they explain.

676
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.800
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: like the, the, the, there's a-

677
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:57.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: it's actually like a thing to it. And it's not just like, oh, we did an area and we just made it look like canto, right? Like if it's just like, oh, it's canto because that's an Easter egg. I'll be really disappointed because I'm like, you could just done anything. Like why would you do this? Like I hope if they actually are doing that, that they have a story to tell about why they're doing it.

678
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.320
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: And then the story is Gen one or spring money. That's a story.

679
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:07.219
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: But if that were but if that no no no no no because if that were the case they would have told us by now

680
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:10.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Um, but I mean, injure that idea or true. I don't know. I mean,

681
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:15.099
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Like we don't because cause us obsessive Pokemon fans are gonna notice it, but they don't need

682
00:50:15.539 --> 00:50:21.059
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: They're gonna get the obsessive Pokefans Pokemon fans no matter what they need to the casual Pokemon fans

683
00:50:21.059 --> 00:50:24.019
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: And the casual Pokemon fans won't care unless they tell you

684
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:32.260
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's true. That's true. Oh, free. Maybe Mount Snorlax is the same Snorlax. I was blocking

685
00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.480
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: that one route. Nobody ever to move.

686
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:52.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: so this oh so this is the this is the world in which red doesn't continue on his journey and and and there for an apocalypse occurs and and that's no likes are still living there.

687
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:53.260
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Team rocket one. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. See, we figured it out. Team rocket one

688
00:50:52.920 --> 00:51:02.920
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: look if that's the extent of the story if that's the extent of the story.

689
00:50:53.260 --> 00:51:01.099
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: and depleted all the resources and people and humanity died and so it's left.

690
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:25.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: that you know what fine i'll take it like it but I i just yeah no seriously I would like I think that would be something right like I just I what I really i'm not really hope not for is for them to be like oh no it's not can't to it just looks like can't.

691
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.860
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. I take it. I say that jokingly, but I take it.

692
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

693
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:33.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: that that that that just that just feels like the worst of all options like either make it can to and tell us why we are in this world or make.

694
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.320
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah. I mean if nothing else

695
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.000
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: it something different because to make it look like until you have to do that deliberately.

696
00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:46.960
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, and I'm curious like can we you know, let's just assume it is cancer, right? Can we fix up the whole region?

697
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:57.139
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Oh, my. Oh, goodness. I mean, if it's like dragon quest builders, too, then yes, it's sandbox. It's sandbox. It's sandbox's sandbox's sandbox, right?

698
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:49.599
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: That's the pretty dope

699
00:51:53.639 --> 00:51:55.639
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, right right like

700
00:51:57.079 --> 00:51:59.920
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, so that's

701
00:51:58.619 --> 00:52:02.780
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: There are two options. They're okay. There are three options here. One is it's not canto.

702
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.840
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

703
00:52:04.059 --> 00:52:10.300
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Two is two is it's canto and it's entire and it's sandbox. So you can do whatever you want. It's an entire post-apocalyptic world.

704
00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:17.420
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: Three is it's not a post-apocalyptic world. It's just Sinabar Island that's post-apocalypse and so the only

705
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:27.980
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: sandbox is that island and everything else is still normal and you're like, you build up and eventually you go and explore and find out. No, it was just something horrible in Sinabar and the rest of the region is fine.

706
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:34.500
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah. There you go. Well, I could see any of these. You're right. I'm very excited for this game.

707
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.760
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I too, I'm excited. I think when I'm talking about it, like, because obviously I'm always thinking forward to the game of the year episode, right?

708
00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:54.159
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: I think the reason why it probably has its best chance is that you know that this will be the game that all three hosts will have played.

709
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Yeah

<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: If a story of seasons comes out, or fields of mystery, I think those are the only two that could,

718
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
<v A0F1C7DD-6517-4BB4-934F-AD87BE5B57F0>Kevin: Baby

722
00:53:41.619 --> 00:53:44.820
<v 2AC3AA87-5DFB-429F-BE6F-23B5E070AE42>Al: are a new story of seasons, or fields of mystery.

750
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.360
