42
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.139
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: with this until the game until I finally reach credits persona 3 reload is still happening

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I just started literally last night, Greece.

46
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.639
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I'm looking forward to continuing that.

47
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Is that how he is pronounced?

48
00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.979
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I don't know, is it Greece?

49
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I thought he was gris.

50
00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:25.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm thinking, I know it's some language for grey.

51
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I want to say it's Spanish for grey.

52
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Oh, then it's probably grey. I don't think you pronounce the ass then.

53
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:37.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: If I remember correctly, isn't that like a French thing to not pronounce the last letter?

54
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Not just... not just...

55
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.979
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's been a minute for me since I'd taken Spanish in high school.

56
00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.939
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I'm like, I don't remember, I thought it was Greece.

57
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.659
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But again, I could be wrong.

58
00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.819
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I could totally be wrong.

59
00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But either way, I started that game.

60
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.060
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Obviously, I've been playing as much as much snacko.

61
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Okay, okay, you might be right, a Google translate does seem to say "gris", but it's more like a it's more like a rather than a "s", it's not like "gris".

62
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.740
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Ooh, okay, we'll take it.

63
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.539
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I think, yeah, I think this sound doesn't exist.

64
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.300
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's in the language, but Greece does, that makes sense.

65
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.540
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But started that, obviously, been working in Snacko whenever I can, and I did finally watch

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Well, I mean, I don't feel that that's a bot, right?

93
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like nobody can reach me and it's pretty good.

94
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.220
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that's true. That's true. That's a very good point. I just have, you know, just a little

95
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: They're far, it's pretty good.

96
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.560
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: bit of looming guilt, just a little bit, just being unreachable, but that's okay. We're

97
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: working through it. But how are you, how are you generally feeling about the DLC?

98
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Fair enough

99
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:17.899
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, so I am enjoying it. I'm not enjoying the the the time limits for each of the sections

100
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Okay, great. Me too.

101
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, me too. Me too. Me too. Me too.

102
00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.699
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I I I

103
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.680
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Don't get why they felt they need to do the time limits. It's just it feels so

104
00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.439
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Stressful and I don't know what it adds to it. It's like...

105
00:06:35.500 --> 00:07:04.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Especially as you can like, what I'm doing is like, it auto saves when you go in the hole, the donut hole, and then, like, just walking around and seeing what there is, and then I reset and then I know exactly where to go, so that I can go and do the things in the time that I want, right? Like, it's not actually, like, it's just satsar unnecessary restriction that is easily worked around, but also still stresses me out because there's a constant timer.

106
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:17.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, not great. I don't know why they made that decision. Have there ever been an area that has been timed in Pokémon that you have to leave at the end of that time before?

107
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.100
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Um, I mean, the, the space-time distortions, is that what they were called, I think, right?

108
00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:28.060
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: In, uh, Legends Arceus, those were gender, really a time limit.

109
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: - Yeah, sure, that felt different.

110
00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:34.100
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: One, you didn't need to like,

111
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.259
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: consumer consumer will to get them, right?

112
00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.740
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You just needed to wait and eventually they would come back.

113
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And it also felt much more of the,

114
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.899
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: like that whole game is about being stressed, right?

115
00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:51.860
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like you're out in the wilds, dying all the time.

116
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.220
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And so it's like, here's this one more stressful area.

117
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.620
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Do, again, okay, that's fair that that is timed,

118
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.660
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: but yeah, it definitely does feel different.

119
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.339
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I I I agree it does feel different my

120
00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:09.220
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: All right, I am I'll be positive first before I be negative

121
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.240
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

122
00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:13.379
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I am very

123
00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:20.819
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Intrigued and curious to see where the story is going and I of course like the characters

124
00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:22.620
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's that's nothing new

125
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:29.779
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I've always liked the characters in this game so far overall and the introduction of the characters and spending more time with other characters in

126
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.080
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: You'll see has been very enjoyable and I'm again very curious to see where things go, but I

127
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: For the first time in what feels like a while in regards to your pokemon game

128
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:49.399
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I have never been as aggravated or frustrated as I have been with the timer and the donut cycle I

129
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.580
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: theorize that the

130
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.580
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: reason that the timer

131
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.419
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Is a mechanic in the game? It's just because it is a

132
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:29.899
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: mechanic that is somewhat regularly used in a number of different games. I can't give you an example off the top of my head. But it's a mechanic that has existed in games more so for the sake of replayability. So it encourages you to continue this cycle of making donuts doing the timer area making yes. And I like I that's fair. I as someone that has learned that I think I

133
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:27.419
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's Pokémon roguelike, boo that's why I don't like it

134
00:09:30.500 --> 00:10:00.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like look roguelikes, like I enjoyed velocher for the time that I played velocher. I would really love to play more Hades at some point. Doing that grind of going like the replayability in that sense, I don't mind that because it feels worth it. I don't feel any payoff for the stress that I feel in these time areas. I come out of there and I'm frustrated almost every single time. So I'm trying to get through the areas in the sense of just getting through it in

135
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:30.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: enough to be able to make it through the main story. So I can either avoid the areas altogether or go in with less pressure to then just be like, Oh, the timer's up. Okay. Whatever. It's fine. I can move on with my life. I'm trying to reframe that because otherwise if I harp on it too much for me, I get very frustrated and I just felt myself just I was so I I've been so tired today because or no. Well,

136
00:10:30.500 --> 00:11:00.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yesterday, I was very tired yesterday and then even rolling into the day because I don't think I ever fully recover from the frustration that exhausted me from playing the game for 10 hours and dealing with the timer. Donut cycle for 10 hours and the donuts too. There's no guidance, nothing. And I want to look up guidance, but I know with Pokemon the way that the most Pokemon game goes is that as you continue through that mechanic, whatever it may be, if I look something up, there's going to be a spoiler somewhere down the line because it's going to be something.

137
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:30.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: special donut that's going to indicate this Pokemon is coming to the game or this new something something is going to be in the game. And that's going to be like a spoiler for me. So I can't even look anything up on like a wiki or something or like therapy because it's probably going to be a spoiler if I look it up. So I'm kind of just stuck in the cycle of guessing. What's a good donut to make? And I'm just I'm just not enjoying it at all. Unfortunately. So that's where I'm at. That's my rant.

138
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:36.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: That's fair. Yeah. I think I might grow to like it, um, because I, I think the donuts are

139
00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:42.340
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: getting better and longer as I go. Um, and so I'm hoping that at some point the donuts get

140
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.860
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: long enough that it's not really an issue, right? The problem is when you have like a three

141
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: minute donut and you're like, how am I meant to completely explore this area in three

142
00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:55.700
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: minutes? But if I were to get like a 15 minute donut, that would be fine, right? Like

143
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

144
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:01.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

145
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.580
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: these areas aren't humongous.

146
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:11.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I just need more time, I don't need infinite time, I just need more time and then you do get to the point where like what was the point in the mechanic in that case, then if they are long enough to do that, but I have a strong suspicion that I will be able to get longer.

147
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.419
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I just, I think I agree, but I just have to get to that point.

148
00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:25.059
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I have to just deal with the aggravation for now and the fact that I have to deal with the aggravation for now, for me, is just frustrating it itself.

149
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah

150
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:33.379
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I am having an issue with the DLC, but I'm just trying to push through, I'm just trying to push through, I can do it.

151
00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:29.759
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Totally fair

152
00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:36.440
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You can do it you can do it we can do it woo, let's do it

153
00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:36.820
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: We can do it. We can do it.

154
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:43.700
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So that's my, that's my, that's my vent.

155
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.159
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Shall we talk about some farming game news?

156
00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.059
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, absolutely.

157
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.480
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: First up we have center bunny have announced that they're switch and switch to release is

158
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.919
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: out now. So if you have been wanting to

159
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: play this game, but you wanted to play it on the switch or switch to knows your chance.

160
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.679
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Have you played this game?

161
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:07.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I have not played it, uh, who played it? Someone played it, um, we did. But was there was an episode

162
00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:07.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Looks like do someone, does someone we know? Has someone played it?

163
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: on Cinebunny? How long ago was that? I am just searching through my list of episodes

164
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.480
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Okay, I missed it.

165
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I thought, hmm, I thought there was a cinnabunny episode, but I can't.

166
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:29.460
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I remember that the topic of cinnabunny came up in regards to, I forget who mentioned it,

167
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Time to do them more deeper.

168
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:38.100
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but someone was like, "Oh, this would be a good game for me to play," and I took one look at it,

169
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.899
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and I was like, "You are dead wrong." Unfortunately.

170
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.379
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Haha, that's it.

171
00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:47.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: There was, yes, there was a Cenobani episode, it was in March of this year, March of this

172
00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:54.940
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: year, Cenobani episode Cody and Kev.

173
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.480
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Okay, maybe I got a circle in my way back to that episode just to just to get the take

174
00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:00.580
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think, yeah, I think they enjoyed the game.

175
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.440
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Okay

176
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.820
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I, like you, have been put off a bit by the graphics.

177
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.200
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Hmm yep

178
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.480
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: is that fair to say, sorry, I'm reading, I'm reading your...

179
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Bill of Pints.

180
00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:14.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, no, that's fine. That is totally okay. That's why I put them there so we could both bounce all of it

181
00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:17.679
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's it's titled the a's dunking's TM

182
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.259
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

183
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.399
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Okay

184
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:29.600
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I it's it's the the way the game looks is not my favorite by any means I

185
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:35.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Like I and when I was researching the game before I started typing out all of my dunkings

186
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.279
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I was like I don't

187
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.720
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Want to unfairly dunk on the game because I don't know much about this game

188
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I don't know the dev studio and then when I looked into the devs like the devs

189
00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:49.759
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's one person making the game so it's

190
00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:05.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: one person working on the game, and I know I don't want to be unfairly harsh, but personally, the way the game looks, especially when comparing it to the game cover art.

191
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:20.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's just, and this has been like a trend. This like kind of goes into like another event. We're all about the events today. It's all it's all about venting today. We're like an air conditioner. Anyways, like, I just, I just...

192
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:27.519
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Okay, it's, it is, I mean, it's not incorrect, I guess it.

193
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:40.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I don't even know if it's the right term. I'm more both tired, we're both delusional. It's one type of vent, an air vent. I don't know, whatever. Anyways, I...

194
00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:37.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Hmm. Yep. You are correct. No, I get, I get your point. It's, it's, it's always

195
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.759
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: difficult to dunk too much on an indie game, especially when it's an individual and

196
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

197
00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:44.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's clearly a labor of love.

198
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.820
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's blood blood, etc, etc, but very much not for you.

199
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.820
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: much so not for me. I just I just really don't like how the bunnies look. They're just like colored

200
00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:03.139
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: blobs with two dot eyes and then two white dots on set eyes and then that's it. And I'm like I just

201
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.179
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and I think about like in comparison. I really don't want to pit two games against each other.

202
00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:15.379
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I just I really don't but I it's like I think about magical delicacy and how good that game looks

203
00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:20.419
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and that's a single developer and then I think about synagogue and I'm like wow.

204
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.460
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But then it's it's not even that it's not even that though.

205
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.899
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, and it's not, it's, yeah, it's not even just that, right?

206
00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:27.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Cause like people will be like, oh, the pixel art or whatever.

207
00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:29.860
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But like, there are other examples as well.

208
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And again, it doesn't need to be like, oh, hey, your game looks bad.

209
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.539
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But like, if you look at something like lemon cake, for example, which is a

210
00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:44.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: very similar game in terms of like size and is also a single individual

211
00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:50.700
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: developer, and it clearly is not, you know, high fidelity, but.

212
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:00.740
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Just looks so much more, hmm, it, more inviting and more vibrant.

213
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Yeah.

214
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.940
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And you don't have to have specific colors.

215
00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:04.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: That's not what it is.

216
00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:08.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's not about like, oh, this one has green, you know, and this one is more

217
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

218
00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: dark.

219
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.259
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like you can make a dark, inviting game as well.

220
00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:17.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Um, I think the problem is they're trying to go to realistic and realistic

221
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.180
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: is hard to do well.

222
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:28.019
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, yeah, you know what, that might be that that might be exactly what it is.

223
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.480
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Not to do well for triple H studios.

224
00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:33.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's got very neutral colors, and like you said, it just feels like it's like realistic.

225
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:39.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And I think this game would benefit to having the colors of lemon cake to make it pot

226
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: more.

227
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.220
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But I still like circle back to the fact, I don't, I still don't know exactly how I feel

228
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.539
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: in regards to this, this specific point that I make in

229
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:56.779
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: regards to the game itself looking different from the game cover art, but it's just there's some

230
00:17:56.779 --> 00:18:01.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like just cognitive dissonance I guess is the lack of a better word that's happening where the game

231
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:08.779
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: looks one way, but then the cover art looks completely different. Like I look at the cover art for

232
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.700
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, that's not an unusual, yeah.

233
00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:13.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Sinnoh bunny and it's like then you look at the game like I'm looking at this one screenshot of this

234
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:20.140
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: bunny on its hind feet and it says my recipe is I'm looking at the steam page.

235
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:28.140
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And it's just the walls and the floor and the tape, it just looks so land and I just don't

236
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:34.220
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: know if I can I just can't cough and I'm sure the gameplay itself mechanic is good that the gameplay

237
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.539
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: loop is good, but I just aesthetically it's so hard for me to look at this game and then it's

238
00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:46.700
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: confusing looking at like the game cover for lemon cake and then looking at the game itself.

239
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the colors are similar, but then the art style is completely different.

240
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:56.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And it's just like confusing me, and I know it's a common thing, but it's just something that I'm not sure how I feel about.

241
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's kind of where I'm at. But, to pivot away from that...

242
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: well now now the easel islin has taken down the developer of cinnabunny

243
00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:08.799
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [Laughter]

244
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:15.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No, I don't want it to be like that! No! I don't want to be me!

245
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:11.640
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: destroyed them

246
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [Laughter]

247
00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:20.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: too late

248
00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:24.839
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [Laughter]

249
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I just want to be honest with my feelings.

250
00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:29.880
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: know that I mean this is the thing like this is

251
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:57.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: what I I keep saying is like just because we don't like a game necessarily doesn't mean it's bad and all of the reasons that we might like or dislike a game might be the reasons someone else dislikes or likes a game right and that's fine and whatever games you like you're totally fine unless it's triggered your island or time it got you plaza you know what maybe it maybe I won't even say

252
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:41.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

253
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughter]

254
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.339
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: You know, it really be that way.

255
00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:56.539
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It really be that way.

256
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:27.799
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: got you plaza because like I can I can after what Micah said to me on the game of the year episode that you will hear listeners in two weeks he's maybe convinced me that it's not as horrifically bad as I could have as I originally thought and I can see why someone might like it she could you island on the other hand is just bad so let's go back to just there's only one

257
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.740
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughing]

258
00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:28.180
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: There.

259
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:44.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: bad game and it's you could you island everything else is just not for me cozy caravan have announced that they are leaving early access their one point oh is coming out on the 8th of January the first release of 2026 I think.

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I don't think there's much else to say it's adding stuff so go play the game if you if you were looking for it

270
00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:15.799
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Bear.

273
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:34.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: This seems to be the first Traveler's Rest like major Traveler's Rest update that I've seen has

274
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.660
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like added in what I would assume would be a core piece of functionality and made me question what was in the game

275
00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:47.740
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like the like there was like maybe four updates in there were like, ah, we've just implemented being able to serve drinks in the tavern

276
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.839
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Right.

277

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [Laughing]

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's like if if the first start you update had like

280
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Ah.

281
00:21:57.019 --> 00:22:00.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: implemented crops like what did you have before?

282
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, that's a bit... that that is a bit odd.

283
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But this seems to, yeah, like you said, make more sense in the sense of it's adding more stuff that shouldn't...

284
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That doesn't... that shouldn't already exist in the game.

285
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Is that what it... does that make sense?

286
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.500

288
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.680

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I find it funny. I wonder what they expect from that, right? Because it's like, well,

305
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.200
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Man

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: if they just said it's no longer an early access, but did nothing else. And they were like,

307
00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:17.599
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: here you go. With that, would they be happy with that? Is that it finished, right? Because

308
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I see. Good question.

310
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:36.359
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's not very many hours over nearly six years. So, just gonna just gonna say, maybe, maybe

311
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's true. That's a very good point.

312
00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:48.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: sharp. That's all. That's all. I mean, I think people seem to be pretty happy with her

313
00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:55.000

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:18.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, that's it. That's it. That's that's that's the overall learning lesson. If you don't like the game, don't play the game, but don't ruin it for others if they like the game. Let them enjoy the game. That's it.

316
00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:04.759
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: like the game, don't play the game.

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Have you ever played the game?

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I don't know. I saw it has very positive reviews too and I'm like, I don't know as far as I know it's a terrible game because what Al says goes.

323
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.640
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Bizarre.

324
00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:46.079

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm glad someone enjoys it, I guess.

326
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:59.680
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: All right, we also have one new game to talk about. This is the free shepherd

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Right, so this is let me read the blurb run fast and free as a sheepdog in a beautiful but troubled world

329
00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:19.400
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: haired masses of lost sheep to a secret refuge discover a mysterious calamity that only you can stop I

330
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.140
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I'm... I'm...

331
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:32.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, why are there so many herads of sheep that I need to... I mean, I guess that's the point of the game is the... the mystery, right? It's just... it's really fascinating.

332
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

333
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:43.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And do I want to be a colleague? Yes, I do want to be a colleague and run free around the hills and hair it up sheep. That is... that is my dream. That is what I want to be in.

334
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:55.819
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But it's so, I'm so intrigued by this ice land and this big tower and this rock with

335
00:25:55.819 --> 00:26:01.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the perfect circle hole in it.

336
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: is the goodbye going to save the world.

337
00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:04.319
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I say yes, I hope yes.

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Also, it's apparently similar to Outer Wilds.

339
00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:12.359
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I don't know how they made that determination, but...

340
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.700
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: mhm. Oh, yeah. What does it say on me? It says this is similar to how like hello, get the island adventure.

341
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:21.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Two, two different worlds.

342
00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:23.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Amazing. Amazing. This game looks so good.

343
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.779
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It does look really good.

344
00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:37.759
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I think this would be a nice hanging out on the couch, put it on, type of game, under a blanket.

345
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.880
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: ambient. Also, proof that you don't need vibrant colors. You know, when we were talking

346
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.440
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: earlier about colors, you can, you can be non-vibrant colors and still look very inviting.

347
00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:43.440
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: All it takes is a consistent concept.

348
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:52.680
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's all, that's it, that's all it is.

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And these dogs were so, so fast.

361
00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:30.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And like, when I tell you they ran,

364
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And they would run for...

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: the top of the hill all the way down to the lock, and this would take like a ten-minute drive, and they would just like absolutely bolt it down, like so much so that you would hardly see them going, they're just so incredibly fast, and they would just thunder.

366
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: are amazing dogs. They were also made in rescue dogs.

369
00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:08.240
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, why are you gonna say it that way?

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It is, I guess, intro to how it starts is you are on a boat going away to a new land.

400
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And your, your boat, I think I can't remember it, does it just overturn or

401
00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:46.339
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: is it crashing to something?

405
00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:59.220
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And then you awaken on the beach in this new area.

406
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.940
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: January 2020, by the way, is when I interviewed them nearly six years ago.

407
00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:03.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: That's mad.

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You find your fellow traveler who is also on the beach and you start your new life on Snacko Island as the farmer.

411
00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:26.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And your aim of the game is to rebuild Snacko Island.

416
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.259
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughing]

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Um, it is, uh, it is quite a vibrant world, the colors pop.

441
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Um, and, uh, the, I don't know where I was going with that.

442
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:37.259
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I mean, I love the visuals.

443
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I like the video.

444
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.359
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: individuals. Always go to one, not me there, don't you?

445
00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:43.779
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That might unintentionally be my thing.

446
00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:48.640
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's not trying to one up, but it just happens to come across that way, and it's not my intention.

447
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.839
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

448
00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:52.700
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I really like it as well.

449
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.740
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think one negative I would say about the visuals

450
00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.299
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: is some of the areas feel quite samey.

451
00:32:58.299 --> 00:33:00.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: There's quite a few areas that feel like

452
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.740
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: this is the grassy area

453
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.579
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and this is also the grassy area

454
00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:05.299
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and this is also the grassy area.

455
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.700
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I would maybe like a little bit more variety

456
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.220
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: in terms of that, but just in general,

457
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.180
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I like how it looks.

458
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.940
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I like all the models and stuff.

459
00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: like the colors I like.

460
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:26.259
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: the world. I have finally got to a point where I am understanding the layout of the island

461
00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:32.339
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and being able to go places without the map, which is always a big thing. Yeah.

462
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.859
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I would say even though I have not sunk in as much time as you probably have,

463
00:33:38.579 --> 00:33:46.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I would say I picked up like navigating around the island so far, like pretty quickly, like it's,

464
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:53.059
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: yeah I picked up on it pretty quickly. I agree with you, the art style and the colors are so

465
00:33:53.059 --> 00:34:02.740
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: very very very cute and so just it feels childlike in a way is maybe like the best way to describe

466
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:08.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: it. I feel like I'm just like a kid playing this game again is the emotions that I feel. I just

467
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:17.139
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like I like just love just sitting down at my desk and just playing the game having for me

468
00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:24.820
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: having the wiki off to the side and just existing like the immersion of this game is very much so

469
00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:32.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: wonderful, especially I can't go in yet but just walking accidentally walking into the mush

470
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:40.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: room forest has been like one of my favorite experiences that was so so pretty everything it feels

471
00:34:38.500 --> 00:35:08.440
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think that's the thing is that's why they're being so many just like generic grassy areas is the one kind of frustrate is why it's frustrating to me because the other areas are just so different and so and everything looks good and then it's like and the areas that I'm going into every day are all the same grassy area right like I

472
00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:46.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: intentional with the art direction of this game and I adore although I do agree with the grassy

473
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: thing. Yeah.

474
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:38.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think that's the thing is like we have these lovely gorgeous areas that really you don't go in very much and you know you have to unlock to get into them as you progress the story which is fine but then once you've done that you're only really going in if you need to do something for the quest right like your farm and the main town area and the kind of more common areas they're all the kind of grassy areas and it's not really a complaint right like it's not like they look bad it's just like these other areas

475
00:35:38.500 --> 00:36:08.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: areas look great I want to be able to see more mystical looking areas more regularly you know.

476
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:52.099
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I mean, they kind of set the expectation when you check out these or you accidentally stumble

477
00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:55.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: across these other areas and then you go back to like your farm and just like the main

478
00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.539
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: town area and it's all kind of the same.

479
00:35:58.539 --> 00:36:02.940
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So the expectation has kind of been raised in that sense, but it's also not like a deal

480
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.099
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: break or a game changer or anything for me.

481
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.440
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: No. No. Just, just to make it very clear, we both love this game and everything we say

482
00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:07.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's just an observation.

483
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:14.460
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

484
00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: is nitpicking, right? Like, this is, this is, this is not the game is bad because of these.

485
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: This is the game is great. And if it had these things, it would be perfect rather than anything else.

486
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes

487
00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:26.719
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So just, just to make that fairly clear, we love this game, fill stop.

488
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, yes

489
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.760
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Okay, cool. Let's talk about the mechanics then. So, oh, sorry.

490
00:36:31.719 --> 00:36:34.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Dale Dale North might be love it the music. Oh

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Just I needed to get that out of my system

494
00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:44.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Dale North

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.739
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You're gonna, you're gonna, well, let's, okay, let's talk about, before we get into like the full mechanics,

528
00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:30.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: let's talk about the beginning of the game. You've got your customization. I made a ginger cat.

529
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:37.219
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, you made my maki, you basically made my maki.

530
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.860
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I like my little ginger cat. Sure.

531
00:39:37.219 --> 00:39:45.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I did actually, I forgot I made a note that I was trying to make a tuxedo cat specifically

532
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:51.099
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: in my past cat precious and I just wish there was a little bit more customization with

533
00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:57.659
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the cat pattern because I can't add like a little white patch on the chest, which I'm

534
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.400
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: about, but I made it work, so, but otherwise like the character customization is pretty

535
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: good.

536
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's pretty standard, I just wish there was more.

537
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.900
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I spent quite a lot of time in there making sure I was happy and you know getting the right color and stuff like that

538
00:40:11.619 --> 00:40:18.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: This is normally where we talk about tutorial. I kind of don't want to talk about tutorial a lot because it's going to tie into the quests a lot

539
00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:20.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Which I want to talk about later

540
00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:25.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But suffice to say I think they've done tutorial really well like I am such a big critic of tutorial

541
00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:32.340
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: The very start of the game you have a bit of you know dialogue and and and tutorial to really get you started

542
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But it's particularly short. It's like the

543
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:56.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: absolute basics of things. And then all the other tutorial is in quests that you can just choose to do. So if you're like, oh, I want to do fishing, and you haven't been told about fishing, you go to the quest board and you see the one that is a tutorial for fishing, and that's how you learn about fishing and you get the fishing rod, et cetera, et cetera.

544
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:57.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

545
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:05.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Well, I think it's a really good way of doing it, especially for someone like me, where it's like, here is the absolute basics you need for this game. And also you can skip that.

546
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:35.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If you want, when you're creating your save file, you can say skip tutorial day. But you've got like, I don't know, it maybe took like 10 minutes or something to get through the tutorial day. And then once you've done that, you now have the basics of the game. You can just go and do what you want, or you can go and then learn more more tutorial, go through more tutorial on learn more, but the other parts of the game as you unravel the game. Like you can leave some of it really

547
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:46.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, that's true. I think about it, that is a very good point. You can leave some of that stuff to whenever you want to do it and you can just do whatever you want and whatever order that you want, which is very nice to have that flexibility, very, very nice to have that flexibility.

548
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, really really good. The one disadvantage of it is like there are sometimes you might not realize that oh, there's this thing

549
00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:58.480
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I could use like it took me ages to realize there was a sword you could get because I just hadn't noticed that tutorial quest

550
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, yeah.

551
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.840
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And so I was like manually getting rid of the grass on my farm by using the whole on every single square and then

552
00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:07.719
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

553
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.639
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And then I was like always that a faster at Google whether there was a fast way to do it and then we're like you get the sword and I'm like, oh

554
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.280
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Oh, there's a sword. Yeah, okay

555
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I just stumbled across that crest recently.

556
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But if you if you are aware that's how these quest things work

557
00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:24.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: There is our in the on the quest board. There is like a tutorial section

558
00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:29.440
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So you can look in that and see all of the tutorial quests if you want to just filter it into that which is is really good

559
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:33.300
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: um-hmm yeah it's very nice that they have the different categories filtered like that for the

560
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:39.780
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: quests whether you want to do main story whether you want to do um I guess like guild stuff whether

561
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: All right, we're talking about quests

562
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:47.300
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: you want to do okay yeah we're just going straight into quests that is fine

563
00:42:43.139 --> 00:42:49.900
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Finally, okay. Yeah, so there is the quests are basically almost entirely

564
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.539
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like pool pooling quests rather than pushing them to you and what by that

565
00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:58.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I mean like you have to ask for quests

566
00:42:58.699 --> 00:43:02.579
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It never goes like oh here are ten quests go

567
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I actually really like that because it means that if you don't want to focus on something you can just ignore it

568
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So you have a question board in the in

569
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:38.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: middle of the the the tone and you go to it and you say I want this quest and before you select the quest it tells you what you need to do to start it like all of the steps and what you get for it. So if you're like if you don't have access to something or you don't want to do a specific thing, then you can just ignore that quest without there's nothing I find more annoying than having a quest you can't do just now and just sitting there for days and days and days with this quest you can't complete just sitting in your list of things.

570
00:43:39.500 --> 00:44:09.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And so the fact that I can look at it and go okay yeah I can do all these things let me select that quest just now and go and do it. It's really nice I really like. Yeah. It's a cottageco game that's kind of yeah it's one of the things that you know we like about these games is the less stressed the like do what you

571
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.320
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I also like that there's no time limit for these quests, at least what I've encountered so far.

572
00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:01.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: You could just, again, do them whatever you want, which is awesome.

573
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.460
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'd love it.

574
00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:14.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I guess I think about that because I think about the quest board or the request,

575
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

576
00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:18.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: whatever the thing is called in Stardew, and it's like you have three days, and I'm like,

577
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:26.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I just, I just ignored those quests and if I, if I wasn't sure I could do it, I never

578
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I have no idea if I'm going to catch this fish.

579
00:44:21.039 --> 00:44:35.599
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I have no idea, which, I bet the thing is I love quests, so it's like my thing is I always

580
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.980
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: took a quest because I'd much rather not have a quest than failable.

581
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:40.079
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: want to do the quest first, but it's like, also I need to do this thing and this thing

582
00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:43.719
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and I want to do this quest first, but I have to do this thing and I just, yeah, I guess

583
00:44:43.719 --> 00:44:44.719
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that's fair.

584
00:44:44.719 --> 00:44:48.440
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I shouldn't pick up the quest in the first place, but when I see it there, it's

585
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like, I have to interact with it, I can't not interact with it.

586
00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:01.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Don't I don't think I've ever done a fish quest in stardew just cuz I'm like, I know I don't I don't I'm not

587
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's fair, that's fair.

588
00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.179
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm just a quest person, I guess, to be fair.

589
00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:08.599
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yes

590
00:45:07.179 --> 00:45:09.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But yeah, again, not having a time limit is awesome,

591
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: because speaking of the fishing quest,

592
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.639
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like one of the quest's requires you to catch salmon.

593
00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:19.139
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And I can't find salmon.

594
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:27.440
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I presume you've made sure you're far fishing in the right spot at the right time.

595
00:45:19.139 --> 00:45:21.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I am trying over and over and over again,

596
00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.400
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and I can't find salmon.

597
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, yes, and I still can't.

598
00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.239
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm just, it's bad RNG for me.

599
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, yeah, fair.

600
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:38.159
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Such as life. That's the problem with that's the problem with fishing always the problem with fishing

601
00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:40.739
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Which we'll get on to later

602
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, the way it's all organized and everything,

603
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.320
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: very nice.

604
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:49.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I like that you can also take notes in-game,

605
00:45:49.159 --> 00:45:51.599
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: for a set of quests if you want.

606
00:45:52.500 --> 00:46:00.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, in game with these things is really important cuz like for me cuz a lot of I know a lot of people are like they'll sit with their

607
00:46:00.659 --> 00:46:06.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: With their note pad next to them or their spreadsheet next to them and they'll be like typing typey typey or a righty righty righty

608
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

609
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.219
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I'm not like that if I have an oat book. It is lost

610
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.840
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If I have something written down it is gone and if I'm playing a game

611
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I'm not playing it in a place where I will want to be looking at a spreadsheet, right?

612
00:46:19.019 --> 00:46:22.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: like I'm sitting on my sofa watching TV with my wife.

613
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:31.480
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I'm not sitting there wanting to have a spreadsheet up on my laptop at the same time.

614
00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:41.300
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I will say, even though I did make the note that being able to take notes in the game is sick,

615
00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And so yeah, being able to note things down in-game is...

616
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and I will probably take advantage of that more when I am playing it.

617
00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:50.099
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I actually haven't played it on my Steam Deck yet, because I've been playing it at home,

618
00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:52.820
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: so I'm like, oh, I might as well just sit at my PC, because I like sitting at my PC.

619
00:46:54.420 --> 00:47:00.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I have actually been using a notebook for my note taking as I'm playing the game.

620
00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:06.980
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But having the option to go between both is very nice, especially in your case.

621
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.980
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: - Yeah, for sure.

622
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:14.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But I will say, I wish, speaking of the notebook, I wish that I could pin more than one crafting

623
00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:21.699
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: recipe while doing the quests, because then I, I'm not even pinning them anymore,

624
00:47:21.699 --> 00:47:26.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: because I'm just writing them in my notebook, because I want to have, I need sometimes for

625
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like one quest you have to make, like, I think, like, paper.

626
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:36.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: in order to make paper, need this thing, but then to, like, you have to make, like, some,

627
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: you have to make, I think it was a sleeping box, so you need to make paper to then make cardboard

628
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:46.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to then make the sleeping box. So it's like one, two, three, and I would like to just be able to pin all three

629
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:52.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to the side, but I can't. So that's why I ended up just writing it all down. Minor complaint, but just,

630
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah

631
00:47:52.500 --> 00:48:00.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like, just, just a complaint. And I do wish to that.

632
00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.980
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah fair

633
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:16.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that I could pin locations or villagers on the map for markers and also just access or maps.

634
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:17.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I think the map, I think the map in general is probably the game's weakest point.

635
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:25.980
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think it's functional, and it technically does everything I want it to do.

636
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's just awkward doing most of the things with it, right?

637
00:48:29.659 --> 00:48:33.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If you want to open up, okay, so let me open up my lap and see you.

638
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:40.780
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If you're in the area of the map that I'm in, I will be able to see him unless he's in a

639
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:47.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: building. If he's in a different area of the map that I can't see, I can't see him and I don't know

640
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yep.

641
00:48:47.019 --> 00:48:55.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: how to know whether I see him or not. You just have to kind of like scan over and see some people and

642
00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:02.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: some buildings show in a list that you can then like click on and it will highlight it on the map,

643
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.539
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: but not everything.

644
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:12.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I don't think I don't have the game open in front of me, but I think for example correct me if I'm wrong, but like nobody's house

645
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I don't think you can highlight on the map for example and I'm not sure why that is I might be wrong a bit nobody says

646
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:24.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But there are certainly some buildings that I went to go and like click on the list in the map to see what it was and it just was

647
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.599
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I think I think you're right. I can't remember either and I also don't have the game open, so I can't fully remember

648
00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:38.460
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But I remember having an issue and I might have just been my game being funky at one point, but I remember

649
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughs]

650
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Not related, but kind of tangent tangentially related

651
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: The calendar too. I was having a trouble with interacting with it at some point

652
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.079
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Like I could not click on the map the calendar at all

653
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:54.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I'm just looking at this calendar and I see like three pieces of cake

654
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:16.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: on the calendar and I'm like I assume that's someone's birthday, but I could not interact with it and it was weird, so it might be just an occasional glitch thing is my suspicion, because that doesn't seem right, but I still agree that the map could use more work especially with like being able to view more areas at once.

655
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:21.179
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, it's also just things like, you know, like moving between the tabs for different items and stuff like that

656
00:50:21.179 --> 00:50:27.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's just everything on them on the map is just slightly more awkward to do than would be ideal

657
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:35.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I'm really focusing on this purely because it is like the one area where I've been a little bit disappointed in it

658
00:50:35.059 --> 00:50:40.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think it could do with a lot of little bits of work in different places. It's not like it needs a complete overhaul

659
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:45.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: There's just like a few different kind of user experience things that it could use

660
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:51.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: in terms of improvement and if you did like five things it would be a million times better

661
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:57.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, that that's all it's not massive and it's not like I hate them up

662
00:50:57.619 --> 00:51:00.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I still use it. It's still good enough to do what I wanted to do

663
00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:06.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It just takes like a few more clicks every time than I would like to do the extended things and stuff

664
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.820
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, this is yeah, that's another thing too with the

665
00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:15.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Since you mentioned like the toggling in between things in the map in general and just more clicks I

666
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.480
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Since I've been playing it at my PC when I end up opening up like my

667
00:51:21.159 --> 00:51:28.360
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: journal or my quest log or anything with a map. I end up just switching to my I primarily play with the controller

668
00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:33.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But when I switched to when I open up that stuff, I end up using my

669
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: mouse because

670
00:51:37.039 --> 00:51:42.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: trying to toggle in between like the different filters for example for the quests

671
00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:44.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: feels

672
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: slightly awkward

673
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.440
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Nothing terrible, but it just feels a little bit

674
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:58.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Clunky, especially when I could be using the bumpers and triggers more to be able to cycle through different areas of the menu

675
00:51:58.639 --> 00:52:00.360
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: overall

676
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So in addition to that with the map, it just feels a bit awkward

677
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:13.800
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah. I will say I agree with you. I also think that this is a much better game in terms

678
00:52:03.159 --> 00:52:04.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I ended up hovering over different areas of the map.

679
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: with my mouse because it's just faster.

680
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:20.920
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: of controller support than most games are in my experience. They've clearly properly integrated

681
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.440
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I agree. I agree.

682
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:26.039
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: the controller. It's not just like pretending it's a nice and keyboard, which a lot of controller

683
00:52:26.039 --> 00:52:30.840
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: support does, right? But yeah, I agree. I think it's difficult when you build

684
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:52.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: our interface for most in keyboard, and then you add on control support. A lot of things are not ideal, and then you have the option of do we change how the UI works now that we have it, and we're adding this or do we make it, or do we make the control support less ideal, and they definitely went with the second option, which I understand why they did.

685
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:01.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But yeah, it's like the, is it the journal, is that where they call it, where you've got the quests, and is like the, the, the.

686
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: recipes and all this stuff. It's like a big book with all the stuff in.

687
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.619
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, whoa the recipes is is a struggle

688
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:30.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: That whole, that whole book, it is, technically fine in terms of how the controller works, but I, as you say, like it could work a little bit nicer in terms of like to switch tab, you have to like go to the left and then select the tab with it with the buttons and then press the, you know, the A button and then it selects that tab.

689
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

690
00:53:31.000 --> 00:54:00.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So I have the like pressing in of the right control stick to go to quests. There's a claim all button for the quests. If you have a bunch of quests that completed, you can, you can press the button to claim all, but it doesn't work by default unless you've so, unless your focus is on the quest section of the book. So if I press, if I press the right control stick to go into quests and press the X button, it doesn't.

691
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes. I love that.

692
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.019
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, I didn't even realize that.

693
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:31.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It doesn't claim everything. I have to, I have to press the control stick in and then go right on the deep out of the left analog stick and then press X. That's the only way that it will work. It's like such small, tiny things that like sound so per nicotine. And it's like so pathetic, the fact that we're talking about these things, but this is just the level of when you like a game this much, you just go into this. There's so few things about it that are like fundamentally problems that you go into these really.

694
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.739
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughing]

695
00:54:31.000 --> 00:55:01.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: really narrow weird things. And it's just like every time I want to claim a quest, I have to do it one extra button press, which is so silly, but also just that little bit annoying. You know, it's like exactly exactly. So like if, if, if I open the quest thing, putting my focus on the quests by default would save me so much minor annoyances as I play the game.

696
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.460
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's just, it's just a little bit. It's not ruining my experience, but it's just a little bit.

697
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mm-hmm, I agree, I agree.

698
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.719
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And again, I've personally adjusted

699
00:55:01.719 --> 00:55:04.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: by just using my mouse at points like that.

700
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.400
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So that's maybe another reason

701
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that I just don't even realize sometimes.

702
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.679
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But it is, I remember when I first,

703
00:55:08.679 --> 00:55:10.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: it's like one of the first notes that I took

704
00:55:10.519 --> 00:55:15.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: when I was making my notes for this recording eventually,

705
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.360
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: was just, it felt a little clunky.

706
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It could be a little bit better.

707
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I do agree the control support is very good

708
00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:24.119
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: in contrast to other games,

709
00:55:24.119 --> 00:55:25.639
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but it could always be better.

710
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:31.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: agreed, agreed. All right. So that's quests and have we done all of the, we've not done

711
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.139
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: all the control stuff. So let's talk about more controls, more in general, because we talked

712
00:55:36.139 --> 00:55:42.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: about the menus and the map and stuff like that. Let's talk about how good the jumping

713
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

714
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:49.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: in this game is. Not only, not only do you get to jump and by the way, jumping will be

715
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Ah, it's so good. The jump dash, ah.

716
00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:54.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: a major theme in the game of the year episode, just saying, not only is jumping fun.

717
00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:02.480
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But you have a double jump right from the start. I get a double jump straight away.

718
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:05.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, yes, yes, oh it's so good, it's so good.

719
00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:09.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I, I, I cannot, I don't walk in this game. I just, I just cannot walk. I, I am jumping. I'm jumping

720
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:16.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and dashing. I'm jumping over things and then jumping round things. I'm jumping through things.

721
00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:24.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like, why, why walk when you can jump? Gotta jump.

722
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.980
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I see why you want to be a border collie.

723
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.360
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's all making sense.

724
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:29.019
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Jump. Jumping everywhere.

725
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.400
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's all making sense.

726
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.940
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughing]

727
00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.599
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No, I have nothing else to add.

728
00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:35.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's so good.

729
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.400
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: If you want to walk, if you want to just, you know,

730
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: run around or whatever, like you can do that,

731
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.360
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but if you want to like, I agree,

732
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: if you want to, you will be jumping and dashing rather.

733
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And it feels so good.

734
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And it just does not feel like a slog to get through

735
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: because you have these options and it's so nice.

736
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's so, so, so nice.

737
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.780
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: one complaint that I do have is that because the jumping is so much fun, I want to jump everywhere,

738
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.980
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: it means that the few invisible walls they have are really frustrating. I don't know if you

739
00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.219
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I don't know if you know, experience them. So see when you're coming from your farm to the

740
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Don't even remember. I don't even remember

741
00:57:14.219 --> 00:57:23.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: main town entrance, you know, the archway that's over the where your your boxes, your shipping box,

742
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah

743
00:57:23.739 --> 00:57:26.219
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: you can't go over that because it's an invisible wall.

744
00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:31.539
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, so I never even I never even dropped that high. I just jumped through it

745
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:34.699
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I see, I tried to go over it because it feels like it will be faster. It feels like a shortcut,

746
00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: but then it doesn't let me jump over it.

747
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:43.940
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Again minor minor complaint. I'm like just jump through it then it's it. It's all it is

748
00:57:43.099 --> 00:57:46.139
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what if I want to jump over it?

749
00:57:47.139 --> 00:57:50.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No, I agree. I agree. 100%. Hey, there could be a patch that comes

750
00:57:48.059 --> 00:57:50.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You wouldn't stop a bar to call you jumping over it, would you?

751
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:57.300
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: down the line. I would not stop a border collar from doing just about anything. If that's what makes their heart

752
00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:10.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: happy, that's what makes their heart happy. That I can agree with. Yeah, very smooth, very

753
00:57:58.139 --> 00:57:59.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: except, you know,

754
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:28.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: there's a lot to talk about the controls, I think so many things are really great, there's like the decorating, you go into the decorating mode and you can either do things on the grid or you can go off the grid and do things slightly better.

755
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:59.300
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You can like move your camera around to view. I will have talked or I will be talking in the game of the year episode about how this game is one of the few games that I actually like to decorate in and I knew that right back at the start when I played the alpha, just before the interview that I did nearly six years ago, I knew that this game was special in terms of decorating because I just don't care in most games,

756
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:20.900
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: this game makes it fun and it makes me feel like I can actually do it as well. It has the flexibility, but it also has the guardrails that allow you to make something that doesn't look terrible. So many times I'm just like, I don't know, like the bed goes there, the big case goes there, but doesn't look good and I don't know why, whereas everything I do in this looks good.

757
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:27.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, and it helps that the again the art style and everything just the art

758
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.019
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: directional meshes really well together in addition to the flexibility that

759
00:59:31.019 --> 00:59:34.619
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: they give you with if you want to use the grid system you can if you want to

760
00:59:34.619 --> 00:59:38.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: go off the grid system you can like they they give you that flexibility it just

761
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:43.820
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: allows for I feel like more creativity to low and no matter what you put with

762
00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.780
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: what because the art direction is so consistent and so good everything looks

763
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:51.780
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: great together and it's just a wonderfully whimsical time.

764
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.280
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, for sure and it's like you can you they have

765
00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.840
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like you can rotate by like 45 degrees which makes things automatically nicer, right?

766
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm so...

767
01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.840
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like my bed is like

768
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:09.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like diagonally from the corner and it just feels so much nicer than just like, oh, it's like sticking straight out from a wall

769
01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.719
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You know, it's it just it just feels so much nicer and like my house as well

770
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, right

771
01:00:15.719 --> 01:00:17.920
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You like put your house down when you first start the game

772
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.920
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I put it like just to the right of the river.

773
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:36.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I just it feels so much nicer and coincidentally ended up lining up perfectly to where I wanted to farm things so I can just have a nice low path going down from there. But yeah, it's really nice. Oh, that reminds me that reminds me. Sorry.

774
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I gotta-- I gotta--

775
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:50.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Just thoughts are coming to me as I'm as I'm talking you if you're putting if you're building things right so see the first example I found this was when I was putting down my stone path from my house to my farm.

776
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No, you're good, you're good.

777
01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:07.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If you run out of the item that you have, but it's an item you can craft and you have the items that you need to craft it, you can just keep building the thing and it will automatically craft you the item so you can put it down.

778
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:20.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So you don't need to do anything. So like you're sitting going pinned down your path, but you only have five paths, but it only takes one stone to do it and you have a hundred stone in your in your box in your house, by the way.

779
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes

780
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:30.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You put it down path, you run it a path, you just put another piece of path down and it just uses up a stone. You don't it's so many steps are taken away.

781
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yep.

782
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:44.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And it's great. I love it. Absolutely love that. That's so much fun because I the thing that annoys me most about decorating, especially with like path or something like something where you've got a lot of one item is like trying to figure out how many you need.

783
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And then you either underestimate in which case you need to go and craft more or you overestimate in which case you have left.

784
01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:10.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And what do you do with the leftovers? What is here is here, you don't have to do that. You make one item and then you go and start putting it down and you just keep doing it until you have all of you need and then you're done. It's amazing.

785
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughs]

786
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:11.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yup, yup, that was my one of my biggest issues with Animal Crossing was just trying

787
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: All my words.

788
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.280
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to plan that stuff out, and that's why I like never did it because I was like this crafting

789
01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: situation is just so way too much thought that I don't want to put in, so the fact that

790
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:22.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah. Yeah. And they didn't, and they didn't even have boat crafting until next year.

791
01:02:20.519 --> 01:02:32.719
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: they just, oh my god, I know literally, so like this, when it comes to that stuff, it, I feel

792
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.940
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Myles ahead of everything this is.

793
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.440
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: this game, this is like a very general statement, it really, it gives you the freedom

794
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:45.480
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to do whatever you want and go and as slow or as fast as you want, and regardless of how

795
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:54.360
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: you want to play, how you want to play the game, it respects your time, and I so much so

796
01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.559
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: appreciate that when it comes to farming games, I feel like there are a lot of farming games

797
01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:03.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that don't respect your time and it

798
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:23.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: is more grindy than it needs to be and I don't mind the grind to be fair and if you want to grind that's okay but as someone that doesn't always want to do that the fact that this game lets like just again respects your time in my opinion more so I just I really much so I vary my so appreciative

799
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.400
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You have a bunch of thoughts, controls wise, lots of smaller items that you want to talk about and go for it.

800
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah. So actually circling back to the house thing, I got to move my house, I got to move my house

801
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.739
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughs]

802
01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:42.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: because I accidentally put it down on a bush. I didn't realize that. So now there's like a little like

803
01:03:37.739 --> 01:03:38.579
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Oh no.

804
01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:46.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: bush graphic like clipping through my house on from the outside.

805
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.800
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's a good thing it's really easy to move your house.

806
01:03:50.199 --> 01:03:53.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I got to move it. I just haven't made the active effort to move it, but like

807
01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:56.679
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Which, which, by the way, is a great thing.

808
01:03:56.679 --> 01:03:58.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: The fact that it's so easy to just move it.

809
01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.320
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And by the way, you can move it just by like one thing.

810
01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Mm-hmm.

811
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.840
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: None of this nonsense, like Stardew has, what it's like.

812
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.679
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Oh, you can't put it there, something's in the way.

813
01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.900
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughs]

814
01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: No, something's not in the way.

815
01:04:07.519 --> 01:04:10.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's the thing I'm moving that's in the way.

816
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It can't be in the way.

817
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.539
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: No, there's none of that because I did the same thing.

818
01:04:13.539 --> 01:04:16.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I put the first building you put down for

819
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:25.059
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: a person coming to the island. I did the same thing. I thought I was having to like rebuild the the broken stuff

820
01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:31.900
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So I was like, oh, I'm gonna build it on this broken thing not realizing that you actually break down that the broken stuff manually

821
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.780
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

822
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You know, this is a brand new building. You're not fixing a building

823
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.980
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughter]

824
01:04:35.659 --> 01:04:40.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So I like put it on and it was like half it was like slanted on top of this

825
01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.780
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughter]

826
01:04:41.619 --> 01:04:46.900
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Half wall it was such a weird situation. So I was like, oh, no, I really hope I can move that. Oh, yes

827
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.739
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, no!

828
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It is incredibly easy to move it. Thank goodness for that

829
01:04:49.539 --> 01:04:50.059
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's great.

830
01:04:50.059 --> 01:04:50.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's great.

831
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.059
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Again, that just start going back to the game

832
01:04:53.059 --> 01:04:54.699
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: respecting your time.

833
01:04:54.699 --> 01:04:58.059
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Just you don't have to do go through all these different hoops

834
01:04:58.059 --> 01:04:59.980
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to fix a mistake that you made.

835
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.659
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: They're just like, "Oh, you made a mistake."

836
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.260
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Easy, let's fix it. That's it. That's just great.

837
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I, and I get that some games are doing it

838
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.340
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: to be like realistic, right?

839
01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Or not that like moving your house is realistic

840
01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: to do in two days.

841
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Aww, yeah.

842
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.820
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But they're at least trying to do something there.

843
01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.099
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I understand that.

844
01:05:18.099 --> 01:05:19.820
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But like, not every game needs to do that.

845
01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.860
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I'm glad that Snackle's not doing it.

846
01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.780
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like I get that someone, someone too.

847
01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And I understand why people will like this makes it better.

848
01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:28.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But okay, we'll see.

849
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm playing a game to play a game. I'm not playing a game to experience reality times, too.

850
01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.659
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

851
01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:31.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah.

852
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.860
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

853
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm playing a game to play a game.

854
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But, um, yeah, other little things that I like is the go home feature.

855
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Love that. Love, love that.

856
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's a great feature.

857
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But then to kind of just go like a little bit back and forth with the go home feature in mine.

858
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I wish I could read the things in the bookshelf from...

859
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: The menu rather than having to go home, um, I never read them to be fair.

860
01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Hmm. Yes.

861
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It doesn't really matter that much because I never read them, but if I were to read them,

862
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: it would be nice to have like easy access to them rather than, again, having to go home.

863
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But at least there's a very easy go home feature for like fast traveling, essentially.

864
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's very nice. Very, very, very nice.

865
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So like if you're in the... I haven't hit the mines yet to be fair,

866
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but I would assume that if you were in the mines and you were just like,

867
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:35.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: "You don't have to worry about running home," like I've done many, many, many, many, many, many, many times in Stardew.

868
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.619
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: hahaha yeah as you russian you're like I don't know if I'm gonna make it yeah

869
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yep. Thank goodness for Stardew mods.

870
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Um, the fact that I could just hit go home is so, so, so nice.

871
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:52.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And then also the back size is also awesome as well.

872
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Like, they give you so much space in your bag, and that it's so easy!

873
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:09.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: To make more storage! It's awesome! It's the perfect amount of grinding, but not too much grind to feel like you're being burnt out.

874
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: You can save anywhere any time, which is great! You can auto-deposit, which is always a wonderful thing!

875
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:23.139
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: the auto-deposing thing is so good and let me tell you that this the sorting in the boxes is better than any other game

876
01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:27.679
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I've played like so many times it's like oh I didn't quite sort the way I would want to sort it

877
01:07:27.679 --> 01:07:31.219
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Now this time doing everything you want is great. I love it

878
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.679
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah. Um, and I already said this, but again, just playing the wiki, playing with the wiki

879
01:07:35.679 --> 01:07:39.519
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: open has been a good experience or just Google in general. Like I've been really enjoying

880
01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:44.480
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like playing the game with the wiki, having my little notebook and just it's been, it's been

881
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:50.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: really, really nice. Um, in regards to quote, unquote dislikes or like criticism, I guess you

882
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:59.780
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: could say criticism. Me, me thing is the, okay, that sounds good. I like that. That works. That sounds

883
01:07:52.500 --> 01:08:00.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Let's talk about it in the next section.

884
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.239
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: good. Um, I think I talked about everything then. Yeah, I already, I read a brush upon it. So this

885
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Are the ones fine though.

886
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Oh, you did already talk about the books.

887
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, that's fine.

888
01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:07.719
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: is a great transition.

889
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Okay.

890
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So let's talk about farming.

891
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So the farming is pretty standard in terms of her works, right?

892
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:19.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like you tell the land, you sow a seed, you water the seed.

893
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Eventually it grows and you harvest it and then you

894
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:43.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: have a tree cycle, pre-standard. No one's looking for anything funny or special here, it does what it wants to do. The actual use of the tools is a little bit different than normal. So you have like a, if you just like press the button to do something, it will do it and it will use a certain amount of stamina.

895
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:53.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If you hold the button to like, till the land or a chopper tree or whatever, there's a bar.

896
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:59.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: If it gets to the top of the bar and you let it go, you will lose less stamina than if you don't do that.

897
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:05.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I've got two things to say but there's one, interesting, I quite like that, two, I never do it.

898
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:21.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And the reason why I never do it, is because I would much rather spam the button and get through time quicker and then just go to sleep and do more with the next day, then spend the time to hold down the button to do less.

899
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:43.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But I can do four button presses of a tool in the time that it would take to do one less effective stamina item, if that makes sense. So I just never do that. I think it's an interesting way of doing things and if you really care about like min-maxing things, I can see why you would do that.

900
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:52.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like, I'm the guy that like speed runs spring of farming games, right? Because I'm like, I don't care about this, there's nothing to do right now.

901
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughs]

902
01:09:52.500 --> 01:10:03.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You don't have everything I need to do, let me go to sleep at 10 in the morning, right? Oh, absolutely, absolutely. Like, spring year one is time for sleeping.

903
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: 10 in the morning!

904
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:10.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's time for farming and once I've done the farming, when I run a F stamina, I am sleeping.

905
01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's wild.

906
01:10:09.159 --> 01:10:13.319
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's wild. Wildly different from how I operate.

907
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:22.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So yeah, I'm just spamming that button, but let me tell you, I love how quick it is. So if, first of all, have you noticed the, the, what?

908
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:33.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So what I'm doing is the same amount of stamina, no matter how long you hold the button down for, if you notice that. There you go, a little trick for you.

909
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.659
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No, I do not realize.

910
01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:30.140
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Good to know.

911
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.659
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I appreciate that.

912
01:10:31.659 --> 01:10:32.899
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That does save me some time.

913
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:51.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But I love how fast it is, right? So I have like, what is it like 22 by 3 or something? It crops on my farm just now. And so I'm just like going from one end to the other, and I just like hold, I hold the analog stick to the right, make sure my cameras.

914
01:10:52.500 --> 01:11:21.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So I'm going completely across, and then I'll just like, I'll just mash that button for, for doing it. And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm down that lane in like five seconds. It is super, super fast. I love it. And it's like, cutting down a tree. I just mash that button until the tree's gone. And it's gone in a couple of seconds. I love how fast these tools are. It's great. It makes early game start you feel like a slog.

915
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah

916
01:10:56.899 --> 01:10:59.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, me too

917
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yep.

918
01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:18.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yep.

919
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughs]

920
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I agree.

921
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I love again.

922
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I will keep staying in over and over, respecting your time.

923
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Respecting your time.

924
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.399
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It is incredibly efficient while still giving you, like, scratching that itch of wanting

925
01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:37.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to have a fun farm, like getting the farming out of your

926
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.560
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I also love how there's like little things like for example if you plan onion seeds

927
01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:52.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You can either harvest them as green onions or you can wait and harvest them as onion onions

928
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, I agree, yeah

929
01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:01.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like just things like that like I've never really seen that in another farming game except presumably farming simulator does it but like we ignore that

930
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughs]

931
01:12:03.159 --> 01:12:06.760
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Like the idea of like your crop will change because like you know

932
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I haven't got like any peppers yet, but I don't know whether that would be

933
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.399
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: a similar thing where it starts off as green and then goes red I don't know maybe maybe maybe I'll be disappointed if it turns it doesn't work that way

934
01:12:18.399 --> 01:12:22.239
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But like you know stuff like that. I think is really fun those little little things

935
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:28.800
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I've just never seen a farming game try and do that and that was like the second crop they give you and I thought that was really fun

936
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I guess maybe to be fair, I never even realized that that was not a common thing in farming

937
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: games because as you know, there's only so many farming games that I can cycle through and play.

938
01:12:41.039 --> 01:12:46.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So, if we're going me versus you, I would argue that you have played significantly more farming

939
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: games than I have, and yeah, it's not even something that I picked up on, but now that

940
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: you point that out, I'm like, oh, that is really cool that they are, I guess, realistic

941
01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: in that sense in a way, is that realistic actually? Either way.

942
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:08.560
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Okay. It's a good feature. That's a good question. I actually don't know.

943
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:06.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think it is. I think a green onion is just an onion spread. I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

944
01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.479
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Show us how much of a farmer I am, but...

945
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:18.399
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, it's a green onions or a tape of Allian vegetable harvested young, so yeah, yeah.

946
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Ah, cool. Sweet. All right. So we got some realism in there.

947
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:28.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I think it's awesome. I guess the one little quote-unquote issue that I have that I wrote down as

948
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: as well as I wish.

949
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I wish it's a, it's a personal thing.

950
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:43.600
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I wish Chilling didn't use stamina, but that's me just coming from the mindset of the other game that I'm picking up here in there in regard to a farming same is of course start you so it's like a very minor thing.

951
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:51.399
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm, I will feel better about it because I also haven't gotten the sword yet so I'm sure once I get the sword that I'm just going to have no issues whatsoever at that point so.

952
01:13:51.399 --> 01:13:58.479
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Not something I'm pressed about whatsoever, I wish it's like man, I just wish this didn't, this telling didn't use stamina and that was it.

953
01:13:58.479 --> 01:14:00.479
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: [laughter]

954
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.239
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: The farming in the game feels great so far.

955
01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:07.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I am enjoying building up my farm.

956
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:15.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I think one of the, oddly enough, one of the most off-putting things in regards to farming

957
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: games is the farming because of how much of a slog it could be.

958
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:27.520
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So the fact that they've made it in a way where it feels satisfying or I guess rewarding

959
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:37.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So I just, I just Google and that is how Bell peppers work in the game as well. You harvest

960
01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.560
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to do farming, they nailed it.

961
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.239
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I really think they nailed it.

962
01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:41.880
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: them early, you get green ones, you harvest them later, you get red ones. It's like here

963
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Ahh, that's nice!

964
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:51.239
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I was already to be disappointed in the game and they've gone and done it.

965
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:54.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: They're really hitting everything that we want in a game, and it's awesome!

966
01:14:53.800 --> 01:15:00.199
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's, it's such an unnecessary thing to add by love it. It's great.

967
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It's all about the little things.

968
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It really is like all the little things add up to be this wonderful mishmash

969
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that has been formed into

970
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:38.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: this game, just the smallest quality of life things. I mean evident here, the smallest quality of life things can be sometimes a little bit of a drag, but then all these other little things just make us dismiss the other negative little things. I don't really know where I'm going with that. I'm kind of just going off in a little bit of income here. It's slightly incoherent tangent, but you know what I mean? [laughs]

971
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:37.439
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, that's fine. I mean farming, I think overall we're enjoying it. It's good. It's pretty

972
01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:42.640
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: standard. I believe there are like more tools to automate it more, which I'm looking forward

973
01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:49.359
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: to getting, but those will feel like an advantage to me rather than just like in most farming

974
01:15:49.359 --> 01:15:54.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: games is like oh good now I don't have to water anymore. And it won't be like oh thank goodness I

975
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.279
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: don't need to water anymore. It's oh yeah there's just speed things up a little bit because of

976
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.680
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: not hating watering right? Like I don't feel like I have to artificially limit myself to how

977
01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.800
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: much I can water in a day because you can pretty much water in a thing with with how this game

978
01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.760
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: worked, whichever they like. And the sprinklers will just mean I don't have to go through the effort

979
01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:22.960
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: of that and can do something else instead which I'm looking forward to. Oh yeah, no absolutely

980
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:23.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I agree, I agree. I'm very much still looking forward to sprinklers as much as much as I enjoy water and I'm just like having those extra quality left things is gonna be nice.

981
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: absolutely. I'm not saying I'm looking forward to them.

982
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.560
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But like in Stardew, I'm like speedrunning to the point where I can get the sprinklers so I don't

983
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:38.800
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: because like I just it's so slow watering all your crops. It's like walk up, press the button

984
01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.800
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: two second animation, walk up, press the button two, where is here it's like bam bam bam bam bam

985
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Yeah.

986
01:16:44.479 --> 01:16:45.319
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Mm-hmm.

987
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and like that is the actual speed that it is. I'm not exaggerating how fast that watering is.

988
01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:56.560
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It is like you are doing like five or six a second. It is like super super fast. You can you can

989
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and really speed through it if you go.

990
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.300
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Once you get it down to a science like yeah, you can you can really speedrun it

991
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:08.760
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Just make sure that camera is at the right angle so you don't end up going at a diagonal.

992
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:14.319
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yo, but once you workshop it you you'll have it down pat and it's just it's a it's a it's just I could I could sit there and just

993
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Water all day. I could sit there until all day if I want to

994
01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Because it just feels great to do so

995
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Fishing. The other one that's kind of like standard in farming games and every farming game has a different way of doing it.

996
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: This is a very different fishing minigame than most farming games, right?

997
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So in my experience, you've got two ways of doing fishing. You either do the Animal Crossing way of fishing, which is you wait until the thing happens, you press the button, you catch it.

998
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Or you do the Stardew one, which is you wait until it catches on, you press the button, and then you have to keep the bobber.

999
01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: A specific point, pressing one button to make it go up, and then wait for it to go down. And those are fine.

1000
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:13.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I really like this fishing minigame. So to try, try, I'm going to try and paint a visual picture for those of you that can actually visualize things in your head, and I'm sorry if you're, if you're like me and can't.

1001
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:23.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I'm going to describe this as a baseball field looking thing. Is that fair? I'm not, I'm not an American, but I'm pretty sure that looks like a baseball field. You're like,

1002
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Yeah.

1003
01:18:21.819 --> 01:18:23.619
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: - Yeah, it's like a baseball field, I would agree.

1004
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:43.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: like what a 45 degree angle roughly of area with a curved top, and you have the fish in the middle, and you've got like your fishing line, this kind of like a line going up the baseball field from the point to the circle at the top.

1005
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:54.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And basically what you have to do is you have to hold the button and follow the fish left and right as it moves around the angle. So you're basically like changing what angle your fishing.

1006
01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:05.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And if you're on line is at to where the fish is. And if you're on it, it will come closer towards you. And if you offer it will go get further away and eventually it will break the line and disappear.

1007
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:20.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think this is a much more easy is not the right word because like some of the fish can be quite difficult, but it feels much more, I don't, I don't even want to say accessible either. It just, it feels more graspable.

1008
01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:24.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I know it does make sense.

1009
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.020
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Does that make sense? I don't know how to describe my feeling towards it, but it feels

1010
01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:31.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I enjoy it more than Stardew and Animal Crossing.

1011
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I would say if I would rank the three, it would be I enjoy the Snacko one because it does.

1012
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:41.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I agree that I don't, I agree that that accessible is not necessarily the correct word,

1013
01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but it feels graspable indeed.

1014
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [Laughter]

1015
01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:49.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like I feel like I did pick it up faster and I enjoy

1016
01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:59.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: watching more. Initially I liked Animal Crossing Fishing, but sometimes it just gets very stressful having to like time and out perfectly and you miss it, you're just like aha.

1017
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:06.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And then the starter you want is just very stressful. Most of the time I'm just like kind of, I might as well be screaming through half of them sometimes. So I'm just like aha.

1018
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

1019
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:18.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So like I would say snacko Animal Crossing Stardew for just talking about those three is like my ranking of best to worst experiences.

1020
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:28.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But it's just, it is very stressful at points and Animal Crossing is generally good, but then when it's a very difficult fish to catch, it becomes kind of a lot.

1021
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:38.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And I guess I haven't had too many difficult fish experiences yet in snacko, but so far I've been enjoying the experience the most when it comes to fishing.

1022
01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Like, that little mini game feels, like you said, graspable.

1023
01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.699
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So, I get what you mean.

1024
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.760
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I feel like I just a lot of them are are just the stardew one, but like in a different way

1025
01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.680
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But like essentially it's the same thing. Where is this is much different?

1026
01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:01.359
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Because those ones are like you press a button to move it one direction and then let go of the button to move it another direction

1027
01:21:01.359 --> 01:21:07.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I don't like the the lack of control there where it's like if you go to high you have to wait

1028
01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:11.600
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You don't have a way to like reverse it. You just have to wait for gravity

1029
01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:14.039
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Whereas in this one is

1030
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:21.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: it's like, oh, I went too far. Let me just go the other direction, right? And it's just about making sure that you keep up to date with it and if you fail it.

1031
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.880
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: actually question. I don't know if you noticed because I have to actually test it and I'll probably test it

1032
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:35.399
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: later today or tomorrow or something. But so what I really, really like about the fishing actually

1033
01:21:35.399 --> 01:21:41.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: is the fact that when you interact with the fish and start the fishing like mini-game will call it,

1034
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: it shows you what fish you caught you or what you could, what fish you could be catching.

1035
01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:52.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And that is, I think, by far my favorite part of it, but my question.

1036
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: If you see the fish and you're like, I don't need another, if you're not like me and you're like,

1037
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I don't need another salmon, can you just back out of the mini-game and does that use your stamina?

1038
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.579
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think you can.

1039
01:22:06.579 --> 01:22:07.939
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: That I don't know.

1040
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:12.279
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That is something that I'm curious about. So, noted for later, I will try to remember to check.

1041
01:22:07.939 --> 01:22:09.300
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: That's a good question.

1042
01:22:13.319 --> 01:22:18.119
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm curious if it uses up your stamina. If you look at the fish and you're like, I don't want it,

1043
01:22:18.119 --> 01:22:21.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and then you leave. But I do like that you have the option.

1044
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can just back out, but yeah, I don't know, uh, I don't know how much if he uses stamina or whatever.

1045
01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.119
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, I know for a fact you can back out, but I haven't realized the other stamina part.

1046
01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.359
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But regardless, the option is nice. If you didn't want to waste your time with it,

1047
01:22:32.359 --> 01:22:36.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: you just sacrifice a stamina, that's fine. If you don't sacrifice your stamina and you don't waste

1048
01:22:36.199 --> 01:22:39.479
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the time, even better. Either way works for me.

1049
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughs]

1050
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.560
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I've done a little bit of cooking, I will say I also have not done too much cooking.

1051
01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:02.399
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I wish I have, I want to do more cooking, but my quests have just been having me do

1052
01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:08.720
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: many other things that I want to do more. But I mean, very simply, I didn't really

1053
01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: write down on the notes just because it's good, it's standard. I don't know if it's necessarily

1054
01:23:13.039 --> 01:23:21.359
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: anything outstanding, but it's fine. I like that it exists. I appreciate that it exists so I can

1055
01:23:22.479 --> 01:23:26.720
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: basically be able to replenish my stamina throughout the day more. But that's also kind of a standard

1056
01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:34.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: thing in, I would say, a number of different farming games. So it's good. No, nothing outstanding. Nothing

1057
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: to complain about at the moment. If there is something, I will follow up at a later point because I

1058
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.720
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: just haven't had enough experience with the cooking to really say too much. But it's good.

1059
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.899
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I've never come across cooking that I actively enjoy in these games.

1060
01:23:50.899 --> 01:23:55.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's all just about how much I would do or don't dislike it, right?

1061
01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And it's like how much time it takes to create a thing.

1062
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.979
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So I haven't actually done any of the cooking.

1063
01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:08.060
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Do you get recipes and can you just like click on a recipe and make a bunch of one recipe

1064
01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:09.060
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: or something like that?

1065
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:35.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: "I believe you can. I've only made like one thing at a time, but I believe you can. I feel like you should be able to. It would not make sense to me if you couldn't do that, because then that would go against the rest of the game. So I think you can. But yeah, I just haven't had enough. I probably have had more experience with cooking than you, but I would argue it's not all that much more."

1066
01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Or are you not that far?

1067
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Right. Yeah.

1068
01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:44.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So it looks like they don't have like proper bulk cooking, but if you make a recipe you can just like there's a button press to just make it again

1069
01:24:45.619 --> 01:24:48.380
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So you can just like press it and it will keep making it

1070
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:55.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's what it is. Which is fine. Again, it's not something that upset me. So it's not something that I like took major note of.

1071
01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:53.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, and it uses a

1072
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.539
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah

1073
01:24:55.539 --> 01:25:02.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, it's just like I like the idea of like going out and like catching a bunch of fish and then going and cooking them all

1074
01:25:02.779 --> 01:25:06.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And it's just like you just got to keep pressing the button and that's fine

1075
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:13.220
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: but like I guess whatever it's it's it uses your your storage as well so

1076
01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:17.520
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: like the crafting it's basically exactly the same as the crafting right as long as

1077
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: long as you're gonna press the button and you have the thing that it needs to

1078
01:25:20.319 --> 01:25:28.159
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: do it it's gonna do that thing which is good for sure

1079
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.079
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, big help, big quality of life, help.

1080
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: You're good, you're good.

1081
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:39.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, this is really not too much I can add with cooking, because I need a little bit more time with it to really have like a full full opinion,

1082
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but it's just been, it's been generally good. I would say, as someone that are good.

1083
01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:49.819
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, I think cooking is such in in my experience cooking is like such a minimal thing in farming games that

1084
01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:55.439
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's like yeah, you do it to complete tasks and to get stamina

1085
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:10.560
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: That's fair. I'm looking forward to sinking time into cooking just because I enjoy a cooking

1086
01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:03.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Right, and it's like so the the less I can do to cook the things I want to cook the better in my in my

1087
01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.920
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: mechanic here and there. I mean, I enjoyed magical delicacy for a reason. I enjoyed the cooking

1088
01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.359
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: mechanic and there, even though I was sitting there going through like five billion different

1089
01:26:19.359 --> 01:26:23.039
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: resources to figure out how to cook certain things. Once it was done, I was like,

1090
01:26:23.039 --> 01:26:26.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Cool! I'm happy with the end result, and then I just moved on.

1091
01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:34.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So it's like a very, like, in the moment gratifying moment, but it's not something that I initially rushed to do.

1092
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:41.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's not something you're praying that you can continue to do as fast as the first thing in your day is going to go do some cooking because you just love it so much.

1093
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No. No. I like it. It's on my list of things that I want to do sooner rather than later.

1094
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:51.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It starts like working through, like, making different recipes, because that's like, the idea of doing that is fun to me.

1095
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but I am really trying to figure out the way to get to the mines.

1096
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Peace out!

1097
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So there are mines in this game.

1098
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.260
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I haven't actually experienced it because apparently I have unlocked it.

1099
01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:05.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I've just not done them yet.

1100
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:11.699
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, no, I'm still working on it.

1101
01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.039
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Have you done the first oblisk and dungeon?

1102
01:27:11.039 --> 01:27:11.880
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: No.

1103
01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.899
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Oh no, I haven't finished the oblisk.

1104
01:27:13.899 --> 01:27:16.340
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I've done the dungeon that unlocks the first oblisk,

1105
01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.220
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: but I haven't finished the oblisk to unlock the mine.

1106
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:24.220
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So the dungeons are these like platforming challenges.

1107
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Oh, yeah!

1108
01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.460
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So you unlock.

1109
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:36.180
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: The first dungeon and it's the only dungeon you like have to do to like continue playing the game and unlock more things

1110
01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:42.899
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But there are other ones that you can do as well and the idea is that they're just they're relatively simple platforming challenges

1111
01:27:42.899 --> 01:27:46.699
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But they're they also have like a speedrun feature built into them

1112
01:27:46.699 --> 01:27:53.140
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: So like there's people online who doing them like a few seconds and it's very funny the things they do to make it go as fast as possible

1113
01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:58.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But yeah, as you progress the story you unlock the the first dungeon

1114
01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:28.479
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: and you do it and then once you've done that you unlock the first obelisk and then the first obelisk has like you have to give it a bunch of stuff and once you've given it a bunch of stuff then you will finish that and it will unlock the mines and the mines are I think pretty standard in terms of mines and they have some like machines in them to make resources as well but like they have you know clusters and you attack the clusters to get items.

1115
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:44.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: You break the nodes to get items from the thing and the reset every day. Yeah, I don't think there's a huge amount to see especially as neither of us have done the mines sadly.

1116
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:53.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm surprised that you haven't made your way over to the minds, but I did see, I mean, I do see like in the trailer that it looks like you can like ride a car.

1117
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.439
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: There is a mine cart, yeah.

1118
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Which is so cool.

1119
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:10.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I, you can go even faster and you can look like it flies. So I'm very excited to get to that point. I'm very, very, like, I already love mining in every farming game I've played so far.

1120
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: This might be, this looks like it has potential to be.

1121
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:20.619
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: The best mining, just solely because of the speed of that car and how fast you can get

1122
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:28.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, and the mining is like I'm double checking with a video, but yeah, the mining is pretty

1123
01:29:20.619 --> 01:29:22.619
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: through these areas.

1124
01:29:22.619 --> 01:29:24.020
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It looks so satisfying.

1125
01:29:29.359 --> 01:29:34.079
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: standard. It's just like there's nodes and you hit them with your axe and your pickaxe and you

1126
01:29:34.079 --> 01:29:39.359
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: get the stuff. But watching this video is reminded me, did you know that your tools can like hit

1127
01:29:39.359 --> 01:29:47.600
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: multiple items at once if you're in the right place? I love that. Yeah, you're using the same

1128
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, I've noticed that with trees. I can I'll accidentally hit multiple trees and I'm like yes

1129
01:29:46.159 --> 01:29:48.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm not wasting my stamina

1130
01:29:48.319 --> 01:29:52.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: you're using the same amount of stamina, but you're hitting two different trees. It's fantastic.

1131
01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.079
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes

1132
01:29:51.079 --> 01:29:53.479
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's wonderful. Oh

1133
01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.880
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It works the same for the nodes in the mine as well.

1134
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Thank God, that's awesome. That's great. Oh, this game is great. This game is so good

1135
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I just I can't believe how

1136
01:30:02.119 --> 01:30:08.520
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: much thought has been put into all these little tiny things to make this game so much more

1137
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.479
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: elevated. I'm gonna guess it's been an

1138
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.600
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: very very long time to be fair but still even though it's been worked on

1139
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: [laughing]

1140
01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: for like such a long time it feels like a modern game like you would think

1141
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.640
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: that because it's been worked it's it started being worked on like a long

1142
01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.720
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: time ago that it would still have like old mechanics in it but it feels so

1143
01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:39.960
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: modern yeah both of us will get there

1144
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.560
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I agree. So yeah, sad that I haven't managed to do the mine yet, but I'll get there

1145
01:30:36.119 --> 01:30:38.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: We'll get there. We'll get there

1146
01:30:38.119 --> 01:30:42.159
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think that's most of the mechanics. Have I missed any mechanics?

1147
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:50.060
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: um I think I think we're good I think I'm just thinking off at the top of my

1148
01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:54.819
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: head now in general I think we're mostly good

1149
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:59.420
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Cool. All right, I don't want to talk too much about like the characters and the story and stuff like that

1150
01:30:59.939 --> 01:31:03.239
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But I think I would like to say that this is a funny game

1151
01:31:03.739 --> 01:31:09.539
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Is like legitimately funny is not like cringe funny is like I'm actually finding myself amused by

1152
01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:20.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: it is very charming, it is very very charming and very silly and I so far love no booger junior

1153
01:31:21.819 --> 01:31:23.819
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and how just child

1154
01:31:25.899 --> 01:31:29.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: just literally such a child and so silly and I just love

1155
01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:35.020
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Mikan is an interesting character too Mikan is like the first the first character that you meet right

1156
01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Mm-hmm

1157
01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: yeah first character that you meet but

1158
01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:41.140
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And they're character you you travel to the island with

1159
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:48.220
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the I have admittedly kind of I guess spoiled myself a little bit in regards to looking at the

1160
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.439
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: shocking.

1161
01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:53.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: character designs I know shocking right cuz I otherwise hate Spark first there I hate spoiling

1162
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.859
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: things for myself but looking at like just like the I think for whatever reason I decided I

1163
01:31:58.859 --> 01:32:04.380
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: wanted to look at like the romanceable characters characters some of these character designs

1164
01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:09.180
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: are awesome and I can't wait to meet them and see their personalities because like every single

1165
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:15.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: character that I've met so far being is it okay for me to list some of the early on

1166
01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:22.220
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: characters okay great so that's what I kind of figure but I was like let me just make sure so

1167
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: sure I don't think it will mean much to people.

1168
01:32:23.659 --> 01:32:35.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: obviously Mikan no boo no boo junior and then I have Riku mac miss curator and I feel like I'm

1169
01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.420
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: for getting someone. Oh, I'm forgetting.

1170
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:49.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Someone and someone else that I will eventually remember, but all their characters feel like I say as I'm forgetting someone.

1171
01:32:49.500 --> 01:33:00.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: All of their characters feel like they stand out very much so. And then looking at the designs, especially one in particular, that is just so simply adorable.

1172
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:09.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Why is their name a song? I have no idea, but they're just a little penguin with glasses. I just, they're so...

1173
01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:22.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: cute and so well designed. I think that's like another thing that sometimes I struggle with with some farming games that have like the little, I guess you could call it started.

1174
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:34.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: You can also call it Persona-esque where it's like you have the dialogue and then you have the character and their expressions and everything on the side and whatnot. I don't know what game is like the first game or like one of the most important games that did that.

1175
01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:39.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: but seeing all the different characters and how they're designed.

1176
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:46.340
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: They look so, so, so nice, and I wish I liked, like, some games that I wish I could like

1177
01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:51.619
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: them more, but I can't like them more just because I don't like the character designs.

1178
01:33:51.619 --> 01:33:54.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I like, be it long story short, I like these characters a lot.

1179
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, that's fair

1180
01:33:55.039 --> 01:34:02.560
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, yeah, I do you reminded me that we should probably talk about like just the overall like building up of the town as well

1181
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.560
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Because like that's a pretty fundamental part of it

1182
01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:08.239
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Because obviously you start off with just me cannon and Nobu

1183
01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:16.199
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And then you you slowly add more people to the island as you build it up and it's it's it's a fun kind of like you know

1184
01:34:18.479 --> 01:34:21.880
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: different way to to do that than be just like

1185
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:38.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: you know, here's a village that you're joining and it is what it is and it's kind of static and you're building up but in a less artificial way than say animal crossing feels.

1186
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:46.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes. Yes. I had to think about that. Yes, I agree. It feels more meaningful rather than just

1187
01:34:46.199 --> 01:34:50.279
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: here's another villager that you just added to your town because you like this villager because

1188
01:34:50.279 --> 01:34:54.520
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: it's cute and it's gonna have like the same like 20 lines of dialogue for the rest of your life as

1189
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.319
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: you play this game like it obviously we haven't sunk enough time into this game to really see

1190
01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:04.840
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: like how much dialogue do they truly have but every character feels it.

1191
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.359
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: intentional with their role within the game that I've met so far and they all I'm hoping and I'm

1192
01:35:12.359 --> 01:35:18.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: assuming their personalities are all very distinct but just their character designs alone are all

1193
01:35:18.199 --> 01:35:24.760
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: very very distinct despite them being different types of animals they all feel very unique

1194
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:33.079
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: which I appreciate. I'm very excited to be a song. So cute. Such a cute penguin.

1195
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.159
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Yeah, I agree. All right

1196
01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:38.520
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: All right, well, I feel like that's that's everything we want to talk about so to conclude on this game

1197
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:45.760
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: It's good go player. It's good game. I think it to be a bit more more detailed on that

1198
01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:53.279
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I think if you like farming games, but quite often feel like they can be a bit slow and a bit

1199
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:03.119
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Jamie, I think this is a good game to try because it can you can still go slowly if you want you can take your time

1200
01:36:03.359 --> 01:36:08.699
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: But you can also zoom about the place and do what you want and like just do the stuff and

1201
01:36:09.159 --> 01:36:14.359
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: And you know do what you want as fast as you want to do it really which I really like

1202
01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yes.

1203
01:36:14.359 --> 01:36:19.720
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I feel like it's almost the perfect ADHD farming game because there's no

1204
01:36:20.279 --> 01:36:25.039
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: There's no getting bored. There's no like oh this took a second too long, so they

1205
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: are from my distraction is gone, whichever you like.

1206
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:33.199
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: It does keep you constantly engaged, but actually I just remember one more like mechanic thing

1207
01:36:33.199 --> 01:36:37.560
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: or control thing that I also really, really like is that in the options, they give you

1208
01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:42.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the option to, because sometimes for some people, some people get, it seems to be overwhelmed

1209
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.800
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: by the amount of quests that they give you in one shot.

1210
01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:50.600
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So there's an option, I forget what it's called, but there's an option that you can toggle,

1211
01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:54.159
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: and it'll give you less quests in one go, so you get less overwhelmed.

1212
01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:55.659
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: But also your days are longer.

1213
01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:14.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: And when you are chopping down trees or breaking rocks or something, you are generally getting more resources as well, if you want to just feel like you don't, if you don't want to feel as rushed because the day is is going to end soon.

1214
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:26.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I've been really enjoying this, this, that is that option that combines everything, but this also a separate option if you want to have just simply just less quests in one go. And it's another option if you want to just simply have longer days.

1215
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:34.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So I have the longer days one toggle because I don't like time limits if I can pause time whenever I could I would, but as of right now.

1216
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:40.399
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: I have literally never felt like I need any more time in this game.

1217
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:52.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah, though in this game, in this game it's been very good, so I haven't had to worry about that, but I like the option that I can have longer days and then if I want to go to sleep early, I can go to sleep early, but just giving myself any way to give myself more time.

1218
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.500
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I will happily take and if I had that option is there.

1219
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:23.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Is wonderful, although I don't know when that option was introduced because I didn't notice it until pretty recently so I don't know where that came from but yeah, that's my last bit about like little nitpity details but overall conclusion wise, I agree with you that this is a great game that constantly keeps you engage you can play it at your own pace, if you want to speedrun it like you said you could speedrun it if you want to take your time you can take your time, the immersion,

1220
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: the, just the world of Snacko in general.

1221
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:38.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Just feels very whimsical and grounded and silly and all the mechanics that all work together.

1222
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:45.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Despite us having experience with them, i.e. the cooking and the minds and stuff.

1223
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:52.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I'm sure when we dive into those mechanics more, they will also all tie together really nicely and respect your time well.

1224
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.319
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: For sure, agreed. Good game. Go play up.

1225
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Great game.

1226
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Wonderful game.

1227

<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: Let's talk about it. Let's talk about it more in the game of the year episode.

1228
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:08.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Yeah.

1235
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:49.000
<v 4792C04D-DE1B-433B-AF03-8402F65AE3E2>Al: He didn't buy the cat Christmas tree.

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: No, well, we might try to make it a Christmas tree. We're not sure. We have to build the, we have to build the, the, the cat tree first. But, um.

1238
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:07.000
<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: I digress. Y'all can find me just about anywhere except Twitter, um, at A-Strainer. And also my husband and I have moon coo which we really need to make time to record.

1239

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: So there will be an episode that drops at some point this month in regards to most likely being present on social media.

1240

<v 2714EDA2-7997-411D-AB28-20B40F1A7F6D>Aislinn: Is I think the topic that we want to do, don't hold me to it, but that'll be coming. And then top K-pop songs of 2025.
