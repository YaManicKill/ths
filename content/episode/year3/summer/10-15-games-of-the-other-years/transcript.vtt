5
00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Woooo!

6
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.980
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Indeed, I don't have it. I don't think you have it because

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, I, um, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not gonna get it. I'm just gonna say I'm not gonna get it.

8
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Ooh! Mmm.

9
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Um, this is probably the first main series game that I am just straight up skipping.

10
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay

11
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.959
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I think my mouth's gone a little dry for Pokemon games right now.

12
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's very fair

13
00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:19.519
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Not only because of being busy with else.

14
00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:24.120
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But also, it's just not seeing enough innovation.

15
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>>> And the last few games that I've played.

16
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.599
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I've just been like, I mean, this is kind of just the same thing.

17
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's like more nostalgic than anything.

18
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, that's fair

19
00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, I want them to do something different.

20
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.799
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yup, I mean

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.140
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I'll play the next legends whenever that happens.

22
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.799
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, yeah, I'm yeah, I'm you know, I can't with the next legends. Whatever. It's gonna be the legend series

23
00:01:48.159 --> 00:02:00.879
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, I've heard This game has issues because the Pokemon game because of course it does, but overall, I'm hearing good things about this one And I love Calo, so I love xy So I'm perfectly excited. I haven't gotten yet, but I want to get legends

24
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm-hmm

25
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But I get your feeling I mean

26
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:24.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>no matter how much you care or fan or care about how you enjoy the scarlet while I think scarlet violet was a momentum stopper of sorts because you know even for the biggest fans it still had technical problems or whatever but anyways I get it's a lot of Pokemon they do a lot of things so taking a break that's that's fine I didn't get the DLC for scarlet while I let that's crazy

27
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm-hmm

28
00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:32.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>um anyways yes so yeah no z yeah we we're actually we somehow we managed to cap ourselves but

29
00:02:33.500 --> 00:03:03.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>what we are we have plenty of other things to talk about because we got you know the news and stuff and and we I don't know what the timing was it probably just the schedule nothing specific but we're warming up for our award season this year by by you know since we are the authority in capital you know T capital A Tm on on farming games we have decided to award

30
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Right, right.

31
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:18.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Earl preemptively or not preemptively earlier in the year award farming game of the year not to this year's contenders or whatever but toward to all the other years we missed the pre harvest season error or at least the pretty whenever we started doing it era

32
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Mm-hmm.

33
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>so we're going back to far as what was it 96 and we're doing all of them

34
00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:31.139
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah, so I think the idea was that Al went back to the,

35
00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>oh gosh, this is a lot to scroll through.

36
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.300
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The harvest man, like the very first SNES harvest moon game,

37
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.259
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>which is in 1996.

38
00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:46.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And he just looked at the farming type games that came out each year thereafter.

39
00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.740
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And, you know, the first.

40
00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:08.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Episode of the podcast, I think we was in 2019 so we're covering up through 2018 so it's kind of going through the big names we of course were going to miss on we're not able to like know every single farming game that ever came out but I'll did it.

41
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yes, you know the three hour episode length just multiply that by however many years recovering and that's how long this episode will be

42
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>right yeah now this is uh this is a loose it's

43
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:52.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>especially when I added like the blurbs that I added to try and remember what these games were um yeah it became a long list so that's uh I'm excited to get into it though I'm wondering if we have anything any differing opinions on some of these you know some of the years the options are slim either to zero or to one but uh

44
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:51.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The real, you know, the real surprises when there's one, but we won't award it to them.

45
00:04:48.500 --> 00:05:04.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I actually am I'm considering it I am I'm considering it so yeah that we're doing that we got some game news before that and before before that uh Kevin what do you up to let's look what's going on

46
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You're not good enough.

47
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.839
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh gosh, it's actually been a week's recorded. It's been a whirlwind week for me. I went to a wedding. That was tight.

48
00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:35.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Wait, was that this week? Yes, I think it was gosh, I don't remember. Yeah, yeah, it was. That was a disaster. Not on their part. Anyways, okay, game-wise, what have I been up to? I'm honestly not that much because I've been so busy. I've digimoned more, man. So the thing about digimon, the the collecting aspect is...

49
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.180
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's not so much like go out and catch everything.

50
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's not, you know, just go find all the random encounters.

51
00:05:43.279 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>A lot of it is going up and down the evolutionary trees, because in Digimon games the standard quo is not only do you digivolt to get bigger, but you can also de-digivolt and to get increased stats when you're, you know, when you go smaller and then you can go bigger again in different directions because branching.

52
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:34.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And so yeah, that's a part of the quote unquote grind in that game like I'm just going to go out and get some XP and level up a whole bunch of people and devolve them and indeed did evolve and then go in other directions and I don't know I find it very zen and enjoyable and it's also I guess it's a fact that you have like it's clear the goalposts, right?

53
00:06:35.000 --> 00:07:05.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>randomly pulling the slot until I get it's like, no, okay, I need to hit this requirement to get this evolution and so on and so forth. So you do get a little a little bit more control and that's kind of nice. But yeah overall, it's mostly been Digimon and some of my other stuffs and this zone zero got an update. It's been fine. But yeah, that's it nothing terribly interesting. What about you go Cody what's going on?

54
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:30.519
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I'm still doing that old PhD making making moves on that, which is good. I actually saw one of my friends did like a proof of life post for like like if you're not, if you don't post that often on social media or something like on their Facebook and it's just like hey I'm still here,

55
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:23.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I too am breathing and living like... [laughs]

56
00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:34.680
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>here's just like a one minute, here's how my life's going, here's what I'm doing and I was like

57
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:46.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My friends got into a habit of a little less regularly, but almost weekly bi-weekly like you just shoot some message to all his friends. Hey, here's what's up this week.

58
00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.959
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>kind of this cost part actually.

59
00:07:46.959 --> 00:08:04.879
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>If you're feeling cool, send it back, you know, reciprocates or we can stay in touch while not saying in touch that much. Mm-hmm.

60
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.060
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah, I have my best friends from Oregon.

61
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.199
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>We have a group that we do that with.

62
00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.240
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>We either, and you always call it something,

63
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.639
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>like it's like the Tuesday, tiramisu,

64
00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:05.959
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>or the Wednesday waffle.

65
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, okay.

66
00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't know why we do that,

67
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:10.079
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but like it's like, here's your Friday Fritter,

68
00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>here's my life, like here's what I'm doing.

69
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.160
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And we try and do like one a week,

70
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but we're all busy humans.

71
00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.560
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So it doesn't always happen.

72
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.600
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But yeah, so I'm still,

73
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.079
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>still going to be actually still doing a puppy.

74
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.600
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>She is 11 weeks now and we just had puppy class today.

75
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:57.059
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, God, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, that's, I mean, it's fine, like, yeah, I can imagine that that's nice, they get tired, they, they, they go full blast with their energy, no, no, no,

76
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.840
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>She's a barker man, that's the biggest thing.

77
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Stella was not as vocal as peppercorn is, so that's something we're having to learn.

78
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:46.279
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Though if you hear her, I apologize.

79
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:52.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Though she just had puppy class, so she's pretty zonked because she had to learn much.

80
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:07.759
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I also did the no king's protest this last weekend, which was super fun.

81
00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:58.059
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No study.

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>There are a couple thousand people from my local city that showed up, very fun.

84
00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.159
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>We got lots of honks.

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>There were only two out of the thousands of humans that came to do the protest.

86
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.440
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>There are only two counter-protestors.

87
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:33.679

89
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So the one guy was just like walking opposite of the march.

90
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And he was just like saying whatever he was saying.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And then another guy was just like on the other side of the road with a single side.

92
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And it's like, bro, you're all by yourself with a single sign.

93
00:09:47.500 --> 00:10:19.320

Wind Story is a simulation game players can immerse themselves in rural lifestyles including farming breeding and fishing

97
00:10:47.500 --> 00:11:17.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>during the day they can freely roam the ranch get capital R the ranch's flower fields wall at night they can enjoy drinking and dancing by the lake site bonfire I could go for drinking the dancing by the bonfire so yeah this it's I just gonna say it's Octopath it has that Octopath 2 what do they call it 2.5 HD whatever art style where it's kind of 2D but also popping out like a storybook almost.

98
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.840
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah, yeah, I felt that, yeah.

99
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:26.740
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.320
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I thought it was cute.

101
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.320
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It looks cute, but 1.0 out now.

102
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:26.519
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's actually also very affordable.

103
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:46.820
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I want to know is why is there some sort of garden warfare thing, it was like crop, but it was almost like cartoony pieces of grass and crops, like fighting other villagers, I don't know what's going on there, but it's funny because it's like kind of, the art style

104
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

105
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>there it will kind of cartoony and like scribble and I don't know what's going on there.

106
00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:55.419
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>There's gliding, the lighting effects on, I just first see it at night.

107
00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:56.419
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>They're very pretty.

108
00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:57.419
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's like a Ferris wheel.

109
00:11:57.419 --> 00:12:05.940
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, there's a lot going on here, what is that green dinosaur thing falling?

110
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't know what that is, but I guess there's a lot going on here.

111
00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:15.580
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm someone in treatment, like you said, it is, which is the price on this.

112
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.580
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't think 12 bucks USD either

113
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:38.440
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>mm-hmm yeah it is unfortunately windows only for those of us like me who I knew I just don't play my desktop and but the switch one is also only $15 so it's also out on

114
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:25.860
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's pretty good. Those are demo! Oh my gosh, all this game is great. That's a demo. It's at one point. No, it's affordable. I want these done as things

115
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, ooh, it's on switching and consent. That's great. Well, there you go. Check that out. That's that's somewhat, I'm somewhat intrigued because they're going for a lot here.

116
00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:50.879
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, that is again, wind story. Um, you think there'd be like a wind message. I don't see one. Um,

117
00:12:52.240 --> 00:13:05.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right. Now, let's go to the, the polar opposite sort of news from 1.0 release to the delay of which book delayed to 2026,

118
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think most games at this point, they're delaying. Yeah, that's that's what they're going to aim for. Um,

119
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:14.580
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. Yeah, I'll made a note on this that he's like, we're hitting that time of the year where

120
00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:18.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>some games either have to put up or shut up.

121
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

122
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:30.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And so they're we're going to either start seeing some releases or delays. He said that there are still 10 games that have not yet been delayed that we're still waiting on.

123
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.820
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>In their in their note at their post where they said that they had to delay, which is totally fine,

124
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.820
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Y'all do you.

125
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:48.620
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They also added an interactive map so you can go on their website and look at this map of the area. It's actually pretty large. I feel

126
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.940
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I like this concept of like you the little man

127
00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:52.139
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and

128
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, yeah, so you can see little screenshots. I also just like I like the idea of it being a school

129
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:06.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>because which brook is like it's right next to I think like an academy or something like that of of witchcraft and

130
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.700
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and I feel like a lot of these games.

132
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They don't have like a school motif or whatever.

133
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Like I kind of like this.

134
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

135
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Don't have enough of that these days.

136
00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:20.980
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, yeah, I agree right like in the

137
00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:28.480
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You know, well trotted path of you know the general the farm in the small rural village. It is a nice spin of like

138
00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:35.059
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, here's a different environment with the different feel and objective so yeah, right. I appreciate that

139
00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:39.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, yeah, and that's

140
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's they're they're they're working obviously they cannot some of the other

141
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Stuff that they're working on character customization a girdle pen

142
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.720
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, no, this is, this is the next one. This is Grimshire.

143
00:14:52.419 --> 00:14:59.440
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>pen What oh my gosh, I did. I'm looking at the wrong one. I mistake. Yes. I'm practicing with my wires. Yeah

144
00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:02.320
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Girdle pen, y'all. What are we talking about? That's a great question.

145
00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:07.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, that's good. Oh green sharp. This is the wild one. Okay. This is the animal people

146
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.679
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, this is a grim cozy.

147
00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.299
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

148
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:18.879
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So yeah, Grimshire, this is, so that was it for Witchbrook. She delayed. Go check out the interactive map. Grimshire has their .25 update.

149
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.480
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh God, not only random number updates, but random pre 1.0 numbers. Yeah!

150
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.519
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughter]

151
00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:37.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And he said note on, or they said note on version number format change. I decided during the middle part of the version numbers. So it's now just that, I guess.

152
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:41.659
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You whittled it down. Oh, but that's great, but that means this earlier ones at the middle version

153
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:48.639
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. So they did a bunch of stuff here. They did Kirk, like as Kev was saying,

154
00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>character customization. The girdle pen and the

155
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:21.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>luggie hutch. An ounce that I haven't looked up with these are and it's funnier that way. And I was considering also not looking them up but I was like you know what I'm interested so I looked them up but there is no answer so it doesn't matter. They say this thing but then they never explain it. I think from context clues it's it's that before you just had like animal pen and no matter what kind of animal you had it went into the animal pen or the coop or whatever.

156
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>[Laughter]

157
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:34.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But now if you have a girdle or a buggy they have their own pen like they no longer go in with the coop or the barn or whatever.

158
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I mean that would have been my wager, but what's a girl?

159
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:44.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That's the next question what's a girdle and what's a buggy and that is going to remain the mystery for me.

160
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.860
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

161
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:47.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, well if you I'm look if you look at a trailer you can see some of their strange animals because you're an animal person and raising some sort of animals

162
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>uh-huh

163
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.759
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The buggy I'm guessing is that bunny slug cross creature

164
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.480
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, that makes sense. Which is wild, because you can be a bunny.

165
00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, you can and then and then

166
00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:00.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Bunny is farming bunnies. Okay.

167
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:14.400
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And there's something that kind of looks like a turtle I don't know what the G is for but there's there's these are strange creatures actually and it looks like a chicken and a sheep draft that's probably what it is a girl that said it is there you go

168
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:39.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>your wrath. I just looked at, I just thought of GIR, but I thought some of the other bug fixes and updates were funnier. So I pulled a few. Here we go. So remember, this is Grimshy. This is a grim cozy game. So something they adjusted was the food insecurity

169
00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:25.599
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yep, that's probably what yeah, because it looked like a llama or something, but yeah, it's probably draft that's what is we saw that we did it good good job

170
00:17:39.500 --> 00:18:10.259
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>death logic with resets the starvation count at the start of each town projects and you can get double-panelized for missing both food categories. So your people can star. I'm interested, you got me. Yeah, wild.

171
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>[Laughter]

172
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:07.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, I mean rewatch that trailer. Yeah, yeah, there may be some enforced starvation on people

173
00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:22.339
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Another thing. So this is just a cool one. The effects of kibble eaten by mothers now affects the nursing babies. That just makes sense. Love that.

174
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:24.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, yes, well kind of terrifying, but oh, okay. I don't know

175
00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:41.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>We got another mystery. Critter's state is now saved when they enter or exit a scene on their own parentheses infinite milk glitch. What? I'm thinking

176
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, that's good. I love infinite glitching.

177
00:18:39.500 --> 00:19:08.140
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>that like something would go out of your frame of view like you'd milk your cow and then they go to the frame of view and you would just find them again and they'd have milk again. I love that. That's they didn't they fixed it though so that doesn't happen anymore. And then finally fixed the void issue at the bottom of the marsh mine maybe for real this time.

178
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:54.700
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. Oh, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I like that a lot too.

179
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:10.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I like I like that last time we need we need more devs adding that on there

180
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:27.700
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Fix this thing. Maybe maybe for real. It's like a final version underscore two underscore rough draft underscore but really. I respect it Grimshire. I'm

181
00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:14.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Maybe for real

182
00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:29.819
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I did too. I like that. That's good

183
00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:34.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So there you go 0.25, which means at most

184
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>75 more updates before release unless they go back to the middle number

185
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.019
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.

186
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:57.660

187
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>out.

188
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.539

189
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:18.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I say it every time I know I say it every time I can't believe that they weren't already in the game But this time this time seems fair. How's Cinderella not in the game? All right. She's to her castle the logo of the company

190
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:44.819
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. Also her fairy godmother's been there the whole time here instead of the views one of the first ones that you get. Yeah. Yeah. So they had their whole 12/2025 showcase so they not only talked about.

191
00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:23.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yes

192
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:33.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yes Okay, okay, I think I'm I'm valid in this one. How was she not there oh?

193
00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:40.980
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, but that's December 10th. She'll join that's cool. She'll explode

194
00:20:45.500 --> 00:21:01.400
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>What they added this year, but they also talked about what's coming and just watching the showcase, I skipped through it, but I just realized how much I missed like it reminded me of how much I've missed because, no, there's, well, it's, it's disney for doing my val.

195
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>much Disney to be experienced.

196
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.400
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But yeah, they added a lot of stuff. It seems like there's a lot of fixes to things so I'm going to try and pick this back up. We'll see what happens.

197
00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:15.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>On top of Cinderella joining on December 10th in a free content update.

198
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.859
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They're also adding something called wish blossom ranch.

199
00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:29.700
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Which is going to be a, I believe paid DLC content that adds horses.

200
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.859
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, that one's actually sooner. That one's November 19th. The ranch.

201
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.700
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So you can summon, yeah, it's pretty soon.

202
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.259
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And that one adds like you get to go and find a bunch of horses.

203
00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:43.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And there are horses that are actually in Disney movies.

204
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.519
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but you can also get your own.

205
00:21:45.500 --> 00:22:00.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So that's fair. Also, in Wish Blossom Ranch, they have Tigger, Corella Deville, Snow White, and Tinkerbell.

206
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.720
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, but why who cares because Maximus just that's off. That's the end of the sentence

207
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.480
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, well, I don't, I don't like rolling that, that this, this, you know, context that that's not good. I don't like that.

208
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:16.220
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, she'd be the last person I would let be at a ranch.

209
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Help her start up her glue factory.

210
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:25.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Kevin, no. Why? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

211
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Tigger needs some glue and she says I can help there.

212
00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:37.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>She needs to glue, take her down as what she needs to do.

213
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Thank you.

214
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:45.099
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That is almost out, I guess. Like you said in November 19th, they also had their roadmap for 2026.

215
00:22:45.099 --> 00:23:09.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So these are all free content things that are coming out. Early 2026, the quote is bond over spaghetti and meatballs. It was clearly saying it's clearly Lady in the Tramp. In spring 2026, they showed the raccoon from Pocahontas, next to Pocahontas is necklace. So it'd be Pocahontas.

216
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I could go for some.

217
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:22.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>the wind. Yep. Yep. And it's and Phil is there in the column. It's that you. So yeah, there we go. That's those are good ones. Hercules. That's a fun one.

218
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:16.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>In summer 2026, clearly Hercules, very Greek, very issues. Yes, yeah.

219
00:23:20.859 --> 00:24:03.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And then Al says more updates to game additions for some reason. I believe it's because there's like three new game additions you can get and one of them is like the base game And then there's the one that includes some of a lot of the pre

220
00:23:37.500 --> 00:24:07.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>dslc paid dlc and then there's the ultimate or whatever and that includes the previous paid dlc but also this this upcoming wish blossom wish brought from ranch. So, which is like 80 bucks. Well, and that so they can kind of get me on that because if I didn't.

221
00:23:49.500 --> 00:24:02.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, this is, uh, some of this is wild. Do you want to get the wit and boss from ranch deluxe editions? He can get Zvan from frozen. I like Zvan. I'll say that. I like grained ear and that's a

222
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:37.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I haven't bought this yet. I'm still playing on game pass, but you're you're gonna have the option to get spin and reunites then and whatever his name is and you're not gonna know it's not a little off. It's the other guy. And you're not gonna do it. You're not gonna do it. So, yeah.

223
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:48.180
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>off. Oh, the other guy. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man. You know, that's a greenhouse. What are the best disney melts because your count. Oh, that's what start getting, you know, into a blood

224
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:42.339
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, oh. Should we do mounds or like mounds plus animal capacity?

225
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:55.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And I'm not talking like, lady in the tramp, like they're not animal companions.

226
00:24:48.500 --> 00:25:09.660
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>cause animal campaigns. That's a tough one. Yeah. No, no, the animal buddy, right? Okay. Here's a question. Does carpet count? Well, I guess it counts amount, but yeah, Zabu. Yeah. If you're

227
00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:02.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, the animal buddy.

228
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:09.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I think you, yeah, well, a carpet would be the mount and then the animal buddy would be Abu.

229
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:18.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Well, so that's that that's Disney dream. My valley. I am going to pick it back up. I tried to do that earlier, but I had more stuff.

230
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:29.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>to prepare for for this podcast. So I was like, Oh, don't have time. So I will let you all know in this lack.

231
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

232
00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:33.119
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Hercule's coming which means Pegasus will be a mal. That's that's a sick one. It's a good one

233
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:36.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, yep, yep, yep, that's a good one.

234
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Starbirds is our next one. So they have their early access road map.

235
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:47.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It includes the flora and fauna update, which they say is going to be December or January.

236
00:25:48.500 --> 00:26:04.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Next December, next January. It includes things like moving to a new place and discovering new things. Okay, they, they say stuff, but it's very vague. So I just was like, okay.

237
00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:02.660
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I mean plant life and it's yeah

238
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:10.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I mean, it's cool that there's more stuff coming out, but when they said flora and fauna, I was like, Oh, what is it?

239
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Not a lot of info there, but I'll wait.

240
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:42.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. It's like, as at a glance, it's adding more things to kind of resource mine and producer whatever. But the big overarching problem, both Alan and I had was just the, what's the big motivation to do it? And I don't know if that's going to be introduced just yet. But, you know,

241
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.779
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Tarbert has my attention.

242
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:49.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>nothing else that are demo early access is working and working well. So I trust them. Um,

243
00:26:50.299 --> 00:27:05.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>and they're not on any rush clearly because for they have like a roadmap and then it off into not even on the timeline, like it just says full release floating out in space. Um, so that's at some point it'll release maybe.

244
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah

245
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:13.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I mean they got to take their time. They got a lot. This is they're they're very much in the beginning of their

246
00:27:14.559 --> 00:27:16.559
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Of their their journey

247
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yup, their space voyage, uh, this did the thing.

248
00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:31.299
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, this next one, I haven't played either game, but I'm kind of hype here.

249
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.400
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, okay. Here he is.

250
00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:47.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Cause I don't know, I don't, I don't, this, okay, I'm talking about a letter from Porsche, Guston, Ginger are coming to Starsand Island, um, right, we're getting across So we're content.

251

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Between start sand island, that's that very like Asian-esque like inspired because you're building up like a kind of like a garden.

252
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.839
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Anyways, sorry about the game loss.

253
00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:13.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Anyways, they're doing a crossover and they're introducing guest characters Dustin Ginger from my time at Porsche and they're in this art style.

254
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>looks good. It really...

255
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:26.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>we've got gusts, there's an architect and then we got gin... I didn't select so I don't know these characters all the way them.

256
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't either.

257
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.799
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But yeah, so these are two people and they say specifically to fill your faces arrived on Star St.

258
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:36.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Island from the distant mainland and they are visiting the island for a special journey. So

259
00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:42.220
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I'll comment and wait. So is this meant to be in the same universe? Is the my time games?

260
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:47.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I think it is. I think that these characters are coming from the my time at Porsche

261
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah.

262
00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:53.160
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>World or wherever that is and they're coming to this island. I did see

263
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.720
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, that's that's cool.

264
00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:00.859
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>the comments on the steam page for this letter is

265
00:29:01.579 --> 00:29:05.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Wait, what's gonna happen? I'm married to gust like what?

266
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>[Laughter]

267
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:13.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Just gotta vanish from my game and like no, I'm sure that they won't do that, but it's cool that they're kind of like

268
00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>showing some of their characters in one of their other games

269
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:49.940
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I don't know I haven't played any of these I haven't played well star sand is an out yet there is a demo currently excuse me that does not have gust in ginger but when the game comes out and it's estimated for Q1 2026 they will be available at launch but it just hasn't launched yet so if you like to my time of Porsche if you really like these characters and you were on the fence about star sand island maybe this pushes you over the edge I don't know

270
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, yeah

271
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:43.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

272
00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:56.400
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it it what fascinates me is that I mean these are two different developers. This is a fairly substantial crossover

273
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.359
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You know cuz you've got sea lab for stars in and was it pantheon games or my time at Porsche?

274
00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:06.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But anyways, it looks great, it starts on island books.

275
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's great visually, it's cool to see that.

276
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:28.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I just, I'm somewhat, I know that like in the Fortnite world, everything's crossing over and it's tired, but I don't know, when one is done well, it still excites me, maybe I'm just a sucker, but it's cool.

277
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:31.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I can't remember. Did I tell you last week that Scooby Doo is in Fortnite right now? Okay, good.

278
00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:36.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, you didn't tell me, is that it had those sick crocs that the first crocs I would ever wear, those scooby-doo crocs.

279
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughter]

280
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:46.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, I hate croc, but I'd rock those because I'd love scooby-doo so much.

281
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

282
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I actually just watched the first live-action movie today.

283
00:30:46.960 --> 00:31:05.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh my gosh, that movie is wild to me, like just, we literally got a new shaggy, he stayed on to voice him for, oh it's crazy, for decades, oh my gosh.

284
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Not for the first time.

285
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:06.900
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I love Matthew Lillard, he's such an amazing actor.

286
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:18.839
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>He's incredible, what range, we got shaggy and we got the guy in the screen, yeah.

287
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.299
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah, one of a killer in scream.

288
00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:22.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>He also is a paranormal, investigative, psychic,

289
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.259
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and a movie called 13 Ghosts,

290
00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:26.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>which is one of my favorite horror movies.

291
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.599
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Ooh, I didn't know that, but we have this, there's the series called 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, we can connect it all!

292
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh my gosh, I didn't know that.

293
00:31:36.119 --> 00:31:40.839
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>He's also like the bad guy thinking five lines of Freddy's life action.

294
00:31:40.839 --> 00:31:49.079
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Man has got this like goofy cartoony horror down, um, good for you.

295
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:56.680
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Which, which fought crossover with a farming game on Matthew earlier would be in stay tuned, I don't know.

296
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.940
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>If I could marry him in Stardew,

297
00:31:57.559 --> 00:32:01.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, yes, I would too!

298
00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I would pick Stardew back up immediately.

299
00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.519
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm sorry Leah.

300
00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:05.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Maybe he'll be in haunted truck with here.

301
00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:08.660
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's another spooky crossover.

302
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.480
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Awwww!

303
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, he won't.

304
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.779
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That would be amazing, huh?

305
00:32:09.559 --> 00:32:11.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Good sir Dave, how much do you love Scooby-Doo?

306
00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:12.940
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Ah.

307
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.440
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, um...

308
00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:18.779
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, last thing before we get into our main topic,

309
00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:20.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>we have one new game,

310
00:32:20.619 --> 00:32:23.740
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and it is called Mazy Village.

311
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.900
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So, Maisie, as in like,

312
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>that you go through that has, like, you has dead ends and you, whatever, a corn maze, whatever.

313
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:49.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Not. Yeah. Yeah. Not Maisie Mouse. That's different. Do you know that one? Oh, I think it was originally British cartoon. It's just a very charming, like kids cartoon. I'm going to put on, I'm going to show the art because it's very charming. But anyways, yes.

314
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, I didn't know. No.

315
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No.

316
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, we'll put it, put it in the slack, put it in the slack.

317
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Maisie Village is a cozy town restoring adventure where a tornado scatters homes, villagers.

318
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And they're precious belongings, including, I'm just going to be saying it, including a cat, if you go find a cat.

319
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Find what was lost in the world as you solve Maisie's rebuild homes and fill the village with warmth and life again.

320
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:21.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So, I, the, I love the art of this game, but I also, I just think this is such a really interesting idea where you start with like a huge area.

321
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

322
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.960
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and then in this little opening scene or whatever you see.

323
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>a tornado just jumble everything around, and then you only have,

324
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>tornado has a face

325
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>tornado has a face.

326
00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:36.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>suggesting that was intentional and aimed

327
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I need to know the tornado is backstory.

328
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.259
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's a very cute face too. That's the worst part. I want to be that tornado's friend

329
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so you end up coming to this town or you're part of this town or whatever,

330
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and you end up bringing everything back together, but it limits what you can do at first,

331
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And then you help people rebuild their...

332
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.599
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>homes or, like, find their lost cat or find their, like, something that's precious to them.

333
00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:14.400
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And as you add tiles back to the, like, main central tile of the town, it, like, shifts all of the other tiles.

334
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:22.400
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So that's the maze part, because sometimes it might make it, so, like, you can't go forward anymore, because there's a cliff now.

335
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:44.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it's, uh, it is, uh, okay, it reminds you of, you know, the slide puzzles, like little tile puzzles, like, I hate those to begin with, I'll be honest, but, uh, in this context, I like it a lot, because changing your layout with that and then, you know, changing paths, they lead, I like that a lot, actually, this, this, this, this one.

336
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And I think that's really interesting.

337
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yes.

338
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yes.

339
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay.

340
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm hmm.

341
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm hmm.

342
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The art style is very cute.

343
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's very plate.

344
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't have a better comparison point,

345
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but play school with the K, you know, the play school brand.

346
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, yeah.

347
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's what it feels like, but it's well done.

348
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's not like infantile.

349
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's just very cute and charming.

350
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Those cows and goats are very cute.

351
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:13.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, yep, yep demo is currently out. There is no release date, but some to keep your eye on for sure

352
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Demos out now.

353
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, I'm in on this game.

354
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I am in.

355
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>- Absolutely.

356
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm...

357
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:18.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I'm on board for this one.

358
00:35:19.579 --> 00:35:20.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

359
00:35:20.579 --> 00:35:21.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right.

360
00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I posted the art of Maisie Mouse.

361
00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.320
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Cool

362
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, we've made it 36 minutes

363
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, good.

364
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.860
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, good heavens.

365
00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:36.019
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Now, 36 hours, buckle up, buckaroos.

366
00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:35.079
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh

367
00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right, here's the question.

368
00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:40.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Do you wanna go backwards or forwards?

369
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:44.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, we know we go we go 98 let's hit 96 we go scroll to the bottom

370
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.980
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, god. Oh, yeah.

371
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.480
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I want to do it that way

372
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:50.219
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right. Okay. Yes.

373
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That also makes more sense because some of these things are remakes or sequels or whatever so

374
00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:59.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, 96 harvest moon. You get the extra special crown because you're the winner by default.

375
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>There's no other for in game. Also, there was no farming game ever really.

376
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.239
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughs]

377
00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So and everyone's kind of just leaching off you.

378
00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:05.239
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

379
00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.900
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So you get an extra shiny crown. Good for you, harvest moon.

380
00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:30.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep. So, I like, so they said on the like Wikipedia or whatever it said that it's considered by some to be the first cozy game and it linked to this inverse article. And I just really liked this quote. So what would make Harvest Moon work? He thought he being the like guy that made

381
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's the SNES edition, the one we Al and I played forever ago.

382
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:47.480
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>was pacing. Crucial to any work of entertainment was a good mixture of pace. If something demands your attention constantly, it's easy to get overwhelmed or tired, but if it's too glacial, it's easy to get distracted. Having a mix of the two is what makes something enjoyable to be at a movie or a game.

383
00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:56.119
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And I think that that is a really good, honestly, that is like what is good about some farming games and others being like too much.

384
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:12.019
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I agree. It's a genius insight and to kind of knock it out of it because that that aspect specifically the pacing um, I think Harvest Moon does it quite well on the original Harvest Moon um and and honestly like

385
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah.

386
00:37:12.739 --> 00:37:14.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>As someone who tried it um

387
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:22.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So much of the DNA the bones of the entire genre are there. It's wild. They have the hot springs for Pete's sake

388
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

389
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:36.260
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>um, you know It's a shame it has a two I don't inventory slot but but other than that it had a lot going for it. So I I definitely tip my hat towards harvest moon

390
00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:40.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Consider it did it first and did it all that

391
00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:46.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, well a well-deserved game of the year for 1996 good for you harvest moon

392
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah, 1997, Harvest Moon Game Boy.

393
00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.760
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And someone said with that,

394
00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:01.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>it's just without the dating aspects of the initial game and with only a few mini quests to play through,

395
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.599
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Harvest Moon Game Boy color is a lightweight version of a feathery game.

396
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:13.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, that I mean a crown by default because whatever, but that's rough though

397
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.199
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I doesn't have to be. We don't have to give a crown.

398
00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:17.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So what do who do who gets the crap?

399
00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:23.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No one, no crown awarded. Uh, that's that's we could do that or I mean, I guess it's up to you.

400
00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:30.119
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I Guess well here because here's the thing like that's rough like it's the game boy you had Pokemon on it, right?

401
00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:35.320
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Like it could handle a sizable-ish Gabe, at least for the time.

402
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.320
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I... I... I had some...

403
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:45.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think I'm the snest addition, I think you could translate that. Um, so that's kind of rough. Um, that, yeah.

404
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:47.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I mean, I think it should still win because it brought harvest moon to handheld

405
00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:59.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It did. I thought I was, but that was my next point actually, like, but the handheld thing, that's always a big leap. Um, especially back in '97. Um, so, all right, sure, good enough.

406
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, all right, you get a crown harvest from a GB for '97.

407
00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.820
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>1998

408
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:18.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So many good games came out this year. On that year, we had got Ocarina of time and all sorts of other things. Yeah, 98 wasn't saying year for gaming. I'd have to go back and see

409
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.300
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, I didn't know.

410
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.639
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, well, then that's, I mean, no other, no one was playing any other game, right?

411
00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:30.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, so So since we had no other actual harvest moon to college core game. We are occurring at time. You have the correct I don't

412
00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:36.519
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But um, was there was there was there any farming in hockey and I'm trying to think I don't

413
00:39:36.500 --> 00:40:06.099
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>think there was no there's fishing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go there you go this is our ocarina specifically the fishing yeah okay 99 all right now we're starting to get some you know contenders um consideration um okay because we got a triple threat of harvest moon um we have

414
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.960
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, there's phishing. Yeah, there's the phishing which I spent a good amount of time

415
00:39:43.719 --> 00:39:45.719
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>phishing it there, so

416
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.360
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah

417
00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:50.760
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so no no winner in 98

418
00:40:06.659 --> 00:40:14.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>harvest moon 64 harvest moon to game boy color and harvest moon back to nature

419
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>wait the PSP didn't exist in 99 did it

420
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:26.820
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I think I might be PSP might have been like it might have been re released or something for PSP later, but that was something that

421
00:40:22.099 --> 00:40:24.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>a root yeah yeah yeah

422
00:40:28.179 --> 00:40:30.179
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That it mentioned so

423
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.320
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>- Yeah.

424
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.679
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>- Um, okay.

425
00:40:31.539 --> 00:40:41.940
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so here's where I started when I started making notes I was like how are we gonna like if I've I've never played any any of these so how how are how am I gonna judge them?

426
00:40:41.940 --> 00:41:16.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>right. So I started adding things like Metacritic score. So Metacritic is something that takes all of the different critical scores for game and kind of like combine them into a score. It's not just an average. I think it like waits things differently. So both Harvest Moon 64 and Harvest Moon 2 on the Game Boy color had 78% and back to nature had 82. So there's that. Also these games differed in different ways. So Harvest Moon 64 updated the previous one by having a

427
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:41.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>limited amount of time to work in any given day and a limited amount of stamina to work. Harvest Moon 2 Game Boy color is you're able to build a sheep pen and by sheep. You can build a greenhouse. You can walk around the town, which walking around the town apparently you couldn't do that in the first one. Oh, well, they said that it's that's oh not in the Harvest Moon Game Boy color. Yeah.

428
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:51.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>good one. You could, you absolutely good. Oh, game original game boy. I'm sorry, game I just think it was, oh, maybe not. I don't know. I didn't think about that. No. Oh, I can't.

429
00:41:46.500 --> 00:42:16.300
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The whole is that you have 3 years to get your farm going. Return to nature. They didn't really explain. There wasn't really like anything that explained what back to nature return to nature meant. And so I think it's because you you like when you were at the farm visiting your grandparents when you were a kid and then you went away and then later you come back. So I think you're returning to like a way out of the city to come to like whatever the country.

430
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

431
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:46.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so these are the 3 options. We got Nintendo 64 Game Boy color and PlayStation 3 different games. What do you think?

432
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:41.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>um this is a tough call um g how should I put this the gbc version looks exactly like in my mind what I picture just looking at screenshots and whatever um which is kind of appealing to me

433
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh

434
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:56.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>um I guess if they're in nostalgia like game boy color feel um but I i don't know how it plays right like there's horses there's sheep pens there's there's an animal pen it looks like it It has, you know, unlike the first version, it has the-

435
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Me and potatoes of a farming game. So I am tempted because of the portability.

436
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:12.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But shockingly, as someone who didn't play PlayStation or in '64, I kind of like back to nature, the visuals.

437
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:22.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Both '64 and back to nature have like an isometric, they're 3D-ish, but back to nature feels a little more 3D.

438
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Like, I see some cows that look almost a little flat on the-

439
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:53.400
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>64 version, but they look a little more 3D on the playstation, so yeah, I don't know something about the visuals on the playstation. Maybe just because everything feels a little rounder, that looks a little more charming, but I don't know, but I say that, but GBC look tempting because that looks like a solid classic retro portable farming game. What are your thoughts, Cody?

440
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Well, I'm going 64, I'm just going 64.

441
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.679
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No, oh, oh the one I was

442
00:43:57.619 --> 00:44:02.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so I feel like Nintendo is where Harvest Moon belongs.

443
00:44:06.579 --> 00:44:09.019
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And also just like back to nature, I don't know,

444
00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:15.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>it just seemed like that, that idea of coming back or whatever, I think that was what the previous ones did.

445
00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.099
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So it just didn't seem like it was doing anything different.

446
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:31.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah Yeah, but also, you know, something about the Metacritic store, right? You got to think about the I think the context of the time, right?

447
00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:21.900
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It does have the highest metacritic score,

448
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.579
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>and only I think I'd go for 64.

449
00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:39.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>This was back in a day when graphics were like, oh, everyone was all about the graphics and and whatnot. So I can see that slanting it

450
00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:43.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The horse looks very charming in 64. I'll say that. Oh

451
00:44:45.179 --> 00:44:47.179
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm not too terribly

452
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:54.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't know how well to play so it's hard to argue for I'm willing to give it to 64

453
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.360
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, cool. Or it could be a tie tie between 64 and back to nature. We could do that too.

454
00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, that's fine. 64 you get the grant

455
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I didn't have PlayStation, so you know, I'm gonna get 64 because I could have played that one

456
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

457
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, all right now we're get to the good

458
00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.059
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>thousand the progressive news

459
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:36.659

460
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.639
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, it's the year of boy or girl.

461
00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:31.119

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But I still don't love it. So, I mean, one of them is two harvest moon games. One of them is Harvest Moon 3 Game Boy Color, but there's also Harvest Moon 4 Girl, which is literally just back to nature, but you can play as a girl.

463
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.320
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But Harvest Moon 3 GBC.

464
00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:13.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>If you get a different story based on who you choose, so here it says the boys is a successful rancher living on the farm from Harvest Moon 2 GBC who was asked by the mayor to help a girl on a nearby island run the farm of her father.

465
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.980
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, which is wild, but okay.

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Or the girl's beginning is she shows up and she's trying to save Harry's farm by taking control of it.

467
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:51.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>ha ha ha ha oh you know what I kind of like it I kind of dig it okay first of all the boy like making it like cannon sequel and he's established and helping out someone else I think that's pretty cool actually um uh the the girl character that's wild that's story but I also kind of digging because it's so wild I kind of dig it yeah

468
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Copper and Booker were excellent.

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And then it kills me that they were delegated to other stuff later on.

503
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I

591
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, no, uh, wonderful life gets it.

592
00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:41.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The remake carries a lot of the spirits, so go listen to that episode of you on my thoughts.

593
00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:46.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You, you're dying that game and that game ends you win, that's, that's rough.

594
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:45.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep.

595
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:57.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, okay, so the clear winner, uh, 2004, uh, by default for a second year running, yeah,

596
00:55:57.619 --> 00:55:59.099
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>of wonderful life.

597
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:06.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The girl of origin is not known as at the remake.

598
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:16.539
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, I think the remake is the one that added the girl version. This didn't have a girl version. It just makes means it just is that you can now have a daughter instead of only having a son

599
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:24.739
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>You can marry Lumina and you can now continue playing after you die

600
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>although, ha ha ha ha ha.

601
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Towing the line to say the least.

602
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:42.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't know. I personally know when her this year. This is kind of yikes to me.

603
00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:37.780
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Like, mmm, yeah.

604
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:38.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay.

605
00:56:39.539 --> 00:56:40.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

606
00:56:40.539 --> 00:56:41.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

607
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Just get, it's two sketch.

608
00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, okay.

609
00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:49.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Here's, okay, for listeners who don't know it in listen,

610
00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm just gonna break it down.

611
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.559
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Lumenau was a character in the original.

612
00:56:55.559 --> 00:56:57.559
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>She was, I guess, grandpa.

613
00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:06.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>She was very clearly a child model, very young.

614
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Very young.

615
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:13.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think they have this version where you can end up marrying her.

616
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm guessing the implication was that she was, you know, early teens,

617
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but the model doesn't reflect that.

618
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>They didn't change it.

619
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So it's just very sketch looking.

620
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:26.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And that's a very, very generous interpretation, right?

621
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So, you know, that's fair.

622
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it's, that's a rough one.

623
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:37.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But, okay, no winner.

624
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.079
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No winner. No winner. That's my vote

625
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay.

626
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Sure, that's fine.

627
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it's, that's rough.

628
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay.

629
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:48.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Let's go to 2005.

630
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Harvest Moon DS.

631
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, I'm trying to remember now.

632
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Is this one the hands changed I think?

633
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think it might be.

634
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:03.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>in the what chain? Oh, no, no, no, no, I have that later. That was actually 2014.

635
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No.

636
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay.

637
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Are you serious?

638
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Holy moly.

639
00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:09.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Explain what you're talking about though.

640
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:08.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Wow.

641
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>My time.

642
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:18.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, just we all know because the original owners of the harvest moon branded from Japan.

643
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Was it not to me?

644
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That was the Japanese company.

645
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.400
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah, so it's not too many ink.

646
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

647
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:32.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, they basically, when they got it to the porta, they gave away the rights to the name eventually basically, which is the most baffling decision ever.

648
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:40.900
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so it was the word story of season games and then at one point they are no longer story of season games

649
00:58:41.000 --> 00:59:07.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, all the, all the harvest moons you've been discussing are quote, unquote, story of seasons at this point, um, and then later they, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, not too many was the, um, I can't, anyways, I have to look up the names because I'm getting all mixed up, but anyways, this is still original brand. Okay, marvelous. That's what it is. Yeah.

650
00:58:46.179 --> 00:58:53.059
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, they split so that harvest moon is distinct from story of season

651
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:08.119
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so the new one is marvelous. The new one is marvelous and X seed I think is the thing, but yeah

652
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, that's the thing because they changed names too, right? Because that's it. Maybe Kimix

653
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:24.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>said, yeah. Um, anyways, but that's later. We're not there yet. You know, I thought we were, but okay, Harvest Moon DS. Um, and they forget me, not Valley. Um,

654
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:36.480
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, but instead of like it being your grandfather or one of your friends farms or whatever It's just that you are a young man named Pete who lives with his friend Takakura on a farm and forget me not Valley

655
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:59.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, well first of all, hey, you got you have a name. That's a first, but yeah, it looks pretty much just like a DS flattened version of wonderful life because that's forget me. Not valid. It's the same village and looking at the map. It looks to be pretty much the same identical map. So

656
00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.760
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They were room they were roommates

657
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>There you go points off for not using

658
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>the naming conventions of the time which was to come up with a sub title of DNS in it

659
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.239
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughing]

660
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.139
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So just but but you know

661
01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:25.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It was a do okay, but that's harvesque. Yes, just the S version of wonderful. I I never played it So I can't commit to the comment on the quality, but we also get

662
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.599
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. Yep. Are you ready for this?

663
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Because at least

664
01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:35.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's baffling to me like is this is this like a red and blue idea

665
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:45.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>of we make the girl version separate will double the sale I don't know what it is but we have our best moon DS cute the girl version you go ahead Cody take it away

666
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep.

667
01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay.

668
01:00:47.179 --> 01:00:50.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But oh boy, so before up until this point,

669
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:54.059
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I had been writing the notes and kind of like giving it a blurb.

670
01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:58.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But I saw this, I was like, I'm just gonna read this.

671
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay.

672
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:08.019
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>In this game, the player's mother sends a wish to the harvest goddess that they may become a successful farmer.

673
01:01:08.019 --> 01:01:13.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The harvest goddess eventually determines the player has no

674
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:23.900
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>work ethic and tells the harvest king what she thinks. The harvest king angrily tells the harvest goddess she isn't trying hard enough and she's slacking off in her old age.

675
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:29.980
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The harvest goddess then calls the harvest king a big baldie and is turned into stone.

676
01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:41.219
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The harvest sprites defend the harvest goddess which angers the goddess the harvest king even more and he sends the harvest sprites and the goddess to another world as punishment But he realizes his mistakes.

677
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.139
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>He is gone too far.

678
01:01:44.139 --> 01:01:59.860
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>He then writes a letter to the player and sends the witch princess to deliver it, telling them that if they work hard as a farmer, it will bring back the harvest sprites and the harvest goddess.

679
01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.900
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, so, you know, for girls, I'd get that misogyny in there.

680
01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:06.139
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>What a frickin' what a like drama.

681
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.059
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Like why does it have to be drama?

682
01:02:08.059 --> 01:02:11.480
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Like the boy version is just, I'm with my friend on a

683
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:22.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>farm and the girl version, they have to make this dramatic woman's spurned turn to stone sent elsewhere.

684
01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.019
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Husband feels bad, goes to the send it back.

685
01:02:25.019 --> 01:02:31.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't know if the harvest goddess and the harvest king are spouses, but like it's just what?

686
01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:32.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>What?

687
01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:33.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's not.

688
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That's a lot.

689
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:53.679
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>that's wild. Okay, and then on a considerably less wild note, we have Harvest Moon magical melody for the game. The Wii was out in 2005 already? That's 2006. Okay, or did it come out on Wii? Maybe it came in on Wii, regardless. Yeah,

690
01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.780
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>There's that.

691
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.940
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It might as like the next year or something.

692
01:02:53.679 --> 01:03:03.840
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>that's what I'm thinking. To wake the harvest goddess and marry one of the townspeople, the player must gather musical notes by finishing various chores in milestones.

693
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't get it, but okay. You can't marry until you get the notes. As one does.

694
01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:21.099
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>because music, I think this was like around the time that like rock band and guitar hero were like becoming a thing. And so they were like, oh, we got to make music. It's got to be music themed.

695
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

696
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>They're just writing

697
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.239
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Writing the the just hopping on that train. Okay. Okay. Um

698
01:03:28.199 --> 01:03:31.440
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, so I I didn't play this one. I can't speak to it, but

699
01:03:33.199 --> 01:03:39.719
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Apparently there's a pet pig. It's that's mm. That's it's a strong. That's a strong point in this favor. I'll say that

700
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep.

701
01:03:41.719 --> 01:03:45.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, so how 11 battles matter its each?

702
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.480
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's a lot, wow.

703
01:03:48.000 --> 01:04:17.960
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>too many options. There's two more. There's also Harvus Moon, an update and a port of Back to Nature, Harvus Moon, Boy, and Girl. That was out on the PSP this year. And Animal Crossing Wild World is on the DS. And this is all I can say about this one is Sphere. This one instead of like...

704
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.440
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Is that, yeah.

705
01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.280
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right, we'll be giving it to.

706
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.280
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I haven't planted these.

707
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, wait, oh gosh, you're right.

708
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.639
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I didn't see the list.

709
01:03:56.639 --> 01:03:57.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, oh goodness.

710
01:04:01.639 --> 01:04:04.559
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Boy and girl, they come together at last.

711
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:25.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>having a block and then you go to the edge of the screen to like go to the next block or whatever.

712
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Tiles. That was an acre system. They were tiles. Yeah

713
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The tiles, yeah.

714
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

715
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Instead of that, it's just a sphere.

716
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>You're running...

717
01:04:30.719 --> 01:04:32.719
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Smooth world

718
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I didn't like that.

719
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So I did not like it.

720
01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.360
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Didn't like it. Yeah, I mean

721
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So despite the fact that I want to give it to a wild world, I don't...

722
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>In good conscience, I can't.

723
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, well, I mean, while well, for most of those series,

724
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.599
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>dental crossings are just straight upgrades, right?

725
01:04:49.599 --> 01:04:53.079
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So, but so, you know, again, same animal crossing.

726
01:04:53.079 --> 01:04:55.280
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It did add a lot.

727
01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You actually had inventory in that game.

728
01:05:00.199 --> 01:05:08.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You could make patterns on clothing and tiles on the floor.

729
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh yeah, I remember that.

730
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>introduce the trauma-inducing tarantula.

731
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.440
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's just squirpy and that would knock you out, so on and so forth.

732
01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.719
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, it's good to fall at work, I say I'm crossing just more ammo crossing better.

733
01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:22.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's the game.

734
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.719
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, so who do we give it to?

735
01:05:24.719 --> 01:05:40.719
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Because while worlds the only one I played, so, you know, impartially that's what I'd give it to, I guess, but I'd rather give it to wild world than anyone else, yeah.

736
01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:34.019
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I mean if you if you want to give it to them, that's fine. I would also be fine to just say no

737
01:05:36.179 --> 01:05:40.019
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No winner There you go, then we're gonna give it to

738
01:05:42.000 --> 01:06:10.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I wish I'd like to go back to these harvest moons and revise it just because I didn't even, magical melody has peaked my interest, just because I don't know, okay, game cubits that feel, of a wonderful life, yeah, but okay, all right, we'll give it to wild world because sure why not, um, 2006, oh, yeah, we only got one entry here and that is room factory for the DS and.

739
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And technically at that time, it was in fact the harvest moon, like, or.

740
01:06:16.159 --> 01:06:27.599
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Room factory, a fantasy harvest moon, the, the, the, the, the path split here, the new timeline was introduced with the.

741
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.539
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, no, this is a completely different game series.

742
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:34.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No, yeah, I know I just mean like world, like the world wise, like here we go down a different path.

743
01:06:30.539 --> 01:06:31.199
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, yeah.

744
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:39.840
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, people get to choose a new, a new branch.

745
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You can go story seasons or room factory.

746
01:06:37.199 --> 01:06:38.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

747
01:06:38.199 --> 01:06:41.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Uh, yeah, it's, it's

748
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:51.440
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>it's hard with his moon, but there's some combat and monsters and stuff. Um, yeah. Um, I actually need to play it. I've never played new original. I haven't played any hard run factory.

749
01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:46.079
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's fun to see.

750
01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:52.880
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I also haven't played any room factory.

751
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.960
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>We totally should and do it as like a second harvest.

752
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.599
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Like people who hadn't played room factory.

753
01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:26.619

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The character that you don't choose will later appear.

769
01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Whoever you are, you're shipwrecked with a family of four and you end up

770
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:26.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>on a deserted island, there seems to be signs of past life on the island, but no one knows what happened.

771
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So I guess you've figured that out throughout the game, I don't know.

772
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>There was, at the time, a review by someone in Australia, Tracy Lean of Hyper.

773
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>She commended the game for bringing, quote, "back the addictive elements from previous games."

774
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:48.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>However, she criticized the, quote, "clumsy control system" that makes even the most basic of tasks feel like a chore.

775
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oof, that's rough.

776
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:55.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So it's because it required you to use the touch screen to move and to interact with things.

777
01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:01.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So you'd have to use, like, have your stylus on the, this is not capacitive touch.

778
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:13.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>This is, like, actually, like, you have to be putting force down on your touch screen to move around and then you'd click on, like, things to interact with them.

779
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>- Yeah.

780
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:20.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Especially if you've had your DS for a while that some of that got a little hard to do.

781
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.079
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Sure. Sure. Sure.

782
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:22.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>You're a while.

783
01:09:24.199 --> 01:09:29.479
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That touch screen was either like top, not much fantastic stuff or it was rough.

784
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.840
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah.

785
01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>There's very few in between. Um, okay.

786
01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.439
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Most of the time, if I had to take my stylus out,

787
01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.479
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I was frustrated.

788
01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:40.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I'm like, let me just play in here without doing that.

789
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:44.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Hmm. Well, if you don't want to touch, what about waggling?

790
01:09:44.199 --> 01:09:47.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't know if waggling was in this game, but it is on the way.

791
01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:47.760
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughing]

792
01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>so there's a strong chance. Harvest smooth tree of

793
01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:50.439
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>There you go.

794
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.840
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>tranquility. The player cabin that's me or Angela moves to Waffle Island,

795
01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:15.680
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>that's a good name, which was once enchanted, home to the deceased mother tree that was one sacred. After the harvest God's vanished, the island lost its connection with nature and its inhabitants do not know what to do. Metacritic score of 60 versus the 65 of Island of Happiness.

796
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.479
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. I mean, I think, yeah, doing the whag line with the Wii, like having a Wii mo and having to move around, like, personally, that'd probably be my preferred.

797
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:28.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Uh, you know, okay, you know what this is the weird thing, but over time, even back when it came out like

798
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:36.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It wasn't even the waggle. It was the batteries of the we moat having constantly having to change them or or recharge them or whatever

799
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah.

800
01:10:36.979 --> 01:10:40.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That that got to me. That was the part that got me about the we but

801
01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:45.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Well, that's why you'd get the like crazy battery pack things that you'd put on it,

802
01:10:43.779 --> 01:10:45.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

803
01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:49.579
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>or you'd buy the rechargeable versions or whatever.

804
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, yeah, which I did do but

805
01:10:52.500 --> 01:11:00.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It was I don't know it just felt weird because you know I mean controls didn't have to deal with batteries before that really or or at least the ones I had dealt with

806
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, cuz they were all wired I

807
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, all right, so which one are we giving it to whoa?

808
01:11:04.319 --> 01:11:06.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Would give it to the tree of tranquility

809
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:12.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The the DS version the DS game it I mean it's it's whatever, but I think the

810
01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I mean

811
01:11:13.359 --> 01:11:20.880
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Having to do with the stuff on the touchscreen that I would have hated that so if I have to go with either of these I have I'm gonna go with tree of tranquility

812
01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Hmm.

813
01:11:20.579 --> 01:11:22.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, I'm only in one of these games.

814
01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.939
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So yeah, we'll also give it to Trifchankood.

815
01:11:23.439 --> 01:11:27.680
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, we'll give it we'll actually give it to tree of tranquility because Kevin was in that game

816
01:11:24.939 --> 01:11:27.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>[laughing]

817
01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And then you didn't tell me you were in a game.

818
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And two.

819
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:41.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Is there a Kevin character in overcoat?

820
01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, I'm also an overcooked, fun fact.

821
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The dog, he's just like the onion king and his dog isn't in Kevin.

822
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh my gosh.

823
01:11:42.739 --> 01:11:43.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

824
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That's so great.

825
01:11:43.739 --> 01:11:44.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

826
01:11:44.579 --> 01:11:47.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>[laughing]

827
01:11:47.619 --> 01:11:48.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay.

828
01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So that's 2007.

829
01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.939
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Congratulations, Trifchankood quality.

830
01:11:52.939 --> 01:11:54.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And you know what, I don't know what it is,

831
01:11:54.699 --> 01:11:56.979
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but the setup of reviving is a sacred tree.

832
01:11:56.979 --> 01:12:00.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't know why it feels, I like the, yeah.

833
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It feels good. Yeah, it feels good.

834
01:12:00.739 --> 01:12:01.819
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

835
01:12:01.819 --> 01:12:02.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay.

836
01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:03.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh boy.

837
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, yep, yep.

838
01:12:03.579 --> 01:12:04.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh boy.

839
01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Big year, 2008.

840
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.619
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We're getting into it folks.

841
01:12:08.619 --> 01:12:11.859
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Harvest Mundia's grand bazaar.

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>What's, whoa, was that Al's ghostly hand giving it the crown.

843
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:20.020
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Do you want to just say all of them and then we can go back through?

844
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:30.180
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'll put these, I guess, harvest moon DS, grand bazaar, harvest moon DS, sunshine islands.

845
01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:36.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We got two harvest moons on the DS, that's wild, as harvest moon DS, sunshine islands.

846
01:12:36.539 --> 01:12:47.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Harvest moon animal parade, animal crossing city folk, room factory two, room factory frontier and formula for the first. Excuse me.

847
01:12:47.500 --> 01:13:03.979
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm gonna go and reverse order what I just said. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Harvest. Oh my gosh.

848
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:58.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, I was gonna say we should we should do it reverse order because then it's like the one game of one thing

849
01:12:59.619 --> 01:13:01.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Like it just kind of makes sense

850
01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:13.659
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's just on the stuck on my tongue now because it said it's on each side. Farming simulator 2008, the first, the only, actually, no, there's only wheat. That's what you're saying. I get it.

851
01:13:13.659 --> 01:13:17.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it's the first farming simulator, first realistic farming sim.

852
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:27.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Only wheat as an option, which is kind of wild, but they were going for realism, so I guess they were dealing with a lot, sure.

853
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.880
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, you can only get wheat.

854
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:37.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Root, PC Gaming in 2008, oh man, Rune Factory Frontier on the Wii.

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So this is, sorry, my note is that it's shortly after the first game.

857
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.140
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>>> No.

858
01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:52.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So this frontier, room factory frontier like takes picks up the story right after the first room factory and then room factory too is like several years after the first game.

859
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So these games, it's like frontier is chronologically in the middle.

860
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:14.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, 'cause Run Factory 2 on the DS is several years after the first game set in the coast of the city of Alvarna, there's two parts of the story, first half of the game follows Kyle, I'm a serious man with a connection to the legendary dragon, fearsome FIE or some,

861
01:14:00.199 --> 01:14:01.439
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, yep.

862
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>second half of the game features Kyle's child searching for their father after he disappears,

863
01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:22.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>ooh, I like that, I like that a lot actually.

864
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:27.180
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I like that but also the fact that it's like a fantasy game and the main character's name is Kyle

865
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:38.479
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, that's good. Okay, city folk, I played this one. Did you play city folk?

866
01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.520
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's just kind of kind of stupid

867
01:14:34.399 --> 01:14:36.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep, I

868
01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Also played city folk

869
01:14:40.319 --> 01:14:44.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Probably, well, is it my least favorite? It's one of my least favorite in the entry.

870
01:14:43.899 --> 01:14:45.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh

871
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think it was just the wee battery thing again. I think that's it. I think that's it.

872
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, yeah

873
01:14:52.399 --> 01:14:57.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It had the city, which was a cool idea of the separate place with all these shops that you could do,

874
01:14:58.319 --> 01:15:02.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>um, wait, Zippert, he was added in this game, and he realized that probably

875
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.119
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, yeah, so I added I looked at this up like they added so many cool things in this game

876
01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:08.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>yeah, yeah.

877
01:15:08.039 --> 01:15:12.359
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The bug off Chameleon is in this was added in this name

878
01:15:11.439 --> 01:15:16.079
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Nat, that was just added in that one of those in there before, that's crazy.

879
01:15:16.079 --> 01:15:23.600
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, they add ticks who polices your shoes. Yeah

880
01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:18.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, man.

881
01:15:21.119 --> 01:15:26.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, I love kicks, kicks is so good. I forgot to kick your right, because he was just literally,

882
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>and street boys shoes shine, but literally on the steps, waiting to shine your shoes and color them.

883
01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I just shoot

884
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>He just polished your shoes.

885
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:44.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Gracie has her own store, Gracie Grace, where they introduce the credit card, because there's stuff like a bajillion bells to buy. Um, oh, my gosh. Oh, that was good stuff.

886
01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, cap and being a bus driver now. That's fun little change. Yeah, I got it to smash.

887
01:15:51.439 --> 01:15:57.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, yeah, city folk, adding stuff. I'm more crossing it. So I'm crossing it's still good overall.

888
01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:10.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay. Oh, a harvest moon animal parade. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I am afraid seek all, um, to tree of tranquility.

889
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, so there's all these harvest mitts.

890
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So I think, yeah, I think the animal prays on the we.

891
01:16:13.439 --> 01:16:18.479
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yes, that is correct. That is correct. Um, last entry in the series made by your shoe, uh,

892
01:16:18.479 --> 01:16:28.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yasugito, Wada, the original creator. Um, that's kind of special. Um, and honest, okay, it's Give me a duty.

893
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:36.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, pardon me for this, but this one has a slightly sentimental place in my heart because my little brother Calvin. This was his first like farming game you play.

894
01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Aww.

895
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, and in the end of parade, living up to the name, it was like you could take care of all sorts of animals.

896
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:54.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, and I had this very, very distinct memory, like it's, it's, it's sweet, but also like all, like I feel bad for him because he was so little and his, he had a cow die, like for the first time.

897
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mmm.

898
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And he just cried like one of those, he used real real little.

899
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:06.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>He just, you know, one of those real deep heart felt cries like not, not tantrum crying like he was sad.

900
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, so I just remember that from Adam parade that was that gets me right in the fields every time.

901
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:18.659
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So, no spoiler, does that remove it from the running, or does it make it stay in the running for...

902
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:23.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, no, that, oh, that puts it for front of the running for me.

903
01:17:18.659 --> 01:17:22.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, okay, okay.

904
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, Harvest Moon via Sunshine Island.

905
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You couldn't have done Destiny Sunshine or something. It was right there. You had one letter. All you need to do is a D.

906
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But anyways,

907
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Sequel to Island of Happiness on the DS.

908
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Sequel, but there's...

909
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, sorry. Oh, I thought I was reading.

910
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, many years before the events of the game,

911
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>a powerful earthquake struck the Sunshine Islands,

912
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>causing them to sink to the ocean.

913
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>How are you getting them back up?

914
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>to get out. But that's what I want to know. But...

915
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.279
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so I think that these islands are like separated or something. This might also

916
01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.479
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I'd be explaining something that happened in the island of happiness in the first game. I don't know, but

917
01:18:10.479 --> 01:18:25.260
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They they listened they heard that people hated the fact that all you had to do everything on the touch pad So they now used it they now added that you can use buttons for some of the actions So you have to move on the with you with the touch pad or whatever

918
01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But then you could push buttons to interact.

919
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.159
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Which I don't know if that fixes it.

920
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:38.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, no, that's fair. Um, yeah, I don't know. I didn't play it. So

921
01:18:38.739 --> 01:18:48.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, all right. Let's just go to the next one. Uh, harvest food. I don't know what else to say. I Sunshine. I just didn't think I'm Mario Sunshine. That was a good game. It's probably not as good as sunshine

922
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughing]

923
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:44.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, now you're right.

924
01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Harvest moon

925
01:18:54.100 --> 01:19:01.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, DS grand bazaar. Um, I like that game. He likes it a lot. The is owl reaching past us

926
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.239
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Well, so he likes he likes the story of seasons grand bazaar, which is the remake of this game

927
01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:09.939
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wonder how it compares to the remake. Um,

928
01:19:10.199 --> 01:19:19.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Well, maybe because owl loves grand bazaar some stories seasons grand bazaar so much. Maybe he should he should jump back instead of second harvest. We should do like retro harvest

929
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:32.140
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Maybe yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd be down for that, but yeah, I haven't played it but clearly I like a lot and

930
01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So you and I could do a retro harvest of rain factory

931
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:37.140
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>At least I should put this a wonderful life like it was almost one to one remake

932
01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:55.819
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>yeah I also think that like they if I remember correctly they added like a lot of quality of life things to this game like to the newer version

933
01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:43.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think I'll said this one had a little more TLC, but it makes sense. This was a DS game, right?

934
01:19:43.699 --> 01:19:47.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>like that was still 2D going to.

935
01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>3D and like that. That was a bigger jump.

936
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:02.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, sorry, one second. Um, uh, so, okay, who, who gets the crown?

937
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Uh, my vote would either be for Animal Crossing City folk or for Animal Parade.

938
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.939
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>>> So I mean, city fog was good, but like I said,

939
01:20:11.939 --> 01:20:14.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>it's one of my least favorite animal crossings,

940
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It's, yeah.

941
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think largely because the way the battery,

942
01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:20.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but I don't pray, I mean, I already said my thing,

943
01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but also a little more objectively.

944
01:20:22.779 --> 01:20:26.140
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>The fact that it was the last one by Wada,

945
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

946
01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.260
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I think that's a little special.

947
01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.039
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So I'm willing to give the crown to Anne parade.

948
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Let's give it to Emma Brad.

949
01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.859
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right, Anne parade, winner of 2008.

950
01:20:32.859 --> 01:20:34.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That was actually a fierce year.

951
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, there was some competition that year for sure.

952
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>There were some contenders that year.

953
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>>> Yeah, actually.

954
01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>2009, we get a breather of sorts.

955
01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We get one harvest moon, one room factory,

956
01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>and one farming simulator.

957
01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:51.659
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farmings, let's get to 2010, sorry, I'm just scrolling.

958
01:20:51.659 --> 01:20:52.939
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No, wait, what?

959
01:20:52.939 --> 01:20:54.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Sorry, ignore me, ignore me.

960
01:20:55.779 --> 01:20:59.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farming simulator 2009, PC, it's still farming simulator,

961
01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:01.180
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm-hmm.

962
01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.100
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but now we get more crops, canola, why would that canola?

963
01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:06.020
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughter]

964
01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Barley and corn, it's okay.

965
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:07.979
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Can all this kind of a big thing, I don't know.

966
01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:09.180
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No, it is just, I don't know.

967
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>When I think of crops like, you know, you would think you'd go to the tomatoes or potatoes,

968
01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>you know, like the common ones.

969
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:27.680
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I think those take like more, because like tomatoes and stuff, I think that they, you can't just like thrush them or whatever the way that you can with these other things. Like you can just

970
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

971
01:21:28.319 --> 01:21:32.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>drive a truck over barley and wheat and canola and corn.

972
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:35.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, you're right. You're right. That's probably actually it's just probably purely mechanical why that makes sense

973
01:21:36.539 --> 01:21:41.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>um, okay Um, that's how yeah heart farming simulator

974
01:21:42.539 --> 01:21:45.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Harvest moon hero of leaf valley

975
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.939
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Enhanced remake of save the homeland. Oh

976
01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:55.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Huh, wait wait. What's your other comment? I'm not I don't understand what you're saying. Can you play?

977
01:21:54.500 --> 01:22:06.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, so instead, so instead of the Homeland, you basically have one year or else like a resort is going to be made at the end of that year, say the year to save the homeland.

978
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:21.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>In this game, you are a hero if you stop a theme park from being made. So some people come in, they're like, we're going to make a theme park here in two years, and you're like, no, so you stop that from happening.

979
01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And IGN said the quote, the complaint.

980
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:29.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The controls can be frustrating at times, but that quote, I had a hard time putting it down.

981
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So that's a great question.

982
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:51.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>what was this DS or we do you know here I'll do let me see oh okay yes so this was ps also ps to it earth yeah ps psp psp uh come

983
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:39.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>If it's the save of the homeland, you know, save the homeland was PS2.

984
01:22:48.500 --> 01:23:08.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh, there we go. Interesting. Yeah, I don't know. That sure is a thing. There's also room factory 3, which they said had a Metacritic score of 77. I never saw a Metacritic score for any of the farming simulator, so I didn't put those down. Harvest Moon here of Leaf Valley had 74,

985
01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:20.739
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but room factory 3 with a score of 77. Quote, "The game presents the central theme of delicate balance of nature and introduces the conflict between humans and the

986
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:48.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>of their races, the protagonist, Micah and Micah. Micah discovers that he is half monster and decides to keep his, you know what, I love him anyway, decides to keep his true nature a secret from other villagers. His goal is to revive the strange, Sharon's tree, Sharon's, whatever.

987
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>ahhh my god

988
01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:29.819
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So I was saying I wish we'd seen it earlier because maybe we could have gotten into record just this just this one sound by

989
01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, go ahead, sorry

990
01:23:35.979 --> 01:23:37.979
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I didn't know that my mica

991
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And one of the two.

992
01:23:48.500 --> 01:24:04.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>A tree and prevent the surrounding land from decaying while also attempting to rebuild the trust between the univir and the humans. I like the setup. It has a it has a it has a pyrometacritic score.

993
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You know what? I like that setup. That's a good setup. I like it a lot. Mike is in it

994
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:12.659
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I think that wins. I know we got to do a I need to need to do a retro harvest of that.

995
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:10.159
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I want to play a mic a game. That's a good room for you to revisit it. Yeah, yep

996

997
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.600
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>He's like, he's, uh,

998
01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You take the crown every day in my heart though um 2010

999
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:55.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>He's gone for like a living deck he's going all in so he's gone he's down for it so go check out my car that's Micah the Brave on Twitch and everywhere else where Micah is um okay uh 2010 the new new decade new new

1001
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.779
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>D. A right now. So folks were interested.

1002
01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.020
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Not at this moment. I don't know,

1003
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:34.819
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but folks should if folks are interested in Z.

1004
01:24:34.819 --> 01:24:37.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I might actually watch because I don't want to play it.

1005
01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:37.859
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So I might do that.

1006
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay. Okay.

1007
01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:17.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farmings ah okay I was so thrown off when I was reading the list because farming simulator does the thing that some other like the sports games have done where we're so far ahead We're releasing next year's game now because farming simulator 2011 release in 2010 Oh my gosh 18 hours

1008
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah

1009
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yes

1010
01:25:18.399 --> 01:25:25.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, this is also the beginning of they started doing in 2011 they started doing this thing where every other year

1011
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.819
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They would do a mobile game

1012
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:36.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So 2011 is the PC game and then 2012 is the mobile 2013's PC 2014's mobile that kind of thing

1013
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.079
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, that's best.

1014
01:25:38.699 --> 01:25:42.739
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So yeah, this one they add 18 hour days

1015
01:25:44.699 --> 01:25:47.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>You keep there's more machines. You can have a bigger farm

1016
01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:55.220
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They also this is the first mention of cows, so I think that you can this might have been the first beginning of cows

1017
01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.260
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And also multiplayer

1018
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:03.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, mostly player. That's a big one. You're good for your performance, isn't it?

1019
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:13.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Uh, okay. I didn't realize that harvest moon. I know we had trio of towns. We've had many games with only one town.

1020
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.760
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughter]

1021
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.180
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

1022
01:26:13.779 --> 01:26:21.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But nobody told me that we had harvest moon, the tale of two towns, both on DS and 3DS.

1023
01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:22.699
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>To-- yep.

1024
01:26:22.699 --> 01:26:28.260
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So it came out, I think the DS score had 63 and then the 3DS had 68.

1025
01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:30.060
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So I think it came out initially on the DS,

1026
01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but then it was one of the 3DS launch titles,

1027
01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:35.699
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>if I wanted-- I'm thinking that's my brain, says that.

1028
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>probably tail of two towns. There's three, three tees.

1029
01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.439
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And then the three.

1030
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:57.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>3DS also added some new features that weren't in the first one including alpacas and honeybees and a pickle pot that you can use to make pickled turnips and I just wanted to read so this is one of those like I didn't know that this game existed and the story of this game is hilarious so hundreds of quotes hundreds of years before the events of the game.

1031
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Ooh, pickling.

1032
01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:03.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The towns of Bluebell and Konohana were once friendly neighbor towns connected by a tunnel through a large hill.

1033
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:10.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>However, fierce arguments arose over which towns cooking was superior to the others.

1034
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:12.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That happened. That's real.

1035
01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:33.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>During during one specific confrontation the harvest goddess grew tired of the bickering and destroyed the tunnel cutting off a majority of the towns contact centuries later the towns are still bitter rivals only communicating during a weekly cooking festival.

1036
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:35.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, this is like Toronto and Montreal with their forma off and of yours.

1037
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.699
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh my gosh, yeah

1038
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:55.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, that's good. I like that. That's strong. Um, okay. I mean, only one of these games introduced honeybees. So, you know, Harvest Moon, Tale of Two Towns, 3DS version specifically. You take the crown. That's a fun. I like that, uh, that's set out. That's a fun premise.

1039
01:27:45.500 --> 01:28:03.979
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I feel like I might just say at this point, you know, farming simulator, you've been do it a lot.

1040
01:28:03.979 --> 01:28:07.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't think it's going to win any of the years.

1041
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:32.239
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, well, this is the problem, right? We we we did one farming simulator episode. I recall it was Johnny and I don't know who else. It was you. Oh, it was you that. Yeah. Uh, but we're not we're clearly not, you know, geared towards the farming simulator crown. Um, there might be one year, uh, depends on the competition. There's one I might give it to, but we'll get there when we get there.

1042
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>It was me and Johnny. Yeah

1043
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:20.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't think it's gonna win in here so I think I

1044
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Yeah.

1045
01:28:29.899 --> 01:28:30.739
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>- Okay.

1046
01:28:32.539 --> 01:28:33.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay.

1047
01:28:33.079 --> 01:28:37.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, it's 2011. We're getting there. We're in the same decade at the end. We're again.

1048
01:28:38.000 --> 01:29:07.560
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We're in there. Yeah. Runefactory tides of destiny. We and PS3. Oh, hello. You boy and girl. No, no four girl version. Aiden or Sonya. Where's it's on. I don't know. I'm guessing Sonya. You're traveling on the giant beast named Ymir. Um, you can raise sucking islands and ships from the sea. Hey,

1049
01:28:38.659 --> 01:28:40.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Oh yeah, 'cause this ends at 2018.

1050
01:28:40.619 --> 01:28:42.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So we're going, we're going.

1051
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>are able to farm fight using a real time battle system in formulation ships. Um, I let me, you know,

1052
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I want a visual of this because the other competition is farming simulator on the 3DS for 2012.

1053
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:31.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>What does that even look like? Hold on. Um, that's crazy. I guess mobile gaming still was in infancy back then. Um, we were definitely not going to do farming simulator on mobile.

1054
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.119
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Huh. It actually looks decent on the 3DS. Farming simulator better than I would have expected.

1055
01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:43.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I'm still going to give it to room factory.

1056
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:48.239
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um, well, I'll beat it. Um, I mean, sure. Sure. Yeah, I'm just, I'm impressed. I'm curious what this looks like.

1057
01:29:48.239 --> 01:30:07.760
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We're getting all that some anime anime. That's a good anime stuff. There's a lot of ocean as the game implies what I'm wondering. If you're traveling on this beast, where, uh, where's the Bachelorette's coming or bachelor's bachelor? It's the, the, you know, candidates where they coming in. Oh,

1058
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.300
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>They can raise sunken islands and ships, so maybe

1059
01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:14.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, yes, sure. So you're up, you're up, fish up a potential wife today. Okay. That's how, that's how you do.

1060
01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.640
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yep

1061
01:30:15.439 --> 01:30:17.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Uh, all right, congratulations.

1062
01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:22.199
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I just I like the idea of you know because like before that all of the games were like oh you're either

1063
01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>On an island or on land and tides of destiny was like hear me out

1064
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>[laughs]

1065
01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>You're not on either

1066
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.800

1067
01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:46.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Alright, here we go. Uh, 2012. Oh, oh, okay. This is both we're getting good and also there's the clear winner like

1069
01:30:53.199 --> 01:30:57.359
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, farming similar to 2013 on PC, but then later Xbox and PlayStation

1070
01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>up to ten other players multi-player that

1071
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.819
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, that was cool. They had they also added mods. They also added chicken sheep and cows

1072
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:29.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>actually really impressive wow um yeah okay rune fact before that's the special one even I know that's the special one that got like multiple remakes and re releases um oh no that's not the Titan it's not no I'm just saying I know it's a special one it is a strong one that's I'm saying we got some content

1073
01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.680
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The end

1074
01:31:15.079 --> 01:31:17.079
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Really

1075
01:31:20.399 --> 01:31:23.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That's not what I thought the Titan was gonna be oh

1076
01:31:24.399 --> 01:31:26.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, good good good good. Okay

1077
01:31:27.319 --> 01:31:29.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay

1078
01:31:30.000 --> 01:32:08.479
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>players here the other non-tight I haven't even I haven't seen this one what does it look like harvest moon 3D um a new beginning of even though we've had the wait do we not have a yeah we had on 3DS um right yeah tell two towns um okay a new beginning is this where the split happens no not yet okay okay because they go for a more this is where oh you know I think it is I think it's the art style um they because they now they use the more anime rune factory art style I think that's what it is

1079
01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:32.359
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Well, what's the other not tight?

1080
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.020
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Nope, we're still not there yet.

1081
01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.659
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I say it's 2014 year that they broke up.

1082
01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:13.579
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>This also adds multiplayer, so it adds a lot more character customization. You can design your house in your furniture

1083
01:32:14.579 --> 01:32:18.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>You can customize what the village is going to look like when you first get there

1084
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That's cool.

1085
01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:30.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But also just being able to do a multiplayer mode, which is like a it's region free So it's not I think you can do no matter what region you're in which was kind of cool. Yeah

1086
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah

1087
01:32:30.359 --> 01:32:32.359
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That is pretty cool. Um

1088
01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:35.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But none of them are as good as

1089
01:32:33.939 --> 01:32:53.720
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, this isn't the game of 2012 This isn't just the game 2012. This is one of the games of my decade This is one of my games of all time because ladies and gentlemen 2012 We got animal crossing newly for the 3DS which is in my opinion still the perfect

1090
01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:56.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Animal crossing game

1091
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.560
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I agree. I, when New Horizons came out, I was like, I guess this is okay, but new leaf was,

1092
01:32:57.399 --> 01:32:59.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Um

1093
01:33:01.399 --> 01:33:03.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yep

1094
01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:11.800
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>it was a new leaf. It was so good. I think the only thing that I'm sad about is that they killed Tortimer.

1095
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's

1096
01:33:11.359 --> 01:33:13.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>He didn't and he wasn't dead. He was in the island

1097
01:33:14.279 --> 01:33:18.840
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>What have you done? No, he's not dead, but like this is the first one where you become the mayor,

1098
01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:23.960
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>instead of like moving into the town. Yeah.

1099
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.760
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah Yeah, which was a fun setup

1100
01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:27.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>and and Oh my god, where do we?

1101
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>First of all, this really changed the proportions. You've got, you know, regular-ish proportions now no longer giant head.

1102
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Isabelle was introduced. Need I say more? She made it to smash.

1103
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:49.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We got the island. You could adjust your town not not completely like New Horizons, but you could build landmarks and big projects, the public works projects.

1104
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It was just wild world just better in every way and so good. Oh, I think,

1105
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:06.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm going back to new life frequently. I'm just scared to open up my town. Let's see what's there, but it's just it is.

1106
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, just the ultimate form of the original Animal Crossing formula.

1107
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:20.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, New Leaf is a 15 out of 10 game for me and winner game the year this year and many years after for me.

1108
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>We got the welcome amoebo update.

1109
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay. Okay.

1110
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Wow.

1111
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'd see you typing.

1112
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Let's see.

1113
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farming Simulator 14.

1114

<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>but I just know it's just the same thing.

1127
01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.279
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I just look, I'd rather say "No Winter."

1128
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay um

1130
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:24.880
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The next year, I'm happy about what they added the next year, so it might actually win this next year.

1131
01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.039
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't know, we'll see, we'll see.

1134
01:35:52.399 --> 01:35:56.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I guess it is all the sound familiar and you can go there to the small village.

1135
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:05.840
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>To meet the mayor and start up farming, and oh wow, I'm just reading your quote here from a a one of the

1136
01:36:07.039 --> 01:36:15.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Metacritic or whatever for better and worse. It's the harvest moon and all but name with a few useful new ideas But still the same old crop of problems

1137
01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, you know what I'm gonna let you know a little secret

1138
01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:26.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Back when the 3DS eShop was closing I rush to buy a handful of games I'm by hand for a minute

1139
01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.319
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm-hmm.

1140
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:48.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That I wanted Story of Seasons is one of them because I said you know what I want to go back and play it I have actually fired this up in one point I have touched this game I was going to do that sort of bring it up, but I didn't get to it So I haven't discussed it, but I have touched this game I liked it so far. It felt very story of seasons harvest moony

1141
01:36:27.539 --> 01:36:28.380
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, okay.

1142
01:36:31.979 --> 01:36:32.819
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Mm-hmm.

1143
01:36:34.859 --> 01:36:36.180
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Ooh.

1144
01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You know, I can't compare to all these other ones, but the bones skeleton was all there, so I like it

1145
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.640
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So just from the brief bits I played I give it a thumbs up

1146
01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.300
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But again, that is without you know, there might be loss of quality of life stuff from other games. I don't know

1147
01:37:06.399 --> 01:37:11.680
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right, let's see what else we got. This is getting 2014 get farming simulator 15 on the PC

1148
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>leave

1149
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So this one also, this one, this one added forestry.

1150
01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.920
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh

1151
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:27.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So that to me, I'm actually, it's in the running.

1152
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>For me, you know, earlier I was like, oh, we should just call, call farming simulator out.

1153
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, this to me, like, adding forestry as agriculture.

1154
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>A lot of people when you think of agriculture, you don't think of forestry, but it is an agriculture thing.

1155
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:52.239
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Like, so I don't play farming simulations, but I still respect it. Like, I think they do their stuff well. And like that forestry. I think that's cool. Doing realistic stuff. I think that is cool.

1156
01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:52.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. Yeah.

1157
01:37:53.520 --> 01:38:02.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So, you know, yeah, I definitely know shade to farming simulator, because that may be the mobile ones. I don't know. But in general, like, yeah, I respect it.

1158
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.579
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But this is a PC here.

1159
01:38:03.579 --> 01:38:04.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So.

1160
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:18.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it's one of those, it's one of those, the serious ones. All Also, so we got story of seasons, but we also got Harvest Moon, the lost Valley, one of the, uh, the now, the Harvest Moon,

1161
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:29.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>that's like the opposite where it's nothing, Harvest Moon, but in name, nothing, but in name. Um, yeah, but not the,

1162
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:51.920
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>so it's still Natsume but it they lost like the Titan like the all of the the effort went with Marvelous right yeah so this is when Natsume and Marvelous like split I think yeah so this is when Natsume no longer ports and Natsume

1163
01:38:37.000 --> 01:39:36.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well Marvelous was were like the original developers yeah yeah not to me was just porting them from what I recall yeah right so they we can do it who needs that marvelous screw we can do it yeah you go to Hillsville a village locate it up in the mountains, stuck in an internal winter, that makes it hard to farm. You meet a harvest sprite named Rowan, who requests their help in reviving the village. Pete and Claire, weren't those names used for more? Oh, okay, anyways. You can modify your house, that's nice, and you can do, oh wow, you can already terrain elevations and building locations, that's pretty impressive for 2014 to be honest. And yeah, you know, other standard farming stuff.

1164
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:01.180
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>was trying to make their own things and they ended up with a Metacritic score of 46

1165
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, I don't think so.

1166
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Who gets the crown?

1167
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I would give it to farming simulator 15 actually.

1168
01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:49.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Not the, uh, yeah, um, I want to give it to story of seasons, but I can't like

1169
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.600
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>objectively in good conscience do it because I only touched it very briefly.

1170
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Do we want to do we want to do a tidier then?

1171
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:58.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Uh, I think, you know what, uh, I want farming simulator to have at least one year.

1172
01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:00.260
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Okay, we'll give it this year.

1173
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:00.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I do, it deserves it.

1174
01:40:00.199 --> 01:40:04.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>So farming simp the 15 because you introduce trees, the novel.

1175
01:40:04.899 --> 01:40:06.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, wait, we're coming down next year!

1176
01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.539
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, I'm doing it again.

1177
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.960
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>No, no, oh, you don't want to give 2015 or farming Sim 16 on the Kindle Fire?

1178
01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:21.220
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>the Kindle Fire. No, I don't want to give it a crown.

1179
01:40:16.279 --> 01:40:18.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You don't want to give it a crown?

1180
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:26.680
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, there's only five crops. Okay, you know boo. No, that's yeah, that's a major downgrade

1181
01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:33.220
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, it's a downgrade. So 2015, no winner. 2014, uh, farming simulator one, 2015,

1182
01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:44.420
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>no winner. The only game that we had in 2015 was farming simulator. 2016, it's a no brainer who wins, but we'll mention the other. There's a sweet of other games, and we'll we'll mention those too.

1183
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, you know what some of these games got discussed on the podcast because it was

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Story of seasons tree of crowns. We did several episodes of that at the beginning of this series

1187
01:41:14.899 --> 01:41:16.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I believe the second game covered actually

1188
01:41:17.739 --> 01:41:23.420
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farming simulator 17 for PC ps4 and the X bone. Oh, yeah

1190
01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:35.300
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, that, oh, yeah, no, when you're, when you play farming, like you have a person.

1191
01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:40.260
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, I thought it was like management style like click and go the truck. Okay, oh

1192
01:41:37.939 --> 01:41:40.659
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>No, you, you actually pilot the things.

1193
01:41:40.779 --> 01:41:44.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, why did we never get for girls before?

1194
01:41:43.779 --> 01:41:50.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And that, yeah, so this is, uh, 2015 was the first year that they had a female character that you could play as.

1195
01:41:44.500 --> 01:42:12.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay. Okay. Sorry. Dylant or Dylant, Dylant, just time planet. I remember that one. I believe that game is also covered on the harvest season.

1197
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>[laughing]

1198
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Good ahead is that thing was out of the--

1199
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:22.739
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>the PSP, jeez. And then a game they call, you may have heard of it called Stardew Valley,

1200
01:42:22.739 --> 01:42:34.239
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>came out in 2016. Okay, so, so yeah, a tree of trance got a lot of love, I remember.

1201
01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:37.460
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't know her. I mean, all the other games value an effort, but they had no way, they have no, they had no way of knowing what was coming.

1202
01:42:34.239 --> 01:42:42.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, yeah, this was-- this was not the iceberg, because you could see the iceberg.

1203
01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>This was the iceberg like

1204
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:54.779
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It was the ice climber's final smash with the J-E-E-E-S-B-B-B-B-Z

1205
01:42:47.500 --> 01:43:04.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, this, yeah. This was the iceberg. Yeah. So I think the only other things that I would mention about some of these previous games is in Harvest Moon seeds of memories on iOS and Android,

1206
01:43:04.939 --> 01:43:10.619
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>you can befriend a bobcat. And I think that that's cool, but other than that,

1207
01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.899
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Ooh, that's good. That's good.

1208
01:43:11.579 --> 01:43:15.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>we've mentioned some of these other games on the podcast and they do exist, but

1209
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:22.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>of towns go worthy of a revisit, in my opinion probably. I think three towns that's cool.

1210
01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>yeah.

1211
01:43:22.579 --> 01:43:38.659
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Idea, Dragon Quest Builders, a good start. I'll say that. It's a good start. Too bad you came out to the year of Stardew Valley. You might have had a shot at DQB, but Stardew, you really wrote Yup with the period, and that is all that needs to be said about Stardew Valley.

1212
01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:40.020
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>That's what literally all I wrote was, yeah.

1213
01:43:41.619 --> 01:43:44.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>the reason we exist as in the show.

1214
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:52.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Oh, okay. Yeah, but I think that's good for 26. I just feel so bad because everyone else has to compete with Stardew Valley.

1215
01:43:53.659 --> 01:44:00.659
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>All right, 2017 Harvest Moon Light of Hope for the PC and later in Switch and PS4 in 2018.

1216
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:19.880
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so I do like that the second player, excuse me, in the special edition there's a playable character that can be controlled by a second player, which is kind of cool.

1217
01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:07.539
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I remember this one was not great. I'm hearing a talk about it on the show actually.

1218
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:20.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>That is fun. That is a fun idea. I like that you're right.

1219
01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:20.760
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Still doesn't matter though.

1220
01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:28.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, this is not farming similar 18 from the mobile version for Android iOS 3DS.

1221
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:34.220
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Ooh, you can go sunflowers. I like sunflowers, but in pigs.

1222
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:41.060
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I do like the animal trailers. So I'm interested to see how they do it in this game, but

1223
01:44:41.939 --> 01:44:48.659
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>as someone who grew up on a ranch, people sleep on how difficult it can be to get animals into

1224
01:44:44.500 --> 01:45:14.460
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah I can imagine I have a puppy and like that's already hard as it is to control that thing. Yup. Yup. Nebby get in the bag! Yeah, but it's a mobile one so yeah. But what about with a...

1225
01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:03.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>yeah, imagine if your puppy is a horse that doesn't want to get in the trailer, you have to get them in the trailer.

1226
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So that's interesting.

1227
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But.

1228
01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:26.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>power of the Nintendo Switch, we can have mobile and console because farming simulator hit the Nintendo Switch. I thought it was later but maybe I'm just catching up in years 2017. Oh yeah, we're actually near the end army.

1229
01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:34.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, farming simulator Nintendo Switch. I don't know, I don't know.

1230
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:38.939
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, there's nothing specific about it. There's nothing, whatever. So it's just

1231
01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>You couldn't farm as Mario sadly.

1232
01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.020
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>- Slime rancher.

1233
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:48.380
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>- Yeah, that's the game I know of,

1234
01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:52.579
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>but I've never played or no much about, really,

1235
01:45:52.579 --> 01:45:54.340
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>other than you ranch slimes.

1236
01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:56.880
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But they're cute.

1237
01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:05.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>But it has, I actually, as I was looking at slime rencher, it is considered overwhelmingly positive on steam.

1238
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:09.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, it's also a shooter isn't it or you suck up the the slides or something you have a guns first-person shooter type of thing

1239
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

1240
01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Which is obviously different from our standard fair, but there you go

1241
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

1242
01:46:16.119 --> 01:46:21.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Gosh, I I vaguely remember this next when yonder the cloud can't your chronicles

1243
01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:24.140
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Well, is this

1244
01:46:25.159 --> 01:46:29.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, I don't remember this at all. What is that? That's like a big

1245
01:46:30.319 --> 01:46:32.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Is that a moose? I think it is a moose

1246
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I don't know.

1247
01:46:33.079 --> 01:46:44.720
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Looking at art here Primary the goal is seeking collect magical creatures known as sprites to banish ominous and ominous shroud known as the merc What what a name the merc?

1248
01:46:45.239 --> 01:46:50.279
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Throughout the adventure the player can take part in activities like farming fishing and crafting while exploring the island

1249
01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:55.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, so we've got actually I

1250
01:46:57.039 --> 01:47:02.720
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Might just want to give it well, okay, on my opinion is either farming sim Nintendo Switch

1251
01:47:03.079 --> 01:47:07.699
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Line rancher Yeah, that's like take away

1252
01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:13.020
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>I think it's lime ranger. I think that people will riot if we don't choose slime rancher. I've heard so many good things about this game Even though I haven't played it

1253
01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:15.399
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1254
01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:19.340
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>So it's got to be slime rancher I I mean it's one of those games. I want to go back and play because I've heard so many good things about it

1255
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:25.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. I mean farming rancher to or slime rancher to excuse me is coming out and people are hyped

1256
01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>People are so hyped

1257
01:47:27.119 --> 01:47:32.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay 2018 is our last year we made a people we made it to the end

1258
01:47:31.899 --> 01:47:33.899
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>The last melon

1259
01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farming simulator 19 on the PC

1260
01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:45.319
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Farming simulated Commodore 64. That's a fun idea on the retro version

1261
01:47:43.739 --> 01:47:49.100
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, so that's nuts. So it's a super retro version. The images were crazy

1262
01:47:50.699 --> 01:47:52.699
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Super super cool, but man

1263
01:47:52.500 --> 01:48:06.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And I feel like one of those things that was started out as an April fools joke, but they said, but we'll do it for real though on. But anyways, that's that's good. Yeah.

1264
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.880
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.

1265
01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.439
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Like the farming simulator group of people,

1266
01:48:04.439 --> 01:48:06.399
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>like they have so many mods and stuff.

1267
01:48:06.399 --> 01:48:10.560
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Someone probably made this as a mod and then it just like exploded.

1268
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:10.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Yeah.

1269
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Probably.

1270
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.199
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>And so they just made it for real real.

1271
01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:22.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Okay, farm together, um, for Windows Max team and OS grow your own farm by yourself or cooperate with your friends in this unique relaxing farming experience.

1272
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:32.500
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I'm going to say this is probably not that unique. It looks like generic mobile game art, to be honest, that's all I can say about it.

1273
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:37.479
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Garden pause for the PC. I remember this one. I believe we this one got an episode

1274
01:48:32.500 --> 01:49:03.300
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah. Yeah, I played this one. I recommend it. It's 20 bucks. I really thought that you basically have your own little shop. And people come in and there's like a line of cute little characters that come and buy all your stuff. And it's really, I really enjoy this game. I actually kind of want to jump back into it. Um.

1275
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.520
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Sure. It looks cute. It's good. Like those are big eyeballs on all these animal creatures.

1276
01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.500
<v 02EE3D40-885C-40E9-A26E-E1B7A7404D25>Yeah.

1277
01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:15.560
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>But it's charming. Okay. That's all nice and lovely, but sorry, this is another year where,

1278
01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.600
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>you know, I might have some interesting ones, but there's a Titan among all of you,

1279
01:49:19.159 --> 01:49:26.840
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>and that is Dragon Quest Builders 2. I talked about that game at length. I adore that game.

1280
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I mean, I suggest people go back and watch the episode, but it's Minecraft in its ultimate form.

1281
01:49:36.199 --> 01:49:41.800
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Like, really, I don't have a better way to say it. Like, it did Dragon Quest Builders 1 better.

1282
01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.199
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>Like, let's think things even better. I had a good story. How on Earth did this game have a good story?

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>I don't know, but it did. Yeah, it's a good game. And hey, if nothing else for, you know, if you guys aren't that interested,

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>And I'll just say this, "Procopia is built off this thing."

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>This game is a good one.

<v 97C95AF1-E1D9-48ED-8B16-76D89E234E1C>It's a credible game of what it's so much.
