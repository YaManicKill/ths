## Intro

(30s) **Kevin:**

> How farmer and welcome to another episode of the harvest season my name is Kevin

(38s) **Codey:**

> My name is Cody.

(40s) **Kevin:**

> And we are here today to talk about anything other than Z. Yeah

(44s) **Codey:**

> Woooo!

(48s) **Kevin:**

> Indeed, I don't have it. I don't think you have it because

(52s) **Codey:**

> No, I, um, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not gonna get it. I'm just gonna say I'm not gonna get it.

(58s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh! Mmm.

(1m) **Codey:**

> Um, this is probably the first main series game that I am just straight up skipping.

(1m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(1m 8s) **Codey:**

> I think my mouth's gone a little dry for Pokemon games right now.

(1m 12s) **Kevin:**

> That's very fair

(1m 12s) **Codey:**

> Not only because of being busy with else.

(1m 19s)

> But also, it's just not seeing enough innovation.

(1m 24s)

> > > And the last few games that I've played.

(1m 27s)

> I've just been like, I mean, this is kind of just the same thing.

(1m 31s)

> It's like more nostalgic than anything.

(1m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's fair

(1m 34s) **Codey:**

> No, I want them to do something different.

(1m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yup, I mean

(1m 38s) **Codey:**

> I'll play the next legends whenever that happens.

(1m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Well, yeah, I'm yeah, I'm you know, I can't with the next legends. Whatever. It's gonna be the legend series

(1m 48s)

> I mean, I've heard This game has issues because the Pokemon game because of course it does, but overall, I'm hearing good things about this one And I love Calo, so I love xy So I'm perfectly excited. I haven't gotten yet, but I want to get legends

(1m 57s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(2m 1s) **Kevin:**

> But I get your feeling I mean

(2m 3s)

> no matter how much you care or fan or care about how you enjoy the scarlet while I think scarlet violet was a momentum stopper of sorts because you know even for the biggest fans it still had technical problems or whatever but anyways I get it's a lot of Pokemon they do a lot of things so taking a break that's that's fine I didn't get the DLC for scarlet while I let that's crazy

(2m 11s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(2m 25s) **Kevin:**

> um anyways yes so yeah no z yeah we we're actually we somehow we managed to cap ourselves but

(2m 33s)

> what we are we have plenty of other things to talk about because we got you know the news and stuff and and we I don't know what the timing was it probably just the schedule nothing specific but we're warming up for our award season this year by by you know since we are the authority in capital you know T capital A Tm on on farming games we have decided to award

(2m 57s) **Codey:**

> Right, right.

(3m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Earl preemptively or not preemptively earlier in the year award farming game of the year not to this year's contenders or whatever but toward to all the other years we missed the pre harvest season error or at least the pretty whenever we started doing it era

(3m 18s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(3m 19s) **Kevin:**

> so we're going back to far as what was it 96 and we're doing all of them

(3m 22s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, so I think the idea was that Al went back to the,

(3m 31s)

> oh gosh, this is a lot to scroll through.

(3m 32s)

> The harvest man, like the very first SNES harvest moon game,

(3m 37s)

> which is in 1996.

(3m 39s)

> And he just looked at the farming type games that came out each year thereafter.

(3m 46s)

> And, you know, the first.

(3m 48s)

> Episode of the podcast, I think we was in 2019 so we're covering up through 2018 so it's kind of going through the big names we of course were going to miss on we're not able to like know every single farming game that ever came out but I'll did it.

(4m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, you know the three hour episode length just multiply that by however many years recovering and that's how long this episode will be

(4m 14s) **Codey:**

> right yeah now this is uh this is a loose it's

(4m 18s)

> especially when I added like the blurbs that I added to try and remember what these games were um yeah it became a long list so that's uh I'm excited to get into it though I'm wondering if we have anything any differing opinions on some of these you know some of the years the options are slim either to zero or to one but uh

(4m 38s) **Kevin:**

> The real, you know, the real surprises when there's one, but we won't award it to them.

(4m 48s) **Codey:**

> I actually am I'm considering it I am I'm considering it so yeah that we're doing that we got some game news before that and before before that uh Kevin what do you up to let's look what's going on

(4m 51s) **Kevin:**

> You're not good enough.

## What Have We Been Up To

(5m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Oh gosh, it's actually been a week's recorded. It's been a whirlwind week for me. I went to a wedding. That was tight.

(5m 12s)

> Wait, was that this week? Yes, I think it was gosh, I don't remember. Yeah, yeah, it was. That was a disaster. Not on their part. Anyways, okay, game-wise, what have I been up to? I'm honestly not that much because I've been so busy. I've digimoned more, man. So the thing about digimon, the the collecting aspect is...

(5m 35s)

> It's not so much like go out and catch everything.

(5m 40s)

> It's not, you know, just go find all the random encounters.

(5m 43s)

> A lot of it is going up and down the evolutionary trees, because in Digimon games the standard quo is not only do you digivolt to get bigger, but you can also de-digivolt and to get increased stats when you're, you know, when you go smaller and then you can go bigger again in different directions because branching.

(6m 5s)

> And so yeah, that's a part of the quote unquote grind in that game like I'm just going to go out and get some XP and level up a whole bunch of people and devolve them and indeed did evolve and then go in other directions and I don't know I find it very zen and enjoyable and it's also I guess it's a fact that you have like it's clear the goalposts, right?

(6m 35s)

> randomly pulling the slot until I get it's like, no, okay, I need to hit this requirement to get this evolution and so on and so forth. So you do get a little a little bit more control and that's kind of nice. But yeah overall, it's mostly been Digimon and some of my other stuffs and this zone zero got an update. It's been fine. But yeah, that's it nothing terribly interesting. What about you go Cody what's going on?

(7m 5s) **Codey:**

> I'm still doing that old PhD making making moves on that, which is good. I actually saw one of my friends did like a proof of life post for like like if you're not, if you don't post that often on social media or something like on their Facebook and it's just like hey I'm still here,

(7m 13s) **Kevin:**

> I too am breathing and living like... [laughs]

(7m 30s) **Codey:**

> here's just like a one minute, here's how my life's going, here's what I'm doing and I was like

(7m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My friends got into a habit of a little less regularly, but almost weekly bi-weekly like you just shoot some message to all his friends. Hey, here's what's up this week.

(7m 35s) **Codey:**

> kind of this cost part actually.

(7m 46s) **Kevin:**

> If you're feeling cool, send it back, you know, reciprocates or we can stay in touch while not saying in touch that much. Mm-hmm.

(7m 53s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, I have my best friends from Oregon.

(7m 57s)

> We have a group that we do that with.

(7m 59s)

> We either, and you always call it something,

(8m 1s)

> like it's like the Tuesday, tiramisu,

(8m 3s)

> or the Wednesday waffle.

(8m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay.

(8m 5s) **Codey:**

> I don't know why we do that,

(8m 7s)

> but like it's like, here's your Friday Fritter,

(8m 10s)

> here's my life, like here's what I'm doing.

(8m 12s)

> And we try and do like one a week,

(8m 14s)

> but we're all busy humans.

(8m 18s)

> So it doesn't always happen.

(8m 19s)

> But yeah, so I'm still,

(8m 21s)

> still going to be actually still doing a puppy.

(8m 23s)

> She is 11 weeks now and we just had puppy class today.

(8m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, God, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, that's, I mean, it's fine, like, yeah, I can imagine that that's nice, they get tired, they, they, they go full blast with their energy, no, no, no,

(8m 29s) **Codey:**

> She's a barker man, that's the biggest thing.

(8m 35s)

> Stella was not as vocal as peppercorn is, so that's something we're having to learn.

(8m 41s)

> Though if you hear her, I apologize.

(8m 46s)

> Though she just had puppy class, so she's pretty zonked because she had to learn much.

(8m 53s)

> I also did the no king's protest this last weekend, which was super fun.

(8m 57s) **Kevin:**

> No study.

(8m 58s)

> This is a great day.

(9m 7s) **Codey:**

> There are a couple thousand people from my local city that showed up, very fun.

(9m 12s)

> We got lots of honks.

(9m 14s)

> There were only two out of the thousands of humans that came to do the protest.

(9m 20s)

> There are only two counter-protestors.

(9m 22s) **Kevin:**

> hahaha hahaha oh hmm yeah oh like mmm where do you even stand in that scenario like you know you

(9m 24s) **Codey:**

> That was pretty dope.

(9m 33s)

> So the one guy was just like walking opposite of the march.

(9m 38s)

> And he was just like saying whatever he was saying.

(9m 42s)

> And then another guy was just like on the other side of the road with a single side.

(9m 46s)

> And it's like, bro, you're all by yourself with a single sign.

(9m 47s) **Kevin:**

> you know if it was it was yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I was about to say you know if it's shame his opinions so trash because that was you know I just I respect that conviction you know the dedication okay good

(9m 50s) **Codey:**

> And I was just like, I don't I mean good good for them also exercising their rights while we still can but yeah that was it was interesting

(10m 10s)

> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, that's what I

## Game News

(10m 17s) **Kevin:**

> stuff with that we all right let's get into news cuz that still goes on despite everything whether he wants or not for cottagecore news all right let us start off with a 1.0 a game called Wind Story which I don't know if we talked about I don't know this one at all. Wind Story is a simulation game players can immerse themselves in rural lifestyles including farming breeding and fishing

(10m 47s)

> during the day they can freely roam the ranch get capital R the ranch's flower fields wall at night they can enjoy drinking and dancing by the lake site bonfire I could go for drinking the dancing by the bonfire so yeah this it's I just gonna say it's Octopath it has that Octopath 2 what do they call it 2.5 HD whatever art style where it's kind of 2D but also popping out like a storybook almost.

(11m 10s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, yeah, I felt that, yeah.

(11m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(11m 17s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I thought it was cute.

(11m 19s)

> It looks cute, but 1.0 out now.

(11m 24s)

> It's actually also very affordable.

(11m 26s) **Kevin:**

> I want to know is why is there some sort of garden warfare thing, it was like crop, but it was almost like cartoony pieces of grass and crops, like fighting other villagers, I don't know what's going on there, but it's funny because it's like kind of, the art style

(11m 42s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(11m 47s) **Kevin:**

> there it will kind of cartoony and like scribble and I don't know what's going on there.

(11m 52s)

> There's gliding, the lighting effects on, I just first see it at night.

(11m 55s)

> They're very pretty.

(11m 56s)

> It's like a Ferris wheel.

(11m 57s)

> Yeah, there's a lot going on here, what is that green dinosaur thing falling?

(12m 5s)

> I don't know what that is, but I guess there's a lot going on here.

(12m 11s)

> I'm someone in treatment, like you said, it is, which is the price on this.

(12m 15s)

> I don't think 12 bucks USD either

(12m 17s) **Codey:**

> mm-hmm yeah it is unfortunately windows only for those of us like me who I knew I just don't play my desktop and but the switch one is also only $15 so it's also out on

(12m 17s) **Kevin:**

> That's pretty good. Those are demo! Oh my gosh, all this game is great. That's a demo. It's at one point. No, it's affordable. I want these done as things

(12m 36s)

> Oh, ooh, it's on switching and consent. That's great. Well, there you go. Check that out. That's that's somewhat, I'm somewhat intrigued because they're going for a lot here.

(12m 44s)

> Um, that is again, wind story. Um, you think there'd be like a wind message. I don't see one. Um,

(12m 52s)

> All right. Now, let's go to the, the polar opposite sort of news from 1.0 release to the delay of which book delayed to 2026,

(13m 6s)

> I think most games at this point, they're delaying. Yeah, that's that's what they're going to aim for. Um,

(13m 8s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I'll made a note on this that he's like, we're hitting that time of the year where

(13m 16s)

> some games either have to put up or shut up.

(13m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

(13m 21s) **Codey:**

> And so they're we're going to either start seeing some releases or delays. He said that there are still 10 games that have not yet been delayed that we're still waiting on.

(13m 32s)

> In their in their note at their post where they said that they had to delay, which is totally fine,

(13m 36s)

> Y'all do you.

(13m 39s)

> They also added an interactive map so you can go on their website and look at this map of the area. It's actually pretty large. I feel

(13m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I like this concept of like you the little man

(13m 50s) **Codey:**

> and

(13m 53s)

> Yeah, yeah, so you can see little screenshots. I also just like I like the idea of it being a school

(14m)

> because which brook is like it's right next to I think like an academy or something like that of of witchcraft and

(14m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(14m 6s) **Codey:**

> and I feel like a lot of these games.

(14m 8s)

> They don't have like a school motif or whatever.

(14m 13s)

> Like I kind of like this.

(14m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(14m 15s) **Codey:**

> Don't have enough of that these days.

(14m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Well, yeah, I agree right like in the

(14m 22s)

> You know, well trotted path of you know the general the farm in the small rural village. It is a nice spin of like

(14m 29s)

> Yeah, here's a different environment with the different feel and objective so yeah, right. I appreciate that

(14m 37s)

> Oh, yeah, and that's

(14m 41s)

> That's they're they're they're working obviously they cannot some of the other

(14m 45s)

> Stuff that they're working on character customization a girdle pen

(14m 52s) **Codey:**

> No, no, this is, this is the next one. This is Grimshire.

(14m 52s) **Kevin:**

> pen What oh my gosh, I did. I'm looking at the wrong one. I mistake. Yes. I'm practicing with my wires. Yeah

(14m 58s) **Codey:**

> Girdle pen, y'all. What are we talking about? That's a great question.

(15m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's good. Oh green sharp. This is the wild one. Okay. This is the animal people

(15m 5s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, this is a grim cozy.

(15m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(15m 9s) **Codey:**

> So yeah, Grimshire, this is, so that was it for Witchbrook. She delayed. Go check out the interactive map. Grimshire has their .25 update.

(15m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Oh God, not only random number updates, but random pre 1.0 numbers. Yeah!

(15m 22s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(15m 27s)

> And he said note on, or they said note on version number format change. I decided during the middle part of the version numbers. So it's now just that, I guess.

(15m 34s) **Kevin:**

> You whittled it down. Oh, but that's great, but that means this earlier ones at the middle version

(15m 41s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. So they did a bunch of stuff here. They did Kirk, like as Kev was saying,

(15m 48s)

> character customization. The girdle pen and the

(15m 52s)

> luggie hutch. An ounce that I haven't looked up with these are and it's funnier that way. And I was considering also not looking them up but I was like you know what I'm interested so I looked them up but there is no answer so it doesn't matter. They say this thing but then they never explain it. I think from context clues it's it's that before you just had like animal pen and no matter what kind of animal you had it went into the animal pen or the coop or whatever.

(16m 5s) **Kevin:**

[Laughter]

(16m 22s) **Codey:**

> But now if you have a girdle or a buggy they have their own pen like they no longer go in with the coop or the barn or whatever.

(16m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean that would have been my wager, but what's a girl?

(16m 34s) **Codey:**

> That's the next question what's a girdle and what's a buggy and that is going to remain the mystery for me.

(16m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(16m 39s)

> Well, well if you I'm look if you look at a trailer you can see some of their strange animals because you're an animal person and raising some sort of animals

(16m 44s) **Codey:**

> uh-huh

(16m 47s) **Kevin:**

> The buggy I'm guessing is that bunny slug cross creature

(16m 52s) **Codey:**

> Oh, that makes sense. Which is wild, because you can be a bunny.

(16m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, you can and then and then

(16m 58s) **Codey:**

> Bunny is farming bunnies. Okay.

(17m 1s) **Kevin:**

> And there's something that kind of looks like a turtle I don't know what the G is for but there's there's these are strange creatures actually and it looks like a chicken and a sheep draft that's probably what it is a girl that said it is there you go

(17m 9s) **Codey:**

> your wrath. I just looked at, I just thought of GIR, but I thought some of the other bug fixes and updates were funnier. So I pulled a few. Here we go. So remember, this is Grimshy. This is a grim cozy game. So something they adjusted was the food insecurity

(17m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, that's probably what yeah, because it looked like a llama or something, but yeah, it's probably draft that's what is we saw that we did it good good job

(17m 39s) **Codey:**

> death logic with resets the starvation count at the start of each town projects and you can get double-panelized for missing both food categories. So your people can star. I'm interested, you got me. Yeah, wild.

(17m 41s) **Kevin:**

[Laughter]

(17m 57s)

> Yeah, yeah, I mean rewatch that trailer. Yeah, yeah, there may be some enforced starvation on people

(18m 9s) **Codey:**

> Another thing. So this is just a cool one. The effects of kibble eaten by mothers now affects the nursing babies. That just makes sense. Love that.

(18m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yes, well kind of terrifying, but oh, okay. I don't know

(18m 22s) **Codey:**

> We got another mystery. Critter's state is now saved when they enter or exit a scene on their own parentheses infinite milk glitch. What? I'm thinking

(18m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's good. I love infinite glitching.

(18m 39s) **Codey:**

> that like something would go out of your frame of view like you'd milk your cow and then they go to the frame of view and you would just find them again and they'd have milk again. I love that. That's they didn't they fixed it though so that doesn't happen anymore. And then finally fixed the void issue at the bottom of the marsh mine maybe for real this time.

(18m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I like that a lot too.

(19m 5s)

> I like I like that last time we need we need more devs adding that on there

(19m 10s) **Codey:**

> Fix this thing. Maybe maybe for real. It's like a final version underscore two underscore rough draft underscore but really. I respect it Grimshire. I'm

(19m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe for real

(19m 25s)

> Yeah, I did too. I like that. That's good

(19m 31s)

> So there you go 0.25, which means at most

(19m 35s)

> 75 more updates before release unless they go back to the middle number

(19m 37s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm.

(19m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, oh From stuff being added before launch. Let's talk about stuff being added after launch because we got the boy This is the game for that doesn't eat dream like Valley

(19m 59s) **Codey:**

> out.

(20m) **Kevin:**

> Where do we start you know okay all right look

(20m 5s)

> I say it every time I know I say it every time I can't believe that they weren't already in the game But this time this time seems fair. How's Cinderella not in the game? All right. She's to her castle the logo of the company

(20m 15s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Also her fairy godmother's been there the whole time here instead of the views one of the first ones that you get. Yeah. Yeah. So they had their whole 12/2025 showcase so they not only talked about.

(20m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(20m 26s)

> Yes Okay, okay, I think I'm I'm valid in this one. How was she not there oh?

(20m 35s)

> Okay, but that's December 10th. She'll join that's cool. She'll explode

(20m 45s) **Codey:**

> What they added this year, but they also talked about what's coming and just watching the showcase, I skipped through it, but I just realized how much I missed like it reminded me of how much I've missed because, no, there's, well, it's, it's disney for doing my val.

(20m 57s) **Kevin:**

> much Disney to be experienced.

(21m 3s) **Codey:**

> But yeah, they added a lot of stuff. It seems like there's a lot of fixes to things so I'm going to try and pick this back up. We'll see what happens.

(21m 11s)

> On top of Cinderella joining on December 10th in a free content update.

(21m 15s)

> They're also adding something called wish blossom ranch.

(21m 21s)

> Which is going to be a, I believe paid DLC content that adds horses.

(21m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that one's actually sooner. That one's November 19th. The ranch.

(21m 29s) **Codey:**

> So you can summon, yeah, it's pretty soon.

(21m 35s)

> And that one adds like you get to go and find a bunch of horses.

(21m 40s)

> And there are horses that are actually in Disney movies.

(21m 43s)

> but you can also get your own.

(21m 45s)

> So that's fair. Also, in Wish Blossom Ranch, they have Tigger, Corella Deville, Snow White, and Tinkerbell.

(21m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but why who cares because Maximus just that's off. That's the end of the sentence

(22m 1s)

> Oh, well, I don't, I don't like rolling that, that this, this, you know, context that that's not good. I don't like that.

(22m 7s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, she'd be the last person I would let be at a ranch.

(22m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Help her start up her glue factory.

(22m 19s) **Codey:**

> Kevin, no. Why? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

(22m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Tigger needs some glue and she says I can help there.

(22m 29s) **Codey:**

> She needs to glue, take her down as what she needs to do.

(22m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Thank you.

(22m 37s) **Codey:**

> That is almost out, I guess. Like you said in November 19th, they also had their roadmap for 2026.

(22m 45s)

> So these are all free content things that are coming out. Early 2026, the quote is bond over spaghetti and meatballs. It was clearly saying it's clearly Lady in the Tramp. In spring 2026, they showed the raccoon from Pocahontas, next to Pocahontas is necklace. So it'd be Pocahontas.

(22m 53s) **Kevin:**

> I could go for some.

(23m 6s)

> the wind. Yep. Yep. And it's and Phil is there in the column. It's that you. So yeah, there we go. That's those are good ones. Hercules. That's a fun one.

(23m 7s) **Codey:**

> In summer 2026, clearly Hercules, very Greek, very issues. Yes, yeah.

(23m 20s)

> And then Al says more updates to game additions for some reason. I believe it's because there's like three new game additions you can get and one of them is like the base game And then there's the one that includes some of a lot of the pre

(23m 37s)

> dslc paid dlc and then there's the ultimate or whatever and that includes the previous paid dlc but also this this upcoming wish blossom wish brought from ranch. So, which is like 80 bucks. Well, and that so they can kind of get me on that because if I didn't.

(23m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, this is, uh, some of this is wild. Do you want to get the wit and boss from ranch deluxe editions? He can get Zvan from frozen. I like Zvan. I'll say that. I like grained ear and that's a

(24m 7s) **Codey:**

> I haven't bought this yet. I'm still playing on game pass, but you're you're gonna have the option to get spin and reunites then and whatever his name is and you're not gonna know it's not a little off. It's the other guy. And you're not gonna do it. You're not gonna do it. So, yeah.

(24m 18s) **Kevin:**

> off. Oh, the other guy. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man. You know, that's a greenhouse. What are the best disney melts because your count. Oh, that's what start getting, you know, into a blood

(24m 36s) **Codey:**

> Oh, oh. Should we do mounds or like mounds plus animal capacity?

(24m 48s)

> And I'm not talking like, lady in the tramp, like they're not animal companions.

(24m 48s) **Kevin:**

> cause animal campaigns. That's a tough one. Yeah. No, no, the animal buddy, right? Okay. Here's a question. Does carpet count? Well, I guess it counts amount, but yeah, Zabu. Yeah. If you're

(24m 55s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, the animal buddy.

(25m 2s)

> I think you, yeah, well, a carpet would be the mount and then the animal buddy would be Abu.

(25m 9s)

> Well, so that's that that's Disney dream. My valley. I am going to pick it back up. I tried to do that earlier, but I had more stuff.

(25m 18s)

> to prepare for for this podcast. So I was like, Oh, don't have time. So I will let you all know in this lack.

(25m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(25m 27s)

> Hercule's coming which means Pegasus will be a mal. That's that's a sick one. It's a good one

(25m 29s) **Codey:**

> Yep, yep, yep, yep, that's a good one.

(25m 36s)

> Starbirds is our next one. So they have their early access road map.

(25m 41s)

> It includes the flora and fauna update, which they say is going to be December or January.

(25m 48s)

> Next December, next January. It includes things like moving to a new place and discovering new things. Okay, they, they say stuff, but it's very vague. So I just was like, okay.

(25m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean plant life and it's yeah

(26m 4s) **Codey:**

> I mean, it's cool that there's more stuff coming out, but when they said flora and fauna, I was like, Oh, what is it?

(26m 10s)

> Not a lot of info there, but I'll wait.

(26m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. It's like, as at a glance, it's adding more things to kind of resource mine and producer whatever. But the big overarching problem, both Alan and I had was just the, what's the big motivation to do it? And I don't know if that's going to be introduced just yet. But, you know,

(26m 14s) **Codey:**

> - Tarbert has my attention.

(26m 43s) **Kevin:**

> nothing else that are demo early access is working and working well. So I trust them. Um,

(26m 50s)

> and they're not on any rush clearly because for they have like a roadmap and then it off into not even on the timeline, like it just says full release floating out in space. Um, so that's at some point it'll release maybe.

(27m 1s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(27m 5s)

> Yeah, I mean they got to take their time. They got a lot. This is they're they're very much in the beginning of their

(27m 14s)

> Of their their journey

(27m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yup, their space voyage, uh, this did the thing.

(27m 23s)

> Okay, this next one, I haven't played either game, but I'm kind of hype here.

(27m 31s) **Codey:**

> Okay, okay. Here he is.

(27m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Cause I don't know, I don't, I don't, this, okay, I'm talking about a letter from Porsche, Guston, Ginger are coming to Starsand Island, um, right, we're getting across So we're content.

(27m 47s)

> Between start sand island, that's that very like Asian-esque like inspired because you're building up like a kind of like a garden.

(27m 59s)

> Anyways, sorry about the game loss.

(28m)

> Anyways, they're doing a crossover and they're introducing guest characters Dustin Ginger from my time at Porsche and they're in this art style.

(28m 13s)

> looks good. It really...

(28m 17s)

> we've got gusts, there's an architect and then we got gin... I didn't select so I don't know these characters all the way them.

(28m 24s) **Codey:**

> I don't either.

(28m 26s)

> But yeah, so these are two people and they say specifically to fill your faces arrived on Star St.

(28m 30s)

> Island from the distant mainland and they are visiting the island for a special journey. So

(28m 38s)

> I'll comment and wait. So is this meant to be in the same universe? Is the my time games?

(28m 42s)

> I think it is. I think that these characters are coming from the my time at Porsche

(28m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(28m 48s) **Codey:**

> World or wherever that is and they're coming to this island. I did see

(28m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's that's cool.

(28m 54s) **Codey:**

> the comments on the steam page for this letter is

(29m 1s)

> Wait, what's gonna happen? I'm married to gust like what?

(29m 5s) **Kevin:**

[Laughter]

(29m 7s) **Codey:**

> Just gotta vanish from my game and like no, I'm sure that they won't do that, but it's cool that they're kind of like

(29m 14s)

> showing some of their characters in one of their other games

(29m 19s)

> Yeah, I don't know I haven't played any of these I haven't played well star sand is an out yet there is a demo currently excuse me that does not have gust in ginger but when the game comes out and it's estimated for Q1 2026 they will be available at launch but it just hasn't launched yet so if you like to my time of Porsche if you really like these characters and you were on the fence about star sand island maybe this pushes you over the edge I don't know

(29m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah

(29m 41s)

> yeah

(29m 47s)

> Yeah, it it what fascinates me is that I mean these are two different developers. This is a fairly substantial crossover

(29m 57s)

> You know cuz you've got sea lab for stars in and was it pantheon games or my time at Porsche?

(30m 3s)

> But anyways, it looks great, it starts on island books.

(30m 7s)

> It's great visually, it's cool to see that.

(30m 9s)

> I just, I'm somewhat, I know that like in the Fortnite world, everything's crossing over and it's tired, but I don't know, when one is done well, it still excites me, maybe I'm just a sucker, but it's cool.

(30m 25s) **Codey:**

> I can't remember. Did I tell you last week that Scooby Doo is in Fortnite right now? Okay, good.

(30m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, you didn't tell me, is that it had those sick crocs that the first crocs I would ever wear, those scooby-doo crocs.

(30m 35s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(30m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I hate croc, but I'd rock those because I'd love scooby-doo so much.

(30m 39s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(30m 44s)

> Yeah, I actually just watched the first live-action movie today.

(30m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh, that movie is wild to me, like just, we literally got a new shaggy, he stayed on to voice him for, oh it's crazy, for decades, oh my gosh.

(30m 48s) **Codey:**

> Not for the first time.

(30m 58s)

> I love Matthew Lillard, he's such an amazing actor.

(31m 7s) **Kevin:**

> He's incredible, what range, we got shaggy and we got the guy in the screen, yeah.

(31m 14s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, one of a killer in scream.

(31m 18s)

> He also is a paranormal, investigative, psychic,

(31m 22s)

> and a movie called 13 Ghosts,

(31m 25s)

> which is one of my favorite horror movies.

(31m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, I didn't know that, but we have this, there's the series called 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, we can connect it all!

(31m 34s) **Codey:**

> Oh my gosh, I didn't know that.

(31m 36s) **Kevin:**

> He's also like the bad guy thinking five lines of Freddy's life action.

(31m 40s)

> Man has got this like goofy cartoony horror down, um, good for you.

(31m 49s)

> Which, which fought crossover with a farming game on Matthew earlier would be in stay tuned, I don't know.

(31m 56s) **Codey:**

> If I could marry him in Stardew,

(31m 57s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, yes, I would too!

(31m 57s) **Codey:**

> I would pick Stardew back up immediately.

(32m 3s) **Kevin:**

> I'm sorry Leah.

(32m 4s) **Codey:**

> Maybe he'll be in haunted truck with here.

(32m 5s)

> It's another spooky crossover.

(32m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Awwww!

(32m 8s) **Codey:**

> No, he won't.

(32m 9s)

> That would be amazing, huh?

(32m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Good sir Dave, how much do you love Scooby-Doo?

(32m 12s) **Codey:**

> Ah.

(32m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, um...

## New Games

(32m 16s) **Codey:**

> Okay, last thing before we get into our main topic,

(32m 18s)

> we have one new game,

(32m 20s)

> and it is called Mazy Village.

(32m 23s)

> So, Maisie, as in like,

(32m 26s)

> that you go through that has, like, you has dead ends and you, whatever, a corn maze, whatever.

(32m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Not. Yeah. Yeah. Not Maisie Mouse. That's different. Do you know that one? Oh, I think it was originally British cartoon. It's just a very charming, like kids cartoon. I'm going to put on, I'm going to show the art because it's very charming. But anyways, yes.

(32m 37s) **Codey:**

> Oh, I didn't know. No.

(32m 44s)

> No.

(32m 47s)

> Okay, we'll put it, put it in the slack, put it in the slack.

(32m 49s)

> Maisie Village is a cozy town restoring adventure where a tornado scatters homes, villagers.

(32m 57s)

> And they're precious belongings, including, I'm just going to be saying it, including a cat, if you go find a cat.

(33m 3s)

> Find what was lost in the world as you solve Maisie's rebuild homes and fill the village with warmth and life again.

(33m 11s)

> So, I, the, I love the art of this game, but I also, I just think this is such a really interesting idea where you start with like a huge area.

(33m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(33m 21s) **Codey:**

> and then in this little opening scene or whatever you see.

(33m 26s)

> a tornado just jumble everything around, and then you only have,

(33m 28s) **Kevin:**

> tornado has a face

(33m 30s) **Codey:**

> tornado has a face.

(33m 33s) **Kevin:**

> suggesting that was intentional and aimed

(33m 34s) **Codey:**

> I need to know the tornado is backstory.

(33m 38s) **Kevin:**

> It's a very cute face too. That's the worst part. I want to be that tornado's friend

(33m 40s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so you end up coming to this town or you're part of this town or whatever,

(33m 48s)

> and you end up bringing everything back together, but it limits what you can do at first,

(33m 54s)

> And then you help people rebuild their...

(33m 56s)

> homes or, like, find their lost cat or find their, like, something that's precious to them.

(34m 2s)

> And as you add tiles back to the, like, main central tile of the town, it, like, shifts all of the other tiles.

(34m 14s)

> So that's the maze part, because sometimes it might make it, so, like, you can't go forward anymore, because there's a cliff now.

(34m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's, uh, it is, uh, okay, it reminds you of, you know, the slide puzzles, like little tile puzzles, like, I hate those to begin with, I'll be honest, but, uh, in this context, I like it a lot, because changing your layout with that and then, you know, changing paths, they lead, I like that a lot, actually, this, this, this, this one.

(34m 22s) **Codey:**

> And I think that's really interesting.

(34m 26s)

> Yes.

(34m 31s)

> Yes.

(34m 33s)

> Okay.

(34m 36s)

> Mm hmm.

(34m 41s)

> Mm hmm.

(34m 44s) **Kevin:**

> The art style is very cute.

(34m 47s)

> It's very plate.

(34m 48s)

> I don't have a better comparison point,

(34m 50s)

> but play school with the K, you know, the play school brand.

(34m 53s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(34m 54s) **Kevin:**

> That's what it feels like, but it's well done.

(34m 56s)

> It's not like infantile.

(34m 58s)

> It's just very cute and charming.

(35m)

> Those cows and goats are very cute.

(35m 3s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yep, yep demo is currently out. There is no release date, but some to keep your eye on for sure

(35m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Demos out now.

(35m 5s)

> Oh, I'm in on this game.

(35m 7s)

> I am in.

(35m 14s)

> - Absolutely.

(35m 15s)

> I'm...

(35m 16s)

> Yeah, I'm on board for this one.

(35m 19s)

> Yeah.

(35m 20s)

> All right.

(35m 21s)

> I posted the art of Maisie Mouse.

(35m 23s) **Codey:**

> Cool

(35m 26s)

> Okay, we've made it 36 minutes

(35m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, good.

(35m 28s)

> Oh, good heavens.

## Games Of The Other Years

(35m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Now, 36 hours, buckle up, buckaroos.

(35m 33s) **Codey:**

> Oh

(35m 36s) **Kevin:**

> All right, here's the question.

(35m 37s)

> Do you wanna go backwards or forwards?

(35m 39s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, we know we go we go 98 let's hit 96 we go scroll to the bottom

(35m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, god. Oh, yeah.

(35m 45s) **Codey:**

> I want to do it that way

(35m 47s) **Kevin:**

> All right. Okay. Yes.

(35m 47s) **Codey:**

> That also makes more sense because some of these things are remakes or sequels or whatever so

(35m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, 96 harvest moon. You get the extra special crown because you're the winner by default.

## 1996

(35m 59s) **Kevin:**

> There's no other for in game. Also, there was no farming game ever really.

(36m 1s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(36m 3s) **Kevin:**

> So and everyone's kind of just leaching off you.

(36m 4s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(36m 7s) **Kevin:**

> So you get an extra shiny crown. Good for you, harvest moon.

(36m 9s) **Codey:**

> Yep. So, I like, so they said on the like Wikipedia or whatever it said that it's considered by some to be the first cozy game and it linked to this inverse article. And I just really liked this quote. So what would make Harvest Moon work? He thought he being the like guy that made

(36m 9s) **Kevin:**

> It's the SNES edition, the one we Al and I played forever ago.

(36m 31s) **Codey:**

> was pacing. Crucial to any work of entertainment was a good mixture of pace. If something demands your attention constantly, it's easy to get overwhelmed or tired, but if it's too glacial, it's easy to get distracted. Having a mix of the two is what makes something enjoyable to be at a movie or a game.

(36m 48s)

> And I think that that is a really good, honestly, that is like what is good about some farming games and others being like too much.

(36m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I agree. It's a genius insight and to kind of knock it out of it because that that aspect specifically the pacing um, I think Harvest Moon does it quite well on the original Harvest Moon um and and honestly like

(37m 3s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah.

(37m 12s) **Kevin:**

> As someone who tried it um

(37m 14s)

> So much of the DNA the bones of the entire genre are there. It's wild. They have the hot springs for Pete's sake

(37m 19s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(37m 22s) **Kevin:**

> um, you know It's a shame it has a two I don't inventory slot but but other than that it had a lot going for it. So I I definitely tip my hat towards harvest moon

(37m 37s)

> Consider it did it first and did it all that

(37m 41s)

> Yeah, well a well-deserved game of the year for 1996 good for you harvest moon

(37m 47s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, 1997, Harvest Moon Game Boy.

## 1997

(37m 53s) **Codey:**

> And someone said with that,

(37m 55s)

> it's just without the dating aspects of the initial game and with only a few mini quests to play through,

(38m 1s)

> Harvest Moon Game Boy color is a lightweight version of a feathery game.

(38m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that I mean a crown by default because whatever, but that's rough though

(38m 12s) **Codey:**

> I doesn't have to be. We don't have to give a crown.

(38m 15s) **Kevin:**

> So what do who do who gets the crap?

(38m 17s) **Codey:**

> No one, no crown awarded. Uh, that's that's we could do that or I mean, I guess it's up to you.

(38m 21s) **Kevin:**

> I Guess well here because here's the thing like that's rough like it's the game boy you had Pokemon on it, right?

(38m 30s)

> Like it could handle a sizable-ish Gabe, at least for the time.

(38m 35s)

> I... I... I had some...

(38m 36s)

> I think I'm the snest addition, I think you could translate that. Um, so that's kind of rough. Um, that, yeah.

(38m 40s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I mean, I think it should still win because it brought harvest moon to handheld

(38m 47s) **Kevin:**

> It did. I thought I was, but that was my next point actually, like, but the handheld thing, that's always a big leap. Um, especially back in '97. Um, so, all right, sure, good enough.

(39m)

> Um, all right, you get a crown harvest from a GB for '97.

## 1998

(39m 4s) **Kevin:**

> 1998

(39m 7s)

> So many good games came out this year. On that year, we had got Ocarina of time and all sorts of other things. Yeah, 98 wasn't saying year for gaming. I'd have to go back and see

(39m 14s) **Codey:**

> Oh, I didn't know.

(39m 17s)

> Oh, well, then that's, I mean, no other, no one was playing any other game, right?

(39m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, so So since we had no other actual harvest moon to college core game. We are occurring at time. You have the correct I don't

(39m 32s)

> But um, was there was there was there any farming in hockey and I'm trying to think I don't

(39m 36s)

> think there was no there's fishing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go there you go this is our ocarina specifically the fishing yeah okay 99 all right now we're starting to get some you know contenders um consideration um okay because we got a triple threat of harvest moon um we have

(39m 37s) **Codey:**

> No, there's phishing. Yeah, there's the phishing which I spent a good amount of time

(39m 43s)

> phishing it there, so

(39m 46s)

> Yeah

(39m 48s)

> Yeah, so no no winner in 98

## 1999

(40m 6s) **Kevin:**

> harvest moon 64 harvest moon to game boy color and harvest moon back to nature

(40m 14s)

> wait the PSP didn't exist in 99 did it

(40m 16s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I think I might be PSP might have been like it might have been re released or something for PSP later, but that was something that

(40m 22s) **Kevin:**

> a root yeah yeah yeah

(40m 28s) **Codey:**

> That it mentioned so

(40m 30s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(40m 31s)

> - Um, okay.

(40m 31s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so here's where I started when I started making notes I was like how are we gonna like if I've I've never played any any of these so how how are how am I gonna judge them?

(40m 41s)

> right. So I started adding things like Metacritic score. So Metacritic is something that takes all of the different critical scores for game and kind of like combine them into a score. It's not just an average. I think it like waits things differently. So both Harvest Moon 64 and Harvest Moon 2 on the Game Boy color had 78% and back to nature had 82. So there's that. Also these games differed in different ways. So Harvest Moon 64 updated the previous one by having a

(41m 16s)

> limited amount of time to work in any given day and a limited amount of stamina to work. Harvest Moon 2 Game Boy color is you're able to build a sheep pen and by sheep. You can build a greenhouse. You can walk around the town, which walking around the town apparently you couldn't do that in the first one. Oh, well, they said that it's that's oh not in the Harvest Moon Game Boy color. Yeah.

(41m 31s) **Kevin:**

> good one. You could, you absolutely good. Oh, game original game boy. I'm sorry, game I just think it was, oh, maybe not. I don't know. I didn't think about that. No. Oh, I can't.

(41m 46s) **Codey:**

> The whole is that you have 3 years to get your farm going. Return to nature. They didn't really explain. There wasn't really like anything that explained what back to nature return to nature meant. And so I think it's because you you like when you were at the farm visiting your grandparents when you were a kid and then you went away and then later you come back. So I think you're returning to like a way out of the city to come to like whatever the country.

(42m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(42m 16s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so these are the 3 options. We got Nintendo 64 Game Boy color and PlayStation 3 different games. What do you think?

(42m 27s) **Kevin:**

> um this is a tough call um g how should I put this the gbc version looks exactly like in my mind what I picture just looking at screenshots and whatever um which is kind of appealing to me

(42m 37s) **Codey:**

> Oh

(42m 42s) **Kevin:**

> um I guess if they're in nostalgia like game boy color feel um but I i don't know how it plays right like there's horses there's sheep pens there's there's an animal pen it looks like it It has, you know, unlike the first version, it has the-

(42m 57s)

> Me and potatoes of a farming game. So I am tempted because of the portability.

(43m 3s)

> But shockingly, as someone who didn't play PlayStation or in '64, I kind of like back to nature, the visuals.

(43m 12s)

> Both '64 and back to nature have like an isometric, they're 3D-ish, but back to nature feels a little more 3D.

(43m 22s)

> Like, I see some cows that look almost a little flat on the-

(43m 27s)

> 64 version, but they look a little more 3D on the playstation, so yeah, I don't know something about the visuals on the playstation. Maybe just because everything feels a little rounder, that looks a little more charming, but I don't know, but I say that, but GBC look tempting because that looks like a solid classic retro portable farming game. What are your thoughts, Cody?

(43m 52s) **Codey:**

> Well, I'm going 64, I'm just going 64.

(43m 53s) **Kevin:**

> No, oh, oh the one I was

(43m 57s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so I feel like Nintendo is where Harvest Moon belongs.

(44m 6s)

> And also just like back to nature, I don't know,

(44m 9s)

> it just seemed like that, that idea of coming back or whatever, I think that was what the previous ones did.

(44m 15s)

> So it just didn't seem like it was doing anything different.

(44m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah Yeah, but also, you know, something about the Metacritic store, right? You got to think about the I think the context of the time, right?

(44m 19s) **Codey:**

> It does have the highest metacritic score,

(44m 22s)

> and only I think I'd go for 64.

(44m 31s) **Kevin:**

> This was back in a day when graphics were like, oh, everyone was all about the graphics and and whatnot. So I can see that slanting it

(44m 40s)

> The horse looks very charming in 64. I'll say that. Oh

(44m 45s)

> I'm not too terribly

(44m 47s)

> I don't know how well to play so it's hard to argue for I'm willing to give it to 64

(44m 54s) **Codey:**

> Okay, cool. Or it could be a tie tie between 64 and back to nature. We could do that too.

(44m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's fine. 64 you get the grant

(45m 1s)

> I didn't have PlayStation, so you know, I'm gonna get 64 because I could have played that one

(45m 7s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

## 2000

(45m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, all right now we're get to the good

(45m 14s)

> thousand the progressive news

(45m 17s)

> millennium we get as you was at your quote or is that al okay? Oh? Yeah

(45m 22s) **Codey:**

> Yep, it's the year of boy or girl.

(45m 27s)

> New millennium, women exist, which is awesome.

(45m 32s)

> But I still don't love it. So, I mean, one of them is two harvest moon games. One of them is Harvest Moon 3 Game Boy Color, but there's also Harvest Moon 4 Girl, which is literally just back to nature, but you can play as a girl.

(45m 50s)

> But Harvest Moon 3 GBC.

(45m 52s)

> If you get a different story based on who you choose, so here it says the boys is a successful rancher living on the farm from Harvest Moon 2 GBC who was asked by the mayor to help a girl on a nearby island run the farm of her father.

(45m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, which is wild, but okay.

(46m 13s) **Codey:**

> Or the girl's beginning is she shows up and she's trying to save Harry's farm by taking control of it.

(46m 20s) **Kevin:**

> ha ha ha ha oh you know what I kind of like it I kind of dig it okay first of all the boy like making it like cannon sequel and he's established and helping out someone else I think that's pretty cool actually um uh the the girl character that's wild that's story but I also kind of digging because it's so wild I kind of dig it yeah

(46m 23s) **Codey:**

> I'm like what?

(46m 32s)

> Yeah, I yeah

(46m 42s)

> It's like, here we are, it's the year 2000 women are here and we are taking what's ours.

(46m 50s) **Kevin:**

> yeah um also let's you know note they're both selectable right one unlike the for girl um

(46m 57s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm Yeah, four girl. You're just the girl. Sorry

(46m 58s) **Kevin:**

> on the back the nature so yeah so I mean I think there's this a clear winner for for three GBC

(47m 8s) **Codey:**

> Now. Yep.

(47m 9s) **Kevin:**

> that that's a wild thoughts and the ideas I like that a lot why am I oh my gosh Stardew 2.

(47m 17s)

> What if you run with it?

(47m 20s)

> Oh, I love seeing continuity, right?

(47m 23s)

> Like between games, like their time passage, that's cool stuff.

(47m 28s)

> Okay.

(47m 29s)

> So congratulations, since you get a current Harvest Moon through GBC.

## 2001

(47m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, 2001.

(47m 37s)

> Okay.

> Wow, PS2 is already out then.

(47m 46s)

> or and okay this is

(47m 51s)

> genre talk baby are we doing farming game or cottagecore because animal crossing original

(47m 57s)

> or at least in the states there are the non-Japan areas dropped in 2001 for the game and cube

(47m 59s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(48m 6s) **Kevin:**

> we didn't keep wasn't listed on the other ones they didn't 64 version but whatever I won't you know lost in the weeds um so animal crossing did you play original animal crossing Cody

(48m 17s) **Codey:**

> Yep, I think it's I think it's animal crossing. I don't even we don't really need to say anything else. The one thing that I love about this animal crossing that is not in any other animal crossing is the police station.

(48m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(48m 20s)

> Okay.

(48m 21s)

> Um, so I mean, it's animal crossing.

(48m 26s)

[laughing]

(48m 28s)

> It, yup.

(48m 29s)

> You, yup.

(48m 34s)

> It's the police station, it's so good.

(48m 36s)

> Copper and Booker were excellent.

(48m 37s) **Codey:**

> Copper and Booker and like their names are just so good.

(48m 40s) **Kevin:**

> And the fact that got, it's incredible.

(48m 44s)

> And then it kills me that they were delegated to other stuff later on.

(48m 48s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I

(48m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Like, what, what was the last time

(48m 50s)

> of "I don't even remember"?

(48m 51s) **Codey:**

> I don't know But there's like in the in the police station. There's a lost and found so you just like go

(48m 51s) **Kevin:**

> They were in, uh...

(48m 53s)

> Uh...

(48m 59s) **Codey:**

> It's just like are any of these items yours and you can go through and just take like everything and they're just kind of like I

(49m 6s)

> Remember it being them being like oh, okay, I guess you've lost a lot or something like that

(49m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Well I recall they were two because the copper and book are like one was day one was night and they had distinct personalities, right?

(49m 16s) **Codey:**

> Right

(49m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Booker was like that. He was the chai kind of timid guy copper. I fire a call correctly. He was like, all right I'm so you better be telling the truth with a glare the stink guy

(49m 19s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(49m 26s)

> Yeah, I think they like walk they like follow you while you're doing it to if I remember correct remember correctly

(49m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, they do. Yeah

(49m 33s) **Codey:**

> This is also resetty really hit hard

(49m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, proper he said he ah

(49m 41s)

> There's fake outs that we do remember that

(49m 41s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so it was if you

(49m 44s)

> If you yeah, or he just would like pop up and you're like but I saved but yeah resetty would show up if you forgot to save and you quit and you quit or whatever and he would just for like five minutes he was just like you need to save and he would just like you're like okay fine it's just so

(50m 11s) **Kevin:**

> These days ah good times good times

(50m 13s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yep.

(50m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'm a car thing. This is great a lot of limitations. Boy those closets with only three items

(50m 20s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yep.

(50m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm, yeah to dedicate a whole basement to inventory

(50m 26s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(50m 27s) **Kevin:**

> But

(50m 28s) **Codey:**

> It was at that one as well that had all of the SNES games that you could play.

(50m 32s) **Kevin:**

> It did yes, yep

(50m 33s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(50m 35s)

> It was good.

(50m 35s) **Kevin:**

> That was fun. It's crazy have the emulator and I'm crossing but

(50m 38s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, you basically had an emulator Animal Crossing.

(50m 40s)

> I don't know if later ones did that.

(50m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Ah Some of them did yeah

(50m 46s)

> Ah, okay, so that's and I mean yeah, it's animal crossing everything all the staples are there your fishing your bugs or neighbors

(50m 53s)

> Oh, you had the hat with the horns or if you're the girl the cone wizard hat for God. Yeah, you have limited looks. No hair. Oh, that's good. Good times

(50m 59s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(51m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, you're the tree the big tree the with the wishing well, yeah, okay

(51m 9s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(51m 11s) **Kevin:**

> All right, memory lane, okay off that off that harvest moon save the homeland ps2

(51m 17s) **Codey:**

> Nope

(51m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Boy talk about a visual like

(51m 20s)

> Upgrade like we're seeing some defined features on these character models look in a little more anime e

(51m 29s)

> The box arts kind of funny because the it's gone from cutesy like I mean so cutesy But the he he's more like fully proportioned now. They they the protecting this he feels

(51m 41s)

> Like late 90s early 2000 anime. That's what I'm looking at here

(51m 44s) **Codey:**

> Hey, that's not a bad thing.

(51m 46s) **Kevin:**

> And that's what the game Yeah, that's what the game kind of feels like all of those cows are so cute

(51m 53s)

> Okay, so now the question

(51m 58s)

> Do we Cuz harvest moon like I'm sure it's still

(52m 3s)

> It's just harvest mooning, you know, I'm not I'm not feeling it's any great innovations here

(52m 9s)

> But amocross me

(52m 11s)

> It's cottage core of course, but is it okay? I'm pretty amocrossing. Yeah. Alright look alright because I'm just saying because the episode or oh game of the years I thought was farming game of the years. Okay. Whatever never mind. All right fine. And of course

(52m 12s) **Codey:**

> Oh, there's no there's no contest. This is a normal crossing. There's no contest. Yeah

(52m 25s)

> I think we're going based on where we're going with the games Al gave us and if those are the games Al gave us a animal crossing the end

(52m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine fine fine. All right animal crossing you win this year. That's fine. Okay, 2002

## 2002

(52m 37s) **Kevin:**

> So that was 2001, going to 2002, uh, nothing.

(52m 41s)

> You got nothing. So no, no, no, I can't think of a 2002 release off the top of my head, so nothing gets it.

## 2003

(52m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Um, 2003. Uh, okay. Ooh, ooh, we got some kit. Well, um, all right, this is it.

(52m 56s)

> This is when farming games really hit the States, because this is where a lot of people pick it up, right?

(53m 1s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(53m 2s) **Kevin:**

> We have, gosh, these were all this year and one year. Friends of Mineral Town, original for the GPA, wonderful life, original for the GameCube.

(53m 11s)

> And more friends of Mineral Town, the girl version for girls, um, because they were still doing that. Okay, even though GBC had already gotten rid of that, but we went back to it. Okay, good to know.

(53m 23s) **Codey:**

> Yeah I played a wonderful life so I mean I think that that one's gonna win anyways I really liked a wonderful life and they say here that it begins you move to the city you move from the city to inherit an abandoned farm and forget me not Valley and a man named Takakura provides them a house and seeds in Calvary. Thank you, Dr. Cura.

(53m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Um, okay. Have you played any of these Cody? Okay, I played it too, so I win.

(53m 43s)

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(53m 54s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, and what girl did you go for in this one?

(53m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Um, uh, Zylia, oh, yeah, 'cause, yeah, I mean, it was first ever video game wife.

(54m) **Codey:**

> Yeah, same.

(54m 2s)

> The one that was nice.

(54m 7s) **Kevin:**

> So, you know, yeah, there you go.

(54m 7s) **Codey:**

> Oh, there you go. Never forget your first.

(54m 11s)

> So the Friends of Mineral Town and the More Friends of Mineral Town.

(54m 15s)

> They have different stories based on between you choose.

(54m 18s)

> So the Friends of Mineral Town.

(54m 20s)

> Um, this would basically, it's not your grand.

(54m 23s)

> The grand father, it's just that like you went to mineral town as a kid and you met this old guy and you like helped him out while you're in mineral town or whatever.

(54m 32s)

> And then when you moved away into the city, you wrote letters to this guy and then one day the letter stop.

(54m 38s)

> And then you go back to see if he's okay and you find out that he died and his farm is run down and you decide to like pick it back up, which is.

(54m 43s) **Kevin:**

> - That's a jump.

(54m 48s) **Codey:**

> That's that hurts my heart, but whatever the girl version more friends of mineral

(54m 53s)

> town, you, the player starts in the city and they're reading their newspaper. She seeds in season advertisement for a beautiful farm and excited by the prospect of rural life decides to buy it. Because girls clearly would not have fun as a kid.

(54m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Why change the beginning?

(55m 8s)

> Why?

(55m 11s)

> With their grandpa or whatever and you went there, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

(55m 11s) **Codey:**

> Hoping, not their greats, not their grandpa, just a random guy. Yeah, I don't know, but if they changed it. So I love the idea of she sees an ad for abuse.

(55m 22s) **Kevin:**

> yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, let's get it.

(55m 23s) **Codey:**

> And she gets there and it's just like a honka junk. And she's like, what?

(55m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean, I did a whole episode of Micah about it while I love that game.

(55m 31s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, no, uh, wonderful life gets it.

(55m 37s) **Kevin:**

> The remake carries a lot of the spirits, so go listen to that episode of you on my thoughts.

(55m 41s)

> You, you're dying that game and that game ends you win, that's, that's rough.

(55m 44s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(55m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Um, okay, so the clear winner, uh, 2004, uh, by default for a second year running, yeah,

## 2004

(55m 57s) **Kevin:**

> of wonderful life.

(55m 59s)

> The girl of origin is not known as at the remake.

(56m 6s) **Codey:**

> No, I think the remake is the one that added the girl version. This didn't have a girl version. It just makes means it just is that you can now have a daughter instead of only having a son

(56m 18s)

> You can marry Lumina and you can now continue playing after you die

(56m 27s) **Kevin:**

> although, ha ha ha ha ha.

(56m 31s)

> Towing the line to say the least.

(56m 33s) **Codey:**

> I don't know. I personally know when her this year. This is kind of yikes to me.

(56m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Like, mmm, yeah.

(56m 37s)

> Okay.

(56m 39s)

> Yeah.

(56m 40s)

> Yeah.

(56m 42s)

> Just get, it's two sketch.

(56m 44s)

> Okay, okay.

(56m 45s)

> Here's, okay, for listeners who don't know it in listen,

(56m 49s)

> I'm just gonna break it down.

(56m 51s)

> Lumenau was a character in the original.

(56m 55s)

> She was, I guess, grandpa.

(56m 57s)

> She was very clearly a child model, very young.

(57m 2s) **Codey:**

> Very young.

(57m 6s) **Kevin:**

> I think they have this version where you can end up marrying her.

(57m 13s)

> I'm guessing the implication was that she was, you know, early teens,

(57m 17s)

> but the model doesn't reflect that.

(57m 19s)

> They didn't change it.

(57m 20s)

> So it's just very sketch looking.

(57m 23s)

> And that's a very, very generous interpretation, right?

(57m 27s)

> So, you know, that's fair.

(57m 30s)

> Yeah, it's, that's a rough one.

(57m 33s)

> But, okay, no winner.

(57m 35s) **Codey:**

> No winner. No winner. That's my vote

(57m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(57m 38s)

> Sure, that's fine.

(57m 39s)

> Yeah, it's, that's rough.

(57m 41s)

> Okay.

(57m 43s)

> Let's go to 2005.

## 2005

(57m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Harvest Moon DS.

(57m 50s)

> Okay, I'm trying to remember now.

(57m 53s)

> Is this one the hands changed I think?

(57m 57s)

> I think it might be.

(57m 58s) **Codey:**

> in the what chain? Oh, no, no, no, no, I have that later. That was actually 2014.

(58m) **Kevin:**

> No.

(58m 1s)

> Okay.

(58m 2s)

> Are you serious?

(58m 5s)

> Holy moly.

(58m 7s) **Codey:**

> Explain what you're talking about though.

(58m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Wow.

(58m 8s)

> My time.

(58m 9s)

> Well, just we all know because the original owners of the harvest moon branded from Japan.

(58m 18s)

> Was it not to me?

(58m 19s)

> That was the Japanese company.

(58m 20s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, so it's not too many ink.

(58m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(58m 23s)

> Yeah, they basically, when they got it to the porta, they gave away the rights to the name eventually basically, which is the most baffling decision ever.

(58m 32s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so it was the word story of season games and then at one point they are no longer story of season games

(58m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, all the, all the harvest moons you've been discussing are quote, unquote, story of seasons at this point, um, and then later they, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, not too many was the, um, I can't, anyways, I have to look up the names because I'm getting all mixed up, but anyways, this is still original brand. Okay, marvelous. That's what it is. Yeah.

(58m 46s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, they split so that harvest moon is distinct from story of season

(59m 1s)

> Yeah, so the new one is marvelous. The new one is marvelous and X seed I think is the thing, but yeah

(59m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's the thing because they changed names too, right? Because that's it. Maybe Kimix

(59m 11s)

> said, yeah. Um, anyways, but that's later. We're not there yet. You know, I thought we were, but okay, Harvest Moon DS. Um, and they forget me, not Valley. Um,

(59m 23s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but instead of like it being your grandfather or one of your friends farms or whatever It's just that you are a young man named Pete who lives with his friend Takakura on a farm and forget me not Valley

(59m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Well, well first of all, hey, you got you have a name. That's a first, but yeah, it looks pretty much just like a DS flattened version of wonderful life because that's forget me. Not valid. It's the same village and looking at the map. It looks to be pretty much the same identical map. So

(59m 36s) **Codey:**

> They were room they were roommates

(1h) **Kevin:**

> There you go points off for not using

(1h 5s)

> the naming conventions of the time which was to come up with a sub title of DNS in it

(1h 10s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(1h 11s) **Kevin:**

> So just but but you know

(1h 15s)

> It was a do okay, but that's harvesque. Yes, just the S version of wonderful. I I never played it So I can't commit to the comment on the quality, but we also get

(1h 21s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yep. Are you ready for this?

(1h 27s) **Kevin:**

> Because at least

(1h 30s)

> It's baffling to me like is this is this like a red and blue idea

(1h 35s)

> of we make the girl version separate will double the sale I don't know what it is but we have our best moon DS cute the girl version you go ahead Cody take it away

(1h 41s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(1h 44s)

> Okay.

(1h 47s)

> But oh boy, so before up until this point,

(1h 50s)

> I had been writing the notes and kind of like giving it a blurb.

(1h 54s)

> But I saw this, I was like, I'm just gonna read this.

(1h 59s)

> Okay.

(1h 1m)

> In this game, the player's mother sends a wish to the harvest goddess that they may become a successful farmer.

(1h 1m 8s)

> The harvest goddess eventually determines the player has no

(1h 1m 11s)

> work ethic and tells the harvest king what she thinks. The harvest king angrily tells the harvest goddess she isn't trying hard enough and she's slacking off in her old age.

(1h 1m 23s)

> The harvest goddess then calls the harvest king a big baldie and is turned into stone.

(1h 1m 29s)

> The harvest sprites defend the harvest goddess which angers the goddess the harvest king even more and he sends the harvest sprites and the goddess to another world as punishment But he realizes his mistakes.

(1h 1m 41s)

> He is gone too far.

(1h 1m 44s)

> He then writes a letter to the player and sends the witch princess to deliver it, telling them that if they work hard as a farmer, it will bring back the harvest sprites and the harvest goddess.

(1h 1m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, so, you know, for girls, I'd get that misogyny in there.

(1h 1m 59s) **Codey:**

> What a frickin' what a like drama.

(1h 2m 6s)

> Like why does it have to be drama?

(1h 2m 8s)

> Like the boy version is just, I'm with my friend on a

(1h 2m 11s)

> farm and the girl version, they have to make this dramatic woman's spurned turn to stone sent elsewhere.

(1h 2m 22s)

> Husband feels bad, goes to the send it back.

(1h 2m 25s)

> I don't know if the harvest goddess and the harvest king are spouses, but like it's just what?

(1h 2m 31s)

> What?

(1h 2m 32s)

> It's not.

(1h 2m 33s)

> That's a lot.

(1h 2m 34s) **Kevin:**

> that's wild. Okay, and then on a considerably less wild note, we have Harvest Moon magical melody for the game. The Wii was out in 2005 already? That's 2006. Okay, or did it come out on Wii? Maybe it came in on Wii, regardless. Yeah,

(1h 2m 34s) **Codey:**

> There's that.

(1h 2m 51s)

> It might as like the next year or something.

(1h 2m 53s) **Kevin:**

> that's what I'm thinking. To wake the harvest goddess and marry one of the townspeople, the player must gather musical notes by finishing various chores in milestones.

(1h 3m 4s)

> I don't get it, but okay. You can't marry until you get the notes. As one does.

(1h 3m 5s) **Codey:**

> because music, I think this was like around the time that like rock band and guitar hero were like becoming a thing. And so they were like, oh, we got to make music. It's got to be music themed.

(1h 3m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 3m 18s)

> They're just writing

(1h 3m 21s)

> Writing the the just hopping on that train. Okay. Okay. Um

(1h 3m 28s)

> Okay, so I I didn't play this one. I can't speak to it, but

(1h 3m 33s)

> Apparently there's a pet pig. It's that's mm. That's it's a strong. That's a strong point in this favor. I'll say that

(1h 3m 36s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(1h 3m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so how 11 battles matter its each?

(1h 3m 46s)

> That's a lot, wow.

(1h 3m 48s) **Codey:**

> too many options. There's two more. There's also Harvus Moon, an update and a port of Back to Nature, Harvus Moon, Boy, and Girl. That was out on the PSP this year. And Animal Crossing Wild World is on the DS. And this is all I can say about this one is Sphere. This one instead of like...

(1h 3m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Is that, yeah.

(1h 3m 50s)

> All right, we'll be giving it to.

(1h 3m 52s)

> I haven't planted these.

(1h 3m 54s)

> Oh, wait, oh gosh, you're right.

(1h 3m 55s)

> I didn't see the list.

(1h 3m 56s)

> Oh, oh goodness.

(1h 4m 1s)

> Boy and girl, they come together at last.

(1h 4m 18s) **Codey:**

> having a block and then you go to the edge of the screen to like go to the next block or whatever.

(1h 4m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Tiles. That was an acre system. They were tiles. Yeah

(1h 4m 25s) **Codey:**

> The tiles, yeah.

(1h 4m 26s)

> Yeah.

(1h 4m 27s)

> Instead of that, it's just a sphere.

(1h 4m 30s)

> You're running...

(1h 4m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Smooth world

(1h 4m 31s) **Codey:**

> I didn't like that.

(1h 4m 33s)

> So I did not like it.

(1h 4m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Didn't like it. Yeah, I mean

(1h 4m 35s) **Codey:**

> So despite the fact that I want to give it to a wild world, I don't...

(1h 4m 39s)

> In good conscience, I can't.

(1h 4m 41s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, well, I mean, while well, for most of those series,

(1h 4m 46s)

> dental crossings are just straight upgrades, right?

(1h 4m 49s)

> So, but so, you know, again, same animal crossing.

(1h 4m 53s)

> It did add a lot.

(1h 4m 55s)

> You actually had inventory in that game.

(1h 5m)

> You could make patterns on clothing and tiles on the floor.

(1h 5m 3s) **Codey:**

> Oh yeah, I remember that.

(1h 5m 8s) **Kevin:**

> introduce the trauma-inducing tarantula.

(1h 5m 11s)

> It's just squirpy and that would knock you out, so on and so forth.

(1h 5m 16s)

> I mean, it's good to fall at work, I say I'm crossing just more ammo crossing better.

(1h 5m 21s)

> That's the game.

(1h 5m 22s)

> Oh, so who do we give it to?

(1h 5m 24s)

> Because while worlds the only one I played, so, you know, impartially that's what I'd give it to, I guess, but I'd rather give it to wild world than anyone else, yeah.

(1h 5m 28s) **Codey:**

> I mean if you if you want to give it to them, that's fine. I would also be fine to just say no

(1h 5m 36s)

> No winner There you go, then we're gonna give it to

(1h 5m 42s) **Kevin:**

> I wish I'd like to go back to these harvest moons and revise it just because I didn't even, magical melody has peaked my interest, just because I don't know, okay, game cubits that feel, of a wonderful life, yeah, but okay, all right, we'll give it to wild world because sure why not, um, 2006, oh, yeah, we only got one entry here and that is room factory for the DS and.

## 2006

(1h 6m 11s) **Kevin:**

> And technically at that time, it was in fact the harvest moon, like, or.

(1h 6m 16s)

> Room factory, a fantasy harvest moon, the, the, the, the, the path split here, the new timeline was introduced with the.

(1h 6m 26s) **Codey:**

> Oh, no, this is a completely different game series.

(1h 6m 27s) **Kevin:**

> No, yeah, I know I just mean like world, like the world wise, like here we go down a different path.

(1h 6m 30s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(1h 6m 34s)

> Yep, people get to choose a new, a new branch.

(1h 6m 34s) **Kevin:**

> You can go story seasons or room factory.

(1h 6m 37s)

> Yeah.

(1h 6m 38s)

> Uh, yeah, it's, it's

(1h 6m 41s)

> it's hard with his moon, but there's some combat and monsters and stuff. Um, yeah. Um, I actually need to play it. I've never played new original. I haven't played any hard run factory.

(1h 6m 44s) **Codey:**

> It's fun to see.

(1h 6m 51s)

> I also haven't played any room factory.

(1h 6m 52s)

> We totally should and do it as like a second harvest.

(1h 6m 56s)

> Like people who hadn't played room factory.

(1h 6m 57s) **Kevin:**

> first service yeah yeah because I don't yeah I've wanted to I just I don't never get to it but um oh okay I want to give it to it because room factory has stayed it is a franchise now um and and I think at the time the idea but hey what do we have harvest movement with some combat and some more you know stuff like you know that was uh that was a decent idea um okay let's go out to

(1h 6m 59s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, exactly.

(1h 7m 9s)

> - Yeah.

(1h 7m 11s)

> - You can do that.

(1h 7m 17s)

> - We have Harvest Moon at home.

## 2007

(1h 7m 27s) **Kevin:**

> what is oh my gosh what is this title 2007 harvest moon ds colon island of happiness dash ds the second dish no oh I thought that was a title I don't know I was reading that I just my brain no you did that for all of them my brain just I just it took as a title okay island of happiness I apologize um yeah okay All right, let's see here. Take it away, Cody.

(1h 7m 31s) **Codey:**

> - Oh, sorry, the dash DS is me saying that it was on the DS.

(1h 7m 41s)

> No, dude, sorry.

(1h 7m 50s)

> still an interesting title.

(1h 7m 56s)

> Oh yeah, so this is where we started at the point where I'm like, what are even these games?

(1h 8m 2s)

> Well, I like, looked up what they are.

(1h 8m 5s)

> This one has a Metacritic score of 65,

(1h 8m 7s)

> and it says in the beginning,

(1h 8m 8s)

> the player, if you choose male, it's Mark,

(1h 8m 11s)

> female, is Chelsea.

(1h 8m 13s)

> The character that you don't choose will later appear.

(1h 8m 17s)

> Whoever you are, you're shipwrecked with a family of four and you end up

(1h 8m 20s)

> on a deserted island, there seems to be signs of past life on the island, but no one knows what happened.

(1h 8m 26s)

> So I guess you've figured that out throughout the game, I don't know.

(1h 8m 31s)

> There was, at the time, a review by someone in Australia, Tracy Lean of Hyper.

(1h 8m 36s)

> She commended the game for bringing, quote, "back the addictive elements from previous games."

(1h 8m 40s)

> However, she criticized the, quote, "clumsy control system" that makes even the most basic of tasks feel like a chore.

(1h 8m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Oof, that's rough.

(1h 8m 50s) **Codey:**

> So it's because it required you to use the touch screen to move and to interact with things.

(1h 8m 56s)

> So you'd have to use, like, have your stylus on the, this is not capacitive touch.

(1h 9m 1s)

> This is, like, actually, like, you have to be putting force down on your touch screen to move around and then you'd click on, like, things to interact with them.

(1h 9m 5s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(1h 9m 14s) **Codey:**

> Especially if you've had your DS for a while that some of that got a little hard to do.

(1h 9m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Sure. Sure. Sure.

(1h 9m 21s) **Codey:**

> You're a while.

(1h 9m 24s) **Kevin:**

> That touch screen was either like top, not much fantastic stuff or it was rough.

(1h 9m 30s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah.

(1h 9m 30s) **Kevin:**

> There's very few in between. Um, okay.

(1h 9m 33s) **Codey:**

> Most of the time, if I had to take my stylus out,

(1h 9m 35s)

> I was frustrated.

(1h 9m 36s)

> I'm like, let me just play in here without doing that.

(1h 9m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm. Well, if you don't want to touch, what about waggling?

(1h 9m 44s)

> I don't know if waggling was in this game, but it is on the way.

(1h 9m 45s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(1h 9m 47s) **Kevin:**

> so there's a strong chance. Harvest smooth tree of

(1h 9m 49s) **Codey:**

> There you go.

(1h 9m 51s) **Kevin:**

> tranquility. The player cabin that's me or Angela moves to Waffle Island,

(1h 9m 57s)

> that's a good name, which was once enchanted, home to the deceased mother tree that was one sacred. After the harvest God's vanished, the island lost its connection with nature and its inhabitants do not know what to do. Metacritic score of 60 versus the 65 of Island of Happiness.

(1h 10m 13s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. I mean, I think, yeah, doing the whag line with the Wii, like having a Wii mo and having to move around, like, personally, that'd probably be my preferred.

(1h 10m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, you know, okay, you know what this is the weird thing, but over time, even back when it came out like

(1h 10m 28s)

> It wasn't even the waggle. It was the batteries of the we moat having constantly having to change them or or recharge them or whatever

(1h 10m 36s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah.

(1h 10m 36s) **Kevin:**

> That that got to me. That was the part that got me about the we but

(1h 10m 40s) **Codey:**

> Well, that's why you'd get the like crazy battery pack things that you'd put on it,

(1h 10m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 10m 45s) **Codey:**

> or you'd buy the rechargeable versions or whatever.

(1h 10m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, which I did do but

(1h 10m 52s)

> It was I don't know it just felt weird because you know I mean controls didn't have to deal with batteries before that really or or at least the ones I had dealt with

(1h 11m) **Codey:**

> Yeah, cuz they were all wired I

(1h 11m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, all right, so which one are we giving it to whoa?

(1h 11m 4s) **Codey:**

> Would give it to the tree of tranquility

(1h 11m 6s)

> The the DS version the DS game it I mean it's it's whatever, but I think the

(1h 11m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean

(1h 11m 13s) **Codey:**

> Having to do with the stuff on the touchscreen that I would have hated that so if I have to go with either of these I have I'm gonna go with tree of tranquility

(1h 11m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm.

(1h 11m 20s)

> I mean, I'm only in one of these games.

(1h 11m 22s)

> So yeah, we'll also give it to Trifchankood.

(1h 11m 23s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, we'll give it we'll actually give it to tree of tranquility because Kevin was in that game

(1h 11m 24s) **Kevin:**

[laughing]

(1h 11m 27s) **Codey:**

> And then you didn't tell me you were in a game.

(1h 11m 30s)

> And two.

(1h 11m 33s)

> Is there a Kevin character in overcoat?

(1h 11m 33s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, I'm also an overcooked, fun fact.

(1h 11m 39s)

> The dog, he's just like the onion king and his dog isn't in Kevin.

(1h 11m 41s) **Codey:**

> Oh my gosh.

(1h 11m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 11m 43s) **Codey:**

> That's so great.

(1h 11m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 11m 44s)

[laughing]

(1h 11m 47s)

> Okay.

(1h 11m 48s)

> So that's 2007.

(1h 11m 49s)

> Congratulations, Trifchankood quality.

(1h 11m 52s)

> And you know what, I don't know what it is,

(1h 11m 54s)

> but the setup of reviving is a sacred tree.

(1h 11m 56s)

> I don't know why it feels, I like the, yeah.

(1h 11m 59s) **Codey:**

> It feels good. Yeah, it feels good.

(1h 12m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

## 2008

(1h 12m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(1h 12m 2s)

> Oh boy.

(1h 12m 3s) **Codey:**

> Yep, yep, yep.

(1h 12m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Oh boy.

(1h 12m 4s)

> Big year, 2008.

(1h 12m 6s)

> We're getting into it folks.

(1h 12m 8s)

> Harvest Mundia's grand bazaar.

(1h 12m 11s)

> What's, whoa, was that Al's ghostly hand giving it the crown.

(1h 12m 12s) **Codey:**

> Do you want to just say all of them and then we can go back through?

(1h 12m 17s) **Kevin:**

> I'll put these, I guess, harvest moon DS, grand bazaar, harvest moon DS, sunshine islands.

(1h 12m 30s)

> We got two harvest moons on the DS, that's wild, as harvest moon DS, sunshine islands.

(1h 12m 36s)

> Harvest moon animal parade, animal crossing city folk, room factory two, room factory frontier and formula for the first. Excuse me.

(1h 12m 47s)

> I'm gonna go and reverse order what I just said. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Harvest. Oh my gosh.

(1h 12m 49s) **Codey:**

> Yep, I was gonna say we should we should do it reverse order because then it's like the one game of one thing

(1h 12m 59s)

> Like it just kind of makes sense

(1h 13m 3s) **Kevin:**

> It's just on the stuck on my tongue now because it said it's on each side. Farming simulator 2008, the first, the only, actually, no, there's only wheat. That's what you're saying. I get it.

(1h 13m 13s)

> Yeah, it's the first farming simulator, first realistic farming sim.

(1h 13m 17s)

> Only wheat as an option, which is kind of wild, but they were going for realism, so I guess they were dealing with a lot, sure.

(1h 13m 20s) **Codey:**

> Yep, you can only get wheat.

(1h 13m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Root, PC Gaming in 2008, oh man, Rune Factory Frontier on the Wii.

(1h 13m 32s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah.

(1h 13m 37s)

> So this is, sorry, my note is that it's shortly after the first game.

(1h 13m 37s) **Kevin:**

> > > No.

(1h 13m 41s) **Codey:**

> So this frontier, room factory frontier like takes picks up the story right after the first room factory and then room factory too is like several years after the first game.

(1h 13m 52s)

> So these games, it's like frontier is chronologically in the middle.

(1h 13m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, 'cause Run Factory 2 on the DS is several years after the first game set in the coast of the city of Alvarna, there's two parts of the story, first half of the game follows Kyle, I'm a serious man with a connection to the legendary dragon, fearsome FIE or some,

(1h 14m) **Codey:**

> Yep, yep.

(1h 14m 15s) **Kevin:**

> second half of the game features Kyle's child searching for their father after he disappears,

(1h 14m 20s)

> ooh, I like that, I like that a lot actually.

(1h 14m 22s) **Codey:**

> I like that but also the fact that it's like a fantasy game and the main character's name is Kyle

(1h 14m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's good. Okay, city folk, I played this one. Did you play city folk?

(1h 14m 28s) **Codey:**

> It's just kind of kind of stupid

(1h 14m 34s)

> Yep, I

(1h 14m 38s)

> Also played city folk

(1h 14m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Probably, well, is it my least favorite? It's one of my least favorite in the entry.

(1h 14m 43s) **Codey:**

> Oh

(1h 14m 45s) **Kevin:**

> I think it was just the wee battery thing again. I think that's it. I think that's it.

(1h 14m 48s) **Codey:**

> Oh, yeah

(1h 14m 52s) **Kevin:**

> It had the city, which was a cool idea of the separate place with all these shops that you could do,

(1h 14m 58s)

> um, wait, Zippert, he was added in this game, and he realized that probably

(1h 15m 1s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yeah, so I added I looked at this up like they added so many cool things in this game

(1h 15m 6s) **Kevin:**

> yeah, yeah.

(1h 15m 8s) **Codey:**

> The bug off Chameleon is in this was added in this name

(1h 15m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Nat, that was just added in that one of those in there before, that's crazy.

(1h 15m 16s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, they add ticks who polices your shoes. Yeah

(1h 15m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, man.

(1h 15m 21s)

> Oh, I love kicks, kicks is so good. I forgot to kick your right, because he was just literally,

(1h 15m 28s)

> and street boys shoes shine, but literally on the steps, waiting to shine your shoes and color them.

(1h 15m 28s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I just shoot

(1h 15m 31s)

> He just polishes your shoes.

(1h 15m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Gracie has her own store, Gracie Grace, where they introduce the credit card, because there's stuff like a bajillion bells to buy. Um, oh, my gosh. Oh, that was good stuff.

(1h 15m 45s)

> Um, cap and being a bus driver now. That's fun little change. Yeah, I got it to smash.

(1h 15m 51s)

> Um, yeah, city folk, adding stuff. I'm more crossing it. So I'm crossing it's still good overall.

(1h 15m 58s)

> Okay. Oh, a harvest moon animal parade. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I am afraid seek all, um, to tree of tranquility.

(1h 16m 3s) **Codey:**

> Okay, so there's all these harvest mitts.

(1h 16m 9s)

> So I think, yeah, I think the animal prays on the we.

(1h 16m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, that is correct. That is correct. Um, last entry in the series made by your shoe, uh,

(1h 16m 18s)

> Yasugito, Wada, the original creator. Um, that's kind of special. Um, and honest, okay, it's Give me a duty.

(1h 16m 28s)

> Oh, pardon me for this, but this one has a slightly sentimental place in my heart because my little brother Calvin. This was his first like farming game you play.

(1h 16m 35s) **Codey:**

> Aww.

(1h 16m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Um, and in the end of parade, living up to the name, it was like you could take care of all sorts of animals.

(1h 16m 42s)

> Um, and I had this very, very distinct memory, like it's, it's, it's sweet, but also like all, like I feel bad for him because he was so little and his, he had a cow die, like for the first time.

(1h 16m 53s) **Codey:**

> Mmm.

(1h 16m 54s) **Kevin:**

> And he just cried like one of those, he used real real little.

(1h 16m 58s)

> He just, you know, one of those real deep heart felt cries like not, not tantrum crying like he was sad.

(1h 17m 6s)

> Um, so I just remember that from Adam parade that was that gets me right in the fields every time.

(1h 17m 9s) **Codey:**

> So, no spoiler, does that remove it from the running, or does it make it stay in the running for...

(1h 17m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, no, that, oh, that puts it for front of the running for me.

(1h 17m 18s) **Codey:**

> Okay, okay, okay.

(1h 17m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, Harvest Moon via Sunshine Island.

(1h 17m 29s)

> You couldn't have done Destiny Sunshine or something. It was right there. You had one letter. All you need to do is a D.

(1h 17m 34s)

> But anyways,

(1h 17m 36s)

> Sequel to Island of Happiness on the DS.

(1h 17m 40s)

> Sequel, but there's...

(1h 17m 44s)

> Okay, sorry. Oh, I thought I was reading.

(1h 17m 47s)

> Okay, many years before the events of the game,

(1h 17m 50s)

> a powerful earthquake struck the Sunshine Islands,

(1h 17m 52s)

> causing them to sink to the ocean.

(1h 17m 54s)

> How are you getting them back up?

(1h 17m 56s)

> to get out. But that's what I want to know. But...

(1h 17m 58s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so I think that these islands are like separated or something. This might also

(1h 18m 3s)

> I'd be explaining something that happened in the island of happiness in the first game. I don't know, but

(1h 18m 10s)

> They they listened they heard that people hated the fact that all you had to do everything on the touch pad So they now used it they now added that you can use buttons for some of the actions So you have to move on the with you with the touch pad or whatever

(1h 18m 25s)

> But then you could push buttons to interact.

(1h 18m 28s)

> Which I don't know if that fixes it.

(1h 18m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, no, that's fair. Um, yeah, I don't know. I didn't play it. So

(1h 18m 38s)

> Um, all right. Let's just go to the next one. Uh, harvest food. I don't know what else to say. I Sunshine. I just didn't think I'm Mario Sunshine. That was a good game. It's probably not as good as sunshine

(1h 18m 41s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(1h 18m 44s)

> Yeah, now you're right.

(1h 18m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Harvest moon

(1h 18m 54s)

> Um, DS grand bazaar. Um, I like that game. He likes it a lot. The is owl reaching past us

(1h 19m) **Codey:**

> Well, so he likes he likes the story of seasons grand bazaar, which is the remake of this game

(1h 19m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wonder how it compares to the remake. Um,

(1h 19m 10s) **Codey:**

> Well, maybe because owl loves grand bazaar some stories seasons grand bazaar so much. Maybe he should he should jump back instead of second harvest. We should do like retro harvest

(1h 19m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd be down for that, but yeah, I haven't played it but clearly I like a lot and

(1h 19m 20s) **Codey:**

> So you and I could do a retro harvest of rain factory

(1h 19m 33s) **Kevin:**

> At least I should put this a wonderful life like it was almost one to one remake

(1h 19m 37s) **Codey:**

> yeah I also think that like they if I remember correctly they added like a lot of quality of life things to this game like to the newer version

(1h 19m 38s) **Kevin:**

> I think I'll said this one had a little more TLC, but it makes sense. This was a DS game, right?

(1h 19m 43s)

> like that was still 2D going to.

(1h 19m 46s)

> 3D and like that. That was a bigger jump.

(1h 19m 54s)

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, sorry, one second. Um, uh, so, okay, who, who gets the crown?

(1h 20m 3s) **Codey:**

> Uh, my vote would either be for Animal Crossing City folk or for Animal Parade.

(1h 20m 9s) **Kevin:**

> > > So I mean, city fog was good, but like I said,

(1h 20m 11s)

> it's one of my least favorite animal crossings,

(1h 20m 14s) **Codey:**

> It's, yeah.

(1h 20m 14s) **Kevin:**

> I think largely because the way the battery,

(1h 20m 17s)

> but I don't pray, I mean, I already said my thing,

(1h 20m 20s)

> but also a little more objectively.

(1h 20m 22s)

> The fact that it was the last one by Wada,

(1h 20m 25s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(1h 20m 26s) **Kevin:**

> I think that's a little special.

(1h 20m 27s)

> So I'm willing to give the crown to Anne parade.

(1h 20m 29s) **Codey:**

> Let's give it to Emma Brad.

(1h 20m 30s) **Kevin:**

> All right, Anne parade, winner of 2008.

(1h 20m 32s)

> That was actually a fierce year.

(1h 20m 34s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, there was some competition that year for sure.

(1h 20m 34s) **Kevin:**

> There were some contenders that year.

(1h 20m 37s)

> > > Yeah, actually.

## 2009

(1h 20m 39s) **Kevin:**

> 2009, we get a breather of sorts.

(1h 20m 42s)

> We get one harvest moon, one room factory,

(1h 20m 44s)

> and one farming simulator.

(1h 20m 47s)

> Farmings, let's get to 2010, sorry, I'm just scrolling.

(1h 20m 51s)

> No, wait, what?

(1h 20m 52s)

> Sorry, ignore me, ignore me.

(1h 20m 55s)

> Farming simulator 2009, PC, it's still farming simulator,

(1h 20m 57s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 20m 59s) **Kevin:**

> but now we get more crops, canola, why would that canola?

(1h 21m 1s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(1h 21m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Barley and corn, it's okay.

(1h 21m 6s) **Codey:**

> Can all this kind of a big thing, I don't know.

(1h 21m 7s) **Kevin:**

> No, it is just, I don't know.

(1h 21m 9s)

> When I think of crops like, you know, you would think you'd go to the tomatoes or potatoes,

(1h 21m 14s)

> you know, like the common ones.

(1h 21m 16s) **Codey:**

> I think those take like more, because like tomatoes and stuff, I think that they, you can't just like thrush them or whatever the way that you can with these other things. Like you can just

(1h 21m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 21m 28s) **Codey:**

> drive a truck over barley and wheat and canola and corn.

(1h 21m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you're right. You're right. That's probably actually it's just probably purely mechanical why that makes sense

(1h 21m 36s)

> um, okay Um, that's how yeah heart farming simulator

(1h 21m 42s)

> Harvest moon hero of leaf valley

(1h 21m 46s)

> Enhanced remake of save the homeland. Oh

(1h 21m 50s)

> Huh, wait wait. What's your other comment? I'm not I don't understand what you're saying. Can you play?

(1h 21m 54s) **Codey:**

> Oh, so instead, so instead of the Homeland, you basically have one year or else like a resort is going to be made at the end of that year, say the year to save the homeland.

(1h 22m 6s)

> In this game, you are a hero if you stop a theme park from being made. So some people come in, they're like, we're going to make a theme park here in two years, and you're like, no, so you stop that from happening.

(1h 22m 21s)

> And IGN said the quote, the complaint.

(1h 22m 24s)

> The controls can be frustrating at times, but that quote, I had a hard time putting it down.

(1h 22m 29s)

> So that's a great question.

(1h 22m 29s) **Kevin:**

> what was this DS or we do you know here I'll do let me see oh okay yes so this was ps also ps to it earth yeah ps psp psp uh come

(1h 22m 32s) **Codey:**

> If it's the save of the homeland, you know, save the homeland was PS2.

(1h 22m 48s)

> Oh, there we go. Interesting. Yeah, I don't know. That sure is a thing. There's also room factory 3, which they said had a Metacritic score of 77. I never saw a Metacritic score for any of the farming simulator, so I didn't put those down. Harvest Moon here of Leaf Valley had 74,

(1h 23m 8s)

> but room factory 3 with a score of 77. Quote, "The game presents the central theme of delicate balance of nature and introduces the conflict between humans and the

(1h 23m 18s)

> of their races, the protagonist, Micah and Micah. Micah discovers that he is half monster and decides to keep his, you know what, I love him anyway, decides to keep his true nature a secret from other villagers. His goal is to revive the strange, Sharon's tree, Sharon's, whatever.

(1h 23m 21s) **Kevin:**

> ahhh my god

(1h 23m 24s)

> So I was saying I wish we'd seen it earlier because maybe we could have gotten into record just this just this one sound by

(1h 23m 32s)

> Okay, go ahead, sorry

(1h 23m 35s)

> I didn't know that my mica

(1h 23m 47s)

> And one of the two.

(1h 23m 48s) **Codey:**

> A tree and prevent the surrounding land from decaying while also attempting to rebuild the trust between the univir and the humans. I like the setup. It has a it has a it has a pyrometacritic score.

(1h 23m 56s) **Kevin:**

> You know what? I like that setup. That's a good setup. I like it a lot. Mike is in it

(1h 24m 4s) **Codey:**

> I think that wins. I know we got to do a I need to need to do a retro harvest of that.

(1h 24m 5s) **Kevin:**

> I want to play a mic a game. That's a good room for you to revisit it. Yeah, yep

(1h 24m 11s)

> Yeah, we got we got to think of I don't know what the name is but we'll think of we'll go up Well, there's got to be a good name there somewhere. Okay. That's 2009 congratulations, Mike. You took the crown

(1h 24m 22s) **Codey:**

> He's like, he's, uh,

(1h 24m 22s) **Kevin:**

> You take the crown every day in my heart though um 2010

(1h 24m 26s)

> He's gone for like a living deck he's going all in so he's gone he's down for it so go check out my car that's Micah the Brave on Twitch and everywhere else where Micah is um okay uh 2010 the new new decade new new

(1h 24m 26s) **Codey:**

> Micah is streaming, um,

(1h 24m 28s)

> D. A right now. So folks were interested.

(1h 24m 30s)

> Not at this moment. I don't know,

(1h 24m 32s)

> but folks should if folks are interested in Z.

(1h 24m 34s)

> I might actually watch because I don't want to play it.

(1h 24m 37s)

> So I might do that.

(1h 24m 40s)

> Okay. Okay.

## 2010

(1h 24m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Farmings ah okay I was so thrown off when I was reading the list because farming simulator does the thing that some other like the sports games have done where we're so far ahead We're releasing next year's game now because farming simulator 2011 release in 2010 Oh my gosh 18 hours

(1h 25m) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(1h 25m 14s)

> Yes

(1h 25m 18s)

> Yeah, this is also the beginning of they started doing in 2011 they started doing this thing where every other year

(1h 25m 26s)

> They would do a mobile game

(1h 25m 28s)

> So 2011 is the PC game and then 2012 is the mobile 2013's PC 2014's mobile that kind of thing

(1h 25m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's best.

(1h 25m 38s) **Codey:**

> So yeah, this one they add 18 hour days

(1h 25m 44s)

> You keep there's more machines. You can have a bigger farm

(1h 25m 49s)

> They also this is the first mention of cows, so I think that you can this might have been the first beginning of cows

(1h 25m 56s)

> And also multiplayer

(1h 25m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, mostly player. That's a big one. You're good for your performance, isn't it?

(1h 26m 4s)

> Uh, okay. I didn't realize that harvest moon. I know we had trio of towns. We've had many games with only one town.

(1h 26m 10s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(1h 26m 13s)

> Yeah.

(1h 26m 13s) **Kevin:**

> But nobody told me that we had harvest moon, the tale of two towns, both on DS and 3DS.

(1h 26m 18s) **Codey:**

> To-- yep.

(1h 26m 22s)

> So it came out, I think the DS score had 63 and then the 3DS had 68.

(1h 26m 28s)

> So I think it came out initially on the DS,

(1h 26m 30s)

> but then it was one of the 3DS launch titles,

(1h 26m 32s)

> if I wanted-- I'm thinking that's my brain, says that.

(1h 26m 33s) **Kevin:**

> probably tail of two towns. There's three, three tees.

(1h 26m 38s) **Codey:**

> And then the three.

(1h 26m 40s)

> 3DS also added some new features that weren't in the first one including alpacas and honeybees and a pickle pot that you can use to make pickled turnips and I just wanted to read so this is one of those like I didn't know that this game existed and the story of this game is hilarious so hundreds of quotes hundreds of years before the events of the game.

(1h 26m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, pickling.

(1h 26m 57s) **Codey:**

> The towns of Bluebell and Konohana were once friendly neighbor towns connected by a tunnel through a large hill.

(1h 27m 3s)

> However, fierce arguments arose over which towns cooking was superior to the others.

(1h 27m 6s) **Kevin:**

> That happened. That's real.

(1h 27m 10s) **Codey:**

> During during one specific confrontation the harvest goddess grew tired of the bickering and destroyed the tunnel cutting off a majority of the towns contact centuries later the towns are still bitter rivals only communicating during a weekly cooking festival.

(1h 27m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, this is like Toronto and Montreal with their forma off and of yours.

(1h 27m 33s) **Codey:**

> Oh my gosh, yeah

(1h 27m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's good. I like that. That's strong. Um, okay. I mean, only one of these games introduced honeybees. So, you know, Harvest Moon, Tale of Two Towns, 3DS version specifically. You take the crown. That's a fun. I like that, uh, that's set out. That's a fun premise.

(1h 27m 45s) **Codey:**

> I feel like I might just say at this point, you know, farming simulator, you've been do it a lot.

(1h 28m 3s)

> I don't think it's going to win any of the years.

(1h 28m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, well, this is the problem, right? We we we did one farming simulator episode. I recall it was Johnny and I don't know who else. It was you. Oh, it was you that. Yeah. Uh, but we're not we're clearly not, you know, geared towards the farming simulator crown. Um, there might be one year, uh, depends on the competition. There's one I might give it to, but we'll get there when we get there.

(1h 28m 14s) **Codey:**

> It was me and Johnny. Yeah

(1h 28m 18s)

> I don't think it's gonna win in here so I think I

(1h 28m 26s)

> - Yeah.

(1h 28m 29s)

> - Okay.

## 2011

(1h 28m 32s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(1h 28m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Well, it's 2011. We're getting there. We're in the same decade at the end. We're again.

(1h 28m 38s)

> We're in there. Yeah. Runefactory tides of destiny. We and PS3. Oh, hello. You boy and girl. No, no four girl version. Aiden or Sonya. Where's it's on. I don't know. I'm guessing Sonya. You're traveling on the giant beast named Ymir. Um, you can raise sucking islands and ships from the sea. Hey,

(1h 28m 38s) **Codey:**

> Oh yeah, 'cause this ends at 2018.

(1h 28m 40s)

> So we're going, we're going.

(1h 29m 8s) **Kevin:**

> are able to farm fight using a real time battle system in formulation ships. Um, I let me, you know,

(1h 29m 14s)

> I want a visual of this because the other competition is farming simulator on the 3DS for 2012.

(1h 29m 19s)

> What does that even look like? Hold on. Um, that's crazy. I guess mobile gaming still was in infancy back then. Um, we were definitely not going to do farming simulator on mobile.

(1h 29m 31s)

> Huh. It actually looks decent on the 3DS. Farming simulator better than I would have expected.

(1h 29m 35s) **Codey:**

> I'm still going to give it to room factory.

(1h 29m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Um, well, I'll beat it. Um, I mean, sure. Sure. Yeah, I'm just, I'm impressed. I'm curious what this looks like.

(1h 29m 48s)

> We're getting all that some anime anime. That's a good anime stuff. There's a lot of ocean as the game implies what I'm wondering. If you're traveling on this beast, where, uh, where's the Bachelorette's coming or bachelor's bachelor? It's the, the, you know, candidates where they coming in. Oh,

(1h 30m 5s) **Codey:**

> They can raise sunken islands and ships, so maybe

(1h 30m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yes, sure. So you're up, you're up, fish up a potential wife today. Okay. That's how, that's how you do.

(1h 30m 12s) **Codey:**

> Yep

(1h 30m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, all right, congratulations.

(1h 30m 16s) **Codey:**

> I just I like the idea of you know because like before that all of the games were like oh you're either

(1h 30m 23s)

> On an island or on land and tides of destiny was like hear me out

(1h 30m 30s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(1h 30m 31s) **Codey:**

> You're not on either

(1h 30m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so it wins it

## 2012

(1h 30m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Alright, here we go. Uh, 2012. Oh, oh, okay. This is both we're getting good and also there's the clear winner like

(1h 30m 47s)

> Car like we got strong contenders within a tight among them. Um

(1h 30m 53s)

> Okay, farming similar to 2013 on PC, but then later Xbox and PlayStation

(1h 30m 57s)

> up to ten other players multi-player that

(1h 31m) **Codey:**

> Yeah, that was cool. They had they also added mods. They also added chicken sheep and cows

(1h 31m) **Kevin:**

> actually really impressive wow um yeah okay rune fact before that's the special one even I know that's the special one that got like multiple remakes and re releases um oh no that's not the Titan it's not no I'm just saying I know it's a special one it is a strong one that's I'm saying we got some content

(1h 31m 6s) **Codey:**

> The end

(1h 31m 15s)

> Really

(1h 31m 20s)

> That's not what I thought the Titan was gonna be oh

(1h 31m 24s)

> Okay, good good good good. Okay

(1h 31m 27s)

> Okay

(1h 31m 30s) **Kevin:**

> players here the other non-tight I haven't even I haven't seen this one what does it look like harvest moon 3D um a new beginning of even though we've had the wait do we not have a yeah we had on 3DS um right yeah tell two towns um okay a new beginning is this where the split happens no not yet okay okay because they go for a more this is where oh you know I think it is I think it's the art style um they because they now they use the more anime rune factory art style I think that's what it is

(1h 31m 30s) **Codey:**

> Well, what's the other not tight?

(1h 31m 52s)

> Nope, we're still not there yet.

(1h 31m 54s)

> I say it's 2014 year that they broke up.

(1h 32m 6s)

> This also adds multiplayer, so it adds a lot more character customization. You can design your house in your furniture

(1h 32m 14s)

> You can customize what the village is going to look like when you first get there

(1h 32m 15s) **Kevin:**

> That's cool.

(1h 32m 19s) **Codey:**

> But also just being able to do a multiplayer mode, which is like a it's region free So it's not I think you can do no matter what region you're in which was kind of cool. Yeah

(1h 32m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 32m 30s)

> That is pretty cool. Um

(1h 32m 32s) **Codey:**

> But none of them are as good as

(1h 32m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, this isn't the game of 2012 This isn't just the game 2012. This is one of the games of my decade This is one of my games of all time because ladies and gentlemen 2012 We got animal crossing newly for the 3DS which is in my opinion still the perfect

(1h 32m 54s)

> Animal crossing game

(1h 32m 57s) **Codey:**

> I agree. I, when New Horizons came out, I was like, I guess this is okay, but new leaf was,

(1h 32m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Um

(1h 33m 1s)

> Yep

(1h 33m 3s) **Codey:**

> it was a new leaf. It was so good. I think the only thing that I'm sad about is that they killed Tortimer.

(1h 33m 6s) **Kevin:**

> It's

(1h 33m 11s)

> He didn't and he wasn't dead. He was in the island

(1h 33m 14s) **Codey:**

> What have you done? No, he's not dead, but like this is the first one where you become the mayor,

(1h 33m 18s)

> instead of like moving into the town. Yeah.

(1h 33m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah Yeah, which was a fun setup

(1h 33m 23s)

> and and Oh my god, where do we?

(1h 33m 27s)

> First of all, this really changed the proportions. You've got, you know, regular-ish proportions now no longer giant head.

(1h 33m 34s)

> Isabelle was introduced. Need I say more? She made it to smash.

(1h 33m 39s)

> We got the island. You could adjust your town not not completely like New Horizons, but you could build landmarks and big projects, the public works projects.

(1h 33m 50s)

> It was just wild world just better in every way and so good. Oh, I think,

(1h 33m 57s)

> I'm going back to new life frequently. I'm just scared to open up my town. Let's see what's there, but it's just it is.

(1h 34m 7s)

> Yeah, just the ultimate form of the original Animal Crossing formula.

(1h 34m 11s)

> Yeah, New Leaf is a 15 out of 10 game for me and winner game the year this year and many years after for me.

(1h 34m 21s)

> We got the welcome amoebo update.

(1h 34m 25s)

> Okay. Okay.

## 2013

(1h 34m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Wow.

(1h 34m 29s)

> I'd see you typing.

(1h 34m 30s)

> Let's see.

(1h 34m 34s)

> Farming Simulator 14.

(1h 34m 35s)

> Now we're on mobile forms on Android iOS.

(1h 34m 40s)

> We got 3DS and the VEDA.

(1h 34m 42s)

> I...

(1h 34m 42s) **Codey:**

> the vida I forgot all about that

(1h 34m 44s) **Kevin:**

> I'll be... Did you know... Did you know VEDA means life?

(1h 34m 47s)

> Did you know that?

(1h 34m 51s)

> Oh, um, get those special SD cards, proprietary SD cards.

(1h 34m 57s)

> I never played a farm so that I can't say no winner.

(1h 34m 59s) **Codey:**

> You hate to see it.

(1h 35m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's fine. I'll give it to Cody.

(1h 35m 2s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, so I wrote "No Winter."

(1h 35m 5s)

> I mean, I think it's whatever,

(1h 35m 6s)

> but I just know it's just the same thing.

(1h 35m 11s)

> I just look, I'd rather say "No Winter."

(1h 35m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Okay um

(1h 35m 17s) **Codey:**

> They didn't add anything like legit.

(1h 35m 19s)

> The next year, I'm happy about what they added the next year, so it might actually win this next year.

(1h 35m 24s)

> I don't know, we'll see, we'll see.

(1h 35m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm. Okay. Um, okay, 2014. This is I finally reached it. The second branching paths for story of seasons and harvest monas, story of seasons is born on 3DS. Um, let's get to it. Um,

## 2014

(1h 35m 46s) **Kevin:**

> you're bored with regular life and there's you recruitment of farmers in Oak tree town.

(1h 35m 52s)

> I guess it is all the sound familiar and you can go there to the small village.

(1h 35m 56s)

> To meet the mayor and start up farming, and oh wow, I'm just reading your quote here from a a one of the

(1h 36m 7s)

> Metacritic or whatever for better and worse. It's the harvest moon and all but name with a few useful new ideas But still the same old crop of problems

(1h 36m 15s)

> Okay, you know what I'm gonna let you know a little secret

(1h 36m 19s)

> Back when the 3DS eShop was closing I rush to buy a handful of games I'm by hand for a minute

(1h 36m 22s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 36m 27s) **Kevin:**

> That I wanted Story of Seasons is one of them because I said you know what I want to go back and play it I have actually fired this up in one point I have touched this game I was going to do that sort of bring it up, but I didn't get to it So I haven't discussed it, but I have touched this game I liked it so far. It felt very story of seasons harvest moony

(1h 36m 27s) **Codey:**

> Okay, okay.

(1h 36m 31s)

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 36m 34s)

> Ooh.

(1h 36m 48s) **Kevin:**

> You know, I can't compare to all these other ones, but the bones skeleton was all there, so I like it

(1h 36m 56s)

> So just from the brief bits I played I give it a thumbs up

(1h 37m)

> But again, that is without you know, there might be loss of quality of life stuff from other games. I don't know

(1h 37m 6s)

> All right, let's see what else we got. This is getting 2014 get farming simulator 15 on the PC

(1h 37m 13s)

> leave

(1h 37m 13s) **Codey:**

> So this one also, this one, this one added forestry.

(1h 37m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 37m 20s) **Codey:**

> So that to me, I'm actually, it's in the running.

(1h 37m 27s)

> For me, you know, earlier I was like, oh, we should just call, call farming simulator out.

(1h 37m 32s)

> No, this to me, like, adding forestry as agriculture.

(1h 37m 35s)

> A lot of people when you think of agriculture, you don't think of forestry, but it is an agriculture thing.

(1h 37m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Like, so I don't play farming simulations, but I still respect it. Like, I think they do their stuff well. And like that forestry. I think that's cool. Doing realistic stuff. I think that is cool.

(1h 37m 47s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 37m 53s) **Kevin:**

> So, you know, yeah, I definitely know shade to farming simulator, because that may be the mobile ones. I don't know. But in general, like, yeah, I respect it.

(1h 38m 1s) **Codey:**

> But this is a PC here.

(1h 38m 3s)

> So.

(1h 38m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's one of those, it's one of those, the serious ones. All Also, so we got story of seasons, but we also got Harvest Moon, the lost Valley, one of the, uh, the now, the Harvest Moon,

(1h 38m 19s)

> that's like the opposite where it's nothing, Harvest Moon, but in name, nothing, but in name. Um, yeah, but not the,

(1h 38m 22s) **Codey:**

> so it's still Natsume but it they lost like the Titan like the all of the the effort went with Marvelous right yeah so this is when Natsume and Marvelous like split I think yeah so this is when Natsume no longer ports and Natsume

(1h 38m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Well Marvelous was were like the original developers yeah yeah not to me was just porting them from what I recall yeah right so they we can do it who needs that marvelous screw we can do it yeah you go to Hillsville a village locate it up in the mountains, stuck in an internal winter, that makes it hard to farm. You meet a harvest sprite named Rowan, who requests their help in reviving the village. Pete and Claire, weren't those names used for more? Oh, okay, anyways. You can modify your house, that's nice, and you can do, oh wow, you can already terrain elevations and building locations, that's pretty impressive for 2014 to be honest. And yeah, you know, other standard farming stuff.

(1h 38m 52s) **Codey:**

> was trying to make their own things and they ended up with a Metacritic score of 46

(1h 39m 19s)

> No, I don't think so.

(1h 39m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Who gets the crown?

(1h 39m 39s) **Codey:**

> I would give it to farming simulator 15 actually.

(1h 39m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Not the, uh, yeah, um, I want to give it to story of seasons, but I can't like

(1h 39m 49s)

> objectively in good conscience do it because I only touched it very briefly.

(1h 39m 52s) **Codey:**

> Do we want to do we want to do a tidier then?

(1h 39m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, I think, you know what, uh, I want farming simulator to have at least one year.

(1h 39m 58s) **Codey:**

> Okay, we'll give it this year.

(1h 39m 58s) **Kevin:**

> I do, it deserves it.

(1h 40m)

> So farming simp the 15 because you introduce trees, the novel.

## 2015

(1h 40m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Well, wait, we're coming down next year!

(1h 40m 6s) **Codey:**

> No, I'm doing it again.

(1h 40m 7s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, oh, you don't want to give 2015 or farming Sim 16 on the Kindle Fire?

(1h 40m 14s) **Codey:**

> the Kindle Fire. No, I don't want to give it a crown.

(1h 40m 16s) **Kevin:**

> You don't want to give it a crown?

(1h 40m 20s)

> Okay, there's only five crops. Okay, you know boo. No, that's yeah, that's a major downgrade

(1h 40m 24s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, it's a downgrade. So 2015, no winner. 2014, uh, farming simulator one, 2015,

(1h 40m 33s)

> no winner. The only game that we had in 2015 was farming simulator. 2016, it's a no brainer who wins, but we'll mention the other. There's a sweet of other games, and we'll we'll mention those too.

## 2016

(1h 40m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, you know what some of these games got discussed on the podcast because it was

(1h 40m 48s)

> Look you you guys know what happens. This is the before and after times this we are now entering the ASV era of the world

(1h 40m 57s)

> Because 2016 we get I'll just go down the list harvest moon sky tree village for 3DS harvest moon seeds of memories again Remember this is now no longer marvelous. Not so many

(1h 41m 8s)

> Story of seasons tree of crowns. We did several episodes of that at the beginning of this series

(1h 41m 14s)

> I believe the second game covered actually

(1h 41m 17s)

> Farming simulator 17 for PC ps4 and the X bone. Oh, yeah

(1h 41m 24s)

> Wait, hold on. I'm sorry. I'm just reading comment under here. First introduce a female character I didn't know there were actually people in Farmy, Simulae

(1h 41m 30s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, that, oh, yeah, no, when you're, when you play farming, like you have a person.

(1h 41m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I thought it was like management style like click and go the truck. Okay, oh

(1h 41m 37s) **Codey:**

> No, you, you actually pilot the things.

(1h 41m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, why did we never get for girls before?

(1h 41m 43s) **Codey:**

> And that, yeah, so this is, uh, 2015 was the first year that they had a female character that you could play as.

(1h 41m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Okay. Sorry. Dylant or Dylant, Dylant, just time planet. I remember that one. I believe that game is also covered on the harvest season. It is not harvest season episodes. I'm excited. Zena on Android and iOS. Dragon Quest Builders on every Sony device imaginable. Android, iOS and Switch.

(1h 41m 53s) **Codey:**

> Dayland. Thanks, so.

(1h 42m 8s)

[laughing]

(1h 42m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Good ahead is that thing was out of the--

(1h 42m 14s)

> the PSP, jeez. And then a game they call, you may have heard of it called Stardew Valley,

(1h 42m 22s)

> came out in 2016. Okay, so, so yeah, a tree of trance got a lot of love, I remember.

(1h 42m 24s) **Codey:**

> I don't know her. I mean, all the other games value an effort, but they had no way, they have no, they had no way of knowing what was coming.

(1h 42m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, this was-- this was not the iceberg, because you could see the iceberg.

(1h 42m 42s)

> This was the iceberg like

(1h 42m 44s)

> It was the ice climber's final smash with the J-E-E-E-S-B-B-B-B-Z

(1h 42m 47s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, this, yeah. This was the iceberg. Yeah. So I think the only other things that I would mention about some of these previous games is in Harvest Moon seeds of memories on iOS and Android,

(1h 43m 4s)

> you can befriend a bobcat. And I think that that's cool, but other than that,

(1h 43m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, that's good. That's good.

(1h 43m 11s) **Codey:**

> we've mentioned some of these other games on the podcast and they do exist, but

(1h 43m 14s) **Kevin:**

> of towns go worthy of a revisit, in my opinion probably. I think three towns that's cool.

(1h 43m 17s) **Codey:**

> yeah.

(1h 43m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Idea, Dragon Quest Builders, a good start. I'll say that. It's a good start. Too bad you came out to the year of Stardew Valley. You might have had a shot at DQB, but Stardew, you really wrote Yup with the period, and that is all that needs to be said about Stardew Valley.

(1h 43m 27s) **Codey:**

> That's what literally all I wrote was, yeah.

(1h 43m 41s) **Kevin:**

> the reason we exist as in the show.

(1h 43m 45s)

> Oh, okay. Yeah, but I think that's good for 26. I just feel so bad because everyone else has to compete with Stardew Valley.

## 2017

(1h 43m 53s) **Kevin:**

> All right, 2017 Harvest Moon Light of Hope for the PC and later in Switch and PS4 in 2018.

(1h 44m 1s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so I do like that the second player, excuse me, in the special edition there's a playable character that can be controlled by a second player, which is kind of cool.

(1h 44m 2s) **Kevin:**

> I remember this one was not great. I'm hearing a talk about it on the show actually.

(1h 44m 17s)

> That is fun. That is a fun idea. I like that you're right.

(1h 44m 19s) **Codey:**

> Still doesn't matter though.

(1h 44m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, this is not farming similar 18 from the mobile version for Android iOS 3DS.

(1h 44m 28s)

> Ooh, you can go sunflowers. I like sunflowers, but in pigs.

(1h 44m 28s) **Codey:**

> I do like the animal trailers. So I'm interested to see how they do it in this game, but

(1h 44m 41s)

> as someone who grew up on a ranch, people sleep on how difficult it can be to get animals into

(1h 44m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah I can imagine I have a puppy and like that's already hard as it is to control that thing. Yup. Yup. Nebby get in the bag! Yeah, but it's a mobile one so yeah. But what about with a...

(1h 44m 54s) **Codey:**

> yeah, imagine if your puppy is a horse that doesn't want to get in the trailer, you have to get them in the trailer.

(1h 45m 3s)

> So that's interesting.

(1h 45m 6s)

> But.

(1h 45m 14s) **Kevin:**

> power of the Nintendo Switch, we can have mobile and console because farming simulator hit the Nintendo Switch. I thought it was later but maybe I'm just catching up in years 2017. Oh yeah, we're actually near the end army.

(1h 45m 26s)

> Okay, farming simulator Nintendo Switch. I don't know, I don't know.

(1h 45m 33s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, there's nothing specific about it. There's nothing, whatever. So it's just

(1h 45m 38s) **Kevin:**

> You couldn't farm as Mario sadly.

(1h 45m 41s)

> - Slime rancher.

(1h 45m 44s)

> - Yeah, that's the game I know of,

(1h 45m 48s)

> but I've never played or no much about, really,

(1h 45m 52s)

> other than you ranch slimes.

(1h 45m 55s)

> But they're cute.

(1h 45m 56s) **Codey:**

> But it has, I actually, as I was looking at slime rencher, it is considered overwhelmingly positive on steam.

(1h 46m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's also a shooter isn't it or you suck up the the slides or something you have a guns first-person shooter type of thing

(1h 46m 5s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(1h 46m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Which is obviously different from our standard fair, but there you go

(1h 46m 10s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(1h 46m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Gosh, I I vaguely remember this next when yonder the cloud can't your chronicles

(1h 46m 22s)

> Well, is this

(1h 46m 25s)

> Yeah, I don't remember this at all. What is that? That's like a big

(1h 46m 30s)

> Is that a moose? I think it is a moose

(1h 46m 30s) **Codey:**

> I don't know.

(1h 46m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Looking at art here Primary the goal is seeking collect magical creatures known as sprites to banish ominous and ominous shroud known as the merc What what a name the merc?

(1h 46m 45s)

> Throughout the adventure the player can take part in activities like farming fishing and crafting while exploring the island

(1h 46m 52s)

> Okay, so we've got actually I

(1h 46m 57s)

> Might just want to give it well, okay, on my opinion is either farming sim Nintendo Switch

(1h 47m 3s)

> Line rancher Yeah, that's like take away

(1h 47m 3s) **Codey:**

> I think it's lime ranger. I think that people will riot if we don't choose slime rancher. I've heard so many good things about this game Even though I haven't played it

(1h 47m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(1h 47m 13s) **Codey:**

> So it's got to be slime rancher I I mean it's one of those games. I want to go back and play because I've heard so many good things about it

(1h 47m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. I mean farming rancher to or slime rancher to excuse me is coming out and people are hyped

(1h 47m 25s) **Codey:**

> People are so hyped

(1h 47m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Okay 2018 is our last year we made a people we made it to the end

## 2018

(1h 47m 31s) **Codey:**

> The last melon

(1h 47m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Farming simulator 19 on the PC

(1h 47m 40s)

> Farming simulated Commodore 64. That's a fun idea on the retro version

(1h 47m 43s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so that's nuts. So it's a super retro version. The images were crazy

(1h 47m 50s)

> Super super cool, but man

(1h 47m 52s) **Kevin:**

> And I feel like one of those things that was started out as an April fools joke, but they said, but we'll do it for real though on. But anyways, that's that's good. Yeah.

(1h 48m) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I mean, I'm not surprised.

(1h 48m 1s)

> Like the farming simulator group of people,

(1h 48m 4s)

> like they have so many mods and stuff.

(1h 48m 6s)

> Someone probably made this as a mod and then it just like exploded.

(1h 48m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 48m 10s)

> Probably.

(1h 48m 10s) **Codey:**

> And so they just made it for real real.

(1h 48m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, farm together, um, for Windows Max team and OS grow your own farm by yourself or cooperate with your friends in this unique relaxing farming experience.

(1h 48m 22s)

> I'm going to say this is probably not that unique. It looks like generic mobile game art, to be honest, that's all I can say about it.

(1h 48m 32s)

> Garden pause for the PC. I remember this one. I believe we this one got an episode

(1h 48m 32s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I played this one. I recommend it. It's 20 bucks. I really thought that you basically have your own little shop. And people come in and there's like a line of cute little characters that come and buy all your stuff. And it's really, I really enjoy this game. I actually kind of want to jump back into it. Um.

(1h 48m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Sure. It looks cute. It's good. Like those are big eyeballs on all these animal creatures.

(1h 49m 3s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(1h 49m 6s) **Kevin:**

> But it's charming. Okay. That's all nice and lovely, but sorry, this is another year where,

(1h 49m 15s)

> you know, I might have some interesting ones, but there's a Titan among all of you,

(1h 49m 19s)

> and that is Dragon Quest Builders 2. I talked about that game at length. I adore that game.

(1h 49m 29s)

> I mean, I suggest people go back and watch the episode, but it's Minecraft in its ultimate form.

(1h 49m 36s)

> Like, really, I don't have a better way to say it. Like, it did Dragon Quest Builders 1 better.

(1h 49m 41s)

> Like, let's think things even better. I had a good story. How on Earth did this game have a good story?

(1h 49m 46s)

> I don't know, but it did. Yeah, it's a good game. And hey, if nothing else for, you know, if you guys aren't that interested,

(1h 49m 55s)

> And I'll just say this, "Procopia is built off this thing."

(1h 49m 59s)

> This game is a good one.

(1h 50m 1s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I have not played it, but I've heard only good things, so that is clearly the the winner of 2018.

(1h 50m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Even when "Procopia" comes up, I will still recommend drawing Quest Builders too.

(1h 50m 6s)

> It's a credible game of what it's so much.

(1h 50m 11s)

> Okay.

(1h 50m 15s)

> Okay.

(1h 50m 17s)

> All right.

(1h 50m 18s)

> All right.

(1h 50m 19s)

> So, we've reached the end.

(1h 50m 20s)

> You know what I'm crazy, Perce.

(1h 50m 22s)

> I'm going to do it.

(1h 50m 23s)

> Run down to the winners.

(1h 50m 24s)

> I'm going down.

(1h 51m 43s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(1h 51m 45s)

> Yeah, we we switched it up and I think also because we didn't have to I think there's at least four years if not five years that there were options and we were like no

(1h 51m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, you aren't good. Oh

(1h 52m) **Codey:**

> I'm not gonna give an award to something just because it was all by its Wilson

(1h 52m 5s) **Kevin:**

> The luminous thing is very sketched. It's not a good feeling

(1h 52m 8s) **Codey:**

> Yep, not a good feeling.

(1h 52m 11s) **Kevin:**

> I'd rather have nothing

(1h 52m 13s) **Codey:**

(1h 52m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, we did it Cody. We did it. Oh, yeah, Cody

> Cody, do you have anything to say to the audience to share her?

(1h 52m 45s) **Codey:**

> Some of these games I didn't even know existed, so let's talk about that.

(1h 52m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, well a lot of those 3DS ones called to me like the story of season ones. I don't know what it is, but we'll see

(1h 52m 50s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

## Outro

(1h 52m 56s) **Codey:**

> The other thing that I would say is if you are an American listener and if you're listening this before November 4th, which is Election Day. Get out and vote in your local

(1h 53m 4s)

> election. A lot of the state Supreme Court judges are up for this this round and it is super important to

(1h 53m 10s)

> make sure that we retain the judges that are good.

(1h 53m 12s) **Kevin:**
