# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season my name is al.
(0:00:36) Kev: My name is Kevin and Al, you drop the ball, you miss the chance.
(0:00:41) Kev: The way we should have started this week was, "Why is podcasting so hard?"
(0:00:46) Al: Oh, disaster. Maybe we need to start that again.
(0:00:49) Kev: Oh dear.
(0:00:55) Kev: Yeah, it's probably harder for Sakurai to make Kirby out.
(0:00:59) Al: It's true, though. But it's not. It's not true. It's not hard.
(0:01:06) Kev: AirRiders isn't a podcast, probably.
(0:01:06) Al: Yeah, yeah, that is true. Probably. Yeah, so we are here, as I said.
(0:01:08) Kev: Well, that was a great direct.
(0:01:16) Al: We're gonna talk about Cuchco Games. Lots of Cuchco Games, because we have a list to talk about.
(0:01:18) Kev: Yeah.
(0:01:23) Al: There's a list. Did I find this list? I found this list, didn't I? This is a list on cozy game reviews
(0:01:26) Kev: Yes, you did.
(0:01:31) Al: of the 22 best Steam farming games of all time. Brackets updated for 2025.
(0:01:38) Kev: What an apropos subject after last week's episode.
(0:01:44) Al: So we're going to talk about that.
(0:01:46) Al: Next we're going to go through it and see if we agree because not only has it got them all listed, it says what they're all best for. They've all got a specific thing that the writer thinks that they're best for.
(0:01:56) Kev: Which is a good move, um, well, you know, we'll get to the list. We'll get to the list. I like the list content
(0:02:00) Al: It gives us something to talk about, so we'll see how we go.
(0:02:08) Al: Before that, we've got quite a lot of news. We'll get into that soon, but first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:02:14) Kev: Oh, this is I've been thinking about this it's been the hardest part for me to think about this week because I've been busy and not
(0:02:22) Kev: a lot of the usuals
(0:02:26) Kev: Let's see here at battle can't Sonic event finish, so I'm still playing but it's it's whatever
(0:02:32) Kev: Pokemon unite is good
(0:02:36) Kev: We had the world championships just last weekend, so we had announcements there
(0:02:41) Kev: That was fun. I don't even remember who it is now, but
(0:02:45) Kev: Oh gosh, what is it? Oh, no, I have to look up the list
(0:02:48) Kev: I don't remember but I mean I've been playing it's good the latte both lattes are out now
(0:02:54) Kev: They're pretty fun
(0:02:55) Kev: Especially when you can actually play with someone and you can use them both because they so specifically designed to work with each other
(0:03:03) Kev: So that's pretty cool
(0:03:07) Kev: But
(0:03:08) Kev: Yeah, you know unite still play. It's wild
(0:03:12) Kev: We're almost at a hundred playable Pokemon in the game
(0:03:14) Kev: That's wild to think
(0:03:17) Kev: That's like what almost 10% of the the techs
(0:03:23) Kev: But but yeah, it's been good. Oh gosh, I cannot
(0:03:28) Kev: I don't remember
(0:03:32) Kev: Sorry, I was trying to Google it was stalled for talking but either way I'm playing unite it's been good
(0:03:39) Kev: Let's see other than that, um, yeah, just a lot of the same as usual stuff. I've been playing
(0:03:44) Kev: I picked up a new show now that I finished monk
(0:03:48) Kev: Have you ever heard of dr. Quinn medicine woman now
(0:03:54) Kev: Okay, so it is a show from the 90s it is
(0:04:02) Kev: How should I put this frontier
(0:04:05) Kev: Style American setting kind of like little house
(0:04:06) Al: Okay, yeah.
(0:04:09) Kev: But it's a little more a little less saccharine
(0:04:12) Kev: It is the titular character.
(0:04:14) Kev: It is a female doctor, Dr. Quinn, which is, you know, given in that timeframe and setting, leads to a very different dynamic, right?
(0:04:28) Kev: So yeah, it's been enjoyable. I think it's a little more "real" than, say, Little House or some of the other more...
(0:04:42) Kev: Uh, I should...
(0:04:45) Kev: It doesn't paint over some of these details, so you know I've just been here enjoying a show about a
(0:04:52) Kev: Trying to find a home and community
(0:04:55) Kev: Despite the backdrop of a society where misogyny
(0:05:00) Kev: bigotry racism et cetera are pretty strong, you know, I
(0:05:06) Kev: Don't know if that resonates with anyone, but you know
(0:05:08) Al: Not at all, not at all.
(0:05:11) Kev: So it's been good
(0:05:13) Kev: It is from the 90's.
(0:05:14) Kev: So it looks a little dated, um, and, and you can still feel the 90's like hairstyles permeating the show though.
(0:05:22) Kev: Um, but, uh, but, uh, but yeah, it's been fun.
(0:05:25) Kev: That's Dr.
(0:05:26) Kev: Quinn, medicine woman.
(0:05:27) Kev: Like I said, just something to fill the, the show hole.
(0:05:29) Kev: Um, but yeah, that's, that's, that's roughly what I've been up to.
(0:05:33) Kev: It's been busy week.
(0:05:34) Kev: I made it, I made like a two day, one day gone the next day back work trip this week.
(0:05:39) Kev: That was wild.
(0:05:40) Al: What have I been up to?
(0:05:40) Kev: Um, yeah, so I'm tired.
(0:05:42) Kev: What about you?
(0:05:45) Al: I'm still playing Donkey Kong Bonanza, so it's a long game.
(0:05:50) Kev: All right
(0:05:56) Kev: Yeah, it's a lot of bananas to find
(0:05:58) Al: It is a lot of bananas, yeah, I've put like maybe like 10 hours into it or something so
(0:06:04) Al: far and I saw that there was a new world record put up today, so I went out to look at it
(0:06:10) Al: and what I've done in that like 10 hours they did in 50 minutes, like oh goodness me, so
(0:06:17) Al: I think I've got quite a lot of the game left to go because the world record is over four
(0:06:21) Al: hours, so I'm maybe a quarter of the way through but that doesn't feel right, but I don't know.
(0:06:29) Al: I did say, I think I said true endings, maybe that's getting all the bananas, so maybe I've
(0:06:33) Al: got, maybe I'm halfway, I might be about halfway through, we'll see.
(0:06:34) Kev: Hmm
(0:06:37) Kev: Hmm have you done that art mode at all the the sculpting mode or whatever?
(0:06:41) Al: I have not, no, I've not.
(0:06:43) Kev: Okay, I've seen people do some crazy nonsense in them. That's pretty cool
(0:06:46) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah, I'm enjoying that, we'll see how long that takes me, but this
(0:06:57) Al: week I'll probably be starting Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar, so who knows, how bizarre, so
(0:07:02) Kev: How bizarre, how bizarre.
(0:07:06) Al: I guess we'll see a mate put down Donkey Kong for a bit.
(0:07:10) Al: I think that's pretty much it gaming wise.
(0:07:17) Al: I've been catching up on a bunch of shows that I missed when I was on holiday, so I've
(0:07:22) Al: just finished Sandman and it was good.
(0:07:25) Kev: Oh, how was it?
(0:07:28) Kev: Was it just weird?
(0:07:30) Al: It was good if you can ignore the fact that it's no gaming, then it's good.
(0:07:30) Kev: Okay.
(0:07:34) Kev: Well, I feel like, you know, I feel like, in this day and age,
(0:07:40) Kev: people get pretty good at that, if you just ignore the, you know, monster at the top.
(0:07:42) Al: Well, yeah. Mm. So, yeah, no, that was good. And I think I'm going to watch Wednesday this
(0:07:56) Al: week. So, yeah.
(0:07:58) Kev: Oh, yeah, that's all right. Okay. You know what you I assume you watch season one
(0:08:05) Kev: Did you watch any Adams family prior to Wednesday
(0:08:10) Kev: Okay, cuz I'm cuz I I'm a big fan of the animals family. Um, so I'm I had not watched Wednesday. So I'm curious how
(0:08:17) Kev: That you know how it compares to the other relations, but alright
(0:08:22) Kev: I'll be curious to hear your thoughts. Anyways
(0:08:26) Al: Yeah, I think that's about it for me.
(0:08:29) Al: Oh, no, I started on.
(0:08:30) Al: So I've been watching through my mentions a couple of times.
(0:08:33) Al: I've been watching through all the James Bond films.
(0:08:35) Al: So I'm now on the Daniel Craig films.
(0:08:37) Al: So on the home stretch nearly there.
(0:08:40) Kev: Okay, okay, how is there any overall trends like they're
(0:08:44) Al: Hmm. So I don't think there is like an upward or downward
(0:08:46) Kev: Like better worse
(0:08:51) Al: trend. They have like a good one followed by multiple terrible
(0:08:53) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:08:55) Al: ones. I will say that one thing I've noticed watching them all
(0:08:57) Kev: Yeah
(0:09:01) Al: like we started in November. So we watched them all in the last
(0:09:02) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:09:05) Al: nine months basically. One thing I've noticed is that they're
(0:09:06) Kev: Yeah
(0:09:08) Al: all basically the same film.
(0:09:10) Kev: Yeah
(0:09:13) Kev: Now we're talking oh
(0:09:14) Al: So I mean, if you like that, then that's good. I did get to the
(0:09:17) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I mean
(0:09:21) Al: point where we hit the, what's his name? I'm so bad with the
(0:09:29) Al: actor's name sometimes. The Piers Brosnan ones. So we hit
(0:09:32) Kev: >> Yeah.
(0:09:33) Al: 95 with GoldenEye. And I was like, oh, fantastic. We're
(0:09:34) Kev: >> Yeah.
(0:09:36) Al: finally, we're finally getting out of the, you know, maybe we'll
(0:09:39) Al: get some bad baddie other than the USSR. And then I'm pretty
(0:09:43) Kev: Yeah, yeah they do.
(0:09:43) Al: pretty sure they go back in time.
(0:09:44) Al: to make the USSR the baddie again.
(0:09:49) Al: And then in the end, I would just watch Casino Royale and there's a little bit
(0:09:53) Al: where, where M goes, Oh, I wish we were, I wish we were back in the cold war.
(0:09:57) Kev: Yeah, yeah, man, that's that's good stuff. Obviously, you and I is Nintendo, Pokemon, MCU fans, we can we can handle a whole lot of the same thing done over and over. But that's that's that's fascinating.
(0:09:59) Al: They really do miss that easy baddie.
(0:10:05) Al: So yeah.
(0:10:18) Al: - Yeah.
(0:10:22) Al: I guess it's different when you're seeing the same thing
(0:10:24) Al: every three years rather than every week.
(0:10:27) Kev: Yeah, you know, that's a good point. That's a good point. But still, I mean, hey, you're still trucking, you didn't cause you to, to give up or die. So it's because there's at least something there.
(0:10:38) Al: Yeah. Yeah, nearly there, nearly there, definitely. I've watched all the Daniel Craig ones as
(0:10:44) Al: well, so I can't officially say that I've watched every James Bond film. I just haven't
(0:10:48) Kev: Yeah
(0:10:50) Al: watched these ones in a while, so. And Rona hasn't seen the newest one, so.
(0:10:51) Kev: Right, right
(0:10:54) Kev: Okay, there you go. Hey congrats
(0:10:57) Kev: Good stuff. Oh, I found the unite Pokemon. It's sorry
(0:11:04) Kev: Okay
(0:11:05) Kev: We are getting Empoleon which sure starters always a safe choice. We are getting Vaporeon
(0:11:13) Kev: Which means that the only Eevee evolutions we didn't have were the original three. So we
(0:11:18) Kev: Are now getting them that's now confirming two other ones down the line
(0:11:23) Kev: But most interestingly we are getting Delmise the
(0:11:29) Kev: Living seaweed on an anchor. I'm excited about that. I like the freak pics. Delmise is a good freak pic
(0:11:38) Al: Fun. Yeah. I look forward to seeing how Dalmay's, you know, moves.
(0:11:39) Kev: Yeah
(0:11:43) Kev: Yeah, I'm just gonna flow it's all just gonna flow
(0:11:49) Kev: But yeah, oh well drags it drags itself
(0:11:50) Al: You never know, should be something more interesting.
(0:11:54) Al: Yeah, you just hear this scraping sound.
(0:12:00) Kev: Oh, that'd be incredible. Oh my gosh
(0:12:02) Al: Especially, I presume there's no in-game chat, like audio chat in Unite.
(0:12:08) Kev: Yeah, there is. There is a voice, yeah.
(0:12:10) Al: Well there is, does it have, has it got, what's it called, where you're like,
(0:12:15) Al: it changes depending on how close to the character you are.
(0:12:18) Kev: Oh, proximity? No, it does not have proximity as far as I know.
(0:12:19) Al: >> Yeah.
(0:12:20) Al: >> That'd be brilliant.
(0:12:21) Al: So if you could hear, like, the scraping come closer to you, that'd be brilliant.
(0:12:22) Kev: The scraping.
(0:12:28) Al: Feels like it's something out of a horror film.
(0:12:31) Kev: That's incredible. Oh, I love dumb eyes. Oh, that'd be great.
(0:12:38) Al: All right, should we get into some news?
(0:12:41) Kev: Oh, you mean a lot of news. So much news.
(0:12:43) Al: So, yeah, we have some games that have released
(0:12:49) Al: that I completely missed when I was doing my catch-up
(0:12:52) Al: of all the news in the break.
(0:12:57) Al: So we're just gonna quickly go through those.
(0:12:59) Al: First up, we have Whimside, Whimside or Whimside.
(0:13:03) Al: I don't know how they want it to be said,
(0:13:04) Al: but it's one of those.
(0:13:04) Kev: Yeah
(0:13:06) Al: So that is out now.
(0:13:08) Al: So a hoo to windside.
(0:13:08) Kev: That's
(0:13:10) Kev: That's the desk that's your rusty like Pokemon collector
(0:13:16) Al: Correct, yes.
(0:13:17) Al: It's a creature collector, the game that sits at the bottom of your screen, and fits easily
(0:13:18) Kev: Which
(0:13:22) Al: into your routine.
(0:13:23) Kev: It looks kind of in-depth I don't want to use it as a you know thing on the side
(0:13:28) Kev: But I am kind of interested to just play get
(0:13:32) Al: Yeah. It has 194 reviews so far, very positive 85%. So that's good.
(0:13:39) Kev: some look some of those were also just pokemon there was just a squirtle in in that trailer
(0:13:46) Al: Well Squirtle is just a blue turtle, so come on. Next we have Herdling, they are also out now,
(0:13:49) Kev: it is you're not wrong yeah that's true
(0:13:56) Al: came out on the 21st of August, that one wasn't one that I missed because it's only just out.
(0:13:56) Kev: they nope that just came out that's
(0:14:01) Al: So that is the you're gathering a herd of mysterious creatures on a stirring and beautiful
(0:14:07) Al: journey into the mountains. And this is published by Panic, they're...
(0:14:08) Kev: It's Journey, the game Journey, but cows.
(0:14:16) Al: the Untitled Goose Game people and also the...
(0:14:22) Kev: Wow, that looks nothing like a criminal ghost game. A publisher? Okay, okay.
(0:14:25) Al: No, well they're just the publisher, they didn't they didn't write the game, but they've
(0:14:33) Al: Panic are also the they've turned into a publisher as well. But they're also the, and I'm just trying
(0:14:41) Al: to remember the name of it. Nope, nope.
(0:14:42) Kev: one game give me a hint is it stray oh oh my goodness wow these guys are heroes
(0:14:47) Al: In our game the Playdate, the console, they also did the console.
(0:14:54) Kev: hurdling exclusive to the play date or with the tool exclusive to the play date where you use the
(0:15:00) Kev: crank to herd the cows uh oh okay yeah so these guys are
(0:15:01) Al: Oh, they did fire watch as well.
(0:15:12) Kev: gonna publish weird things that's cool good for them i'm actually more interested in hurdling now
(0:15:20) Kev: now that I have this I mean not that the publisher just the developer or whatever you know but uh
(0:15:22) Al: Yeah, I
(0:15:26) Al: Yeah, but I mean a publisher tells you something especially when they've only published like 10 games or something so
(0:15:32) Al: It's not like they're throwing them out there. They're taking anything that comes
(0:15:36) Al: unlike some other games publishers
(0:15:38) Kev: But
(0:15:39) Al: But yeah, I mean it looks much more kind of fire watchy than it does anything else in terms of it's because obviously fire watch is
(0:15:44) Kev: Yeah
(0:15:46) Al: much more
(0:15:47) Al: straight and serious and
(0:15:49) Kev: Yeah
(0:15:50) Al: and they look.
(0:15:52) Al: kind of meditative, almost.
(0:15:53) Kev: Yeah
(0:15:55) Kev: Yeah, it's not yeah, that's a good way of describing it right very Zen sort of thing
(0:16:00) Kev: Just walking with some cows up a mountain
(0:16:00) Al: Hmm. Big haticos.
(0:16:05) Kev: The character even wears red like the journey
(0:16:08) Kev: Character with the scar. It's fine. Journey is a good game
(0:16:14) Al: Next we have a ritual of Raven, which is also out now.
(0:16:20) Al: So this is an isometric, story-based farming game.
(0:16:26) Kev: cards, lots of cards, everywhere. I don't understand the mechanics. Do you farm
(0:16:34) Kev: with cards? It kind of looked like that.
(0:16:38) Al: Yeah, I think so. I think you use the cards to create spells because you're awake
(0:16:43) Kev: okay right let's see enchant constructs to help grow herbs and ingredients to help you complete
(0:16:49) Kev: your book of shadows using the mystical deck of cards you'll be able to enchant constructs to
(0:16:54) Kev: plows plow sow seeds water and harvest them for you collect all 22 constructs and create thriving
(0:17:01) Kev: herb garden um so yeah looks like you do use the cards to make stuff to farm that's kind of
(0:17:08) Al: Yeah. Yup, so that's out now. Next, we have Abyss New Dawn. This is out in early access now.
(0:17:17) Al: I think they had a delay. Are these the ones that delayed the game? They were meant to come
(0:17:24) Al: out and then they were like, "Oh no, we've got an issue." There we go. This is the one. Abyss
(0:17:26) Kev: Did I lose the button, too?
(0:17:31) Al: New Dawn release may be delayed by a few days. During Steam's review process, our latest build
(0:17:36) Al: was rejected due to a technical issue of three achievements.
(0:17:38) Al: We've already fixed or submitted the build for approval. Steam usually takes three to
(0:17:43) Al: five days for the review, so the release date may be delayed until August 25th. It was not.
(0:17:48) Al: It ended up releasing Friday 22nd, so I don't think it was delayed at all, but they thought it might be.
(0:17:49) Kev: Yeah, um, so this, first of all, I hate.
(0:18:02) Al: Oh yes, this is a warm village above a deadly abyss below. Will you farm in peace or dive in?
(0:18:10) Kev: Okay, so first of all, I hate that name, like good heavens what an awful name, just like, it's just so generic, it doesn't tell you anything, um...
(0:18:14) Al: Yes, also it feels like it's the second in a series. This is the sequel to Abyss. It's
(0:18:24) Al: Abyss New Dawn. But I don't think that's the case. It is not the case.
(0:18:25) Kev: yeah yeah okay this is gonna sound kind of weird this this game doesn't look
(0:18:34) Kev: like it was AI generated but it looks like the concept was generated concept
(0:18:40) Kev: because it feels like it has so much going on like all these hallmarks you've
(0:18:44) Kev: got Animal Crossing as characters you got farming you got fishing
(0:18:49) Kev: customization and then the abyss the abyss is actually just dinosaurs it's
(0:18:54) Kev: It's just a dinosaur world.
(0:18:55) Kev: I don't know. It looks well made. It's a tough market out here.
(0:19:04) Kev: That's all.
(0:19:04) Al: Yeah, I'm not seeing anything make me want to play this.
(0:19:06) Kev: No, as much as I love dinosaurs, I'd rather play paleopine.
(0:19:13) Kev: I would, I'm not trying to entertain them.
(0:19:16) Al: Yeah, do you want to fight dinosaurs or do you want to tame them? That's the question.
(0:19:21) Kev: Also, so they have the Animal Crossing decorate your house because, of course.
(0:19:25) Kev: The one question I don't see, and I think this is a big problem a lot of games have,
(0:19:30) Kev: can you actually use the furniture? Can you sit in the couch or lying in the bed?
(0:19:36) Kev: Because that kills me when you can't, and a lot of games do it. But anyways, yeah.
(0:19:43) Kev: Bismuthon, that's early access. I probably won't play it. Bite Slime, that's in the video.
(0:19:55) Kev: Not fight slimes or anything, just fight slime singular. Or the general concept of slime, I guess.
(0:20:05) Al: Yeah, yeah, I don't I'm not excited to to play this let's put it that way
(0:20:11) Kev: I'm not either
(0:20:14) Al: All right moving on to something I am excited to play
(0:20:17) Kev: Okay, okay, I tried
(0:20:18) Al: Starbirds
(0:20:20) Kev: Okay, let's see here. So I tried looking at this. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Remember this one now. Yeah. Yeah
(0:20:21) Al: Starbirds
(0:20:24) Al: So so starbirds have announced that the their early access is releasing on the 4th of September. So just to
(0:20:33) Al: So, remind people.
(0:20:35) Al: This is the game made by the people who did Dorph Romantic, and it is based on the YouTube channel Kurtzkazat in a nutshell.
(0:20:49) Al: They do science-based videos, very interesting videos, all very meticulously researched and stuff.
(0:20:56) Al: And this is in their art style, and it is an asteroid-based building and resource management game.
(0:21:03) Kev: yeah that yeah it's it's um it's a lot those are a lot of words but the good the game the game looks
(0:21:08) Al: You know Dorph Romantic, right? You know the game. You don't know Dorph romantic. You would
(0:21:10) Kev: good I don't want to like I don't actually no no hold on
(0:21:16) Al: you definitely recognize it if you clicked on it. Click through to the developer on Steam
(0:21:20) Al: and click on Dorph romantic. It's a really record. It's kind of it's got the like tiles
(0:21:25) Al: like the hexagon tiles and it's it's like a building puzzle game. Yeah, it's pretty
(0:21:31) Kev: That is that is just settlers of Katon the game
(0:21:37) Al: it, it, it, it pretty much.
(0:21:38) Al: Um, but it's single player, I think, um, it's got 15,000 overwhelmingly positive reviews.
(0:21:40) Kev: Sure sure
(0:21:46) Al: It's a very big game, they're romantic.
(0:21:47) Kev: Oh, I'm sure okay, is it good to have you played it?
(0:21:53) Al: I haven't played it, but I mean, there's overwhelmingly positive on the Rivens team.
(0:21:58) Kev: That's true well
(0:21:59) Al: So like people like it.
(0:22:01) Kev: I guess so that's true
(0:22:02) Al: It's not, I'm not, I'm not the biggest management game guy.
(0:22:06) Kev: Yeah, that is true
(0:22:08) Kev: So I'm also okay for starboard. So it is very heavy on the management. You have networks of cables and roads and flow
(0:22:16) Kev: But I think the art style is very charming
(0:22:19) Kev: very cartoony
(0:22:20) Al: What I like about it as well is it's very small scale.
(0:22:24) Al: So I think one of my issues with management games is,
(0:22:27) Al: here's an infinite canvas, make something.
(0:22:31) Kev: Yeah. Mine it.
(0:22:31) Al: And you're like, but maybe I don't want to.
(0:22:33) Al: And what this does is it goes, here's a mini asteroid.
(0:22:36) Al: Mine it.
(0:22:37) Al: And then those all connect together eventually.
(0:22:40) Al: And so it does create this bigger thing,
(0:22:41) Al: but it's like much smaller scale at the start.
(0:22:44) Kev: Very piecewise. Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah, I think that's cool too. Very
(0:22:44) Al: I like, yeah.
(0:22:51) Kev: Like discrete as in with the E at the end
(0:22:56) Kev: Discrete units of
(0:22:59) Kev: Resource management and then you connect them all together for a bigger network. I like it. That's a fun idea
(0:23:06) Kev: Also your birds I
(0:23:08) Kev: Like I like to parrot a toucan. I don't know what bird that is. Looks like it has a toucan beak but parrot
(0:23:14) Kev: So I'm not sure I like that bird
(0:23:16) Al: Alrighty, so that yeah, that's 4th of September that comes out, Starbirds.
(0:23:21) Kev: That's sooner than it should be. Oh, where did all this go? Jeez
(0:23:28) Al: Yeah, that's two weeks away, less than two weeks away.
(0:23:30) Al: That's a week and a half away.
(0:23:30) Al: That'll be a week away when this game episode comes out.
(0:23:32) Al: Alrighty, next we have Lens Island.
(0:23:36) Al: They've released their 1.1 update.
(0:23:38) Al: That is out now.
(0:23:40) Al: That includes, it is the community feedback update.
(0:23:42) Al: update. It brings a bunch of changes such as free
(0:23:46) Al: camera orbiting. Okay, junk loading settings and performance
(0:23:51) Al: boost, you can change how far away you can see things, which
(0:23:54) Al: is really cool. If you've got like, a really good computer,
(0:23:57) Al: you can see islands miles away in the distance. I really like
(0:24:00) Al: that because yeah, that's really nice. Increased performance of
(0:24:05) Al: spending farms always good. A sorting button for storage items
(0:24:09) Al: should have been there in 1.0. Edit constructions with new move
(0:24:13) Al: button. The move button should have been 1.0. When Earth was
(0:24:16) Al: this was one of the things I complained about in the in my
(0:24:16) Kev: Yup.
(0:24:18) Al: review of it. Why on earth? Why on earth did I have to delete
(0:24:20) Kev: Yup.
(0:24:21) Al: something and recreate it? So silly. You did at least when you
(0:24:22) Kev: Yup.
(0:24:25) Al: recycled something, you got all the materials back. So you
(0:24:26) Kev: Right, right, right.
(0:24:27) Al: didn't waste anything. But it's just still such an annoying
(0:24:30) Kev: Yeah, I agree. Like, I feel like almost every game that has you, you know, building constructs or buildings or whatever should have this feature.
(0:24:38) Kev: And a lot of them don't. A lot of, I don't know why.
(0:24:42) Al: Yeah, another thing that should have been in there is the crop status UI, so if you hover over a crop, you can see whether it's ready to harvest or not, which is good.
(0:24:52) Kev: That seems important.
(0:24:53) Al: Yeah, yeah, I found it later on. So after the podcast, I read that I found out that you can craft a scythe, and if you use the site that only gets rid of things that are harvestable, but before that, you just have to guess.
(0:25:05) Kev: Oh, that's good. That's good. Good good
(0:25:12) Al: So you can create a new companion, the black bear, so you can get an animal black bear companion.
(0:25:18) Kev: Now this I like just because I like bears in general good good for you. He added a bear
(0:25:24) Al: Yeah, yeah, I think I'm probably gonna stick with my dog. I like my dog, but
(0:25:26) Kev: Can you pet the bear?
(0:25:30) Kev: Yeah
(0:25:31) Al: There's tempting
(0:25:35) Kev: I'm tempted. I don't play this game. But if I did I'd get a bear
(0:25:39) Al: Haha, I
(0:25:42) Al: Haven't played it for a few weeks
(0:25:43) Al: But I will hopefully get back into it at some point the problem is this is the one that I have to play on my
(0:25:48) Al: computer with my mouse and keyboard, so you know and
(0:25:53) Al: Next we have Disney Dream.
(0:25:54) Al: I'm just going to say a new episode.
(0:25:56) Kev: What property is it today or this time?
(0:26:01) Al: This is the emotional rescue update.
(0:26:04) Al: Let's see.
(0:26:06) Al: Joy and sadness.
(0:26:08) Al: You've got, so there we go.
(0:26:10) Al: We've got inside out, that's what it's called.
(0:26:11) Kev: Inside out as in joy and sadness TM, but the capital letters
(0:26:19) Kev: That
(0:26:21) Kev: How should I put this like this is a
(0:26:25) Kev: complete nonsensical like
(0:26:28) Kev: There's no logic in this world because it's just whatever cartoons
(0:26:33) Kev: but it
(0:26:34) Kev: But despite that, I don't know it feels weird that you can hang out with you know
(0:26:40) Kev: and psychological constructs.
(0:26:41) Kev: You win. You know, the rest of the guys are actual lions or dogs or people.
(0:26:48) Kev: But, whatever. I liked Inside Out. I didn't see Inside Out, too.
(0:26:53) Kev: Inside Out, first one, was a good movie.
(0:26:55) Al: I enjoy, I think Inside Out 2 was just as good if not better than Inside Out 1.
(0:27:00) Kev: Ooh! Ooh! That's interesting. I'll have to check that out.
(0:27:03) Al: It's very good. I think that so many sequels, I understand why people get frustrated with them,
(0:27:09) Al: but I think Inside Out was not, I mean, whether it was a cash grab or not, I don't care, right?
(0:27:15) Al: Like it doesn't feel like a cash grab, it feels like a continuation of the story in good and better
(0:27:15) Kev: Yeah
(0:27:20) Kev: Sure, I mean
(0:27:22) Al: ways, right? Like it's, it takes the concept.
(0:27:23) Kev: Yeah
(0:27:25) Al: And it goes further with it in a way that can completely break you.
(0:27:27) Kev: Yeah
(0:27:30) Kev: Sure sure, I mean, yeah, okay, it's not
(0:27:34) Kev: It's difficult but being a cash grab and being an excellent sequel are not mutually exclusive
(0:27:40) Al: Exactly.
(0:27:41) Kev: Um, just very, very rare, but, but it is, it, it's theoretically.
(0:27:45) Kev: Possible. So sure. Um, okay. I, I have one question from the sequel.
(0:27:50) Kev: Okay. So you remember in the first movie, you, sometimes you see the,
(0:27:55) Kev: the minds of other people, the parents or whatever,
(0:27:57) Kev: and they have the five emotions.
(0:27:58) Al: Yes. No. Explain why they weren't there with the main character who I can't remember the
(0:27:59) Kev: Do they explain why all these other emotions weren't there? No.
(0:28:05) Kev: Darn it. Darn it.
(0:28:11) Al: name of, but not why the new ones wouldn't be in Riley, that's the name, yeah, but why
(0:28:13) Kev: Riley.
(0:28:16) Kev: Yeah. Darn it. That's fine. That's fine. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean,
(0:28:16) Al: they wouldn't be in the other ones. No, they don't explain that. No, they do explain why
(0:28:21) Kev: it makes sense that you get new emotions as you get older.
(0:28:23) Al: why they're not in Riley.
(0:28:25) Kev: You get, you know, more nuanced. It's totally makes sense.
(0:28:28) Al: Yeah, the metaphors are both fun and painful.
(0:28:35) Kev: Now you say, is it painful? Cause it's too real.
(0:28:38) Kev: Is that what it is? Oh, yeah.
(0:28:42) Kev: Oh, yeah.
(0:28:42) Al: a little bit yeah you're a big anxiety boy aren't you yeah yeah then then then yeah
(0:28:45) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, yeah.
(0:28:52) Al: watch it but but watch it on an emotionally stable day
(0:28:52) Kev: Oh, oh, so it can be so that was so the rest of your day can be emotionally unstable.
(0:28:58) Al: or you know semi-emotionally stable
(0:29:08) Al: no I think I think it's one of those ones where it will break you but in a healing way
(0:29:12) Kev: Sure, sure.
(0:29:13) Al: you know like therapy you know you go into therapy and sometimes you come out crying
(0:29:14) Kev: Yeah, no, I get that.
(0:29:16) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:29:18) Al: but also you feel better in some ways as well it's kind of like that
(0:29:22) Kev: Yeah, I get that.
(0:29:22) Kev: Yeah, no, I know what you mean.
(0:29:24) Kev: I mean, like, like the first one, the shocker.
(0:29:26) Al: not that watching watching films obviously important to note watching films is not a
(0:29:30) Al: suitable alternative to therapy do therapy please and thank you
(0:29:34) Kev: Yeah, that's that's a good thing to do that
(0:29:36) Al: if you can if you can afford it if you can't talk to your friends
(0:29:38) Kev: You go go or
(0:29:42) Kev: Okay, yeah, here's my my PSA helpful hint for the day
(0:29:46) Kev: I always always recommend because therapy can be very expensive, right?
(0:29:52) Kev: Especially on the states where we have to deal with you know medical insurance and yada yada
(0:29:57) Kev: If you find that to be a challenge go seek out your nearest University
(0:30:02) Kev: They may have a clinic with students.
(0:30:04) Kev: They may have a clinic with students in training to be full psychologist/counsellors, which is usually generally affordable.
(0:30:06) Al: Hmm.
(0:30:10) Kev: Or they can make it affordable.
(0:30:13) Kev: And it's pretty okay because they still are supervised by actual, you know, fully certified therapists and whatnot.
(0:30:20) Kev: So, yeah, go look at your local university.
(0:30:24) Kev: Anyway, so that's Disney Dreamlight Valley!
(0:30:30) Al: - Yes, that's Disney Dreamland Valley, go to therapy.
(0:30:37) Al: Next, we have Overthrown,
(0:30:39) Al: they have released a coastal update.
(0:30:42) Kev: Okay.
(0:30:42) Al: So that includes some coastal related things.
(0:30:45) Kev: Okay, so I saw that and my first question was what is overthrown? I did not remember this game at all.
(0:30:50) Al: This is the one where you can like pick up the sawmill
(0:30:54) Al: and throw it at trees and it'll turn the trees
(0:30:56) Al: into planks of wood, stuff like that.
(0:30:58) Kev: Yeah, which is
(0:30:59) Al: It's like the.
(0:31:02) Kev: The very it's very cool concept to be honest I saw it
(0:31:07) Al: and you can also in their ritual run.
(0:31:08) Kev: Yeah, you are not running across water and everything
(0:31:13) Kev: And it's multiple. It's it's chaotic and and boy that that main character
(0:31:18) Kev: They're the default design or whatever that is a breath of the wild outfit. That is blue link blue
(0:31:24) Al: Yeah, fair.
(0:31:27) Kev: But but it's fine
(0:31:28) Kev: What a wild goofy game
(0:31:30) Kev: What a novel idea to pick up the sawmill and chop down the whole forest by running with it
(0:31:37) Kev: We're throwing buildings at the invaders that's good stuff. I like that. That's fun
(0:31:43) Kev: Coastal I like coastal stuff you can throw pirate ship now
(0:31:46) Al: All right, next we have Starsand Island have released a trailer for the game.
(0:31:54) Al: Have you watched it yet, Kevin?
(0:31:56) Kev: let me see which one is this no this is not the hold on there's a lot of games
(0:32:03) Kev: trying to merge one this isn't the allegory allegory game
(0:32:08) Kev: yeah no we'll get to that later oh gosh I missed this one I was going through
(0:32:15) Kev: the doc and it's this one actually let me see here live reaction okay those are
(0:32:20) Kev: pretty graphics hate the name of course goes without saying oh that's anime that
(0:32:25) Kev: That is some anime.
(0:32:27) Kev: Uhm, okay, a lot of customization, farming, cat, ooh, is that an arcade? Actual arcade?
(0:32:34) Kev: Why is it always snake? They always be, "Oh, you're right, on a deer there's some pandas, and a bamboo raft, so we can go build your aquarium."
(0:32:45) Kev: Oh, I kind of remember, yeah, I remember this, build the house, 3D spirit favor house, yeah, yeah, yeah, water slide into the ocean.
(0:32:53) Kev: There's a lot of stuff.
(0:32:56) Kev: Yeah, build your 3D Animal Crossing Spiritfare pool party house.
(0:33:03) Kev: Okay, that's...
(0:33:05) Al: I feel like this game is either going to be another Stardew Valley like a big really popular
(0:33:12) Al: really good farming game or it's Sugardew Island again and I can't tell which like I
(0:33:14) Kev: Yeah, there is a metal ground, you don't think so? I kind of, I mean, I mean, you have reason
(0:33:19) Al: don't think there's going to be a middle here I don't know for this game like there are
(0:33:25) Al: many games in the middle ground I don't think this one can be in the middle ground it's
(0:33:29) Al: one or the other like it might be that this game is entirely fake I'm still not convinced
(0:33:37) Kev: to believe that there's a guy playing guitar with ostriches and sheep, there's backup dancers.
(0:33:43) Kev: That's...
(0:33:46) Kev: I like that. I don't know if it's real.
(0:33:48) Al: you can get a boat with a water slide
(0:33:48) Kev: But...
(0:33:50) Kev: Into the ocean.
(0:33:53) Al: for some reason. I'm so confused about the boat. Where's the boat?
(0:33:54) Kev: Yeah.
(0:33:59) Al: Like, am I riding the boat somewhere? Because I can customize the boat,
(0:34:03) Kev: Yeah, it makes you think like it's your main base, but they show you a room. Yeah, you
(0:34:03) Al: right? But it's not. You've got a farm.
(0:34:10) Al: So what is this? Why is this boat? Is it from traveling places or is it just a
(0:34:13) Al: second home? Why was I going down the slide in
(0:34:15) Kev: Probably
(0:34:17) Al: might feel soon.
(0:34:19) Al: So many questions.
(0:34:20) Kev: There's a lot of questions what why are you writing a legendary Pokemon not the ostrich the deer one
(0:34:26) Al: And an ostrich.
(0:34:29) Al: Yeah, I know I saw the deal, but the ostrich definitely looks
(0:34:32) Al: fine. I would ride an ostrich. That sounds fun.
(0:34:33) Kev: I
(0:34:34) Al: Also, there's a baby chick on the ostriches head for some reason.
(0:34:37) Kev: It does something, you know us oh, yeah, there are there is chick. Oh, I think you customize the ostrich
(0:34:44) Kev: I see one the flower too. I don't know
(0:34:46) Al: There's a snake minigame where instead of a snake, you're a capybara.
(0:34:50) Kev: Which is I don't like that concept I
(0:34:54) Kev: Don't like yeah, no or rather the the cap of the air gets longer. No, I don't get that
(0:34:54) Al: Of a long capybara.
(0:35:03) Al: Oh, you're fine with a long capybara just as long as it stays the same length.
(0:35:04) Kev: You
(0:35:06) Kev: Yes, I don't I don't like yes, it's the increase here that's making me uncomfortable but
(0:35:06) Al: Is that what you're saying?
(0:35:13) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:35:15) Kev: It's a wild game. I
(0:35:18) Kev: Don't know
(0:35:20) Kev: it looks real enough, but
(0:35:24) Kev: You can put a carousel in the middle of your boat
(0:35:28) Kev: It's wild. I
(0:35:30) Kev: I don't know what what is the point of all I like.
(0:35:33) Kev: What is the impetus here? Why do you write ostriches? I don't get it.
(0:35:37) Al: You get round fast, obviously. Come on.
(0:35:39) Kev: Yeah, you know, apparently writing ostriches is incredibly dangerous in real life.
(0:35:45) Al: Well yeah, obviously. They're terrifying birds.
(0:35:46) Kev: Yeah, yeah, but like, yeah, they are.
(0:35:52) Kev: I like them, though. Anyways, I mean, it it has caught my attention
(0:35:57) Kev: just because it's it's I don't know what to make of it.
(0:36:03) Kev: It hasn't it hasn't put me off.
(0:36:06) Kev: So good for you, Star Santa, even with the name, you've you've caught my attention
(0:36:11) Kev: to a degree, Star Santa Island.
(0:36:13) Al: I also worry that there might just be too much in this game, that's always a problem
(0:36:17) Al: with these games.
(0:36:18) Kev: You know, it feels like that's kind of a recurring theme these days.
(0:36:23) Kev: Like they're just do stardew, but bigger or add more and bloat and bloat and oh,
(0:36:34) Al: Well, we'll see. We will keep you posted on this game.
(0:36:38) Kev: We're obligated to.
(0:36:42) Al: Next, we have Harvest Moon Home Sweet Home Special Edition.
(0:36:47) Al: So this is the console version of this game for Switch and PS5.
(0:36:53) Al: We now have a price. It is $40 and it's up for pre-order now coming out Q4.
(0:37:00) Kev: It's... we all know what it is. It's the harvest moon. The Natsume...
(0:37:10) Kev: Well, I'm not gonna get it, I'll be honest.
(0:37:13) Al: That's fair. I will say, I still think this is actively a good game. My big question is,
(0:37:22) Al: is there going to be an update coming to the mobile version that gives us the stuff that
(0:37:26) Kev: Hmm
(0:37:28) Al: this version has, like the hover bike and stuff like that?
(0:37:31) Kev: I I wouldn't rule it out. Not something has been surprising us lately. So maybe actually it's more than 0% chance
(0:37:34) Al: Yep, I never expected an update for this game.
(0:37:43) Al: On the console to give us controller support, for example, never expected that and we got
(0:37:48) Al: it. So maybe, maybe, but it's weird that they've not done anything about it, like told us anything
(0:37:55) Al: about it yet.
(0:37:58) Kev: Well, it's better than scong than in the communication.
(0:38:02) Al: Next we have in what is both surprising and not surprising crossovers, like was this on
(0:38:09) Kev: I
(0:38:12) Al: your bingo guard of crossovers?
(0:38:13) Kev: Well, no because
(0:38:14) Al: No, but if you said, if you told me this was going to happen, I would say, okay, sure,
(0:38:19) Al: I can see that.
(0:38:21) Al: And that is Infinity Nicki cross Stardew Valley.
(0:38:21) Kev: I. Okay, so to begin with, I was not familiar with Infinity Nicky. So that was my first
(0:38:31) Kev: response. What is Infinity Nicky? I watched a I watched the trailer. I watched a gameplay
(0:38:32) Al: This is the dressing up game, isn't it?
(0:38:39) Kev: trailer. I still don't understand what this game is. Yeah, but it's also gotcha.
(0:38:42) Al: I'm pretty sure this is the, uh, yes, it's the dress up game.
(0:38:47) Al: So the whole point it's, yes, it's a gacha great dressing up game.
(0:38:51) Al: So the collaboration is in Infinity Nikki.
(0:38:54) Kev: very anime. Yeah.
(0:38:57) Al: It's not in Stardew Valley.
(0:38:59) Al: Um, but I don't think we know for certain, I've not, I didn't notice
(0:39:03) Al: anything in the trailer that gave us an indication as to what it was, but
(0:39:05) Al: I'm guessing it's Stardew inspired outfits in Infinity.
(0:39:10) Kev: I thought that 3D... still pixelated, but 3D Junimo was in the game.
(0:39:17) Al: Yeah, I think that's just, this is the trailer. I don't think that actually is going to...
(0:39:20) Kev: Are you sure? Mmm...
(0:39:23) Kev: I don't know. I kind of feel like it is. It felt very...
(0:39:26) Kev: That was a very detailed model for just a trailer, in my opinion.
(0:39:31) Kev: There's creatures for, to some extent, in this game. I don't know what they do.
(0:39:36) Kev: But... yeah, I don't know.
(0:39:40) Kev: But regardless, like...
(0:39:44) Kev: It's...
(0:39:45) Kev: First of all, it's...
(0:39:47) Kev: It's so many other Stardew crossovers.
(0:39:49) Kev: Like, it's, you know, 2D pixelated, indie developer, whatever, right?
(0:39:54) Kev: Like, it's kind of on the same realm as Stardew.
(0:39:58) Kev: Uh, Infinity Nicky is a very high-fidelity, 3D anime, mohoyo-looking game.
(0:40:09) Kev: And so it's wild to see.
(0:40:10) Kev: We started getting upgraded, like just visually, you know, up to that level.
(0:40:17) Al: Oh, here's interesting. So, apparently, Infiniti Nikkei is getting updated to have
(0:40:23) Al: homes. Apparently, he didn't have homes before. And farming.
(0:40:27) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's correct. I do I did see that
(0:40:32) Al: So, that's interesting.
(0:40:34) Kev: And well, there's your there's your Avenue
(0:40:36) Kev: What what a get for this infinity Nikki go for the big one and I'll start it to introduce your new home
(0:40:44) Kev: Farming update with it
(0:40:47) Kev: Yeah, this this whole thing is wild apparently so the internet thought so too
(0:40:52) Al: Yes, so just to clarify, I think this article is mostly clickbait, but I wanted to just
(0:40:58) Kev: Yeah, I agree
(0:41:00) Al: have a quick chat about it. So this is a random article on a random site. Stardew Valley creator
(0:41:05) Al: defends free Infinity Nikki crossover after backlash as he genuinely thought the players
(0:41:11) Al: would like it. So I don't think he's actually responding to complaints about the fact that
(0:41:17) Al: this exists. The quote comes from a tweet where he says there have
(0:41:22) Al: been a few collaborations between Stardew Valley and other games over the years. To
(0:41:27) Al: be clear, I never received any money from these collabs. I've only done them because
(0:41:31) Al: I was a fan of the other games or because I genuinely thought the players would like
(0:41:34) Al: it. That is not like the headline definitely makes it sound like he's specifically talking
(0:41:40) Al: about this collab. And he and he's like making it makes it sound like it's going, Oh, I'm
(0:41:44) Al: really sad. People don't like it. I genuinely thought the players would like it. Like that
(0:41:48) Al: doesn't seem to be the case. And if you look in the YouTube comments for this video, like
(0:41:52) Al: it is mostly positive and or mostly just like shock in general, right?
(0:41:56) Kev: Uh
(0:41:58) Kev: I I don't know because the
(0:42:01) Kev: concern they tweeted is uh
(0:42:03) Kev: Just a couple days ago, um right around the time of the trailer dropping
(0:42:08) Kev: So I think he might be obviously he's getting
(0:42:11) Kev: He has a lot of people that follow him and send him comments and stuff. So
(0:42:16) Kev: he I suspect there was a
(0:42:19) Kev: Maybe not a large but you know how these things are a vocal minority of people
(0:42:24) Kev: Who complained about this because
(0:42:26) Kev: I can see the logic right concerned a star do we that's a success right he's
(0:42:32) Kev: already getting success from stardew and now he's collabing with the gotcha game
(0:42:37) Kev: which is probably making insane boatloads of money because gotcha games
(0:42:41) Kev: that's what they do so oh look at that and see now he's collaborating with big
(0:42:42) Al: Yeah. Yeah, so well, so yeah, so my I suspect it was a small number of people who are like, oh,
(0:42:54) Al: I can't believe he's doing this, he must just be getting a bunch of money. And so he's like,
(0:42:57) Al: no, no, I'm not getting money. And that's all he really cared about doing, right? That's because
(0:43:00) Kev: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
(0:43:01) Al: that's really all he said is, I don't get money from the collabs, play it or don't, I don't care.
(0:43:02) Kev: Yeah.
(0:43:06) Kev: Yeah, pretty much.
(0:43:06) Al: Right? Like, I think these are fun. And that's basically what he's saying, which is a fair thing
(0:43:11) Al: to... to point out. I just...
(0:43:12) Al: feel like this then article just takes it as like this stupid over the top forced to apologize
(0:43:20) Al: because it you know it's just like oh my word gonna know and then of course I'm playing into
(0:43:20) Kev: yeah yep and then and then QS I think the 3d dream was part of it I'm still
(0:43:24) Al: that by talking about it. I'm still not sure what this collab actually is as well but it
(0:43:34) Kev: I'm standing by that
(0:43:35) Al: we'll see. Well I think it'll just be inspired designs but we will see.
(0:43:40) Kev: yeah I don't know how should I put this it's wild to me that started concerned
(0:43:48) Kev: I knew what this game was from what I've seen.
(0:43:50) Kev: in other interviews he seems a little out of touch with the gamesphere but here we are
(0:43:54) Al: Yeah, maybe. All right, to finish off the news, we have two new games to talk about,
(0:44:03) Al: and I don't know why, but this is apparently horror time. One of them is called We Harvest
(0:44:10) Al: Shadows, a single-player first-person farming horror allegory,
(0:44:14) Al: become a recluse, build up your farm, and survive the lonely nights.
(0:44:18) Kev: Yeah, this is what I said was the allegory game, um, yeah, um, this is, this is just straight
(0:44:21) Al: All right. Okay. There we go.
(0:44:26) Kev: horror.
(0:44:27) Kev: There is no cozy here.
(0:44:29) Kev: Um, it's full 3D, first person, spooky lighting, you know, uh, run down shack you're living
(0:44:38) Kev: in.
(0:44:39) Kev: You are leading a lamb to a sacrifice, it looks like, I don't like that.
(0:44:45) Kev: Um, okay.
(0:44:48) Kev: I hate about, um, not just games, but like, I hate when anything describes itself as an
(0:44:56) Kev: allegory or allegory, excuse me, um, uh, because like, that kind of defeats the point.
(0:44:58) Al: Yeah.
(0:45:04) Kev: You know, you should be able to figure it out.
(0:45:04) Al: Yeah. Also, an allegory to what, right? Like, you can't just say that.
(0:45:06) Kev: And the worst part, exactly, right?
(0:45:09) Kev: Exactly.
(0:45:10) Kev: If you're gonna tell me, okay, what is it for?
(0:45:13) Kev: Tell me.
(0:45:14) Kev: Right?
(0:45:15) Kev: If you're going to be, you know, maybe you're inspired off.
(0:45:18) Kev: Something or give me a general idea.
(0:45:20) Kev: I guess I can get it, but, but you're just okay.
(0:45:25) Kev: Why were you telling me you're, you mean something?
(0:45:28) Kev: That's like, this game has thoughts.
(0:45:31) Kev: This game has emotions.
(0:45:32) Kev: Okay, good for you.
(0:45:34) Kev: I would hope your game does, but yeah, it's very bizarre.
(0:45:37) Al: Yeah, what am I meant to do with this information? Right? Bizarre.
(0:45:44) Al: Oh my word, those creatures are horrifying. Sorry,
(0:45:44) Kev: But anyways, the game itself...
(0:45:46) Al: I was just watching the end of the trailer and just got jump scared from that horrible creature.
(0:45:48) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that said, I was about to say that exactly, the it is very just straight horror, those are Resident Evil-esque looking creatures at the end of that trailer.
(0:46:00) Kev: Um, and you got a shotgun, and I don't know what you're supposed to survive, and you're still farming somehow, apparently.
(0:46:08) Kev: Um, yeah, I'm generally not a big horror, like straight horror.
(0:46:10) Al: Obviously. I mean, why not?
(0:46:18) Kev: Um, at least game-wise, um, so I don't know if I'll be checking that out, but it's a little more refreshing than, than, you know, what is this, Star Sand Island baby?
(0:46:31) Kev: A bit, it's New Dawns, but definitely more exciting than that.
(0:46:32) Al: And the other one, which I'm not 100% sure whether we have or haven't talked about this
(0:46:41) Al: one, because like some things are ringing bells.
(0:46:42) Kev: We have I or I am like positive or do we talk about just on discords?
(0:46:44) Al: We have talked about this, right?
(0:46:48) Al: It's not, it's, this is the thing I can tell, it's, it's on, it's not, it wasn't on my list
(0:46:49) Kev: I can't remember because it was on a direct
(0:46:54) Al: of games that are upcoming.
(0:46:56) Al: So I either didn't talk about it or I forgot to put on the list, but anyway, we're talking
(0:47:02) Al: about it.
(0:47:03) Al: That's never a way.
(0:47:04) Al: The interesting thing about this one is the pixel artist is the one who did Celeste.
(0:47:09) Al: So that's exciting.
(0:47:10) Kev: - Yeah, so that's good work already.
(0:47:12) Al: After quitting her dead end job, Fiona starts over on a farm and becomes the immortal hero
(0:47:17) Al: of a dead God.
(0:47:18) Al: Make friends, fight through horrors and pay your debt in this nightmarish life sim RPG.
(0:47:24) Al: This is giving Cult of the Lamb.
(0:47:26) Kev: yep it's it's still stardew-esque because you have a town and you're interacting with characters and
(0:47:33) Kev: possibly romancing but genuine horror there are some twisted looking visuals in this game um
(0:47:40) Kev: like cult of the lamb but even the cult of the lamb was a little more cartoony
(0:47:45) Kev: a little more light-hearted um yeah this is this is stardew but scary for real um I honestly i'm
(0:47:46) Al: Yes.
(0:47:50) Al: Pretty much.
(0:47:52) Kev: I'm kind of hyped about it.
(0:47:56) Kev: I know I'm generally not into horror, but when you blend horror with something else, then it becomes a little more interesting to me.
(0:48:04) Kev: Because you still have some degree of Stardew-esque facade/elements.
(0:48:10) Kev: Yeah, so it's interesting.
(0:48:14) Kev: Yeah, it was on a direct, it got eyeballs on it.
(0:48:16) Al: We'll keep an eye on it.
(0:48:16) Al: It's coming out next year.
(0:48:19) Al: All right.
(0:48:22) Al: Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:48:23) Al: All right, we are now going to talk about this list,
(0:48:27) Al: the 22 best Steam farming games of all time brackets
(0:48:30) Al: updated for 2025.
(0:48:32) Al: So there are 22 games on this, obviously.
(0:48:35) Al: As far as I can tell, this is not a ranking.
(0:48:39) Al: This is just games that the person likes
(0:48:44) Al: and why they like them.
(0:48:46) Al: So I think we're going to go through the list and we're going to talk about each of them and why they're right or wrong because it's not just going to be wrong because we start off Kevin with stargy Valley as best overall farm.
(0:48:48) Kev: Now let's tell them why we're wrong.
(0:48:50) Kev: QR-- yeah.
(0:48:58) Kev: Wrong, wrong, wrong.
(0:49:01) Kev: No, QR YouTube reaction gif, you know, thumbnails.
(0:49:05) Al: How dare you like Stardew Valley! You're such a normie.
(0:49:10) Kev: Exactly.
(0:49:13) Kev: OK, I mean, yeah, like--
(0:49:16) Kev: when did it start to release?
(0:49:17) Kev: Was that 2016?
(0:49:18) Kev: The Switch, right? When it dropped? Yeah, 2016.
(0:49:20) Al: No, the Switch one dropped in 2017, but it had been—no, no, it wasn't.
(0:49:28) Al: It came out after the 1.0 release, I'm pretty sure, because Stardew Valley did not have
(0:49:32) Al: on Early Access.
(0:49:34) Al: 2016, yeah.
(0:49:48) Kev: No more army games, but in the modern day, you know, at least Cottagecore, Stardew is king, and undeniably.
(0:49:56) Al: Yeah, I think I tried to say a couple of years ago that I thought Coral Island was better, but
(0:50:03) Al: I don't go back to Coral Island. I've tried, but I keep going back to Stardew.
(0:50:05) Kev: Yeah
(0:50:07) Kev: and
(0:50:09) Kev: Personally there when I look at you know rankings or you know
(0:50:13) Kev: The quality of something like there is in my opinion an element of the game's
(0:50:21) Kev: Influence or how iconic it is that is separate from its actual quality
(0:50:27) Kev: There are probably better just gameplay mechanic wise games out there than stardew
(0:50:35) Kev: I'd argue wildflowers is um, but
(0:50:39) Kev: But I'd like I'm still saying the throne goes to stardew hands down
(0:50:45) Kev: Cuz just the the length of its influence. It's still ongoing right concerned. They will never stop
(0:50:51) Kev: And it's it's always good when it comes out. It's always good
(0:50:57) Kev: And really how much of this list is you know on the shoulders of stardew, right?
(0:51:04) Kev: Yeah
(0:51:05) Kev: No arguments for me, stardew's king
(0:51:07) Al: Next we have Fields of Mistria. Best new farming game.
(0:51:11) Al: I could see why somebody would say this, but I do think that Coral Island has a claim to that.
(0:51:20) Kev: Sure, sure and how new does new have to be, you know
(0:51:25) Kev: But
(0:51:27) Al: Although Caro Island is on the late later on the list for something else, but I think it you know
(0:51:33) Kev: Yeah, this is kind of one of the the
(0:51:37) Kev: issues with trying to give every every game its own ranking or title right like
(0:51:42) Al: Yeah, yeah.
(0:51:43) Kev: You can say best new game asterisk not counting these other new games also on the list
(0:51:50) Al: Yeah, yeah, I do I do think that fields of mystery is up there. It's one of the best
(0:51:56) Al: So I think it deserves to be on the list but best new farming game. That's a hard one
(0:52:00) Kev: wait was fields a mystery of the one that came with the coins
(0:52:04) Al: What do you mean the coins what coins oh
(0:52:06) Kev: you remember the coins last week we talked about the the merch was it fields a mystery yeah yeah
(0:52:09) Al: Yeah, oh, yeah the pins the pins yeah, yeah
(0:52:12) Kev: the pins that's what it was yep it's it's gone it's gone up it's gone up in the rankings for me
(0:52:14) Al: Still can't get over that it's mad
(0:52:21) Al: And I also think that the problem is the fields of mystery is still missing a lot of stuff because it's an early access
(0:52:26) Al: There's still a lot of stuff that was missing and so to call it best new farming game feels you know, that's a bit
(0:52:28) Kev: Oh yeah, yeah
(0:52:34) Kev: Personally I disqualify any early access game for that particular ranking cuz
(0:52:40) Al: Yeah, I think it's fine to be on the list, but I would maybe say best early access currently,
(0:52:45) Kev: Yeah, there you go, there you go, exactly
(0:52:45) Al: like it's definitely the best farming game that I've played that's currently in our area.
(0:52:50) Kev: There you go exactly, okay
(0:52:54) Kev: So yeah, yeah, I'm not trying to disregard
(0:52:58) Kev: You know the quality of fields of mystery I haven't played it myself, but it looks confident just
(0:53:02) Al: it's good.
(0:53:03) Kev: It just there's some qualifiers here. They're a little questionable
(0:53:05) Al: Exactly.
(0:53:06) Al: Exactly.
(0:53:07) Al: All right, Kevin.
(0:53:08) Al: One for you.
(0:53:09) Al: One to stop best rating team.
(0:53:12) Kev: I mean
(0:53:15) Kev: Okay, first of all, we're looking at the stanley parable, you know devs writing I don't know if it's the same writers but
(0:53:22) Kev: The the devs work. They know how to make good writing or make a game with good writing
(0:53:27) Kev: So, duh.
(0:53:28) Kev: Also, like, what are we competing against here?
(0:53:32) Kev: What other farming games have good writing?
(0:53:36) Al: Stardew Valley.
(0:53:40) Kev: Now, does Stardew Valley have good writing?
(0:53:42) Kev: Or is it just good writing by comparison?
(0:53:44) Kev: Because again, what else are we looking at?
(0:53:48) Al: I mean, just because it's the only one of few that would be considered good doesn't
(0:53:56) Kev: yeah that's true that's true you know yeah that's fair that's fair right and here here's the thing
(0:54:00) Kev: with um stardew valley uh and I think any other farming game with quote unquote good writing um
(0:54:11) Kev: it's all characterization right character interactions little arcs little stories
(0:54:16) Kev: but how many game farming games actually have a full plot you know that uh that has a decent
(0:54:26) Kev: story and decent writing because wander stop has that
(0:54:27) Al: that feels subjective. I think most most have an overall story. Now you could say that most
(0:54:36) Al: of them aren't good, but I think most of them do have an overarching
(0:54:38) Kev: yeah okay fine I mean yes I mean star views okay stardust story is technically you inherit
(0:54:45) Kev: grandpa's farm and you know you're living the farm life or whatever but yeah as I said that's
(0:54:50) Al: The story is what you make it, that's the thing, right?
(0:54:53) Kev: part of it too right it's it's very a lot of these games are very open-ended right so that's
(0:54:57) Kev: hard to write a story for especially when you have no end point um wander stop has a very clear like
(0:55:06) Kev: goal and end point and the journey.
(0:55:08) Kev: Star 2 is great and fantastic. I think Star 2 gets very deep. There's a bit here or there, a character story that gets a little deep.
(0:55:12) Al: I double checked of the two writers of the Stanley Parable, one of them.
(0:55:35) Kev: But water stop gets deep, there's themes there's.
(0:55:39) Kev: And again, it might just be the nature of the beast because when you're doing open world sandbox farming games like that's going to be hard to do.
(0:55:49) Kev: When the goal of the game is just to, you know, Zen make a Zen experience farming or whatever.
(0:55:56) Kev: It wanders stop. It has great writing because it was designed for great writing, right? Like they were very clearly going for that.
(0:56:03) Kev: So it's a little unfair, but all the point is like there's there's no argument against it. Yeah
(0:56:08) Kev: That's right. He didn't get in any farming game
(0:56:12) Al: Next, we have Story of Seasons Friends of Miniro Town. Best for nostalgia.
(0:56:16) Al: And I have two issues with this. One, I don't think Friends of Miniro Town is one of the best
(0:56:16) Kev: I'm... come...
(0:56:23) Al: farming games. I wouldn't put it on my top 22.
(0:56:24) Kev: I'd give it to the other Story of Seasons remake.
(0:56:31) Al: Well, this is the thing, and this is the problem, is the best for nostalgia is so subjective.
(0:56:38) Kev: yeah
(0:56:39) Al: I mean, actually, I think that Stardew Valley is nostalgic.
(0:56:42) Al: For most harming game players, right?
(0:56:42) Kev: I was about to say that too you could argue stardew
(0:56:45) Kev: yeah I was about to say that you could argue stardew valley is the best for nostalgia
(0:56:50) Al: So this is obviously clearly from the creator of this list.
(0:56:54) Al: This is put in because it's best for nostalgia for them.
(0:56:56) Al: And that's fair enough.
(0:56:58) Al: I'm not trying to, but like that is quite a claim to put on something as best for nostalgia.
(0:57:04) Al: I don't think I would recommend this game to anybody unless they play the original.
(0:57:10) Al: And then, then I don't need to record.
(0:57:10) Kev: Yeah.
(0:57:12) Al: The game misses so many quality of life improvements that other games have now.
(0:57:17) Kev: Yeah.
(0:57:20) Al: And it's just, it's fine.
(0:57:22) Al: But you're better playing a different game.
(0:57:22) Kev: Yeah.
(0:57:24) Kev: Yeah, yeah, sure.
(0:57:25) Kev: But I guess that's why it's for nostalgia, right?
(0:57:27) Kev: Like, that's exactly easy.
(0:57:28) Al: I still think you're better playing a different game for nostalgia.
(0:57:31) Kev: Yeah, yeah, okay.
(0:57:32) Al: Like, as you say, for you, a wonderful life is much better for nostalgia.
(0:57:32) Kev: Yeah, I know that's fair.
(0:57:34) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:57:35) Kev: Yeah, I agree.
(0:57:36) Al: For me, Stardew was my first farming game.
(0:57:37) Kev: Yeah.
(0:57:38) Al: So it's going to be this nostalgic one.
(0:57:41) Kev: That's wild.
(0:57:42) Al: Been eight years.
(0:57:43) Kev: That is wild.
(0:57:45) Kev: Stardew Valley at this point.
(0:57:46) Kev: Really, I think at this point, even, you could say, yeah, you could say you could play for nostalgia now or for the nostalgia and invoke back when it came out.
(0:57:48) Al: Eight years, come on.
(0:57:57) Kev: Either way.
(0:57:59) Kev: Yeah.
(0:58:00) Kev: And you know what, I think this, you know, this is the first one we're really disagreeing with, right?
(0:58:04) Kev: And again, this list is from just one person, just one writer on this is basically her.
(0:58:11) Kev: You know, it's not like we're saying she's an authority and we're arguing against it.
(0:58:15) Kev: We're the authority.
(0:58:16) Kev: We're here to set the record.
(0:58:17) Al: No, no, no.
(0:58:18) Kev: Yeah.
(0:58:22) Al: Next, we have Coral Island, which I agree with being on the list,
(0:58:26) Al: but the reason it's on the list is best hand-drawn art.
(0:58:31) Al: OK, of all the reasons to put Coral Island on a list,
(0:58:36) Al: I don't know why you would choose that very specifically.
(0:58:40) Al: Is it hand-drawn art?
(0:58:41) Al: I didn't know that.
(0:58:42) Kev: I also didn't know that... Isn't it 3D? I don't know if you'd call that hand-drawn art then,
(0:58:54) Kev: right? I would assume a hand-drawn game has to by default be 2D. So that's...
(0:59:00) Al: Yeah, I don't know. I'm maybe they mean that maybe they mean
(0:59:04) Al: the character portraits because they're 2D.
(0:59:06) Kev: Yeah, I mean, maybe the designs were hand-drawn. Oh, maybe that, but even then, I don't know.
(0:59:12) Kev: I don't know about that.
(0:59:13) Al: don't clarify what they mean in the description they've got underneath the game there's nothing
(0:59:17) Al: no mention of the art so I don't know what they mean. I think this is a very good game that should
(0:59:22) Al: definitely be on the list but I would put like you know I think the thing it does best is adding
(0:59:27) Al: new small ideas and refining the idea of what a farming game is. I think what it does is people
(0:59:34) Al: who don't like 2D 8-bit games would enjoy this more because it's 3D models it's you know higher
(0:59:42) Al: quality images, I think.
(0:59:43) Al: Some people prefer that.
(0:59:45) Al: I think there are many reasons like that that you would play this.
(0:59:48) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Um, yeah, the coral island does deserve to be on this list.
(0:59:53) Kev: Just a very weird angle to go for. I agree.
(0:59:58) Al: Wildflowers, best for inclusivity of caste.
(1:00:06) Kev: Okay. So, um, this is,
(1:00:08) Al: Is that is this is this sound saying, I don't disagree, but
(1:00:14) Kev: yeah. Okay.
(1:00:16) Kev: This feels weird because, of course.
(1:00:18) Kev: I'm going to say Wildflowers, so 1000% deserves to be on this list, um, because it's an incredible game.
(1:00:24) Kev: Now it is true.
(1:00:25) Kev: It is probably one of the most inclusive casts because they went down to check, you know, they've made a checklist of how do we include every minority and, you know, every, uh, representation and identity we can think of and include them all because it very much feels like they did.
(1:00:42) Kev: Um, so, you know, there's no denying is an inclusive cast.
(1:00:46) Kev: Um, just but
(1:00:49) Kev: I feel like the game just there's probably a different angle. I'm not sure what it could be. But the game does other stuff better. Like that's not the standout thing for for wildflowers for me. But you know, maybe this is what we have to pick because I'm not going to argue it's the best game, right? I'm not going to choose it or start or whatever. And you just got to find a reason on the list. So you know what? Maybe maybe that's the best we could do. I don't know.
(1:01:15) Al: It very much feels like, yeah, here's the list, let me see what I can shoehorn these
(1:01:18) Kev: I... I...
(1:01:23) Al: descriptions into. Because next we have Sunhaven, best skill tree/leveling mechanic. And you know
(1:01:33) Al: what, you're not wrong, but one, do I want my farming game to have a skill tree? And two,
(1:01:41) Al: There is not much competition.
(1:01:43) Kev: Yeah. Oh, you know, I kind of respect Carmen for the this hustle. Like, how do you fit? How can you justify this game on this list? There's an art to that. I will say that. That's good. I like that best skill tree for your farming game. Yep. Oh, oh, snap.
(1:02:04) Al: This is the first game that neither of us have played, so probably not much we can say
(1:02:10) Al: about that, but yeah, I think it does a lot of interesting things that other games have
(1:02:17) Al: now done as well, in terms of like the spells and the RPG aspects and stuff like that. But
(1:02:25) Al: I mean, yeah, I mean, maybe it is still really good for that. I'm not a big RPG person. I
(1:02:30) Al: I know you do like your RPGs, so maybe, maybe you gotta-
(1:02:33) Kev: I do like my RPGs.
(1:02:34) Al: -play this game sometime, Kevin.
(1:02:36) Kev: I love my rocket-propelled grenades.
(1:02:41) Kev: Maybe I should.
(1:02:43) Kev: You know what?
(1:02:44) Kev: I like this list, because this is giving us a reason to maybe
(1:02:46) Kev: think about going back, Son-Haven.
(1:02:49) Al: Well, speaking of, speaking of, yeah.
(1:02:49) Kev: Yeah.
(1:02:50) Kev: If this-- hey, I just want to say,
(1:02:53) Kev: I will say I do love a good skill tree.
(1:02:56) Kev: So maybe I will check it out.
(1:02:59) Kev: Not just only looking for in my farming games,
(1:03:01) Kev: But when you-- my favorite--
(1:03:03) Kev: little trees are like the web kind that, you know, it's like nodes on like a spider web and you can expand to the next one.
(1:03:08) Kev: Anyways, go ahead, next one.
(1:03:10) Al: Well, speaking of games that we don't want to go back to, Rune Factory 4 Special, best
(1:03:18) Al: combat and dungeon integration.
(1:03:20) Al: And I would strongly disagree with this.
(1:03:23) Al: First of all, I don't think this should be on the list at all.
(1:03:26) Al: And secondly, in what world does this have the best combat?
(1:03:31) Al: What world does it have the best dungeon integration?
(1:03:33) Al: It was so bad.
(1:03:37) Al: It was very much our game that should not have been ported.
(1:03:40) Al: And should have been left where it was.
(1:03:43) Al: I think that Stardew Valley has really bad combat.
(1:03:48) Al: And it has better combat than this.
(1:03:50) Kev: No, oof, oof.
(1:03:52) Al: I do not like this game.
(1:03:55) Al: I do not like the combat.
(1:03:56) Al: I do not like the dungeons.
(1:03:59) Al: It's bad.
(1:04:02) Kev: I mean
(1:04:02) Al: I don't like it.
(1:04:03) Al: Now, I think that that doesn't mean this other people can't enjoy it.
(1:04:07) Kev: Sure
(1:04:07) Al: But calling this good combat is wild to me.
(1:04:11) Kev: Okay, I am I haven't played it so I can't you know directly speak to that but
(1:04:16) Kev: a room factory entry should probably on this list
(1:04:20) Kev: I don't know if this is the one I can't even comment if this room factory is better than other what's but
(1:04:28) Kev: But yeah, you know, I'm just gonna have to defer to your judgment here
(1:04:30) Al: I am not recommending a Rune Factory 4. That is a mad idea to recommend Rune Factory 4.
(1:04:32) Kev: I'll cuz I haven't played it
(1:04:40) Al: I think if you're wanting a Rune Factory, you want the most immersive and up-to-date one.
(1:04:44) Al: I don't think you want the one that is a port of a 12-year-old game.
(1:04:45) Kev: Yeah.
(1:04:49) Kev: Yeah, you know what, that's probably fair.
(1:04:53) Kev: Um, yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna argue with you there.
(1:04:56) Al: 13-year-old games are...
(1:04:56) Kev: You, you...
(1:04:57) Kev: Geez Louise.
(1:04:59) Kev: We're talk- Oh my gosh, that's combat olden starters.
(1:05:02) Kev: Combat! Geez Louise!
(1:05:04) Kev: Uh...
(1:05:04) Al: It's not good. Next we have, speaking of games that are better than Rune Factory 4, that is
(1:05:14) Kev: Ha ha ha well hey, that's unfair you could use that for literally any other
(1:05:15) Al: Harvestella. Oh yeah, don't you worry, we'll get to that. Harvestella, best main story.
(1:05:20) Kev: Maybe maybe no, that's not true. There's at least one nevermind. Okay, go ahead. It's harvest Ella. I forgot about that
(1:05:31) Kev: Okay, it's made by squire Enoch sure fair I haven't played it I can tell you probably has a better main story than everything else
(1:05:38) Al: Yeah.
(1:05:38) Al: Yeah.
(1:05:40) Al: Again, this is one that neither of us has played.
(1:05:40) Kev: Yeah, I'm not gonna argue it's made by screenings
(1:05:44) Kev: You know, I don't know if you know this out. They've made a story or two in their day
(1:05:48) Al: Yeah, yeah, that is fair. Yeah, I'm not, I think I get why, I get why this is on the
(1:05:51) Kev: So, yeah, I'm fine if you want to give them that that's that's fine, um, yeah
(1:05:58) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's fine that's fair sure
(1:05:58) Al: list. It's not for me. 10, Roots of Patra, best for shaking up the genre. Um, I don't
(1:06:09) Al: understand this. I understand why this is on the list. I think the Roots of Patra is,
(1:06:15) Al: As far as I can tell, a good game.
(1:06:16) Kev: Yep
(1:06:18) Al: I, however, don't think it shakes up the genre much at all, right?
(1:06:25) Kev: That see that could go for coral island or wildflowers right like even
(1:06:26) Al: Go, I'm not even, I don't even think they do particularly.
(1:06:34) Al: Like I would really struggle to figure out what I just, what I think best shakes
(1:06:38) Al: up the genre, but I don't think it's really a patch up because I think this is entirely
(1:06:42) Al: based on, Oh, it's set in the past.
(1:06:44) Al: And so everything looks different.
(1:06:44) Kev: Yeah, I I was about this
(1:06:46) Al: And you're like, oh, instead of.
(1:06:48) Al: sprinklers, we have, uh, the watering channels, I can't remember the
(1:06:52) Al: irrigation channels and you're like, okay, but like, that's not
(1:06:55) Al: fundamentally different, right?
(1:06:56) Kev: Yeah. Yeah.
(1:06:57) Al: Like everything is just like, oh, it's like, it's like saying Flintstones.
(1:07:02) Al: Uh, you know, shakes up, um, uh, it comes and you're just like, no, it doesn't.
(1:07:05) Kev: Sitcoms.
(1:07:08) Al: It's just, everything is a dinosaur, right?
(1:07:11) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
(1:07:11) Al: Like it's a funny concept and I'm not saying it's not good, but it doesn't
(1:07:15) Al: do change anything fundamentally.
(1:07:18) Al: Right.
(1:07:18) Al: You know, it just.
(1:07:20) Kev: So, you know, what's funny is I'd argue to include Brutes of Pie show on this list,
(1:07:25) Kev: But my...
(1:07:26) Kev: Tyler or you know, the the award would be for almost the exact opposite reason of what they're saying
(1:07:32) Kev: I'd give it the reward for the best stardew clone
(1:07:37) Al: Yeah, that's fair.
(1:07:37) Kev: Because it I think it follows, you know, the stardew formula to a T
(1:07:43) Kev: But it does its flavor of the prehistoric past very well, but that's not checking up the game
(1:07:48) Kev: It's just it's good execution a good art style slash setting
(1:07:54) Kev: It just does what it sets out to do very well.
(1:07:56) Kev: Um, so yeah, it's a rich box, which is a great game.
(1:08:00) Kev: An easy recommend to anyone who's a Stardew fan, but I'm not going to say it's
(1:08:04) Kev: shaking up the game because it is, it is star doing all over.
(1:08:04) Al: I think you could say best setting would be a good one possibly as well. In terms of the other
(1:08:13) Kev: I guess.
(1:08:16) Al: games on the list, I think it's the one that's most different in terms of that aspect, but that's it
(1:08:21) Al: I think fundamentally. I personally would go that Coral Island is the best RG clone.
(1:08:29) Al: Next we have Summer and Mara, best for sailing. Yeah, agreed. 100%
(1:08:34) Al: played this game yet. Buy this game. It's great. Buy it. Buy it now. It's a good game. Great game.
(1:08:36) Kev: Okay, you know, okay, this is kind of almost an aside, but hold on. Is it on the list? Let me
(1:08:45) Kev: double check. I don't remember the full list. That's a lot of games. But the question I have
(1:08:51) Kev: for some of these titles, especially the 2D hand art award, where's the line drawn for farming game?
(1:09:03) Kev: Why is Spirit Fair not included on this list?
(1:09:06) Kev: Why is Spirit Fair not included on this list?
(1:09:06) Al: that is a fair question. Samara definitely has farming and it's quite fundamental to the game.
(1:09:30) Al: Yes, it definitely doesn't. Spiritfarer the sailing is almost accidental. You click a
(1:09:36) Kev: is, the sailing is a load, it is a loading screen in the
(1:09:38) Al: button and it takes you to a place and it's just slow travel. Exactly. That is a whole
(1:09:43) Kev: background. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
(1:09:46) Al: aspect to it. You take time to get places and it makes you slow down. I'm not going
(1:09:52) Al: to say whether that's good or bad, but it is a thing. Whereas Summer in Mara is wind
(1:09:58) Al: waker sailing, right?
(1:10:00) Al: Like, that's what you're looking for.
(1:10:01) Al: And I think it's fantastic in that it, I had so much joy playing
(1:10:06) Al: Summer and Mara.
(1:10:09) Kev: Oh, you said Wind Waker, so that's high praise. I might I might have to check it out if it's Wind Waker's ailing.
(1:10:16) Al: I think it's so much fun and the characters and the story in this game are so much fun.
(1:10:20) Al: I enjoy this game so much. There's a reason I keep playing Chibig games.
(1:10:22) Kev: Yeah, all right.
(1:10:27) Al: It's because I played Summer in Mara and fell in love with it and the world.
(1:10:27) Kev: Yeah, they made some remar- ooh.
(1:10:32) Kev: Ooh, that's that's high praise. All right, you know what? It's worth a shot. I'll look at it at some point probably.
(1:10:38) Al: Farming Simulator 22. Best farming sim for realism.
(1:10:42) Kev: Duh, that's all I have to say
(1:10:45) Al: Well, so I have a couple of questions. Why 22? Why not one of the later ones, right?
(1:10:54) Kev: Well
(1:10:54) Al: That's an interesting choice.
(1:10:56) Kev: My you know what my theory is this she made this list when 22 is the latest one it didn't update it
(1:11:01) Al: Fair enough, fair enough. Yeah, that would be fair.
(1:11:03) Kev: Just put farming simulator X fill in whatever number you want
(1:11:08) Al: Yeah, farming simulator brackets, the latest one. Yeah, this is probably true.
(1:11:17) Al: Do people actually want this? No, not do people. Obviously, there are people who want it.
(1:11:23) Al: It is a market. The same people that like, well, not necessarily, in the same sort of way as people
(1:11:29) Al: like truck simulator and stuff like that. There are always going to be people who like this sort
(1:11:35) Al: sort of realistic thing.
(1:11:36) Al: I don't think there's overlap, much overlap.
(1:11:38) Al: Between stardew people and farming.
(1:11:42) Kev: Oh probably not which is very weird right because it's they are both you know hardcore
(1:11:48) Kev: underlying farming games but so different at the same time um but yeah I mean I agree nothing
(1:11:55) Kev: we did an episode on farming simulator finally because I don't remember who played it I don't
(1:11:59) Kev: think it was either of us there you go but you know most of us have never had much of an itch
(1:12:00) Al: It was Johnny and Cody.
(1:12:07) Kev: to play for Arming Simulator. I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure it's great even just it doesn't.
(1:12:12) Kev: It doesn't call to me because I'd rather you know spend time in Roots of Pacha or whatever, but
(1:12:17) Al: literally any other game.
(1:12:20) Kev: Well, well you say that now I got I can think of a game or two that could challenge that
(1:12:24) Al: Okay, yeah, okay. We'll get to that. We'll get to that.
(1:12:28) Al: Faith Arm, best for cross-platform play. Okay, here you go. This is the game, this is the
(1:12:31) Kev: This it okay, I haven't played faith farm
(1:12:35) Kev: So I'm not I can't call it you comment on the quality
(1:12:40) Al: game I would put for best for shaking up the genre. This is it. That just decided.
(1:12:42) Kev: Oh
(1:12:45) Kev: All right, well there you go, okay, if it's if that is okay that is a better, you know award than cross-platform
(1:12:53) Al: It's it's it's not a game that I want to play a lot
(1:12:57) Al: But it is a game that does a lot of things that I want to be in other
(1:13:01) Kev: Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Well, there you go. Okay, that that is something then worthy of being on the list
(1:13:08) Kev: Boy cross-platform play that is we're stretching here
(1:13:12) Kev: reaching
(1:13:14) Al: Yeah, well, speaking of reaching, research story, best for puzzle lovers. I've never
(1:13:15) Kev: For
(1:13:24) Al: really thought of research story as a puzzle game, but I guess you could go with that.
(1:13:27) Kev: Yeah
(1:13:31) Al: I feel like maybe Botany Manor would be a better choice for a puzzle farming game.
(1:13:36) Kev: Yes, yes
(1:13:40) Kev: Roots of Pacha
(1:13:40) Al: I wonder stop had puzzle aspects to it in terms...
(1:13:44) Al: of the potions, right? Or the tea, sorry, the tea, sorry. Oh, really? Okay.
(1:13:46) Kev: Ah
(1:13:47) Kev: Not not that no, I wouldn't say that not really cuz they get basically give you instructions
(1:13:53) Kev: There's a book you read through and you match it. It's not you're not figuring it out. I'd say
(1:13:54) Al: Okay, okay. But Botany Manor is definitely puzzle- puzzle-esque,
(1:13:58) Kev: Sure roots of Pacha has some puzzles in the dungeons like
(1:13:58) Al: that's the whole point of it, is you're going through and thinking about it.
(1:14:04) Kev: They're not even like I'm gonna say they're amazing
(1:14:06) Kev: But this is a weird category to begin with cuz you know farming games generally aren't puzzle heavy
(1:14:13) Kev: And yeah, botany manner. I agree cuz the whole game is a mystery basically, right?
(1:14:19) Kev: Piecing together what's going on?
(1:14:22) Kev: Yeah
(1:14:23) Kev: Yeah, I don't know. What what would we give research story?
(1:14:28) Kev: the award for
(1:14:30) Al: best science?
(1:14:31) Kev: There you go
(1:14:35) Kev: That's the best represent
(1:14:36) Kev: She's in Cody that that's probably not true. She is actually in a game
(1:14:38) Al: No, no, that's apico. Come on. Let's not be silly.
(1:14:44) Al: Okay. Farm together. Best for a silly, unserious time. I haven't played this game. I would
(1:14:54) Al: struggle to believe that it's better of a silly, unserious time than overthrown, though.
(1:15:04) Kev: man. It's not out yet, but I'd even say Southfield. Yeah, yeah,
(1:15:09) Al: Yeah, yeah, another. Yeah, yeah. Is that still not out? My word.
(1:15:14) Kev: I'm waiting. I can't wait for that one. But I think they did
(1:15:18) Al: It's been ages since they were meant to release the Early Access, wasn't it?
(1:15:24) Kev: enter early access. Or was that no? Oh, gosh, I don't remember.
(1:15:25) Al: No, they didn't. They had a date, and they decided not. They ended up delaying it.
(1:15:30) Kev: Oh snap. I'm gonna go check that out. You know what?
(1:15:34) Kev: Under the right circumstance you could nominate Stardew for this game this award
(1:15:42) Al: Sure, but we don't want to give Stardew everything, right?
(1:15:43) Kev: Yeah, yeah, but I honestly haven't played farm together so I don't know maybe I'm uh
(1:15:49) Kev: You know dismissing it too much. I can't really say but
(1:15:54) Kev: There are games that yeah even overthrown to be honest you guys are running around holding sawmills
(1:16:01) Kev: Naruto dashing over water. That's that's pretty hard to compare.
(1:16:04) Al: Exactly.
(1:16:08) Al: Paleo pines, best for dinosaur pets. Hard to argue with that one, right?
(1:16:10) Kev: oh yeah yeah and you know it's a I mean you know bias or whatever but it's a good game
(1:16:17) Al: I think I feel like there's a bit more of competition for this than you might initially
(1:16:18) Kev: like i'm gonna recommend it so yeah fine you that's the one we have to do to get it in fine
(1:16:29) Kev: oh that's
(1:16:43) Kev: I'd argue minecraft could take this one
(1:16:49) Al: Yeah, that's a fair argument.
(1:16:53) Kev: Yeah, I bet like I'm trying to okay what other like true I haven't played Dean come
(1:17:00) Kev: Is that actually true survival like you can die?
(1:17:04) Kev: Cuz I feel like that's important aspect to survival, right?
(1:17:10) Kev: Yeah, I don't know I'd have to think what other
(1:17:13) Kev: farming games have some sort of, I mean Jack even, again stardew right, like a lot of these
(1:17:18) Kev: stardew, you don't have sort of stardew, you don't fully die per se, you just fall unconscious.
(1:17:24) Al: Well, I mean, what is dying in these things, right? Do you die in Minecraft?
(1:17:25) Kev: Yeah, kind of, yes actually respawn but you do too, like yeah okay fine fine fine fine fine.
(1:17:31) Al: Yeah, but that's essentially what's happening with Stardew as well, it's the same mechanic.
(1:17:36) Al: I'm just being, I'm just arguing.
(1:17:38) Kev: yeah yeah it's fair enough either what I mean again I am
(1:17:43) Kev: played deacon so maybe i'm again just totally missing what's going on here but I feel like
(1:17:48) Kev: that is a tougher um genre or award to think about um than what they're going for here but uh but i
(1:17:57) Kev: don't know I don't know that'll sound like a fool um
(1:17:58) Al: Next, we have Echos of the Plum Grove, best for multi-generational play. This, again, feels similar to some others in that it is technically true, but...
(1:18:15) Kev: Yeah, exactly, right? I can't think of another one.
(1:18:20) Al: Because you never actually end up playing as your child in a wonderful life, do you?
(1:18:25) Kev: That is the exact thing I was about to say.
(1:18:28) Kev: And if you play the game right, they can inherit the farm supposedly, but you don't play as them or whatever.
(1:18:36) Kev: Oh, yeah. So, yeah. Winner by default.
(1:18:43) Kev: Good for you, Echos of the Plump, bro.
(1:18:45) Al: It probably should be on there. It's an interesting enough mechanic that some people would find
(1:18:45) Kev: It is, I agree, you know.
(1:18:49) Al: that interesting. I don't like the survival aspect of that in that how easy it is to die,
(1:18:56) Kev: you know
(1:18:58) Al: too. OK, number 19. Oh.
(1:19:01) Kev: all right the reason we decided to do this episode
(1:19:07) Kev: because we saw this list we saw 19 and we were just like both wtf um
(1:19:14) Al: Sugardew Island best short farming sim. No, yes, kind of. As in, no, it's not the best anything. Yes, it is short. And is it a farming sim? Yes, I guess technically it is a farming sim.
(1:19:32) Al: If you're going to try and make some justification list, at least pretend that the shop is an interesting mechanic and use that instead.
(1:19:44) Al: I hate this game so much. It is such a bad game. It is such a cash grab game, if you will. There's so much about this game that I hate.
(1:19:54) Kev: yeah yeah I mean like so Stardew clone is such a massive part of the genre right
(1:19:58) Al: Oh, bad game.
(1:20:03) Kev: and then so we see both extremes of the spectrum right we see games like coral
(1:20:09) Kev: island or paleo or roots Apache and then at the other end yeah sugar do island
(1:20:16) Al: I wouldn't say this was a stardew clone, stardew clone, I expect a good well-rounded game, this is not, this doesn't have 90% of the mechanics from stardew.
(1:20:26) Kev: Oh, okay, there you go.
(1:20:27) Kev: That's fair too.
(1:20:28) Al: It has one, one mechanic, it's the farming, that's it.
(1:20:33) Al: If you like farming day after day and never having any real progression, other than you're farming more, then go for it, but it is a bad game, this should not be on this list.
(1:20:44) Al: It is the one that I'm just, I'm just,
(1:20:46) Al: I do not know it's bad, it's bad, bad game.
(1:20:50) Kev: Mmm. Could you argue um, oh gosh, what was the name of a tiny garden to dethrone it here?
(1:20:58) Al: Yeah, there we go. Tiny garden, best short farming sim. Also, also could be in the running for best puzzles.
(1:21:02) Kev: There you go
(1:21:05) Kev: Yeah, there you go there yeah, oh you there you go
(1:21:09) Kev: Sugar duality doesn't have a crank mechanic does it just saying
(1:21:12) Al: Alright, time for one for Kevin to argue with. Over magica, best creature.
(1:21:20) Kev: Oh, okay. I haven't played over magica. So this is gonna be hard. I can't argue against it per se, but let's see
(1:21:26) Al: No, but you can argue for something else.
(1:21:28) Kev: Yeah, I'm trying to think here we got Moonstone Island which
(1:21:32) Al: I mean, that's the obvious one.
(1:21:34) Kev: Yeah, that's the obvious one
(1:21:37) Kev: You know what? Honestly, you know, I'd give it to paleo pines to be honest like I'd give it because
(1:21:44) Kev: paleo pines is a creature collector, I mean, you know, not the standard pokeball or whatever, but
(1:21:50) Kev: your call amassing a whole, you know
(1:21:54) Kev: farm ranch filled with dinosaurs to help you out you can collect them in different colors and stuff and
(1:22:01) Kev: they
(1:22:03) Kev: They actually help you with the farming that you know
(1:22:06) Kev: That's like any time I think of the concept of a creature collector in farming
(1:22:12) Kev: The biggest thing is the creatures should be directly interacting with your farm, right?
(1:22:17) Kev: You want both parts to be substantial and you want them to work.
(1:22:20) Kev: You want to work together.
(1:22:20) Al: Which which over magica does do
(1:22:50) Kev: The farming part of it is just to create items to catch more monsters with.
(1:22:54) Kev: That is all.
(1:22:56) Kev: And the monsters don't help you do anything with the farm.
(1:23:00) Kev: So, yeah, that is not what I'd want when I try to blend these two categories together.
(1:23:08) Kev: So, you know what? Maybe OpenMagica does deserve it.
(1:23:11) Kev: Because these are monsters or magical creatures or whatever as opposed to just dinosaurs.
(1:23:17) Kev: Um, I mean, I love dinosaurs and all, but, uh,
(1:23:20) Kev: getting the chance to go creative with fictional creatures.
(1:23:24) Kev: That's fun too.
(1:23:24) Kev: So, um, I like the fairy slime.
(1:23:27) Kev: I will say that, or bug, whatever that is.
(1:23:31) Al: I do I will say what so like in general, I think that this I've
(1:23:37) Al: still not played over magic. I'm waiting for the 1.0. And I do
(1:23:40) Al: I do think that there seems to be a lot of love and care that's
(1:23:42) Al: gone into this game. And this is one of those ones that's built
(1:23:46) Al: by an individual. So I do not want to be too harsh on these
(1:23:51) Al: things. I will say it's I feel like it's difficult to justify
(1:23:58) Al: the best creature collection farming game.
(1:24:02) Al: As where all the creatures are blobs.
(1:24:05) Kev: That is true. Yeah, that is true.
(1:24:07) Al: And it's not to say that that is a bad thing and it's not to say that there hasn't been thought gone into all the designs because they're not just.
(1:24:16) Al: Different colored blobs they have different designs and some of them do look quite interesting but fundamentally, they are still all blobs.
(1:24:18) Kev: - Yeah, yeah.
(1:24:24) Kev: They are, yeah.
(1:24:26) Kev: - Mm.
(1:24:27) Kev: You know what the problem is?
(1:24:28) Kev: We need more entries in this specific
(1:24:30) Kev: combination of genres. (laughs)
(1:24:32) Kev: Give it to me, give me more, straight to my veins.
(1:24:36) Kev: That's what I want more than anything in the world.
(1:24:39) Kev: A farming sim where your creatures help you.
(1:24:41) Kev: Oh.
(1:24:42) Al: I think Sunhaven does that as well, although maybe it's more spells, I think, than creatures,
(1:24:44) Kev: Ooh, ooh.
(1:24:46) Kev: Ooh, I got a place on haven.
(1:24:48) Kev: Darn it.
(1:24:50) Kev: Yeah.
(1:24:51) Al: but.
(1:24:52) Al: All right.
(1:24:53) Kev: Okay.
(1:24:53) Al: Rune 21, Rune Factory, Guardians of Azuma, best for voice acting.
(1:24:54) Kev: Now for the one that's gonna cause me to actually scream.
(1:25:03) Kev: Okay, I'm holding in the screams.
(1:25:07) Kev: Okay, to be fair.
(1:25:08) Kev: I've not played Guardians of Azuma and it is anime.
(1:25:12) Kev: It's by, you know, big money pocket.
(1:25:14) Kev: So I'm sure the voice acting is good here.
(1:25:16) Kev: But, uh... I- the-
(1:25:18) Kev: Let me look at the- the cast list.
(1:25:22) Kev: 'Cause, I mean, obviously, like, the- you know, the joke, the- the low-hanging fruit would be wildflowers, right?
(1:25:26) Kev: 'Cause we got Ray, we got, um...
(1:25:30) Kev: Uh, we got, uh, Valerie.
(1:25:32) Kev: Um, right? Like...
(1:25:34) Kev: The voice acting was solid in, uh...
(1:25:36) Kev: In wildflowers.
(1:25:38) Kev: But, honestly, like, if I- to be honest with myself, looking in the mirror,
(1:25:44) Kev: The hard truth, as much as I love Ray and- and the whole cast-
(1:25:48) Kev: Overall, Sockin' has got some pretty dang good voice acting!
(1:25:52) Kev: Sockin' was pretty solid, even if one of them is just a baby.
(1:25:57) Al: - Yeah.
(1:25:58) Kev: Um, they might have killed it as that baby.
(1:26:00) Kev: Um, but, uh...
(1:26:02) Kev: But, uh... But, yeah, no, like, Sockin' alone is a tour de force, uh, performance.
(1:26:08) Kev: Um...
(1:26:08) Kev: But, yeah, I- I don't-
(1:26:10) Kev: Again, I'm just arguing for one I do know.
(1:26:14) Kev: Um, I haven't played Guardians of Ozma, so maybe the voice acting is good there.
(1:26:18) Kev: I wouldn't be surprised. Again, anime, game, um...
(1:26:22) Kev: Big, you know, big budget money company.
(1:26:26) Kev: Um, so...
(1:26:28) Kev: Yeah, no, they could be right. They could be dead wrong.
(1:26:31) Al: My question is, why is this not replacing Rune Factory 4S
(1:26:36) Al: when this is a good game and that's a bad game?
(1:26:36) Kev: Ah, there you go.
(1:26:39) Kev: And then there's that.
(1:26:41) Al: Like, best for combat?
(1:26:41) Kev: Yeah, that's-- yeah, there you go.
(1:26:42) Al: How about this one?
(1:26:44) Kev: Is this the dancing one, right?
(1:26:48) Al: No, that was Harvard Stairline.
(1:26:48) Kev: Or no, is that the other--
(1:26:50) Kev: no, no, no, no.
(1:26:52) Kev: There was definitely a rune factory with the dancing.
(1:26:55) Kev: It might be a different one.
(1:26:58) Kev: Regardless, yeah, I'm sure there's
(1:27:00) Kev: better combat in this game.
(1:27:05) Al: Oh, yeah. No, you're right. This was this way.
(1:27:07) Kev: See, at least even just mechanically, that might mean
(1:27:13) Kev: much, but flavor-wise, that's a little more maybe.
(1:27:18) Al: - Yeah, I mean, you're still doing kind of standard combat.
(1:27:20) Al: It's just kind of fluffed up around.
(1:27:23) Kev: Yeah, exactly.
(1:27:24) Kev: So probably better than rune factory 4, probably,
(1:27:29) Al: All right, you mentioned it already, Sakuna number 22, the final game on the list,
(1:27:34) Al: best for detailed rice farming.
(1:27:36) Kev: I hate this. I hate this because I love this game so much and that's the best we're gonna come up with
(1:27:45) Al: It is such a bizarre choice for like, yes, okay, it is the best detailed rice farming game.
(1:27:53) Al: Name a number one. Name a second one, please.
(1:28:00) Kev: Again again, this is one person who makes the list, right?
(1:28:03) Kev: So, you know, you got to do what you got to do to get sucked.
(1:28:06) Kev: I'm not there, I get it, but it kills me that, you know what, jeez, why didn't I think of it?
(1:28:12) Kev: How is this not clearing Rune Factory for best combat?
(1:28:16) Kev: The combat's excellent in Sakuna.
(1:28:18) Al: Good question. Good question.
(1:28:19) Kev: Like, holy moly, it's incredible.
(1:28:22) Kev: Um, the voice acting's solid, um, it's not hand-
(1:28:25) Al: This game is, is, is, is very good in lots of ways.
(1:28:29) Al: I just couldn't get past the race farming.
(1:28:31) Al: It just drove me to men.
(1:28:32) Kev: Yeah, you know what? You know what? Okay, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it is the hardest thing to get over for sure, the rice farming, right?
(1:28:38) Al: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Bizarre decision, but as you say, you got to do what you got
(1:28:40) Kev: Why are we giving the award for the hard, the most divisive part of the game?
(1:28:50) Al: to do if you want to get on the list.
(1:28:52) Kev: I, you know, all right, Carmen, listen to me, listen to me closely.
(1:28:56) Kev: I would rather you giving it for best game to be adapted into an anime.
(1:29:00) Al: Yeah, that was the other thing I was thinking of that was the other thing I was thinking
(1:29:02) Kev: If we had to go for one where there's nothing else, go for that one.
(1:29:10) Al: This was an interesting list. I think there were only really two games that we actively disagreed
(1:29:15) Al: on being on the list, and that would be Rune Factory 4S and Sugardew Island. The rest I think
(1:29:18) Kev: sugar dew sugar dew
(1:29:23) Al: we agree probably should be on the list, but we would maybe give some different reasonings,
(1:29:28) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. Like clearly Carmen, I mean this is an extensive
(1:29:37) Kev: list of anyone to have played all these games. She's running CozyGameReviews.com. Like I joked
(1:29:44) Kev: that she's one person, but she's definitely has some sort of authority just from experience from,
(1:29:49) Kev: you know, playing all these games. So good for Carmen for coming up with this list. And yeah,
(1:29:56) Kev: And most of it is solid, like we said,
(1:29:57) Kev: only two were...
(1:29:58) Kev: We're really scratching our heads over.
(1:30:02) Kev: But it is a solid list.
(1:30:04) Kev: And I would hand this list to most people, like, hey,
(1:30:06) Kev: choose something off this, so you want to get into farming
(1:30:08) Kev: games, right?
(1:30:10) Kev: Yeah, lots of easy recommends on this.
(1:30:11) Al: I would, yeah, I would show them this list with a few deleted.
(1:30:17) Kev: With the big X over Sugar 2 Island.
(1:30:21) Kev: Yeah, no, of course.
(1:30:22) Kev: But yeah, no, this was fun to do our little YouTube
(1:30:29) Kev: reaction thumbnail on someone else's list.
(1:30:30) Al: You won't believe what number, what was it number 19 number?
(1:30:36) Kev: Yeah, 19 was the one we didn't like.
(1:30:42) Kev: Yeah, it was 19.
(1:30:43) Kev: 19-- or wait, was it?
(1:30:44) Al: No, it wasn't it was number 18. No, it was number 19. Yeah, you're right.
(1:30:45) Kev: Yeah, yeah, 19.
(1:30:47) Kev: It was 19, yeah.
(1:30:49) Kev: Yeah.
(1:30:49) Al: 22 best farming games. You won't believe number 19 because it's wrong.
(1:30:53) Kev: Yeah.
(1:30:56) Kev: Oh, man.
(1:30:59) Al: I don't often people tell people the wrong about what they enjoy,
(1:30:59) Kev: I got-- you're-- yeah, yeah, sure.
(1:31:01) Al: but if you enjoy Sugaju Island, you're wrong. That's it. I'm sorry.
(1:31:05) Al: Everything else on this list, even Ring Factory 4S,
(1:31:07) Al: I can understand why someone would enjoy that. Do not play Sugaju Island. Do not play it.
(1:31:15) Kev: OK, so this list is exciting because it's
(1:31:18) Kev: a good list for, say, you or me or anyone
(1:31:22) Kev: else who listened to the show of, hey, maybe I missed a game.
(1:31:25) Kev: Maybe I should go back to Sunday even and give that a shot.
(1:31:30) Kev: Maybe I do want to check. I've been wanting to check at Harvest Della. Why haven't I played it yet, etc, etc.
(1:31:36) Kev: So yeah, this has been fun.
(1:31:38) Kev: Now the next obvious step, get Carmen on the show and have her do her defense.
(1:31:42) Al: Well, yes, so I have contacted Carmen to see if she would be interested in coming on and defending her list. I would be up for that. I have not received a response yet, just doing my journalistic right to reply. The door is open, Carmen, if you ever want to defend your list.
(1:31:52) Kev: Yeah, of course. All the heckling aside, this is a great list. Good work, Carmen. Very cool
(1:32:02) Al: As I say, this is all done in jest. In general, not a bad list.
(1:32:15) Kev: of you to have done this. So thank you. Thank you for handing us an easy episode.
(1:32:20) Al: Yes, absolutely. Especially when we delayed the Tales of Shire episode again.
(1:32:22) Kev: Al, we have a problem, Al. Are you gonna let Silksong beat you? Are you gonna let Silksong
(1:32:27) Al: It's coming soon, I promise!
(1:32:39) Kev: fuck up before the Shire episode? Lighten a fire under you, Al.
(1:32:42) Al: Um, so let's say that I don't want to promise anything, but no, I don't foresee anything.
(1:32:56) Al: Okay, there could, it could still be delayed again, possibly not silk song, but hopefully it will come out before silk song.
(1:33:00) Kev: Yeah
(1:33:06) Kev: Oh
(1:33:08) Kev: That's uh
(1:33:09) Al: Can't believe we got silk song before GTA six.
(1:33:11) Kev: I
(1:33:12) Al: Uh,
(1:33:13) Kev: That's true, that's true
(1:33:16) Kev: But yeah, no, I'm just saying, you know, we got to have these
(1:33:19) Kev: You want to get it in there right? You want to have that badge came out before silk song?
(1:33:24) Al: Most things did, all right. Thank you, Kevin, for joining me for this episode. Is there
(1:33:32) Kev: Well, I mean, I'd love to tell them a couple hours about why I love Kirby air riders drink, but that is not for this particular episode.
