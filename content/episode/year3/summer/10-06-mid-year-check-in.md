# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al.
(0:00:36) Kev: My name is Kevin.
(0:00:38) Al: And we are here today to talk about cottagecore games.
(0:00:41) Kev: Wooo!
(0:00:43) Al: I'm back from my holiday. Hello.
(0:00:45) Kev: You... from the Isle of Men...
(0:00:49) Kev: I don't know where you were.
(0:00:49) Al: All the men. Yeah, I know that's where I was. I love man, as usual. Yes, I'm back.
(0:00:51) Kev: I don't know where you were.
(0:00:54) Kev: Okay.
(0:00:56) Kev: Yeah.
(0:00:58) Kev: The opposite of No Man's Sky.
(0:01:00) Al: Almanska, yeah. I'm melting because I got home and it's apparently 25 degrees and that's too hot for me.
(0:01:01) Kev: Heh. Heh heh.
(0:01:10) Kev: So, look, the people, you know a lot of Americans,
(0:01:15) Kev: and we love to give you a hard time
(0:01:16) Kev: because those are nothing numbers for us,
(0:01:19) Kev: but I will say, you know,
(0:01:20) Kev: I think something a lot of Americans easily overlook
(0:01:24) Kev: is you're pretty far up north.
(0:01:26) Al: Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm further north. I'm further
(0:01:26) Kev: Well, like latitude-wise, right?
(0:01:28) Kev: Like you're Canada north, which gets frosty.
(0:01:32) Al: north than all America except that last
(0:01:33) Kev: Yeah.
(0:01:36) Kev: Yeah, so, you know, that's fair,
(0:01:39) Kev: But, but we're still going to.
(0:01:40) Kev: I'm laughing, you know. (laughs)
(0:01:41) Al: Well, also, it's interesting because like every time that someone like from a warmer
(0:01:47) Al: place moves to the UK and then the experience, the UK summer, they're like, oh, people weren't
(0:01:53) Al: just talking nonsense. It is, it's different. And it's hard to explain. I don't know why,
(0:01:59) Al: but it is just, it is, I don't know. Like I don't know, because I've never lived in
(0:02:03) Kev: Wha-
(0:02:04) Al: a hotter place. But all I will say is that lots of people who have lived in really hot
(0:02:09) Al: places come to the UK
(0:02:11) Al: and say that the heat is different.
(0:02:13) Kev: Huh, I mmm. I don't know I mean well
(0:02:16) Kev: I will say this right like one thing you guys aren't built for warmer temperatures generally speaking not like
(0:02:23) Kev: Alright, so you know down here in the American South for instance, right?
(0:02:27) Kev: We have air conditioning so you know you can go in a building and escape the heat
(0:02:32) Kev: And that's not always the case over there in there
(0:02:33) Al: Yeah, my office is currently warmer than outside. So, but also I am ginger, so definitely not built
(0:02:37) Kev: Yeah, there you go see so say yeah
(0:02:43) Al: for heat. Yeah, yeah, I use factor 50 sun cream. All right. This episode we're going to do,
(0:02:44) Kev: Here's biologically sensitive to pretty much everything
(0:02:58) Al: uh, I think, I think Cody and Kevin insinuated that this episode would be the tales of the
(0:03:03) Al: shower episode is not, that's going to be in a couple of weeks, just because we're having some
(0:03:07) Al: scheduling things and, uh, you know, want to make sure we've, uh, the game has been played properly
(0:03:13) Al: before it is covered. So that will be in a couple of weeks. Um, this week we're going to talk about,
(0:03:19) Al: we're going to do a major check-in, see how we're feeling about games for the year. Um, this is
(0:03:24) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:03:24) Al: obviously not our game of the year episode that will be in five months, no, four months, four
(0:03:30) Kev: Pudby
(0:03:32) Al: More months!
(0:03:33) Kev: That's not I'm going to pretend you didn't say that I'm going to pretend you didn't say that
(0:03:34) Al: That's how time works, apparently.
(0:03:41) Al: It's halfway through August, and that means it's four and a half months to the end of the year.
(0:03:44) Kev: That's not true
(0:03:46) Al: It also means it's nearly my birthday, but anyway.
(0:03:50) Kev: Well, so get the two-third year check-in
(0:03:54) Al: We are going to... We're just calling... I said mid, not half. I said mid-years,
(0:03:59) Al: Yeah, so we're gonna talk about what we would talk about again.
(0:04:04) Al: And what we think might be in the running for Game of the Year this year.
(0:04:08) Al: We'll see. I'll be interested to see whether we're right or not.
(0:04:12) Kev: All right, I'm first question have I played enough games to come up with three?
(0:04:18) Al: Ah, who cares? Before that, we've got a bunch of news. But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:04:26) Kev: Oh
(0:04:27) Kev: Okay, so
(0:04:30) Kev: Okay, where should I start? Okay, you know, I'll start with this
(0:04:32) Kev: Okay, the battle cats mobile game with the funny you are our art in the cats. They're goofy looking
(0:04:39) Kev: I've discussed it on the show before
(0:04:42) Kev: So that's a game I go on and off and generally something draws me back to it and
(0:04:50) Kev: The what is the number one crossover to draw me to any game out
(0:04:54) Al: Oh wow, oh goodness. Number one. We had this exact same conversation a month and a half ago,
(0:04:58) Kev: Number one
(0:05:04) Al: and I can't remember what the answer was, and I feel like I overthought it,
(0:05:04) Kev: Probably
(0:05:07) Al: just like I'm overthinking it just now.
(0:05:09) Kev: You are I don't know what but
(0:05:12) Kev: It was probably the same because it's crosses over the law. There you go
(0:05:13) Al: Probably. Sonic. Ah, yay, I got it right this time.
(0:05:19) Kev: Sanic in in in in the battle cats
(0:05:22) Al: Sonic's in Battlecat!
(0:05:24) Kev: Yeah, it's actually I forgot to bring it up last week
(0:05:26) Kev: It was - it started two weeks ago from recording and today I think is the last day. Sorry listeners too late for you
(0:05:33) Kev: He's not but neither is
(0:05:37) Kev: Hatsune Miku or
(0:05:39) Kev: Street fighter, but they're in there
(0:05:40) Al: I don't know. If somebody told me that Hatsune Miku is a cat, I would believe it.
(0:05:48) Kev: you know, um, you know what, that's fair. That's fair. Um, here, let me, uh, as, as we do, I'll, yeah, I'll do the, the slack thread.
(0:05:57) Kev: Um, uh, let me, I'm going to show you the art, um, because, so how these crossovers and battle cats usually work is, uh, there'll be a banner of four characters, um, from the actual property crossover, whatever.
(0:06:12) Kev: Um, uh, and, and so, yeah, the four.
(0:06:18) Kev: Characters, um, and they went with the, the obvious ones, Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow, the Hedgehog, because of course the poster children.
(0:06:27) Kev: Um, but what's fun is, uh, they'll also introduce a series of cats, uh, as in the battle cats TM, um, that look like, or cause play as the other characters.
(0:06:40) Kev: Um, and they're quite goofy looking.
(0:06:42) Kev: Um, I don't.
(0:06:42) Al: Why is there such a height disparity there?
(0:06:48) Kev: I don't know. That's a good question. I don't, I, that particular image, oh no, that, that particular image, I think it's just, uh, just the, the framing, like it's front to back.
(0:06:49) Al: Like, shadow is meant to be...
(0:06:56) Al: Well, no, I think, sure, for the actual sonic and shadow on the right-hand side,
(0:07:02) Al: but on the left-hand side, the sonic cat is clearly like three times the height of shadow cat.
(0:07:04) Kev: okay yeah oh yeah yeah okay so there's a sonic cat that looks like shadow like
(0:07:12) Kev: the regular cat like shadow cat but then you can evolve him and he turns into
(0:07:16) Kev: this taller cat I don't know why because it's the battle cats they love to do
(0:07:18) Al: Oh. Oh, so you'll be able to get both of them as as tall or
(0:07:19) Kev: weird things that's why that's your answer it looks like a twinkie with a
(0:07:23) Kev: sonic cat yeah I've only seen Sonic's evolution so I don't know if the other
(0:07:31) Kev: cats can evolve in tall forms or
(0:07:34) Kev: weird forms but Sonic Cat does get weird he turns tall like a Twinkie but
(0:07:40) Kev: yeah so yeah it's I will say Battle Cats is pretty good with their collabs
(0:07:46) Kev: because of course you get the characters but you also get stages which come with
(0:07:52) Kev: full Sonic soundtracks there's like four special stages that you can do on a
(0:07:56) Kev: repeat in different missions and so it's been a lot of fun the Sonic cast are
(0:08:02) Kev: Actually quite quite good
(0:08:04) Kev: The actual characters I pulled I got Sonic
(0:08:08) Kev: So I'm happy. I got one at least
(0:08:11) Kev: Calvin pulled tails, I believe but sadly we didn't get the others
(0:08:17) Kev: But what is nice these collabs will frequently come back
(0:08:21) Kev: Well, maybe not frequently, but but they come back on some regularity. It is to be expected
(0:08:26) Kev: So I'll be saving up for the next time Sonic swings around but it's it's been good fun
(0:08:32) Kev: I'm getting better and I do
(0:08:34) Kev: Enjoy the game battle cats not just the the polls really got your whatever so it's been nice to get back into the end
(0:08:40) Kev: So yeah Sonic and the battle cats. It's been a lot of fun. Oh, you know what there was an intro video
(0:08:44) Kev: Let me find the intro video. Hold on. I'll put it in you can watch it later
(0:08:48) Kev: But but they did a little animation. It was good
(0:08:52) Kev: So yeah aside from that, um, oh, you know what I finished monk the the detective show monk
(0:09:01) Kev: It's it's good. I
(0:09:04) Kev: Yeah, eight seasons so I kind of crushed it cuz I don't know I've been binge watching but it's like the regular show
(0:09:10) Kev: I'll watch when I get home or whatever
(0:09:13) Al: Oh, it's it's old. I mean, I said it's old. I mean, not super old, but like 20 years old.
(0:09:16) Kev: Sorry, what was that? Oh
(0:09:19) Kev: Yeah, yeah, well, that's a thing they actually did I after I finish I have to watch
(0:09:26) Kev: the
(0:09:27) Kev: Sorry, I have to see
(0:09:29) Kev: There's a movie they'd made a movie in 2023 50
(0:09:34) Kev: years or so after the end
(0:09:36) Kev: and I can't wait to check that out
(0:09:40) Kev: they have all the original actors they
(0:09:43) Kev: look quite old but it's still enjoyable
(0:09:45) Kev: but yeah anyways my great series the
(0:09:49) Kev: main actor Tony Shalab he's he is such a
(0:09:53) Kev: good actor like his performances are
(0:09:55) Kev: just incredible easy recommend for
(0:09:58) Kev: anyone but yeah the later seasons were
(0:10:01) Kev: really good season sevens really good
(0:10:04) Kev: it feels like they knew the end was
(0:10:07) Kev: coming so they did a lot of stuff to
(0:10:10) Kev: celebrate the series if you will so yeah
(0:10:13) Kev: good good stuff was good
(0:10:15) Kev: um let's see other than that nothing
(0:10:20) Kev: honestly not that much it's been crazy
(0:10:23) Kev: at work but thankfully I finally finished
(0:10:24) Kev: this huge project and so I'll finally be
(0:10:26) Kev: able to partake in other things again
(0:10:28) Kev: these upcoming oh wait wait one more
(0:10:31) Kev: thing how could I tear a nail after my
(0:10:34) Kev: last week I played the update their nail
(0:10:36) Al: Oh yes. Nice. It's just more of the same.
(0:10:37) Kev: um it's yeah turn out a good game still
(0:10:40) Kev: good game the core still the same the
(0:10:43) Kev: new levels the new line yes and no like
(0:10:47) Kev: the center of the general purpose but
(0:10:49) Kev: they introduce a lot of new mechanics
(0:10:50) Kev: and and different kind of ways to solve
(0:10:54) Kev: the puzzle I've been enjoying it of
(0:10:56) Kev: course but let them fun thing they did
(0:10:58) Kev: they'll add new objectives even to the
(0:11:00) Kev: old stages so let's say I had a hundred
(0:11:04) Kev: four all those areas I had a hundred
(0:11:05) Kev: percent are not only like seventy five
(0:11:08) Kev: percent because they had a new objective
(0:11:10) Kev: so gives you a good reason to go back
(0:11:12) Kev: and then try the old levels and have fun
(0:11:13) Kev: with them again since it's like a
(0:11:16) Kev: procedurally generated level it's you
(0:11:18) Kev: know it's fun every time so yeah a
(0:11:20) Kev: tear in L it's good all right out what
(0:11:24) Al: Hmm. Not a huge amount because I've been on holiday and going on holiday with kids means
(0:11:33) Al: not having a holiday. So I've not had a huge amount of time to do much, but I have started
(0:11:36) Kev: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
(0:11:42) Al: playing Donkey Kong, Bonanza. I'm only like an hour or so in. I mean, I've got a good
(0:11:47) Kev: okay
(0:11:48) Al: idea of how the game plays, but I'm not like super.
(0:11:50) Kev: yeah
(0:11:54) Al: Super far through it. I got through the tutorial level and I'm kind of like half the way through
(0:11:55) Kev: why
(0:11:58) Al: the next set of levels. Yeah, mostly, mostly. I am very frustrated with the camera. It is
(0:11:59) Kev: okay I've heard that game is good like really really good
(0:12:05) Kev: mostly
(0:12:13) Al: fine when you're out in the open, but as soon as you get into any like tunnel or like go
(0:12:20) Al: underground. It's super not fun.
(0:12:24) Al: a great camera for that. And I think the most frustrating thing is there was a section
(0:12:28) Al: in the tutorial where the camera worked really well for underground. It like kind of zoomed
(0:12:33) Al: out and you could see through the ground and it was like a really nice way. But it's I've
(0:12:37) Al: not seen it again do that since then. And I don't know why they don't use that camera
(0:12:41) Al: when you're underground because like you just end up like going up against the wall and
(0:12:43) Kev: Hm.
(0:12:47) Al: it gets really confused. And it's really hard to see anything. And considering it's a game
(0:12:54) Al: where you're like smashing everything up and you're encouraged to make tunnels through
(0:12:57) Al: the ground. I don't know why they didn't put more effort into that camera. Not that I can
(0:13:00) Kev: is there an option for that i'm gonna guess no because it's a nintendo game
(0:13:04) Al: see. Yeah, not that I can see. There's a decent amount of controller options, but nothing
(0:13:07) Kev: nintendo doesn't believe in options heck sometimes
(0:13:15) Al: for changing how the camera works other than inverted camera.
(0:13:19) Kev: do you remember in was it no sword and shield they hid the audio options on an item
(0:13:27) Kev: you had to talk to an NPC to get it
(0:13:28) Al: Oh yeah, that was a certain field. That was bizarre. And it wasn't even the first area.
(0:13:30) Kev: no it was like motor stoke yeah I'm
(0:13:35) Al: You had to get up to Motorstoke, I think. Which is like a third of the way through the game.
(0:13:40) Kev: pretty sure so that was there's a couple
(0:13:42) Kev: yeah you had to pass the wilder that's
(0:13:45) Al: You couldn't change the volume settings until you were a third. It's just bizarre.
(0:13:48) Kev: crazy yeah yeah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
(0:13:50) Al: And then you have to buy it. Yeah, that was a stupid decision.
(0:13:56) Al: Like a lot of times with games, I'm like, OK.
(0:13:58) Al: Sure, I don't like that, but maybe that's stupid, right?
(0:14:02) Kev: Oh my gosh, yes, oh.
(0:14:02) Al: That's just that is literally an accessibility option, right?
(0:14:05) Al: Like, come on.
(0:14:06) Kev: Yep.
(0:14:07) Kev: Oh my gosh, you know, I hate them, but I also love, because I just love trash fires.
(0:14:16) Kev: I love bad stupid decisions like that.
(0:14:19) Kev: Battle Cats actually has one. It's like the single flaw in the entire game, because the game is very well made in my opinion.
(0:14:25) Kev: And it's a very minor, like very niche thing, but there's, as you can imagine,
(0:14:32) Kev: They have like a gallery or whatever, right? Go through the menu and, you know, go through the characters, see their stats, yada, yada.
(0:14:39) Kev: Well, they have an enemy guide too, same thing, but the enemy guide is just a straight horizontal list.
(0:14:48) Kev: There's no pages, you can't filter, you can't search, you just have to go left to right through an entire
(0:14:55) Kev: huge roster of enemies. It's almost the worst.
(0:15:00) Kev: Anyways options are good
(0:15:02) Kev: Forgive people options people
(0:15:04) Kev: Do good things
(0:15:05) Al: So yeah, I think that's, that's about it. I mean, I've been watching through the Sandman
(0:15:11) Al: show, but I'm not really talking about that because, you know, Neil Gaiman, awkward. So
(0:15:15) Kev: Sand man, I wait. What is that? I don't know what that is
(0:15:18) Al: Sandman who's a DC character at TCC, that one, but it's the Netflix adapted it into
(0:15:21) Kev: Oh, it is that one okay, okay
(0:15:26) Al: a show. And they did the first season a couple of years ago, and then the whole Neil Gaiman
(0:15:32) Al: and stuff, you know, because he was the one that wrote down, man.
(0:15:34) Kev: Uh, yeah.
(0:15:35) Al: And they were like, oh, oh, but they did manage to get the second season done without him.
(0:15:44) Kev: Well, guess what, anything you do probably gives someone awful money.
(0:15:44) Al: He's almost certainly getting money for it, but whatever.
(0:15:53) Al: Yes, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. It doesn't make me feel better.
(0:15:58) Al: Yeah, so I have been watching that and I've mostly been managing to ignore him.
(0:16:06) Al: And focus on the show and it's good. I like it. I enjoy the show.
(0:16:08) Kev: sure sure that's cool yeah it's wild to me the the the you know years between seasons structure
(0:16:18) Kev: that netflix does um I don't know I just I find it crazy like I was at wednesday the wednesday show
(0:16:25) Kev: that was a three-year gap and it was only eight episodes I think the new season that's insane to
(0:16:26) Al: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
(0:16:33) Kev: me you remember when shows I say this someone watching monk you'd get like
(0:16:38) Kev: ish episodes of season every year isn't that great 20 to 26
(0:16:42) Al: Well, you want to have a conversation? No, I don't like that.
(0:16:48) Kev: what what
(0:16:48) Al: So, right, OK, so there's two parts to this. One, do I wish the shows that I like released
(0:16:52) Kev: okay
(0:16:55) Al: yearly? Probably, if they could keep the quality up, yes. But do I wish that all series were
(0:16:58) Kev: yeah okay
(0:17:02) Al: still 20 episodes? Absolutely not. Why would I want 20 episodes when half of them are boring?
(0:17:09) Al: right, give me the eight episodes that are good, don't give me the more that
(0:17:12) Al: you don't care about, give me what you think you want, not something that is enforced by
(0:17:17) Al: studios because they need year-round episodes, like we don't need to do that anymore and I don't
(0:17:23) Kev: Mmm, I mean
(0:17:23) Al: care for it. It's like how it's like, oh you know, like do you complain about the fact that episodes
(0:17:32) Al: aren't always, you know, was it 48 minutes long anymore because they don't all have to fit into
(0:17:36) Al: the exact same advert blocks. Now,
(0:17:39) Kev: Mm-hmm. I
(0:17:42) Kev: May kind of do
(0:17:42) Al: you can take that too far, Netflix with your two and a half hour season finale of Stranger Things
(0:17:48) Al: season four last time. That was too far, but other than that, I mean that doesn't, you can have
(0:17:48) Kev: Yes, yes
(0:17:53) Kev: Exactly
(0:17:58) Al: a middle thing which is not in the extremes there. I like when episodes aren't like necessarily
(0:18:02) Al: consistent because they want to fit in what they want to fit in, that they feel fits their artistic
(0:18:07) Al: expression. I like that.
(0:18:08) Kev: yeah okay sure I guess okay you know here's the call here's the here's the qualifier right
(0:18:13) Al: Do you really miss clip episodes?
(0:18:18) Kev: is it good right which is a dumb thing because that's the question right because let's all right
(0:18:19) Al: Yes, of course.
(0:18:23) Kev: let's yeah you can look at examples on both ends of the spectrum right um look at uh look at cora
(0:18:30) Kev: right that that show could have used some more episodes for sure um that that first season needed
(0:18:33) Al: possibly. I mean maybe they didn't have anything else they wanted to put in it, right? Like...
(0:18:38) Kev: at least a couple more episodes at first
(0:18:41) Al: Yeah, I guess my point is not like, oh, I wish we didn't have more episodes, right? I'm not saying
(0:18:48) Al: that. Like, if there's good stuff, I want to see it. But I don't agree with the, oh, wasn't it
(0:18:53) Al: great when every show had 20 to 22 episodes and they were all the exact same length and they
(0:18:59) Al: happened. No, I don't. I don't long for those days. I don't.
(0:19:02) Kev: Don't know I got a monk. It's been pretty good the whole time. I guess it did depends
(0:19:04) Al: But I just, it's just when you, when you got the like episode, that was the clip episode,
(0:19:11) Al: because they had to put out an episode and they didn't care. They didn't want anything.
(0:19:13) Kev: Monk did not do that actually crazy, but you sure yeah, yeah, but but okay. Yes, that's just
(0:19:16) Al: Sure. But most shows did almost every show did. And some of them did it better than others,
(0:19:21) Kev: Yes, yes
(0:19:22) Al: but you always, every time it happened, you rolled your eyes and went, Oh, here we go.
(0:19:24) Kev: Yeah, okay, you know what you're right
(0:19:26) Al: And you watched it anyway, because maybe there was something that was actually going to progress the
(0:19:29) Al: story. You don't know. It might be fully clips or it might actually do something.
(0:19:31) Kev: Sure
(0:19:33) Kev: Eh, I guess
(0:19:34) Al: But I mean, I think the, I think the, as you say, the complication is it depends on the show.
(0:19:42) Al: It depends on what they're doing. And I don't think it's, it's obviously not the case that
(0:19:47) Al: creators get to do what they want all the time. Obviously I'm not, I'm not suggesting that is,
(0:19:48) Kev: Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, that's
(0:19:53) Al: but I think having more freedom for that, I think is a good thing in general. And.
(0:19:59) Kev: Sure, you know, okay fine. I don't need every show to
(0:20:03) Kev: How should I put this? Okay? I don't it's not that I want every show to be 26 episodes every year or whatever
(0:20:10) Kev: but when I look at
(0:20:11) Al: The numbers just getting higher and higher
(0:20:13) Kev: when I look at
(0:20:16) Kev: Though the Wednesday series
(0:20:18) Kev: Right episodes in three years that that seems like you know that it seems cheap for lack of a better word, right?
(0:20:20) Al: So, I think, well, I mean, you say that cheap, like you pay for the subscription for Netflix
(0:20:32) Al: when you want to get the stuff and you watch it and then you stop subscribing, right? I
(0:20:34) Kev: Sure, sure. Yeah. Yeah
(0:20:36) Al: think of those sorts of shows as in the same way that people complain about them because
(0:20:41) Al: they're structured like films, I think of them in that sort of way as well, right? Three
(0:20:46) Kev: That that is true
(0:20:47) Al: years, three years between a film and its sequels.
(0:20:50) Al: Not an unusual amount of time, and eight episodes is longer than a film would be.
(0:20:51) Kev: That is very true that that's what that's what I'm
(0:20:56) Kev: You're right, that's that's what I'm not thinking here because that that is more common nowadays
(0:21:00) Kev: Isn't it where a season of a show is really just an extra-long movie like the Marvel Studios shows?
(0:21:06) Kev: You're you're right about that
(0:21:10) Kev: Yeah, that's a good point touche
(0:21:12) Al: I mean Marvel have a problem with sequels in general just now, right? Like when was the last,
(0:21:16) Kev: Ah
(0:21:18) Al: you know, in we got three Iron Mans and I think it was eight years or something like that and
(0:21:26) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:26) Al: it's now been what four years since Shang-Chi and we haven't even got a second yet.
(0:21:30) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:31) Al: Like there is a real problem they have with sequels just in general which is a whole other
(0:21:34) Al: conversation and is probably part of the reason that they're not getting big box office numbers
(0:21:35) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:41) Al: because most.
(0:21:42) Al: There are big numbers.
(0:21:43) Al: We're always the third in a series, you know, Iron Man one didn't make a billion.
(0:21:46) Kev: Mmm, that's a good point.
(0:21:48) Al: Iron Man three did make a billion.
(0:21:52) Al: Just saying also, you know, it's things like, you know, the Marvels being called the Marvels
(0:21:52) Kev: Uh, yeah.
(0:21:57) Al: rather than Captain Marvel two probably would have made more money if it had done that.
(0:21:58) Kev: Yeah...
(0:22:01) Al: Now, there are obviously other issues with that in terms of misogyny, but that was still
(0:22:04) Al: there when the first film came out and it made a billion.
(0:22:05) Kev: Yeah...
(0:22:06) Kev: Yeah, exactly!
(0:22:07) Kev: Right, right?
(0:22:07) Al: Why did the mark?
(0:22:08) Al: Why did Captain Marvel make a billion and the Marvels didn't?
(0:22:11) Al: And then there's all this other complications.
(0:22:12) Al: Well, nobody has any money anymore and COVID killed everything until blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
(0:22:17) Al: But Deadpool and Wolverine made a billion.
(0:22:19) Al: That was the third in the series as well, right?
(0:22:22) Al: Like they clearly can make lots of money.
(0:22:24) Al: They're just not doing what they used to do, which made them lots of money.
(0:22:28) Al: They make a film and it doesn't make a lot of money.
(0:22:30) Al: And they go, Oh, well, well, let's not make a second.
(0:22:31) Al: But the whole point was your first ones never make a lot of money.
(0:22:34) Al: It's the second and third that make the money.
(0:22:36) Al: And also which third film in the MCU made the least money, Thor.
(0:22:42) Al: Or three. Why was that?
(0:22:43) Al: Cos Thor 2 was bad.
(0:22:44) Kev: It was really bad is it is it hmm
(0:22:47) Al: Coincidence?
(0:22:49) Kev: Have we are I'm thinking got you know on our discords and slacks have we argued which of the worst Marvel films
(0:22:55) Kev: I feel like that that needs to happen. Oh
(0:22:56) Al: I mean, it's I mean, it's Star of the Dark World, right?
(0:22:59) Kev: I mean I
(0:23:02) Kev: Okay, I don't want to turn but it's probably a rise probably dark world. Yeah, I'm struggling to think
(0:23:06) Al: Eternals, I'm not trying, I'm not trying to say Eternals was one of the best, but it's not the worst, not at all.
(0:23:10) Kev: It's not as bad as dark world. Yeah, I believe a dark world
(0:23:12) Al: Absolutely not. There is, I don't think there is an MCU film that is as bad as those.
(0:23:18) Kev: Yeah, that was rough. Oh I miss
(0:23:22) Al: Like, I mean, try and explain this plot of that film.
(0:23:29) Kev: Yeah, yeah, no there's
(0:23:30) Al: Thor's girlfriend gets injected with something, and he has to get it out of her,
(0:23:32) Kev: And they and he used to fight dark elves
(0:23:34) Al: and also his mum dies, maybe, I think.
(0:23:38) Kev: Did she did I don't know why but oh god
(0:23:41) Al: You can know everything about that film, just from the bit where they go back in time
(0:23:46) Al: and endgame to it. That is the only bit about that film that matters.
(0:23:47) Kev: They were yeah, yeah, they really didn't see good. Oh, yeah
(0:23:50) Al: It tells you everything.
(0:23:53) Al: In fact, there's more, there's more character progression and more heart in that scene when
(0:23:58) Al: he goes back than there is in the entire film. You know, when he meets his mom and he's sad
(0:24:02) Kev: There is
(0:24:03) Al: because he knows she's about to die, you know, that is more than the entire film has.
(0:24:05) Kev: Yeah, you're you're right I did enjoy that what 15 minute bit
(0:24:10) Al: And then, and then he calls for his, then he calls from y'all near and it comes for him and he's
(0:24:14) Al: so happy. He says, I'm still worthy.
(0:24:18) Kev: You're right, that was better than the entire movie. You're right. I
(0:24:23) Al: I mean, I don't know how they, how did they make that film so long when there's so little that happens?
(0:24:29) Kev: Don't I don't know. I just whatever well, I will say this Kat Dennings
(0:24:31) Al: Anyway, you would, you would, you would have to have a, you'd have to have a, well, yeah,
(0:24:36) Al: okay, true. I mean, that's fair. She does improve any film. But you'd have to have a really good
(0:24:38) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's correct
(0:24:44) Al: argument to convince me that that's not the worst film. I don't think anything even comes close.
(0:24:47) Kev: Yeah, okay, you know what fair fair. I'm gonna yeah fair. I haven't seen fantastic for
(0:24:53) Al: Anyway, what was my point? Yeah. Yeah. I was watching The Sandman and then I'm probably
(0:24:58) Kev: Sandman
(0:25:00) Al: going to watch Weddings day after that. Cause that's, I need to, I need to watch that next
(0:25:02) Kev: Cool I like the Adams family
(0:25:03) Al: season. And then where else have we got Strange, Strange New Worlds, Star Trek. That's coming out
(0:25:09) Al: just now. Need to watch that as well. Name a Star Trek that doesn't fit that description.
(0:25:10) Kev: Oh
(0:25:12) Kev: Is that the one with the hot guy I don't remember
(0:25:18) Kev: Oh
(0:25:21) Kev: That's a good point, but that's a good point
(0:25:22) Al: Anyway, that's what we've been up to. Maybe I'll have more to talk about Bonanza when
(0:25:32) Kev: No, we did it
(0:25:34) Al: next time we'll see. All right. We're going to talk about some,
(0:25:36) Kev: Get to the end
(0:25:38) Kev: I'm saying get to the end. There's there's good things in that game. Mm-hmm
(0:25:40) Al: I don't think I'll do that in a week. I have heard that the story is good, but I've not got
(0:25:47) Al: to any point that actually matters with the story yet. Yeah. Let's talk about some.
(0:25:52) Al: Game news. First up, Moonlight in Garland, which Kevin's probably going, Oh, I can't remember what
(0:25:59) Al: that game is. I don't recognize that name. Well, it's coming out of early access on the 27th of
(0:26:00) Kev: CORRECT!
(0:26:06) Al: August. I mean, it's pretty much it's.
(0:26:12) Kev: Ha ha ha use the mad libs the cottagecore game mad laser you just yeah
(0:26:19) Kev: There I'm looking
(0:26:22) Al: Seems like it's less farming, more community building, and it's like a kind of town slash
(0:26:29) Kev: Yeah
(0:26:32) Kev: Yeah, this has a very specific
(0:26:32) Al: city rather than village.
(0:26:38) Kev: Aesthetic to like mid-2000s. I don't know a
(0:26:42) Al: Yeah, I was thinking Polly Pocket, but like the characters from Polly Pocket rather than the
(0:26:45) Kev: Pocket Polly like it's weird. Um
(0:26:50) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly the characters right that's exactly I'm talking
(0:26:51) Al: action. Yeah, it's funny that we both had the same thought that that shows you where it's at.
(0:26:57) Kev: Yeah, that's so
(0:26:59) Kev: Wait, is this the one where you can do crime? No, that might be a different one. We live in the city
(0:27:02) Al: No, that's not this one. That's not this one. No crime in this one.
(0:27:08) Kev: Gosh good old cottagecore. We're in too deep. Oh, we're in too deep
(0:27:15) Kev: All right
(0:27:17) Kev: Wait, so what was the actual news here? Are we at one point a release? Okay, August 27th
(0:27:22) Al: Yes, 27th of August. Next, "Above Snakes have announced their console releases coming on the 4th of September." So that is Switch, Xbox.
(0:27:30) Kev: I'm kind of surprised they're doing console's release was that do we cover again I I don't
(0:27:35) Al: That was a Kickstarter stretch thing.
(0:27:37) Kev: even remember did we come
(0:27:39) Al: I don't know if we did a proper one on it. We had our episode where we talked about the cultural...
(0:27:46) Kev: Yeah, yeah, Nami on that, yeah, yeah, I remember that.
(0:27:48) Al: I don't want to say appropriation, the cultural questions around it.
(0:27:52) Al: Shall we see?
(0:27:52) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I do remember that.
(0:27:54) Al: I don't know if we actually covered that.
(0:27:55) Kev: But, well, you know what?
(0:27:58) Kev: Hats off to them if that was a goal
(0:28:01) Kev: and they're actually doing it, right?
(0:28:02) Kev: Because even games that do release from Kickstarter
(0:28:05) Kev: don't always get to the console port when they promise it.
(0:28:08) Al: Absolutely. Yeah, I should probably play at some point. I do have it. I own it on Steam
(0:28:19) Al: because I backed it because it came out on that period of time where I was backing basically
(0:28:24) Kev: everything before you
(0:28:25) Al: every vaguely cottage core Kickstarter. I'm better now. I have not backed a farming game
(0:28:33) Al: on Kickstarter since Autonomica.
(0:28:38) Al: I went back in April. Yeah. I have backed two Kickstarters back then, but since then,
(0:28:39) Kev: So your time on rehab was successful.
(0:28:41) Kev: Good, good for you.
(0:28:47) Al: but neither of them have been farming.
(0:28:49) Kev: Nah, look at you, progress.
(0:28:53) Kev: Well, hey, that's September 4th.
(0:28:56) Kev: Oh, I don't like how close that is.
(0:28:58) Kev: How's it going so fast now?
(0:29:00) Al: I don't know. Time.
(0:29:04) Kev: Time.
(0:29:07) Al: Next we have Out and About. They managed to release this time successfully. This was the
(0:29:10) Kev: Your comment.
(0:29:15) Kev: This time.
(0:29:19) Al: one where last week they tried to release, but they accidentally, or they realized they
(0:29:23) Al: hadn't clicked the access button, which put it into review, and then it took several days
(0:29:24) Kev: They deleted the button.
(0:29:30) Al: so now they have actually released their early access. Congratulations to Out and About.
(0:29:34) Kev: good for them they did it I don't know the game looks fine I guess it's walking
(0:29:45) Kev: through a forest looking
(0:29:48) Al: Yeah, it's doing something different. It's not just like, it's not farming, it's foraging,
(0:29:52) Al: and the idea is you're exploring, and it's another picture-taking one as well, but
(0:29:58) Al: you're foraging for things. It's cute.
(0:30:00) Kev: Yeah, it is. It's, uh, it's like, uh, what is it? Uh, the, the, the, the, the hike game. Um, I forget, it kind of reminds me of that, but a little more involved.
(0:30:10) Al: Oh, a short hike. Yeah. It's much more, you know, it's 3D, third person view. No. Yeah.
(0:30:12) Kev: Yeah. It's the one. Yeah. But you know, you're actually foraging.
(0:30:16) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. It looks like an extension of that. Not necessarily better extension, but just, you know, kind of in that vein of ideas of just going through the woods and looking at stuff.
(0:30:28) Al: I'm also comparing it to Alba in my head because it was kind of similar where you're
(0:30:35) Kev: Yeah, yeah that too yeah, um yeah, okay. Well hey good good for them. They found the button finally
(0:30:44) Al: Congratulations. Next we have Coral Island have announced that their 1.2 update is out.
(0:30:51) Kev: Okay, why why is there someone in a dinosaur suit?
(0:30:56) Al: Why not? What a silly question! I'm guessing that's one of the spooky costumes, cause.
(0:30:58) Kev: How good
(0:31:00) Kev: You know, that's a good counterpoint, okay
(0:31:06) Al: So the things that are coming in this update, multiplayer, they've revamped their romance
(0:31:11) Al: progression, adding more hearts. You can get up to a heart event, sorry, you can get up
(0:31:15) Al: to 15 hearts now with heart events. So 11 to 15 are after marriage, like the stargy
(0:31:22) Al: ones added in like 1.4 or something, I forget.
(0:31:27) Al: But they've also added spooky costumes, okay?
(0:31:35) Al: Like, this is one of those ones that feels weird that this feels like
(0:31:40) Al: something they wanted to do for 1.0 and just didn't, but.
(0:31:43) Kev: yeah that's it that is very much what it feels like Mitch drew I guess good for
(0:31:49) Kev: them that a gate got here like yeah I am NOT gonna fault them for that because
(0:31:54) Kev: it's a game dev is hard I don't know if you know that out oh oh I like you I'm
(0:32:00) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fair.
(0:32:02) Kev: looking I'm sorry I'm looking for the video some of the costumes the the NPC's
(0:32:06) Kev: rather pretty good there's like a tinker the good chicken a Tinkerbell costume I
(0:32:09) Kev: like that that's good
(0:32:11) Al: Yeah, there does seem to be a lot of care taken on these costumes. They're not, they're not just like generic things. Each person has like a unique costume and they're all very interesting. The twins have almost the same costume, which is fun, but they're not quite. They're slightly different, which is based on, you know, their personality.
(0:32:32) Kev: That's fun to, yeah, that's, yeah, I like that, that's, that's good, yeah, um, dressing
(0:32:37) Kev: up your NPCs.
(0:32:38) Kev: You know what, I take it that the dinosaur costume is a good idea.
(0:32:41) Al: I'm trying to find them. So I've asked you motivates us that I found their spooky festival section of the video. I'm guessing that's where you saw it. Well, I see someone as a panda.
(0:32:48) Kev: Yeah, there's near the start
(0:32:51) Kev: All the twins. Oh
(0:32:51) Al: I was near the start of the video.
(0:32:54) Kev: Yeah, it's near the start all that. I'm looking at the twin costumes. Those are good. Actually
(0:32:59) Kev: They might be the best costumes
(0:33:01) Kev: It's a I don't know. There's like little blueberry monsters. I don't know how to describe it better
(0:33:09) Kev: That's cool. What is that guy there?
(0:33:10) Al: It's definitely you have to see.
(0:33:12) Kev: Yeah, there's a guy in a black turtle. What is that is that supposed to be a costume that doesn't look that's just a
(0:33:18) Kev: Guy in a sweatshirt and jeans. I don't get that
(0:33:22) Al: And yeah, OK, I don't know what his I don't know what Pablo's costume is he trying to be Steve Jobs or something?
(0:33:30) Kev: I guess with Shane. I don't know. I don't know
(0:33:33) Al: I don't know.
(0:33:37) Al: Where's this dinosaur costume you're talking about?
(0:33:38) Kev: Yo
(0:33:40) Kev: Okay, okay, let me let me find it it's in the video it was near the very start
(0:33:45) Al: Oh, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it. Yeah, that's, that'll be a spooky costume,
(0:33:47) Kev: You found it great
(0:33:49) Kev: Yeah, it probably is I like it. It's dumb. I like it what?
(0:33:49) Al: because it's pumpkins and lights around them.
(0:33:55) Al: There are some silly costumes you can use as your player as well in the game that I've
(0:33:59) Al: put on before. I can't remember what I was dressed up as, but they, it's not just like,
(0:34:05) Al: they have a decent amount of player customization already.
(0:34:08) Kev: Yeah, yeah. There's also a collab with Fungi Swarm.
(0:34:09) Al: Uh, yeah, that's their game.
(0:34:15) Al: Our other game, isn't it? Um, uh, what, there's, uh, redeemable items. Okay.
(0:34:17) Kev: Yeah, it is. Which, yeah, but I think...
(0:34:24) Kev: There's a antler dog guy. I don't know what that is, but, uh...
(0:34:27) Al: Uh, a mythical pet outfit.
(0:34:31) Kev: I don't know what... I don't... Okay, I don't know what this creature is.
(0:34:34) Al: "Razzi" or "Razzdi"
(0:34:37) Kev: whereas the it's an off.
(0:34:41) Kev: It's a blue reindeer dog.
(0:34:42) Kev: I don't know what else to describe it.
(0:34:44) Al: Well, speaking of dogs,
(0:34:45) Kev: Uhhh...
(0:34:47) Kev: You! Ooh, good transition, tell me.
(0:34:48) Al: for some reason we're talking about Sugadoo Island again,
(0:34:51) Kev: W-w-why?!
(0:34:51) Al: this game.
(0:34:53) Al: 'Cause, dog, they've released a code
(0:34:57) Al: that you can redeem in the game and it gives you dog.
(0:35:01) Kev: But okay spotted dog, that's
(0:35:04) Al: If it's anything like everything else in this game,
(0:35:07) Al: you won't be able to name it.
(0:35:08) Al: It won't do anything other than just follow you around
(0:35:11) Al: like a blind rat, I don't know.
(0:35:14) Kev: I'm not sure how well blind rec could follow you but they do that is true you'll fly like
(0:35:15) Al: It's not really turned on for metaphors just now.
(0:35:22) Al: They have a good sense of smell.
(0:35:28) Kev: a dog I have a dog they do follow you yeah that is true its name is spotted dog that's
(0:35:32) Al: Yeah, but with personality, I doubt this one a lot.
(0:35:41) Kev: That's it.
(0:35:41) Al: That would, I mean I'd be surprised if it wasn't just dog.
(0:35:44) Kev: Yeah.
(0:35:48) Al: Next we have Aether Wizard Life have released a what they're calling their first announcement
(0:35:56) Al: trailer but I'm confused because this game was announced multiple years ago so I don't
(0:35:57) Kev: Okay
(0:36:00) Al: know how this is an announcement trailer.
(0:36:01) Kev: And
(0:36:02) Kev: It's only for backers, which I don't know you probably want to make that available. Oh, there is. Oh, okay. Let me see. Oh
(0:36:06) Al: There's a link to the actual video as well.
(0:36:11) Kev: Yeah, there is. Okay. Yeah, that's all right. I was like at the Kickstarter page
(0:36:15) Kev: First of all, I don't like this name at all. I don't know if we covered this game, but I don't like that at all
(0:36:18) Al: No.
(0:36:23) Al: This is, I don't know if we've seen gameplay before.
(0:36:26) Al: This is the first time seeing some of this stuff.
(0:36:29) Al: The building of your house is basically
(0:36:32) Al: exactly the same as the Spiritfarer building,
(0:36:36) Kev: Yup!
(0:36:37) Al: which I'm not complaining about because that is good.
(0:36:39) Al: I like that.
(0:36:40) Al: More of that, please.
(0:36:40) Kev: Yeah, that modularity, it's good. Build your castle.
(0:36:44) Al: There are some, shall we say, thirsty characters
(0:36:48) Kev: Oh, geez. Good. That guy, I mean, that one guy alone, he's the worst offender. It's the first one they show you, too.
(0:36:59) Al: There's yep, it's uh, you're gonna this is this is a weed game apparently
(0:37:00) Kev: Good heavens.
(0:37:06) Kev: Oh my gosh, that... Oh, shit. You know what? Fine. Lean into it. Just full thirst into it and just do it.
(0:37:16) Kev: If you're going to do it, go all in.
(0:37:16) Al: Every game has to have a hook, I just don't think that that is a unique hook.
(0:37:22) Kev: True? That's true. It probably worked for some people, not me, but...
(0:37:27) Al: You're definitely not you. Not you. Have you got to the other characters yet?
(0:37:32) Kev: Yeah, I see the other characters like they're
(0:37:36) Kev: Is it this is hmm, this is a problem when everyone does it like everyone loses their
(0:37:42) Kev: You know, it's it's it's tough to stick out in the crowd, right? Like these just look generic
(0:37:46) Kev: I don't know the guy who looks like he's dressing up like an elf
(0:37:50) Kev: I don't know and then why are there two in silhouettes? Why do you have to silhouette those characters? I feel like you shouldn't
(0:37:56) Al: for our secret. We're going to tell you later. I don't just like the character designs. The
(0:37:58) Kev: Okay
(0:38:01) Kev: There's a girl with the ponytail of the sword
(0:38:03) Al: character design's okay. What I do find a bit weird is not the character designs and not your
(0:38:11) Al: playable character design. They're both fine. What's weird is them both together in the same
(0:38:17) Al: game. They look like very different designs. They look like they're from different games.
(0:38:20) Kev: They do
(0:38:22) Kev: Right because yeah, cuz we're looking at the
(0:38:27) Kev: The oh
(0:38:29) Kev: Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. Absolutely cuz these NPCs, you know very
(0:38:34) Kev: Detailed sort of designs and and whatnot and you're a little in the generic side
(0:38:35) Al: much more detailed.
(0:38:38) Al: I don't dislike the playable characters design, it just feels, I think it looks bad purely
(0:38:40) Kev: You're right, I agree with it
(0:38:44) Kev: Yeah
(0:38:48) Al: because of how the other one.
(0:38:52) Kev: you're right it doesn't you know what the problem is I as far as i've seen there's no like
(0:38:57) Kev: portrait art for your character right because yeah yeah yeah because it's it's a very different
(0:38:59) Al: That's what it is, it's the portrait art of course I'm just yeah I'm looking at a bit of one of them in game and yeah they look, they look much more similar to your characters but the portrait art is so much more detail.
(0:39:11) Kev: art style as as portrait arts are so frequently done but there's not one for your your character
(0:39:18) Kev: And so I don't know it's just I see I get what you're saying. Absolutely
(0:39:22) Kev: Um
(0:39:24) Kev: But I mean even in the in-game art style like it's there's still a little more detail than your character
(0:39:31) Kev: Because like your characters is
(0:39:32) Al: It's the face, there's no nose.
(0:39:33) Kev: Yeah, ooh, that's a good point, right? There's no facial features. It's just like the eyes and the smile
(0:39:39) Kev: That's it on your the player character. You're right. You're super right
(0:39:42) Al: Anyway, the interesting thing about this, I guess, is the magic stuff, and it does look quite detailed.
(0:39:48) Al: So maybe that could be interesting.
(0:39:50) Al: And then there's some combat.
(0:39:52) Kev: yeah there's a lot of stuff going on here there's an owl with the flower on its head and
(0:39:58) Kev: I don't even know what's going on with these like skill trees or I don't know there's a lot going on here
(0:40:03) Al: I think, I think they're for like making new spells, possibly.
(0:40:07) Kev: yeah honestly
(0:40:08) Al: Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna probably play it because I did back on Kickstarter,
(0:40:12) Al: like the idiot that I was, but.
(0:40:14) Kev: the the magic stuff I think is the bigger draw here that looks pretty interesting slash well done
(0:40:19) Al: Yeah. Yeah. Agreed.
(0:40:21) Kev: There's combat
(0:40:22) Kev: Magical creatures that looks fun
(0:40:26) Kev: It's wild the data will NPCs just they don't even live up to that it's crazy
(0:40:33) Al: Next, fields of mystery, I have announced a merch collection.
(0:40:37) Al: So, you know, go get your fields of mystery on merch, I guess.
(0:40:40) Kev: is it good merch let's see i'm looking
(0:40:45) Al: So they they have a they have they have a pin.
(0:40:47) Kev: oh goodness what is that the first the first one is the oh yeah yeah the first one they show you is
(0:40:53) Al: They have a pin that you tilt and it changes between
(0:40:58) Al: more clothes and fewer clothes.
(0:41:00) Kev: Yeah, it's it's
(0:41:03) Kev: Presumably it's I don't know the characters, but that's datable guy and yet
(0:41:07) Kev: You know you tilt it and it's and now he's shirtless cuz good heavens
(0:41:11) Al: That's the entire marriage. That's all the marriage. That's everything.
(0:41:12) Kev: Oh
(0:41:14) Kev: My god, it's all that. I'm not good in the laundry. It's just
(0:41:20) Al: It's just like the pen from Friends, which Joey had, and you click it, and the women's clothes
(0:41:27) Al: come off, right? Like, what is this? Why is this your only piece of marriage? And it's two characters.
(0:41:28) Kev: Yeah! _laughs_
(0:41:37) Kev: Yes, too! _laughs_
(0:41:38) Al: Two characters, one male, one female.
(0:41:41) Kev: Oh, that's incredible! _laughs_
(0:41:41) Al: What a weird decision.
(0:41:47) Kev: Oh, and...
(0:41:48) Al: I need to go what I need to go read the comments.
(0:41:49) Kev: Beholds in... it's... why I need to understand how... because...
(0:41:55) Al: Oh, people, people like this.
(0:41:58) Kev: Oh, the first one's "Lily, Take My Money." Oh my goodness, these... oh!
(0:42:05) Kev: This is why we're in this cottagecore world, brain rot, dateable nonsense.
(0:42:12) Kev: It's your fault, commenters.
(0:42:15) Kev: And what kills me is Fields of Mystery has that kind of 90s anime art style vibe.
(0:42:23) Kev: You could play off that, right, for your merch, but no, we get to...
(0:42:28) Kev: Two pins that take off the character's clothes!
(0:42:34) Al: odd decision it's like they sit down and they go right okay we're gonna make some merch what's our
(0:42:38) Al: first merch gonna be a poster no no not a poster like a t-shirt no not a t-shirt a pin yeah we
(0:42:40) Kev: Apparently according to the commenters.
(0:42:47) Al: could do a pin but what if it was a pin where they undress them I just I don't I don't
(0:42:54) Kev: Ohh, look, alright, look, I mean, I mean, I tried to be delicate, I have kids gloves when I talk about these subjects, but look, this commenter here said it's straight, it's the fields of gooning.
(0:43:15) Kev: Ohh, good heavens. Worst part is, it looks like it's gonna be a huge success, so.
(0:43:21) Al: Oh probably, probably. I just like what you I can't imagine. It just it would feels like it would be even if you want it. It feels like embarrassing to own.
(0:43:31) Kev: Well...
(0:43:33) Al: And the whole point of pins is to show them off, right?
(0:43:36) Kev: Yeah? _laughs_
(0:43:38) Kev: You just make sure to always show it off at one angle and never ever move it to the other angle. _laughs_
(0:43:49) Al: All right moving on to a very interesting story, a story of seasons.
(0:43:54) Kev: - Yeah, okay, from the worst story to the best.
(0:43:59) Al: It's a little bit of shame we don't have Cody on to talk about this but let's go with it anyway.
(0:44:04) Al: So story of seasons and well Marvelous, the company that makes, well they're the European
(0:44:12) Al: company that ports and not ports, they translate and publish the story of season games.
(0:44:20) Al: I just know that Marvelous is the Japanese version of the company as well,
(0:44:24) Al: they are the same company now aren't they, I think. Anyway it doesn't matter,
(0:44:27) Al: anyway story of seasons company, the European part of it have made a partnership, they started in 2020,
(0:44:36) Al: they made a partnership with the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, of all places,
(0:44:42) Kev: Me and literally Cody and Al were involved directly in this
(0:44:47) Al: and they helped fund
(0:44:49) Al: conservation efforts to repopulate the pine hoverfly in Scotland. So it had gotten down
(0:44:58) Al: to the point where there was only one small group of the flies in Cairngorm, which is
(0:45:05) Al: one of our national parks, and since then they have put in a lot of funding into this
(0:45:13) Al: effort, which they've been doing at the
(0:45:19) Al: Highland Park. What was the name of it? I can't remember there. Two seconds. Let me remind myself
(0:45:25) Al: of the, which is funny because I have actually been to this, the place that they did it. I just
(0:45:30) Kev: when you went to go help save the hoverflies.
(0:45:30) Al: can't remember the name of it. Before they were doing this, yeah, it's a Highland Park. I can't
(0:45:40) Al: remember what it's called. The Highland Wildlife Park. There we go. So yeah, the the the royals is
(0:45:49) Al: called, and they've been doing the conservation effort for this fly, the pine hoverfly, at the
(0:45:59) Al: Highland Wildlife Park, and they now have five, I think, areas of hoverflies now up from the one
(0:46:07) Al: in 2020. So successful. And yeah, they've done a documentary about it, a 10-minute documentary about
(0:46:16) Al: the work and
(0:46:20) Al: I mean, it's obviously an ad for their games as well, but you know what? I don't care.
(0:46:25) Kev: Yeah, I mean, okay. Well, I mean how cool is this story overall?
(0:46:32) Kev: Yeah, like
(0:46:34) Kev: Well, I mean first of all, right
(0:46:36) Kev: It's it's marvelous story of seasons right there the big dogs and then in our little corner of the internet
(0:46:43) Kev: so, of course, it should be them but
(0:46:47) Kev: On these these games that are all about a lot of them are very nature heavy and then you know
(0:46:54) Kev: on the gensure cover here there.
(0:46:55) Kev: Pro nature, whatever. It's nice to see, you know, some of these games actually making an impact in the real world nature.
(0:47:04) Kev: That's good. Terranelle I think does something, some of the donut to some conservation efforts, but yeah, which is cool.
(0:47:10) Al: Yeah, yeah, we talked about that on their episode, I think. Yeah, that's cool.
(0:47:16) Kev: But it's also cool to have a very specific example of we help this one species grow in this one area. That's very cool.
(0:47:24) Kev: I like that.
(0:47:25) Kev: Good, good for you, Marvelous.
(0:47:26) Al: So yeah, pretty cool, just in general, and also local to me, so also kind of cool.
(0:47:34) Al: Obviously, the Highland Wild Love Park is quite far away from me, but I did used to live closer to it for a while.
(0:47:44) Al: Anyway, there we go. That's our news.
(0:47:48) Kev: Oh, what a, what a, what a rollercoaster.
(0:47:54) Al: It's fine. We don't need to go back in time.
(0:47:56) Al: We can forget about the stuff we want to forget.
(0:48:00) Kev: All right, let's talk about stuff we don't want to forget about let's talk about games that we like
(0:48:04) Al: Yeah, so, I don't know about you, but this feels like a funny year for farming games so far.
(0:48:12) Al: In that there have been a lot of games released this year so far. We're only in August, and the list so far is
(0:48:21) Al: Artisan Story, Bugaboo Pocket, Cattle Country, Chronomon, Cinnabunny, Dessop Cat Cafe, Dinkum, Dowlook Town,
(0:48:29) Al: Fantasy Life, Eye of the Girls, Steel's Time, Galactic Getaway, Grimoire Groves, Harvest Hills,
(0:48:34) Al: Hello Kitty, On Switch, Honeymancer, Into the Emberlands, Lens Island 1.0, Mudborne, My Little
(0:48:42) Al: Life, Of Life and Land, that was a weird pronunciation, Of Life and Land, Opudum, Pixelshire,
(0:48:50) Al: Pixelcross, Rune Factory, Ratopia, Rune Factory Gardens of Azuma, Space Sprouts, Shugadew Island,
(0:48:56) Al: Sunseed Island, Tamagotchi Plaza, oh yeah the Ratopia was 1.0, Tamagotchi Plaza, Tiny Garden,
(0:49:03) Al: to pick Salia.
(0:49:04) Al: I think that's a lot of games, but what I find interesting is I don't think there
(0:49:25) Al: was anything on that list that I was like super super excited for going into this year.
(0:49:30) Kev: oh I mean okay like not even I mean I was I was I don't know if excited like I wasn't screaming
(0:49:33) Al: but maybe that's just me.
(0:49:41) Kev: about it but wander stop like I i was gonna play it okay that's I might be jumping ahead but but
(0:49:48) Kev: overall you're you're right um like I i think about these games and I wasn't yeah I wasn't
(0:49:55) Kev: that set on any of them right it would there was no um maneko's night market that I really
(0:50:00) Kev: waiting for years this year um you're right about that um no
(0:50:06) Al: Oh, Snacko 1.0, I've not got that on my list. I need to add that to my list, which was on
(0:50:12) Al: my list of things that I was excited about for this year. So two things on this list
(0:50:17) Al: that I was excited for, Snacko 1.0, which I've not played yet, and Hello Kitty, not
(0:50:21) Al: on Apple Arcade. But I guess the problem with that is I'd already played it a bunch,
(0:50:26) Al: and so actually I haven't played it a lot. So all my other ones are like Super Zoo Story,
(0:50:26) Kev: Yeah, I'm not counting. I'm not counting. Hello.
(0:50:32) Al: out yet. Fields of Mystery at 1.0 and not out yet and Starbirds.
(0:50:36) Al: Not out yet. I've had fun playing Lens Island, that has been good. But it's also like a
(0:50:46) Al: couple that are like absolutely dreadful, like Sugardew Island and Tamagotchi Plaza.
(0:50:51) Al: Tiny Garden was fine, I enjoyed it, but it was still quite small in scope. Pixel Cross
(0:50:58) Al: Ring Factory was fine again, but nothing special. You like Fantasy of the Life Eye, right?
(0:51:05) Kev: I do, well I haven't played it, but I like the first one, I'm excited about it. No.
(0:51:07) Al: Oh you haven't played it yet? Okay, it's on my list to play at some point.
(0:51:12) Kev: Yeah, this is mine.
(0:51:13) Al: Is the problem? I think that there are too many now, and so we can't play most of them,
(0:51:21) Al: and so we just end up looking at them going, "Oh yeah, that one might be good."
(0:51:28) Kev: Yeah, that's probably the case. Yeah, you're right. Because when we started, it's a very different place, right? When you started this show.
(0:51:37) Kev: It was, I don't know how many releases there were back then, but I mean, it was Stardew and that was, you know, maybe a Harvest Moon or Story of Seasons back in those days.
(0:51:50) Al: In 2019, which is the first year of the game of the of the podcast, there were 13.
(0:51:58) Kev: Well, and now you just listed like 30 dead least
(0:52:04) Al: Um 34 yeah 34 and we're not we're not at the end of the year yet. So yeah um I guess my point is
(0:52:16) Kev: Okay, well, there's got to be some.
(0:52:19) Al: I don't I don't think that any of these that I've played so far are going to be my game of the year
(0:52:24) Al: I I think that's still to come that might mean that one of these is I've just not played it yet
(0:52:26) Kev: sure. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Can you pick at least three games that you've played this year that you've
(0:52:29) Al: Like, I really need to play Fantasy Life Eye. That might be it. We'll see.
(0:52:39) Kev: enjoyed?
(0:52:40) Al: Oh goodness, right. Okay. Well, so I mean, I have really enjoyed Lens Island. It's not
(0:52:46) Al: going to be my game of the year mainly because its controller support is so disappointing
(0:52:52) Al: that it just kind of like knocks it off, but was a lot of fun. It is rough, but it just
(0:52:56) Kev: That's... that's so rough.
(0:52:59) Al: means I can't play it much because I have to be on my computer and I can't be doing
(0:53:01) Kev: Yeah.
(0:53:04) Al: that much. Likewise, Tiny Garden was really fun. I don't
(0:53:09) Al: I don't think it will be my game of the year.
(0:53:10) Al: Because it's quite small scope.
(0:53:12) Kev: Yeah, it's very one note, a very good note, but it's one.
(0:53:12) Al: It's, well that's the thing, it's very fun.
(0:53:16) Al: But when I compared it to my previous games of the year,
(0:53:19) Al: it doesn't, it's not there, right?
(0:53:22) Al: That's the problem.
(0:53:24) Al: I'm trying to choose something else that isn't Hello Kitty.
(0:53:27) Al: Because let's just talk about that.
(0:53:29) Al: That game is excellent.
(0:53:31) Al: It's just a very good game on so many levels.
(0:53:35) Al: My problem is I just played it when it was an Apple Arcade.
(0:53:38) Al: arcade. So I.
(0:53:40) Al: Don't feel the I must play this now.
(0:53:44) Al: It's hard to get back into a game like that,
(0:53:46) Al: especially when you have to start from scratch.
(0:53:48) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's that's a good point. It is a great game. But it's it's also like ongoing life
(0:53:56) Kev: Service-y where it has events whatever right? So that feels well, you know, it's it's it's it's it's already had a lot coming in
(0:54:03) Kev: Like content and stuff. So and I don't know I struggle to even count it because it already existed. It's just a port to another
(0:54:10) Kev: system
(0:54:11) Al: Yes, but it was a port to a system that people actually have, right, like, people don't really
(0:54:15) Kev: True
(0:54:17) Al: have Apple arcades. That was the problem.
(0:54:19) Kev: That's a good point
(0:54:22) Kev: That's a good point
(0:54:25) Kev: Release to people actually can put it
(0:54:28) Al: Exactly, exactly. Because this is the problem, right? Like with game subscription services
(0:54:36) Al: is that it's one thing for like film and TV to have subscription services because like
(0:54:41) Al: you can, as I say, like build up a bunch of stuff and go for one month of Netflix and
(0:54:45) Al: watch through four series and five films. And then you really feel like you got your
(0:54:49) Al: money's worth. But if you like playing a game, you can sometimes be playing for like multiple
(0:54:54) Al: months on one game, and then you're essentially paying for it.
(0:54:58) Al: Paying what, like 10 quid a month or something like that for a game, it just, you struggle
(0:55:06) Al: to justify that, if you don't get through a lot of them. That I think is my problem
(0:55:13) Al: with game subscriptions. Yeah. And it depends, I guess, on the cost of the game, right? Like
(0:55:19) Al: it would say you're doing, if you get through a game a month, you're going to definitely
(0:55:24) Al: be covering your cost.
(0:55:28) Al: But, if you don't have as much time as that, and you're spending multiple ones on one game, it's definitely not worth it.
(0:55:34) Al: The problem with Appel Arcade is, there are exclusive games to it, and there's no way to play them without doing this subscription.
(0:55:41) Al: So I did one month subscription for Hello Kitty, and I did as much as I could in that month.
(0:55:44) Kev: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:55:45) Al: But I wasn't going to pay for a second month, just to continue playing the game.
(0:55:50) Al: But then when it came out and switch, I was like, well, I put in like 30 hours into it two years ago, right?
(0:55:58) Al: And the problem is, it was nearly two years between the game coming out on Appel Arcade and coming out on Switch and Steam.
(0:56:04) Al: And so it's just hard to go back into a game two years later. It's not Stardew, come on.
(0:56:10) Al: Is it possible for another game to do that?
(0:56:10) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's a
(0:56:16) Al: I haven't had another game that makes me want to go back into it and play it for 100 hours two years later.
(0:56:24) Al: or in Starge's mind five years later.
(0:56:28) Kev: Yeah, well that's because Concerned Ape is a psycho and nobody does games like that
(0:56:35) Kev: Nobody has dedicated their entire everything to one game like Concerned Ape. That's the thing, right? I mean every now and then
(0:56:43) Kev: like I
(0:56:45) Kev: Mean there are games that come out with DLCs or updates that do draw you back in but certainly not to the level like
(0:56:51) Kev: Stardew
(0:56:54) Al: I put in a hundred hours into Stardew last year alone.
(0:56:54) Kev: Yeah
(0:56:58) Kev: Well
(0:56:59) Al: Like that is not a joke.
(0:57:01) Al: That is not an exaggeration.
(0:57:02) Al: I put in a hundred hours into the 1.6 up.
(0:57:02) Kev: Yeah, no, I believe you you're right
(0:57:06) Kev: You're right. I'm trying to think like the closest I can think of is animal crossing on 3ds
(0:57:11) Kev: They came out with the was it welcome amiibo update whatever. They have that big update
(0:57:15) Kev: That was a lot that got me back in for a good chunk
(0:57:18) Al: I did keep going back to Animal Crossing New Horizons with all their updates. I went in, but
(0:57:23) Al: how much of that is because of this podcast? That's...
(0:57:26) Kev: Yeah, yeah, and it's and it's interesting because
(0:57:33) Kev: How should I put this let's just look at Mario Kart, right?
(0:57:37) Kev: They came out of a lot of updates the mark heart eight specifically and you go back and you play them
(0:57:42) Kev: But you you finish them right? There's the very clear. Okay. I did all the new content
(0:57:47) Kev: I'm you know, I'm good or whatever, right?
(0:57:51) Kev: But say they start doing to degree animal crossing like they're
(0:57:56) Kev: Everything is just so interconnected all the old and the new like it's it's so easy to just get lost in all of it
(0:58:04) Kev: very few games I think are
(0:58:07) Al: That's fair.
(0:58:09) Al: Here's another question, then.
(0:58:11) Al: Is it possible to do a fair game of the year episode anymore?
(0:58:18) Kev: well yeah no no it it okay it it is in my opinion are the question I think
(0:58:21) Al: I'm not suggesting stopping doing it, right?
(0:58:24) Al: Because it's still a fun episode to do, but it.
(0:58:34) Kev: there's two I think it's how you approach it and I talked about this on
(0:58:40) Kev: the slack with some of the other host folk like you need to because there's
(0:58:46) Kev: different...
(0:58:48) Kev: You've already started kind of subdividing into categories, right?
(0:58:51) Kev: There's games that got updates, right?
(0:58:53) Kev: You judge that, so you should kind of judge that separately from a new game, right?
(0:58:58) Kev: A remake or whatever, right?
(0:58:59) Kev: There's different categories, that's step one.
(0:59:04) Kev: The hard part is having played enough, right?
(0:59:07) Kev: Because obviously, we can't play every single game that comes out this year.
(0:59:11) Al: yeah do you know I do have I do have an early runner for my favorite game update though and
(0:59:13) Kev: Right?
(0:59:19) Al: that's the mica update into the montgon mountgon that was this year yeah that that was that was
(0:59:22) Kev: was that this year oh my gosh jeez louise that was a good update
(0:59:28) Al: very i've really i've really enjoyed that because um it felt like a good amount of content based on
(0:59:30) Kev: that was a great update yeah
(0:59:33) Al: the size of the base game um it had uh challenges so it felt like you were actually you know trying
(0:59:40) Al: to do, it wasn't like...
(0:59:42) Al: I'll just go and do a bunch of fetch quests, right?
(0:59:44) Al: Like you were actually trying to hone your skills on the broom.
(0:59:45) Kev: yeah yeah yeah yeah that was a great one um well okay look well you know let me let me say my
(0:59:56) Kev: titles let me just uh bring up bring up my titles um like I got five-ish I would say just and they're
(1:00:06) Kev: all pretty much the ones I played that's part of the problem right i've only played like five games
(1:00:10) Al: Yeah. So your favorite games are the five games you've played.
(1:00:10) Kev: and I've enjoyed them more or less. I lucked that out. I didn't play sugardoo like you.
(1:00:16) Kev: That is correct, but I will say there is a clear winner. Like okay, Cinnabonnie, I enjoyed, and that was cute and alright. That was a good one.
(1:00:33) Kev: Hello Kitty was new to me, but it came out, so I kind of even struggled to think about that one.
(1:00:39) Kev: It was the Mika update, but look okay that the three winners in my opinion so far for me.
(1:00:46) Kev: I'm gonna say the oh gosh I'm forgetting the name. I'm trying to look down the list here on the notion to remember the name.
(1:00:59) Kev: Oh my gosh, what was it? Oh my gosh. Hold on, I had it ten minutes ago. I should have written it down.
(1:01:08) Kev: Hold on, wait one second now. I legit had it and I forgot it. Okay, that's how much I like the game.
(1:01:14) Al: Is it is it is a wonder stop.
(1:01:16) Kev: I mean one just stops number one. I'm gonna get to that. Goucho Goucho's the one. Red Topi. Okay, never mind.
(1:01:18) Al: i'll go to.
(1:01:20) Kev: Okay, yes, okay. Oh look, I'll just say my top. Yeah, okay. Yes, okay. Alright, let me just do my top three because there were good ones.
(1:01:21) Al: it's fine i'll call that i'll call that I don't worry i'll cut it out, you can read it.
(1:01:28) Kev: There was, you know, Cinnabonnie was good. Hello Kitty was good, but I'm not counting that because it was, it came out in my opinion.
(1:01:35) Kev: And then I don't know that that's weird to me like I yes, you have a valid point. It's for people played it and it was my first time playing it but this game that already existed right it is so I don't know.
(1:01:46) Kev: My three thus far like I'm gonna say Goucho which of course right that's that is like the one game I was excited for this this year on this list that I see.
(1:01:52) Al: okay. Yeah. And that was one you meant that was one you mentioned in the in
(1:01:59) Kev: I enjoyed it. It's kind of small.
(1:02:03) Kev: Yeah, that is true. There you go.
(1:02:07) Kev: I was good. I think it's kind of small scope. I don't know if everyone will enjoy it.
(1:02:13) Kev: But I like it.
(1:02:15) Kev: I liked it.
(1:02:17) Kev: I don't even know if it quite met my expectations, because it was just different from what I anticipated.
(1:02:22) Kev: But what was there was good.
(1:02:25) Kev: Rattopia.
(1:02:27) Kev: Rattopia is weird, because it's not even like holy cottagecore, right?
(1:02:33) Kev: It's not...
(1:02:33) Al: - Oh, okay, it definitely counts, come on.
(1:02:37) Kev: It feels very different, let me say that, from other cottagecore games.
(1:02:41) Kev: Because in my opinion, it's not
(1:02:45) Kev: I hate it like the
(1:02:47) Kev: It's not the cottage-y part
(1:02:49) Kev: You know that cozy feeling
(1:02:51) Kev: Uh, for as much as I hate the word
(1:02:53) Kev: Right? Um...
(1:02:55) Kev: And the gameplay, it's very
(1:02:57) Kev: Strategy based
(1:02:59) Kev: Like, I don't know
(1:03:00) Al: Cottagecore and his strategy aren't mutually exclusive.
(1:03:01) Kev: Just when I play Ratopia
(1:03:03) Kev: Yeah, you're right, you're right
(1:03:05) Kev: But I don't know, it just
(1:03:07) Kev: It feels different, because
(1:03:09) Kev: Maybe it's because it's not about individual characters
(1:03:11) Kev: Um...
(1:03:12) Al: It's not, but it is, because you are still playing as an individual character.
(1:03:13) Kev: Right like they're all in animals in peace
(1:03:16) Kev: Right the one specific but like they don't have personalities. They don't have anything going on. There's no story
(1:03:23) Kev: It's just just build me. Maybe that's what it is. Right? Like there's no writing. There's no Lord or story. It's just
(1:03:30) Kev: Make numbers go up
(1:03:32) Al: Yeah, that's fair. But it's done in a, it's done in a casual way though, right? Like you're not,
(1:03:33) Kev: That that's what I think feels different
(1:03:37) Kev: It is
(1:03:39) Al: it's not as uncozy as most management.
(1:03:42) Kev: Yeah, you're right. It has a Codgecore aesthetic. It's cute.
(1:03:45) Kev: Mice and you're out in the woods and there's a degree of farming or whatever
(1:03:51) Kev: but I don't know either way it is it is a good game so I'm gonna put it in my top
(1:03:56) Kev: three but you know what all that all that's fine and dandy but really all that
(1:04:02) Kev: matters is that there's one game way above power gap between everything else
(1:04:07) Kev: and that's wanders up and I'm gonna I'm already set on arguing wanders up to be
(1:04:12) Kev: game of the year.
(1:04:16) Kev: It's absurd how good at Wanda Stop is.
(1:04:21) Kev: Guess what? The Stanley Parable people do good writing.
(1:04:26) Kev: And what's funny is, Wanda Stop is very clearly cottagecore.
(1:04:35) Kev: You're running a tea shop and it's relaxed and slow paced.
(1:04:37) Al: Yeah. I mean, the fact that the fact that it's the fact that his cottage core is literally
(1:04:39) Kev: But it's also very stressful.
(1:04:44) Al: part of the plot, right?
(1:04:46) Kev: correct yes but it also leans on that in the opposite way like calling out how
(1:04:53) Kev: stressed you are and making you very uncomfortable at points depending on who
(1:04:59) Kev: you are. Wander stop is so good like yeah I mean that's my clear winner from all
(1:05:08) Kev: this year but and I legit think it's in the running for Game of the Year.
(1:05:11) Al: Well, I wouldn't disagree with that, like, obviously I've not played it but from all of the, you know, from the episode and from other people's coverage and stuff, it does seem like it's a very good game and I would love to play it.
(1:05:26) Al: But there's so many games to play. And this is the problem. This is the problem.
(1:05:31) Al: Do we focus on a few games that everybody ends up playing and then we can actually have a proper discussion about whether they are.
(1:05:41) Al: The best game of the year, or do we spread out that workload and different people play different games. And that means I end up with all the bad games and.
(1:05:53) Al: And, and then you kind of it's hard to you're then basically based on who's best to arguing something right because you can't actually have a proper, a proper discussion about whether something is good and that's how the last few years has gone is whoever was best at convincing the other people that the game that
(1:06:01) Kev: - Yeah, yeah.
(1:06:11) Al: they played was best. It's a hard one.
(1:06:14) Kev: That is correct, and I hold my minneko victory. You know I hold it up high
(1:06:22) Al: Yeah, I mean, yeah, exactly. Like that's a perfect example of that, right? Like, we both played and loved that game, but not everybody played it, and therefore you can't have those conversations.
(1:06:32) Al: And this is the problem with games, where it's like, if you really want to, you can watch most of the films that are released, at least most of the good ones, at least most of the ones that people will have watched.
(1:06:40) Kev: - Yeah.
(1:06:42) Al: Right? So like, I easily can watch all of the films that are nominated for the Oscars, and then we can actually have a discussion.
(1:06:52) Al: About whether we think the right one was chosen. But with games, it's so much harder because you, like, at what point have you played it enough to know if you've got a full idea of what that game is?
(1:06:53) Kev: - Sure.
(1:07:05) Al: Especially with something like Wonder Stop, right? Which is, you know, very much about the story. Do you have to finish the story to be able to say whether it's the best game or not?
(1:07:06) Kev: In
(1:07:08) Kev: Yeah
(1:07:11) Kev: Kind of want to do it start to finish
(1:07:15) Kev: Yeah
(1:07:18) Kev: Yeah, well hmm, okay. All right one second
(1:07:25) Kev: Okay, sorry. Okay. All right. All right. I guess we're just brainstorming now. How would do we attack gave it here, right?
(1:07:30) Al: We are. Yeah, why not? Why not?
(1:07:33) Kev: Yeah, okay here. Here's my thoughts right because
(1:07:36) Kev: I fully agree right like I think to have a discussion of any x of the year everyone needs to have
(1:07:42) Kev: Like in the Oscar example seen the films right that that's I think that just makes sense. So
(1:07:46) Al: The Oscars even added that to their rules for next year, which apparently it wasn't
(1:07:49) Kev: Okay, look, there's a list of
(1:07:52) Kev: Finally I can't believe that didn't exist
(1:07:54) Al: apparently already a rule.
(1:07:57) Kev: So stupid, um, I think
(1:08:01) Kev: Because look there's this list of 34 games, right?
(1:08:06) Kev: Whittle it down to top ten or five easily, right?
(1:08:09) Al: Yes, but how do you know which ones to do because do you just look at like overall Metacritic score and then we're just being driven by everyone else, rather than actually having a good idea of what the best one is right
(1:08:23) Kev: Well right well here's the thing right what what you want to do is you want to
(1:08:28) Kev: limit it to
(1:08:30) Kev: X number of games a small amount that way you know you you get whoever is on the panel or whatever
(1:08:38) Kev: You yeah, you got to play a certain number of them, right?
(1:08:43) Al: How do you decide that list? That's the thing. You're then artificially limiting what can be
(1:08:45) Kev: Yeah
(1:08:49) Al: the game of the year.
(1:08:51) Kev: Well, we-
(1:08:53) Kev: You gotta do the game-
(1:08:56) Kev: Well, we did for Game of the Year last year, that's gonna be the pre-Game of the Year, to determine the list for the actual Game of the Year.
(1:09:02) Kev: That's how we're gonna do it.
(1:09:03) Al: So we need to do it like two months before the end of the year, so we can make the list.
(1:09:06) Kev: That is maybe actually-
(1:09:10) Kev: If you wanted to get serious, you maybe actually-
(1:09:14) Al: So, well, okay, let's get serious. I don't want to get serious, I think, would be my point, right?
(1:09:18) Kev: Okay, yeah, no, yeah, I agree, I agree.
(1:09:22) Al: I think what is fun about the game of the year episode that we do is not that we have an answer,
(1:09:27) Al: right? Because we can't know these things. What I think is fun is people talking about games they
(1:09:35) Al: like, right? And that is naturally going to be people picking up games that they think they will
(1:09:36) Kev: Yeah, I agree
(1:09:42) Al: like and therefore
(1:09:43) Al: playing them and finding "yes, yes I did in fact like this game" or "no, no in fact
(1:09:48) Al: I did not like this game, it did not do what I expected it to". And I think to change that
(1:09:55) Al: would be to the detriment of that episode. That's fair.
(1:09:55) Kev: - Yeah, probably, yeah.
(1:09:59) Kev: Because yeah, I'm brainstorming,
(1:10:00) Kev: how would you actually make this work?
(1:10:02) Kev: But I agree, I don't think we have the capacity,
(1:10:05) Kev: nor do we specifically want to do,
(1:10:07) Kev: you know, actually become an Oscars of Conage Corps games,
(1:10:12) Kev: right, we're just BSing and having nonsense debates
(1:10:17) Kev: on the end of the year episode.
(1:10:21) Kev: but uh but yeah it's
(1:10:23) Al: I mean, because it's an interesting question in general, like if we think about like Jeff
(1:10:25) Kev: yeah oh yeah who's
(1:10:27) Al: Keeley's The Game Awards, right? Are they all playing all of the games? And what are
(1:10:33) Al: all of the games? Are they just playing the nominated games? How do they decide on the
(1:10:36) Al: nominated games? I honestly don't know the answer to this question. And most people will
(1:10:41) Al: just be like, Oh, the game that should win is the game that I played. Because I know
(1:10:46) Al: that's good. Because let's be honest, all of the games are good. They've been nominated.
(1:10:51) Al: Otherwise it wouldn't have been nominated.
(1:10:54) Al: You know, are you going to have played most of those games?
(1:10:54) Kev: true true and there's this kind of weird there's a weird I don't know i'm sure there is a name for
(1:10:56) Al: No, of course not.
(1:11:02) Kev: I don't know what it is but there's definitely an effect of a game that gets talked about a lot
(1:11:08) Kev: gets uh makes it more appealing if that makes sense right like right so I mean just looking
(1:11:16) Kev: at this list like wander stop is probably one of the most talked about games on on this list right
(1:11:24) Kev: like people will probably be more inclined to enjoy it if they play it just because they hear
(1:11:29) Kev: good things about it um so yeah I don't know it's it's weird um yeah because like if you
(1:11:40) Kev: just play the best games because everyone says they're the best games well yeah that gun just
(1:11:44) Kev: feeds into itself um I i don't know but and and you're right this is a weird year because there's
(1:11:54) Kev: doesn't feel like there's any juggernuts other than wander stop um right like other years
(1:12:00) Al: In terms of upcoming games, because we still have some upcoming games, we do have the
(1:12:04) Kev: that is true
(1:12:06) Al: Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar, which could be good, and is in particular a remake of
(1:12:08) Kev: and that's true
(1:12:13) Al: a game that not very many people played originally. What else? What else? I mean,
(1:12:21) Al: Fields of Mystery, if their 1.0 comes out this year, that could be a big one, because
(1:12:26) Al: that got a lot of attention last year when it came out in Early Access, just in general.
(1:12:29) Kev: It did? Well, I mean, I mean, fields of mystery could win on those pins alone, let's be honest!
(1:12:36) Al: Yeah, yeah
(1:12:44) Kev: Let's just, screw it, let's just give it to Pixel Cross, 'cause Pixel Cross is always good!
(1:12:50) Kev: Don't, don't think, just, just do it, it's good.
(1:12:52) Al: Well, I would really struggle to give the best Cottagecore game of the year to a Picross game.
(1:13:03) Kev: mind makes it easy don't think about it it wins because it's big
(1:13:10) Al: I think those would be the big ones. I need to update my upcoming list because
(1:13:16) Kev: uh you know you know you know you know you know what i'm thinking out I think I might have the
(1:13:18) Al: I just noticed multiple games that are already out that are still later on in the list.
(1:13:25) Kev: answer we're gonna mix it up this year go for the worst game of 20 25 see not how it is sugar do i
(1:13:25) Al: Tell me.
(1:13:30) Al: Oh, it's Suga-ju Island.
(1:13:34) Al: Like there's no competition there, Suga-ju Island, right?
(1:13:39) Al: like yet Tamagotchi pl-
(1:13:40) Al: as a close second place but like Suguji Island.
(1:13:46) Kev: - Yeah, but see, now you can already speak with authority.
(1:13:50) Al: Well I play both of those games they're both terrible.
(1:13:52) Kev: - Yeah, yeah, there we go.
(1:13:56) Al: All right well I yeah I don't really know where we go with this but I think it's an
(1:14:01) Al: interesting question and I guess my point is game of the years for games well game of the years
(1:14:11) Al: at all are nonsense but let's keep doing it because it's fun. Is that fair?
(1:14:15) Kev: yeah it is it's why it's wild because we're in a quote unquote niche genre
(1:14:24) Kev: right like and it's look how hard it is that's that's pretty crazy yeah that's I like
(1:14:24) Al: Yeah. And there's still too many. Yeah.
(1:14:30) Al: Yeah. Well, let's just think if let's, I mean,
(1:14:32) Al: let's have a look at the list of, uh, for games of the year, last year,
(1:14:37) Al: right? The, the, the nominees for the game of the year, last year,
(1:14:42) Al: where Astrobot, Bellattro, Blacksmith Wukong,
(1:14:47) Al: Elden Ring, Shadow of the Air Tree, which was a DLC, not a game,
(1:14:52) Al: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which
(1:14:54) Al: I believe is the second part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Metaphor Re-Fantasio.
(1:14:58) Kev: That is correct, yes.
(1:15:03) Al: How can you properly justify what is best of astrobot, bilateral, and an Elden Ring
(1:15:10) Al: DLC? Never mind the other three. What does it mean to be the best of those? What makes
(1:15:13) Kev: Hahahahaha!
(1:15:16) Kev: Aww, that's a good point.
(1:15:18) Kev: Umm...
(1:15:20) Kev: I...
(1:15:20) Al: astrobot better than bilateral? I mean, I do think that astrobot is better than bilateral.
(1:15:24) Kev: Hahaha! You tell me!
(1:15:24) Al: Because I think the bilateral is very one note, and it's good at what it does,
(1:15:26) Kev: Tell me, Al!
(1:15:30) Al: but it gets boring quickly. Whereas astrobot is a much more fleshed out and enjoyable game as a
(1:15:35) Al: whole. But what makes astrobot better than Blacksmith Wukong? I can tell you that my six-year-old
(1:15:40) Kev: I do well. I, um...
(1:15:44) Al: has put in a hundred hours into astrobot, and obviously he's never going to play Blacksmith
(1:15:49) Al: Wukong. So one of them is definitely better for him, but does that make it better than the other
(1:15:56) Kev: Maybe
(1:15:58) Kev: I
(1:16:00) Kev: Don't know
(1:16:02) Kev: But maybe though I
(1:16:05) Kev: Like it more that's what makes it better. That's good. It's the game that year cuz I like it
(1:16:12) Al: Well that's and that's my point and that's and that's fine but then we like I think it makes
(1:16:18) Al: more sense in our format because we're just talking about the games that we like and then
(1:16:24) Al: realistically we don't need to have a an answer for the question but it's just a fun little kind
(1:16:29) Al: of debate to have at the end but like the game awards it makes no sense it's just
(1:16:38) Kev: Are you saying that the answer to our game of the year problem is to have Jeff Keeley host it?
(1:16:46) Al: Uh-huh.
(1:16:46) Al: Please, Noah.
(1:16:48) Kev: I
(1:16:49) Kev: want
(1:16:50) Kev: Yeah, no, I'm just thinking cuz I mean wholesaling games is a thing right like TM actually a brand
(1:16:57) Kev: Do you think we'll get a wholesome game of the year at one point? I feel like we're on track to that
(1:17:02) Al: Oh, I'm surprised we haven't.
(1:17:05) Kev: Yeah, there you go. Well, there you go. Then the question settled
(1:17:08) Kev: They'll do it. We never have to do it again and then did the dare these
(1:17:10) Al: But no, but this is the thing. It's not the same. We're not wholesome games. We're Cottagecore games.
(1:17:15) Al: Those are two different things. Nobody would say that Pumpkin Panic was a wholesome game,
(1:17:16) Kev: No to say
(1:17:22) Al: right? But we covered it. I mean, you could argue it wasn't a Cottagecore game either, but...
(1:17:22) Kev: It was not yeah
(1:17:28) Al: Do we care?
(1:17:28) Kev: Some would argue some would argue sugar do island isn't old some gay
(1:17:32) Al: Oh wow.
(1:17:33) Kev: It's an assault on the senses
(1:17:36) Al: I don't understand why like
(1:17:40) Al: why did some people like that game?
(1:17:49) Al: Are there expectations so low for games? How is it mostly positive on reviews?
(1:17:58) Kev: Hahaha!
(1:18:00) Kev: Ugh!
(1:18:01) Kev: Okay!
(1:18:03) Kev: For real, for real!
(1:18:04) Kev: We probably gotta get Cozy Game Reviews on there, though!
(1:18:08) Al: All right.
(1:18:08) Kev: Carmen, from Cozy Game Reviews, that's what we gotta do!
(1:18:13) Al: I think we're done.
(1:18:14) Al: Thank you, Kevin, for talking to me about whatever this episode ended up being.
(1:18:15) Kev: Hahaha!
(1:18:17) Al: It was meant to be the mid-year check-in, and it just ended up being existential.
(1:18:17) Kev: I don't...
(1:18:20) Kev: We don't know...
(1:18:21) Al: Is there any point to anything?
(1:18:24) Kev: Hey, I'm saying wonder stop wins now and again
(1:18:28) Kev: The game of the year that's what I'm saying
(1:18:29) Al: You know what?
(1:18:30) Al: I would not bet against that.
(1:18:32) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah who who who would dare to maybe story of seasons late in the year maybe that's
(1:18:38) Al: Well, so yeah, we do have a problem. I mean, if you talk about game of the year overall,
(1:18:43) Al: there is a problem with Wonder Stop as it came out too early in the year. And I think people
(1:18:48) Al: forget about it, which is the other problem with yearly based things. How on earth do you
(1:18:54) Al: meant to compare things that came out in February and things that came out in November?
(1:19:00) Al: October, that they don't do stuff that's in November that ends up going in the night,
(1:19:04) Al: Which is even worse, right?
(1:19:08) Al: All right.
(1:19:11) Al: We're done now.
(1:19:12) Kev: uh...
(1:19:13) Al: Kevin, where can people find you on the internet?
(1:19:14) Kev: I want to stop
(1:19:16) Kev: uh... find me a copriz on whatever and that's me on the guy
(1:19:21) Kev: uh... find me on
(1:19:23) Kev: uh... how might you know I can plug my art stuff until I make more art it's
(1:19:27) Kev: been
(1:19:28) Kev: a long time but yeah find it and i'm a copriz, what about you al, where do people find you?
(1:19:33) Al: Yes, similarly, I don't really care what people find me. I don't post anything online anymore.

(1:21:18) Theme Tune: in this episode.
(1:21:27) Kev: You know, okay, I think a few people listen to this know this one, but I cannot remember it was IGN or one of those gaming websites. They came out with a game of the decade list in, you know, right before 2020. And it was like 50 games, 100, whatever, it was a big list of games of the decade.
(1:21:53) Kev: And I remember they had...
(1:21:57) Kev: Death Stranding on that list? Before Death Stranding even came out?
(1:22:00) Al: Oh Death Stranding 2 is gonna be a game of the year this year, isn't it?
(1:22:07) Kev: Oh, I guess so. Genius cold jumbo.
(1:22:11) Al: I don't, so like, ignoring everything else about the game, I just do not understand why
(1:22:16) Al: you would want to focus on how much you put in a bag and where you put it in the bag and
(1:22:20) Kev: It's, it's, it's like, it's a very specific brain thing, I think, that appeals to certain
(1:22:21) Al: I'm just like, oh, no, it just sounds dreadful, oh my word, that's not fun, work.
(1:22:34) Kev: people.
(1:22:35) Kev: Like, you know, like satisfactory organizing your wires is a very specific brain thing
(1:22:40) Kev: that people like.
(1:22:41) Al: Yeah but that's that in and of itself sure but like that's just a small part of a bigger game
(1:22:46) Al: and it just feels like it would get in the way and be annoying. Did you know that Kojima he
(1:22:53) Al: changed the story in the game after play test because people liked the story too much?
(1:22:56) Kev: Liked it too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah
(1:23:00) Al: Who is this guy? I don't understand him.
(1:23:03) Kev: He's the genius kojumbo
(1:23:09) Kev: And you know what's funny that I heard the story isn't as great in this game as it was
(1:23:10) Al: I don't know what to say.
(1:23:15) Al: Yeah, 'cause he changed it, 'cause he made it bad.
(1:23:17) Kev: No, no, actually no. No, I've heard
(1:23:20) Kev: I've heard the opposite because people like kojima games
(1:23:25) Kev: They know that he gets
(1:23:26) Kev: And then and big-brained or whatever. I think one of the complaints. I've heard is that this story was too
(1:23:36) Kev: Too mass appealing like too too normal like it was too too straightforward
(1:23:43) Kev: But anyways, but I don't I've never I haven't played myself, so I'm just saying what I've heard
(1:23:47) Kev: But but anyways, but but that is hilarious though still they don't like to too much change it
(1:23:57) Kev: That's what sugar doo-doo, too
