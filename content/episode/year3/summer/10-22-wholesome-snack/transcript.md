## Intro

(30s) **Al:**

> Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al

(37s) **Codey:**

> - That was Cody.

(37s) **Al:**

> And we're here today to talk about cottagecore games

(41s) **Codey:**

> - Oh, woo!

(42s)

> Oh, oh, oh!

(44s) **Al:**

> We are gonna talk today about the wholesome snack. We have literally just finished watching the wholesome snack together

(53s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(53s) **Al:**

> I live streamed us talking about it

(56s)

> I have no idea if it was any interesting to anyone who...

(1m)

> I've watched it. I'm sure we'll find out at some point, but we did have a few people mostly from this lack who were here, watching and listening and commenting and I had fun.

(1m 11s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I think it's I think it's always fun to live stream these things because then you basically are getting feedback from your friends like in real time versus me having to

(1m 20s)

> Rush to slack to

(1m 22s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1m 22s) **Codey:**

> Get people's opinions

(1m 24s)

> About something that that I'm excited about. I was able to in the real

(1m 31s)

> Show people the game. I was freaked out about when you see if you put it on here. Yes, you did. Okay, I'm not gonna talk about it

(1m 36s) **Al:**

> I did. Of course I did.

(1m 39s) **Codey:**

> Oh, I need to go through all this news.

(1m 42s)

> I'm doing the news as we're doing it.

(1m 44s) **Al:**

> I mean, most people do that. Most people don't do what you do and actually look at it.

(1m 46s) **Codey:**

> I normally listen to as I normally go through all the news before you record.

(1m 52s)

> I did not do that.

(1m 52s) **Al:**

> But Cody is the only person who does that. I think it.

(1m 55s)

> That's not true.

(1m 56s)

> Micah does it.

(1m 57s)

> Micah goes and like opens up a tab for every single thing in the news.

(2m 1s) **Codey:**

> Yep, so I like to put my comments in there.

(2m 1s) **Al:**

> But that's

(2m 3s) **Codey:**

> I like to look at the material beforehand and put my comments in there

(2m 6s)

> because there's like a stress of I need to be interesting.

(2m 11s)

> If I've at least looked it up so that there's not like me on the fly trying to like panic figure out what to say,

(2m 22s)

> it just reduces some of the stress.

(2m 24s)

> It's autism.

(2m 24s) **Al:**

> I know I get that. I get that. I'm all I'm saying is most other people don't do it. I'm not saying you're not allowed to. I just find it funny. That's all all right.

(2m 29s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(2m 31s)

> Yep.

(2m 32s)

> Hit me.

(2m 34s) **Al:**

> So yeah, we're gonna go through the the stuff from the wholesome smack snack that there is to talk about.

(2m 38s) **Codey:**

> Oh, so soon.

(2m 41s)

> My brain took that to a non-wholesome place.

(2m 45s) **Al:**

> Yep. I don't know what to say. Yep. The wholesome smack. No, we are.

(2m 48s) **Codey:**

> There you go!

(2m 53s) **Al:**

> sake we here.

(2m 54s)

> Yes we will. We will be going through our deer. We will be going through the stuff from

(2m 56s) **Codey:**

> Episode title.

(3m) **Al:**

> the Holesome Snack. We have some other news to cover as well but first of all Cody what have

## What Have We Been Up To

(3m 7s) **Codey:**

> I have been doing much, um, let me actually look. I feel like I haven't been on in a hot minute,

(3m 14s)

> mm-hmm. Because I went to, um, in November, I was gone for your multiple weeks at a conference

(3m 23s)

> in Oregon, um, two conferences and then I got to see my family and then I came back and then it

(3m 28s)

> was packed on plug weekend, uh, in Philly, which was nuts and I got to see aslan. It was lovely.

(3m 35s)

> and some other, some of our other friends.

(3m 37s)

> And we got to play board games together and then I came back and ever since then, I've just been kind of like slamming my PhD trying to get everything done and squared away.

(3m 48s)

> And then when I need my brain turn off time, I've been playing like board games with my roommates also like for Thanksgiving this year.

(3m 59s)

> We don't really go anywhere and we have some other friends who don't go anywhere for Thanksgiving, but they go places for like the other holidays.

(4m 7s)

> We've got a friends giving, we just invited a bunch of people over and one of our friends drove up, he's a few hours away, but he drove up and stayed with us for like the whole weekend.

(4m 20s)

> And so we just played board games like that whole weekend, it was just kind of an open invite of anyone can come and play board games and we all ate all of the Thanksgiving food was lovely.

(4m 31s)

> Oh man, what did we not play? We played ark nova. We played slay the spire board game.

(4m 37s)

> Which I, you know, Jeff made a horrible mistake in giving me access to his amex account and I now have an amex card.

(4m 49s)

> I just, I spent so much money at that convention, but it packs you, but it was all money that I was like, should we get this? And he said yes.

(4m 57s)

> And then he'd be like, wait, why is this $180? And I'm like, I asked if you, I asked if we should get it.

(5m) **Al:**

[laughter]

(5m 3s) **Codey:**

> And you said, yes.

(5m 7s)

> But that's how much sleigh this buyer, collector's edition costs, and that's all they had.

(5m 12s)

> But it's a super fun game if you've ever played the normal, regular sleigh this buyer.

(5m 17s)

> It's that, but instead of you can play it anywhere from one to four players, and it's co-op.

(5m 22s)

> So instead of playing four people and trying to beat each other, whatever.

(5m 27s)

> You're working together and trying to use each other's skills to slay this buyer.

(5m 31s)

> And now we're doing that as a campaign.

(5m 33s)

> So every week one of our friends comes over and

(5m 37s)

> and we all are trying to slay that spire. Next time we play it's going to be

(5m 42s)

> starting act 3. Very interesting. We also played a game called Insect

(5m 47s)

> Tarium. We played March of the Ants. We played Splendor. We played Pax Premier,

(5m 56s)

> Red Dragon Inn. I'm missing at least, I'm missing at least like 3. We played, it was

(5m 58s) **Al:**

> That's a lot of games

(6m 1s)

> How long was this

(6m 4s) **Codey:**

> basically like four days.

(6m 6s) **Al:**

> Okay fair enough, I was I was assuming this was like one day and I'm like that's a lot of games for one day

(6m 7s) **Codey:**

> It was like Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

(6m 11s)

> Mm-hmm.

(6m 12s)

> Yep, nope, it was many days.

(6m 18s)

> We also got life, so that packs unplugged.

(6m 21s)

> We played like the old old version of the life board game.

(6m 24s)

> Have you ever played life?

(6m 25s)

> Oh.

(6m 26s)

> Yes, the game of, yeah, the game of life.

(6m 27s) **Al:**

> I don't - is that - is that the game of life or is it a different - the game of life?

(6m 33s) **Codey:**

> So we played the original one at PAXU and then, but.

(6m 37s)

> My friend Kaylene, I really like how in the newer ones, you get to choose which house you have instead of just being like buy a house, give me give the bank $20,000 whatever.

(6m 47s)

> So then she went and bought the most modern version and so we were playing that it was very fun.

(6m 55s)

> Our friend Jack ended up with like eight kids, was nuts.

(7m)

> Yeah, so I played a lot of that and then other than not, I've been playing house flipper on Xbox.

(7m 7s)

> Got very into that. I won't play the second one, but I'm finishing the first one and then I've just cop this late this buyer bug again. So I've just been playing that as well.

(7m 17s)

> On top of trying to finish the PhD and apply for jobs.

(7m 20s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(7m 21s)

> So just a few things then.

(7m 21s) **Codey:**

> I've applied. Yeah, I've applied for multiple jobs that could take me anywhere across the country.

(7m 28s) **Al:**

> Are you going to get a break over?

(7m 28s) **Codey:**

> Haven't. No, no, it's possible that I might. Well, it would be quote unquote a break, but it wouldn't really be a break.

(7m 37s)

> This upcoming weekend because Jeff's company holiday party, instead of just being like, they usually pay for everyone to go to like a Brazilian steakhouse or whatever and they just like get whatever you want, but this year they rented a beach house in Miami.

(7m 50s) **Al:**

> Yep.

(7m 53s) **Codey:**

> So we're just going there and then they've like book desk massages and top golf and like cooks to come to the house and jet skis and an Everglades tour and yoga.

(8m 7s)

> stuff. So that's kind of a break, but like on the way there, I'm going to be like on the

(8m 13s)

> plane. I'm just going to be writing and then any moment that I have I'll probably be writing.

(8m 18s)

> Like when I went to Hawaii with Jeff, we basically just it was it was just me doing work,

(8m 25s)

> but in a different location. And I feel like that's going to happen again. Yes.

(8m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean that's sometimes that can be

(8m 30s)

> Sometimes that can be refreshing. I find that like quite often. I'll we'll go

(8m 35s)

> To the Isle of Man and I'll still be working, but it's a school holidays

(8m 40s)

> So I'm the only one working, but I I find that

(8m 44s)

> Refreshing because it's like hey, I'm in a nice place. I'm in a place. It's not my normal place. I like being here

(8m 48s) **Codey:**

> Yup, well that's, I'm going to hush now, that was a lot.

(8m 55s)

> What about you?

(8m 56s)

> Oh, what are you up to?

(8m 57s) **Al:**

> Well, so I'm in an I'm in that awkward period where I have recorded an episode that's coming out in three weeks

(9m 4s)

> And so trying to remember what I said then and not just repeat myself

(9m 9s)

> But I am playing I've been playing snackle

(9m 11s)

> I don't want to talk about that too much because I might be talking about it

(9m 17s)

> Soon, but I so I don't want to talk about that much, but I am playing it and playing it on my Xbox ally

(9m 24s)

> I was using the kind of...

(9m 27s)

> default windows and it was fine, but I get really annoyed by a bunch of it, so I'm now using SteamOS for it, but I've got it set up so I can have Windows and SteamOS, so I can put into Windows if I want to do GamePad stuff.

(9m 41s)

> But, Snack, I just have on Steam, so I'm just going to use Steam, and it's still a much better device than the Steam Deck in terms of, like, it's more powerful and I prefer the ergonomics to it.

(9m 55s)

> But yeah, I just I just wish

(9m 57s)

> was so steam it's just steam OS is just so much better like on so many levels

(9m 59s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(10m 5s) **Al:**

> this like the sleep mode on Windows it's just terrible like if you just if you just press the

(10m 13s)

> power button to turn off the screen it does it uses so much battery power it's basically running

(10m 20s)

> everything it's not it doesn't put anything to sleep and the screen will like flash on and then

(10m 26s)

> go off 10 seconds.

(10m 27s)

> the next time you're going to be in the next one.

(10m 51s)

> and just as as you would expect, you know, it's just steamaways.

(10m 52s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(10m 57s) **Al:**

> That's what you expect it to do and windows goes some stuff.

(11m 2s)

> I feel like the problem is that they're trying to just go we want everything.

(11m 6s)

> We want it to be windows and so we're going to build windows differently,

(11m 11s)

> but because it's all fundamentally still the same thing,

(11m 14s)

> it still has all the disadvantage of windows.

(11m 17s)

> And so its power management is terrible and all of that is not fun.

(11m 22s)

> And like I don't know if it's possible to like not have a password on the lock screen for example.

(11m 27s)

> So every time you come to open up to play your game again,

(11m 32s)

> which you put down and you press the power button because you've gone to the toilet

(11m 36s)

> and you just you don't want it to sit in there with the screen on the whole time.

(11m 39s)

> You come back, you press the power button and up you have to type in your password again to get in.

(11m 43s)

> It's not great.

(11m 44s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yeah Jeff also really really likes the steam deck. He got one and basically has just been reusing it to replay

(11m 45s) **Al:**

> So there's lots of things.

(11m 53s) **Codey:**

> so long again

(11m 55s)

> And he said it's just so much faster than switch and the it feels better in the hand

(12m 3s) **Al:**

> So that and that, yeah, that's probably all I want to talk about just now because I've talked about a lot in the game a year episode and that's coming out in three weeks.

(12m 12s)

> So you'll learn more about Snackle then and also maybe next week. That's what we've been up to.

(12m 18s) **Codey:**

> Oh, woo!

(12m 18s) **Al:**

> All right, so we have some pieces of news that were before the wholesome snack that we're going to go through first.

## Game News

(12m 26s) **Al:**

> So first up, Little Rocket Lab, they have, so I think we already...

(12m 33s)

> did we already know about the Switch version? I can't remember. There is a Switch version and now a Switch 2 version coming out.

(12m 40s)

> They come out tomorrow as we're recording, so they will be out now if you're listening to this unless you're currently in the chat listening to this because we are apparently live streaming this one.

(12m 44s) **Codey:**

> Hmm.

(12m 52s) **Al:**

> As far as I can tell, the only difference between the Switch and the Switch 2 version is the Switch 2 version can run at 120 frames per second, which is madness.

(13m 2s) **Codey:**

> It's also 0.4 gigs more file size.

(13m 9s) **Al:**

> Wow. So the upgrade is free. So good. If that's, that's all you're getting is 120 frames per second,

(13m 20s)

> which feels unnecessary little unnecessarily large, right? 60 frames per second. Sure, I get that. 120

(13m 28s)

> is madness. But I'm sure there'll be somebody who will be like, no, no, I need, I need those extra 60 frames per second.

(13m 36s)

> But yeah, so that should be out now.

(13m 36s) **Codey:**

> - Well, speaking of frames per second.

(13m 39s) **Al:**

> Yes, okay, so this one's interesting to star sand island have announced they're also releasing a switch to version

(13m 46s)

> It's all coming it's all coming to switch to know

(13m 49s)

> So we already knew their switch versions coming we I don't believe we have an exact release date for them

(13m 55s)

> And don't know whether it's coming out at the same time as steam, but it is coming in 20 twin is early 20 26 is what they said early 20 26

(13m 56s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, that says, the nebulous early 2026.

(14m 7s) **Al:**

> I guess we'll--

(14m 9s)

> find out. I think we do officially have a date for on Steam as the first of February, apparently.

(14m 18s)

> I don't know if that's still the case. Let me check the Steam page.

(14m 22s)

> No, that is no saying Q1, 2026. So maybe it's not the first of--

(14m 28s) **Codey:**

> This is nuts.

(14m 29s) **Al:**

> Yes, so the Switch 2 version will have a higher performance, but what they're adding--

(14m 39s)

> two different performance modes, either quality mode, which targets 45 frames per second at 1080,

(14m 47s)

> and performance mode that delivers 60 frames per second, also at 1080.

(14m 54s)

> So basically, it's like, do you want 45 frames per second or 60?

(14m 59s)

> Because most of the time when they have two different modes of performance is like,

(15m 4s)

> This is the one that has the higher resolution. This one is the one that has...

(15m 6s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(15m 9s) **Al:**

> the higher frame rate, which is this is like, "No, no, they have the same resolution. It's just one is better."

(15m 17s)

> I guess maybe that's if you want to preserve battery life, you go for the quality mode.

(15m 23s)

> I don't know why they're calling it quality mode when it's the same resolution.

(15m 25s) **Codey:**

> Yup, that to me so like my gut when I saw quality mode was like here's the one that has the good quality like

(15m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(15m 37s) **Codey:**

> you can play it better versus the prettier mode. No, and so like that's the thing is like that's where my brain went.

(15m 41s) **Al:**

> Yes, but that's not what it is at all

(15m 47s) **Codey:**

> So I don't know if I don't like what would be the point. I guess maybe quality mode.

(15m 54s) **Al:**

> I don't know.

(15m 55s) **Codey:**

> Maybe it just drains your battery less or something? That's like...

(15m 57s) **Al:**

> I think that's the only thing I can think of.

(16m)

> The other thing I can think of is that it was a mistake and actually it's different because

(16m 6s)

> the YouTube video that the uploaded with this information is gone, they've deleted it.

(16m 11s)

> So was the video wrong and they need to fix it and re-upload it.

(16m 16s)

> But then this was a week ago and the video's not back up.

(16m 20s)

> So I don't know what's happening very weird.

(16m 24s)

> There's also no information on whether the upgrade costs

(16m 27s)

> money and it adds mouse mode and game chat as well and I think that's all we know so far.

(16m 34s) **Codey:**

> But it says you can check out the reveal trailer bullet.

(16m 40s) **Al:**

> Amazing.

(16m 42s)

> Next we have a delay.

(16m 45s)

> It's been a while since we've had to delay and hopefully won't be the last this year

(16m 49s)

> because I still have four games listed as coming out this year.

(16m 55s)

> At the overthrow and I have announced that their 1.0 is delayed till next year.

(16m 59s)

> They say first off we'd like to thank everyone for your continued patience and support for

(17m 3s)

> overthrow and while we had initially hoped to release 1.0 this month after careful consideration

(17m 9s)

> the team feels it is necessary to move the launch to next year.

(17m 13s)

> Our biggest priority is ensuring the game is in its absolute best shape for you all and this

(17m 18s)

> additional time is necessary to accomplish that goal and deliver the best player experience.

(17m 23s)

> We answer release.

(17m 24s)

> into 1.0 with the airship update as soon as we can. I enjoy that. It's like just the boilerplate like oh we need more time. Thanks.

(17m 36s) **Codey:**

> And let's go to the comments. Oh, Lord, she loading. Oh, something went wrong.

(17m 42s) **Al:**

> did you break steam? Oh yeah. Oh that's proper broken. I got it as well. Steam

(17m 43s) **Codey:**

> I did, I guess.

(17m 46s)

> Can you, can it, does it do anything for you? Oh, yeah, okay. Cool.

(17m 48s) **Al:**

> appears to be experiencing downtime. Steam is down for routine maintenance every

(17m 54s)

> Tuesday. Weird. Is it back?

(17m 55s) **Codey:**

> There you go. I found it. Take your time looking forward to it. That's perfectly fine.

(17m 59s)

> Thanks for the update. Much rather it be delayed than release when not ready. Yeah, see, this is

(18m 4s)

> is all positive.

(18m 5s)

> You mentioned this in the most reason.

(18m 6s)

> You can delay as long as you're transparent about why.

(18m 10s) **Al:**

> think up to a point up to a point I think after after like two or three delays people

(18m 10s) **Codey:**

> Oh, wait, someone just responded, "Bad!"

(18m 21s) **Al:**

> start to get annoyed at that I do think it's good they've not announced another

(18m 25s)

> time they've just said as soon as possible I do think that's probably the best way

(18m 29s)

> to go about things but yeah after a few delays people start to as you can see

(18m 37s) **Codey:**

> Some people are also saying that the devs seem to be working on another title on the sidelines, so they're not even really focused on this game.

(18m 45s) **Al:**

> That I feel like you don't know how they're working in you know

(18m 49s)

> It's not like it's very common for a lot

(18m 53s)

> You know teams that are expanding to expand by adding new new people on a different

(19m)

> Project rather than adding to your existing team because adding to your existing team doesn't necessarily speed anything up because they have to get

(19m 6s)

> Unboarded they have to figure out what it's like they have to learn your processes and your tools

(19m 11s)

> So adding people to your team doesn't necessarily speed that up but adding them

(19m 15s)

> to a new project allows you to get that started while you're finishing off an existing game. So I feel like that's a bit unfair assuming that but

(19m 23s)

> I get I get why people get frustrated with that but also I feel I feel like that's common knowledge and remedies that that's how these things work, right?

(19m 31s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I think so. It should be.

(19m 33s) **Al:**

> All right, next we have Luma Island have released their winter update. So this includes Christmas decorations and includes a limited time Luma egg. Now I that doesn't send great to me.

(19m 46s)

> Like you have to get it and before the middle of January. And it sounds like it's redolph because it says here's a hint. It's got a red nose, but yeah, just I've not I'm not a huge fan of a lot of games doing this recently, which is where for a certain period of time you can do something in game.

(20m 6s) **Codey:**

> It's the FOMO. It keeps you engaged, keeps you chime in.

(20m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(20m 11s)

> exactly not a fan of that. But then I also don't

(20m 13s) **Codey:**

> Gotta love some of the bug fixes though.

(20m 15s) **Al:**

> really play Lou violence so... [laughs]

(20m 18s) **Codey:**

> Some of the bug fixes are fun.

(20m 19s)

> So they also did the Luma's will now gather resources for you.

(20m 25s)

> You can turn, I do like this.

(20m 27s)

> You can toggle grass and plant growth on or off your farm.

(20m 31s)

> I've wished that like animal crossing did that.

(20m 34s)

> like, stop, I don't want.

(20m 36s)

> The flowers growing anymore, I don't know, because I've curated my little garden, like,

(20m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, they just want you to be logging in every single day

(20m 43s) **Codey:**

> let it just stay the way it is, but it won't.

(20m 48s)

> Yeah, I'm not doing that. Come on, Animal Crossing. We know what it is. I log in in the spring,

(20m 54s)

> I start playing, I get excited, and then by a month later, I'm not playing anymore, and then

(21m)

> suddenly I try and check in late fall, and I realize I missed so much, and then I just freak out.

(21m 6s)

> Luma's will also gather resources for you if you place them in their nests, so there are

(21m 12s)

> water luma's, earth luma's, nature luma's, mining, and lost luma's. They dig up loot from threats,

(21m 21s)

> I don't know, assuming. Yeah, it must be something in the game. I do love the first bug fix.

(21m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I got that far into Le Mansland to figure it.

(21m 34s) **Codey:**

> This performance now remains stable during loss.

(21m 36s)

> And I'm playing sessions instead of slowly degrading over time.

(21m 40s) **Al:**

> That's one way of saying we fix the memories.

(21m 46s) **Codey:**

> any of these other ones are. Dogs should no longer stand frozen on that

(21m 51s)

> one strangely fascinating spot in town.

(21m 53s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(21m 55s)

> All right, next we have the Coral Island 1.2B update

(22m)

> that is out now.

(22m 2s)

> So there's quite a lot in this.

(22m 5s)

> So first up, they have the haunted house.

(22m 11s)

> There's a new mini game.

(22m 12s)

> It's a partner only activity.

(22m 14s)

> So you have to have a romance ball NPC

(22m 16s)

> that you've already hung out with.

(22m 18s)

> And Ling's mansion becomes a haunted house

(22m 22s)

> during the year.

(22m 23s)

> This is a tattoo shop which I feel like I've not really seen in a farming game before being able to get tattoos.

(22m 30s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so this character, um, Razi, she was, she's been in the game, but, and she's clearly

(22m 39s)

> a tattoo artist, but you couldn't get anything, so I'm excited that this is finally there.

(22m 44s) **Al:**

> Yeah, she's one of the the mirror people.

(22m 48s)

> Also, they've added some more stuff to NPCs.

(22m 51s)

> So romance ball NPCs that you're dating can initiate a hug with you.

(22m 57s)

> If you're married, they can also kiss you and there's some more dynamic dialogue.

(23m 4s)

> So they're slowly trying to add more stuff to make it seem like your

(23m 8s)

> spouse is not just a husk.

(23m 12s) **Codey:**

> though they did

(23m 14s)

> They do have it where your person leaves the house now

(23m 17s) **Al:**

> Was I in the 1.2 update?

(23m 19s) **Codey:**

> That was before like in one of the original ones. Yeah, I think you actually mentioned it in a podcast recently

(23m 20s) **Al:**

> Was I 1.1?

(23m 24s) **Codey:**

> You know, it's like no, no, they changed it because like like I married to the to the hot museum guy and he

(23m 31s)

> Will go to work

(23m 33s) **Al:**

> right. I haven't played it in a while. There's another new hangout you can watch a film together.

(23m 33s) **Codey:**

> Like he leaves the house, which is great

(23m 44s) **Al:**

> There's also arcade minigames. There's a dance dash, mining minia, galaxy invaders, and mice

(23m 53s) **Codey:**

> oh my god my survivors just locked a frickin hidden core memory rodents

(24m 4s)

> revenge I gotta play it now that I think listeners if you've ever played

(24m 10s)

> rodents revenge hit me up cuz I used to play the crap out of

(24m 14s) **Al:**

> Fair enough. Also, there's some stuff about race growing, but I don't care about that. Pets now have

(24m 20s)

> a 20% chance to bring new gifts. And if you have two or more of the same type of pet, they'll

(24m 26s)

> actually play together. Oh, I forgot that you could now get multiple pets because you remember

(24m 31s)

> the first time we talked about it, I bought a bunch of pet beds and then found that you could only

(24m 32s) **Codey:**

> Uh-huh.

(24m 35s) **Al:**

> get one pet. So, that's fun. Nice.

(24m 36s) **Codey:**

> Grap.

(24m 37s)

> Wait, oh, you, spiker do gave a hardwood.

(24m 42s)

> You brought you a stick.

(24m 45s) **Al:**

> Classic. They've also added an end of season recap screen. So, that's cool. You can just see what

(24m 51s)

> you've gotten throughout the whole season, kind of like the end of day screen that you get as well.

(24m 57s) **Codey:**

> There's just other stuff like points of interest.

(24m 59s)

> You can look at pictures, new clothing options, new things

(25m 5s)

> for your decor.

(25m 7s)

> It really makes the world feel lived in.

(25m 11s)

> They also improved the UI of fishing.

(25m 16s) **Al:**

> Oh, I missed that. Where was that? Oh, yes, improved fishing. I just I got to the

(25m 16s) **Codey:**

> OK.

(25m 17s)

> Gotta keep scrolling, man.

(25m 20s) **Al:**

> point where it talked about clothing and decor and went, okay, fine. We're

(25m 25s)

> done then. And then noticed there was other things as well. Okay.

(25m 29s) **Codey:**

> combat animations are now smoother. There's hit feedback, so there's a tactile, like you clearly

(25m 36s)

> hit something. A lot of these UI issues that they're talking about and wondering if this

(25m 43s)

> has all happened.

(25m 53s)

> Solar orb.

(25m 54s) **Al:**

> I mean, basically everything's improved, right?

(25m 55s) **Codey:**

> Wait a minute, improved NPC sleeping.

(25m 58s) **Al:**

> Oh, NPCs now sleep with their blankets pulled up.

(26m 3s)

> It looks, of course, they slept on top of the bed.

(26m 6s) **Codey:**

> I don't know.

(26m 7s)

> So to be fair last night, I slept on top of the bed.

(26m 10s)

[laughing]

(26m 12s)

> Jeff was like, what are you doing?

(26m 13s)

> I'm like, I'm really warm.

(26m 15s)

> Leave me alone.

(26m 18s)

> I'm just still scrolling to the bottom.

(26m 19s)

> Ooh, color blind mode, new setting for that.

(26m 23s)

> Also bug fixes.

(26m 26s) **Al:**

> All right. That's out now. Next we have the slime launcher 2 1.1.0 update. It is out now.

(26m 34s)

> And they say it adds toys, trimmings and chin-ups.

(26m 38s)

> So there's toys for your slimes. There are a bunch of gadgets for customization and decorations, stuff like that.

(26m 48s)

> And a bunch of quality of life upgrades as well.

(26m 52s)

> The also have added shadow parts.

(26m 56s)

> Players can find shadow parts throughout the grey labyrinth, break them open to reveal a host of shadow's lines inside, or maybe get creative and take them to different location to maximize your earnings. I have no idea what that last bit means.

(27m 9s) **Codey:**

> fun. Everyone knows that we need that quality of life update of adding feather

(27m 16s)

> particles when chickens are eaten. I want feathers to rain from the heavens any

(27m 18s) **Al:**

> Wow. That's terrible. And the final pre wholesome snack news update is Disney Dream

(27m 24s) **Codey:**

> time. Can so much chicken.

(27m 34s) **Al:**

> Live Valley have released their the winter ball update. And this adds Cinderella is basically

(27m 42s)

> a familiar glass slipper will lead you to discover where the magical princess from Disney

(27m 46s)

> Cinderella has been all the

(27m 48s)

> time plus there was this on you to multiplayer thing as well dream teams I don't know where this is I don't

(27m 49s) **Codey:**

> Okay

(27m 52s)

> The horses

(28m 1s) **Al:**

> know if I care I really I'm really struggling to care but Disney Dreamlet Valley now it's like

(28m 5s)

> it feels like every week they have a new update and it's like here's another character and nothing else

(28m 8s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, well, yeah, I think that's the yeah, like that's their that's their whole shtick right like they will always have things to add to it

(28m 18s)

> Or if they don't have new characters, they'll be like oh now you can get Tiana wearing Cinderella's dress like

(28m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I just like there's too much I can't it's like it has to be your only game or you'll never keep up with that

(28m 37s)

> That's the voice of someone who has given up trying to keep up

(28m 41s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(28m 42s)

> No notes.

(28m 43s) **Al:**

> All right, that's the news

(28m 48s)

> Kind of

## Wholesome Snack

(28m 50s) **Al:**

> We're gonna we're gonna talk about the wholesome snack there were a few things in the wholesome snack

(28m 55s)

> I think--

(28m 57s)

> I think it was about half an hour long, a wholesome snack, let's have a check, yeah it was about half an hour long, and yeah we watched it live, we streamed, we had, I think about four, four people chatting in the chat as well, most of whom have left, there are apparently two people left, but I don't know if they're actively listening because they're not sending any messages in the chat, but maybe that's because we said we were going to ignore that.

(28m 59s) **Codey:**

> Yep. And we watched it live.

(29m 25s) **Al:**

> but yeah we were we were

(29m 27s)

> after watching it so we was about half an hour and there were about five things that I felt were related to us that we're going to chat about and first stop we have we finally got some footage of wild society, the follow up to wild flowers and I guess I'm going to wait for Kevin's reaction to that.

(29m 46s) **Codey:**

> Yep, I imagine that he's going to love it.

(29m 49s)

> It looked really good, and yeah.

(29m 53s) **Al:**

> I know it's I know it's up. You're running a B and B aren't you? Are you running some sort of

(29m 58s)

> place? I don't know. I can't remember if there's some story around why you're doing it. But

(30m 2s) **Codey:**

> Well, so it's like a bed and breakfast

(30m 4s)

> that for witches that your grandma used to own

(30m 7s)

> or something like that.

(30m 9s)

> And so you're building it up, you're decorating it.

(30m 13s)

> decorating looks really uh

(30m 16s)

> satisfying gives me house flip revives hosting tea parties hosting

(30m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and they showed some of the decorating the rooms as well, so I mean, it looks

(30m 21s) **Codey:**

> saiances

(30m 28s) **Al:**

> fine.

(30m 29s)

> I think if you like that sort of thing, you're going to have a lot here.

(30m 34s)

> It looks very much like it's just wildflowers, but with a different kind of core loop

(30m 39s)

> of the B&B rather than farming and then continuing on with some more story in that world.

(30m 47s)

> So I'm sure.

(30m 48s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm, and main character, who is a woman, has a lady friend.

(30m 49s) **Al:**

> Kevin will we'll love it.

(30m 57s)

> Yeah, I'm going to guess it's like the previous one and you're choosing her to romance like

(31m 3s)

> but yeah, it did very clearly show them.

(31m 7s)

> Yes, dancing together.

(31m 10s)

> So more lesbian witches.

(31m 15s)

> We also got the news of wildflowers. The first game in the series is

(31m 19s)

> coming to Xbox and PlayStation. It's already on Switch isn't it? I think I played it on Switch.

(31m 23s) **Codey:**

> uh probs?

(31m 28s) **Al:**

> Yes it is already on Switch. No I did not play on Switch. I didn't play it on Steam either.

(31m 33s)

> I played this game though. What did I play it on if I didn't play it on either Switch or

(31m 37s)

> Steam? Is it just that I'm not logged in here? No I am logged in here. No, it's more I went

(31m 37s) **Codey:**

> Is it on your other st. Switch? The switch that got nuked?

(31m 43s) **Al:**

> on to the eShop and it says bye no. I can't remember when I played it.

(31m 49s)

> It must have been on Switch and it's just thinking that I don't own it on the web. Anyway yeah so

(31m 56s)

> if you were waiting for that game to come to Xbox or PlayStation now is your time.

(32m 2s)

> Did they announce when that was? Let's have a look. Is it available now? Nice. Yep.

(32m 4s) **Codey:**

> Uh, I think he said it was available now.

(32m 8s) **Al:**

> Available now. Nice. Cool. Next we have Spirit Crossing. So this describes itself as a

(32m 14s)

> a beautiful cooperative life sim about building friendships and community.

(32m 19s)

> Now, this is the Netflix one wasn't it?

(32m 23s)

> This is a Netflix game, you don't need Netflix for it on Steam, but you do it on mobile.

(32m 32s)

> It was... let's see, we've got another blurb, but the friend bears, ad-loss spirits,

(32m 39s)

> ride fluffalo, and build a thriving village with other players in this multiplayer life sim from the creators of Cozy Grove.

(32m 47s)

> Oh, it's cozy growth people.

(32m 49s)

> All this opportunities to express yourself, make new friends and enjoy a social experience

(32m 53s)

> like any other.

(32m 54s)

> So is this a fully online

(32m 57s) **Codey:**

> I'm assuming so. Given that you're either playing on

(33m 1s)

> um, on Netflix or on a mobile account.

(33m 5s)

> Over there, it's also on Steam. I don't, I don't, there's, this game

(33m 9s)

> is kind of confusing. I don't know where this game begins and

(33m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I'll see you can like climb up cliff faces, which is interesting. I

(33m 19s)

> Think yeah, I think we're gonna need to know more more about this game in the future, but I'm intrigued

(33m 26s) **Codey:**

> It seems like you can cooperatively decorate a place, decorate your home, you talk to people,

(33m 35s)

> there's probably NPCs as well that you can talk to, something way more than,

(33m 38s)

> though I don't, I guess I don't know how many multiplayer people because it looked like there's like

(33m 43s)

> 15 or 20 people running around. Together, so I guess I don't know who would be an NPC and who

(33m 51s)

> isn't an NPC here.

(33m 53s) **Al:**

> I'm guessing none of them are in PCs?

(33m 56s) **Codey:**

> I mean, I guess the spirits, right?

(33m 58s)

> Also, you're writing Fluffalo. I don't know where you're going with them, though.

(33m 58s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah, yeah.

(34m 1s)

[Laughs]

(34m 1s) **Codey:**

> You just kind of ascend... ascend.

(34m 2s) **Al:**

> It doesn't matter.

(34m 3s)

> You're just going with them, it doesn't matter where.

(34m 5s)

[Laughs]

(34m 6s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, it just, I... it looks cute, but I guess there's not to me, there's not enough information about what you will be doing with your friends.

(34m 17s)

> Like it says, express yourself among friends, keep each other safe.

(34m 21s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it feels like it thinks it's giving you a lot of information, but actually it's really not.

(34m 21s) **Codey:**

> What?

(34m 29s) **Al:**

> Well, I guess we'll keep an eye on it and see what happens with it.

(34m 32s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I mean, it's kind of giving spirit fair where it says, as you explore, you'll meet people

(34m 36s)

> and spirits who need help with patients and kindness. They'll begin to reveal more about themselves.

(34m 40s)

> Well, it's very spirit fair or coded, but, um, yeah, I don't know. I would need, I need to see more

(34m 49s) **Al:**

> Also, as always, with multiplayer games,

(34m 52s)

> I'm just gonna struggle to find the time to play with people.

(34m 56s)

> So I wonder if it'll be able to play on your owner

(34m 58s)

> or whether it's online only,

(35m)

> and things will be really hard

(35m 2s)

> if you're only playing as one person.

(35m 4s)

> Also, it says other players.

(35m 6s)

> So maybe it's not people you know.

(35m 8s)

> Maybe it's just, you randomly get added

(35m 10s)

> into a specific village.

(35m 13s)

> Make new friends.

(35m 14s)

> I don't know.

(35m 15s)

> There's a lot, well, we'll keep an eye on it.

(35m 17s)

> We'll see what comes.

(35m 19s)

> Oh, Cory's really been waiting for this whole time.

(35m 21s) **Codey:**

> uh-huh

(35m 21s) **Al:**

> It's catchmaker.

(35m 23s)

> In bark on a cozy 3D adventure

(35m 25s)

> where you catch bugs and match them for perfect romance,

(35m 29s)

> explore a world above,

(35m 31s)

> a buzz with cute creatures,

(35m 33s)

> cute critters and help them find their perfect date

(35m 36s)

> through playful mini games,

(35m 38s)

> befriend the locals and cover your past

(35m 40s)

> and embrace your destiny as steward of a magical land.

(35m 43s) **Codey:**

> you're you're helping bugs find love oh yeah yeah um yeah so this uh when I saw this

(35m 43s) **Al:**

> You're a bug, matchmaker.

(35m 49s)

> It's, oh, that just, I only just got the catchmaker matchmaker.

(35m 59s) **Codey:**

> I rest in pepperonis to people on stream that heard me freak out about this um because it's just

(36m 8s)

> I love the idea like and the butterfly that you are playing as or that like you

(36m 13s)

> start with is like no I don't this one has too many legs and this one is I don't like this one

(36m 22s)

> and it's just so silly um so I I like the idea of like going out and finding insects um I'm trying

(36m 34s)

> to think if there were any non insects like they're if it's just arthropods in general um but going

(36m 39s)

> out and finding them and bringing them back and being like...

(36m 43s)

> Do you two want to love each other? Do you two want to love each other and it's like...

(36m 52s)

> What is the minimum... How are you willing to... What is the word I'm trying to compromise?

(37m) **Al:**

> Yeah

(37m) **Codey:**

> Or how subtle? Like, I don't know. I also just really liked the animations of the bugs as well.

(37m 10s)

> even before you get them on their little dinner plate.

(37m 13s)

> Uh, in their little like, oh gosh, what was it like lady in the tramp style dinner?

(37m 20s)

> With their, yeah, I don't know. What did you think of it? I, I kind of was just like losing my mind. Um, I didn't even ask you what you thought of it.

(37m 22s) **Al:**

> I think it's I think it's a very fun concept, um, I don't, it's definitely not for me.

(37m 35s)

> I feel like they're like having to figure out the different preferences of different bugs

(37m 40s)

> and like try and put them together just feels like it's gonna, you know, it doesn't scratch

(37m 46s)

> my brain in the way that game I want game to, um, but it's definitely a fun concept.

(37m 52s)

> And I, I see what they're doing with it. It's very clever. Um, and I'm sure lots of people will like it. It's, it's, I mean, it's basically a puzzle

(37m 59s)

> game, right? Like you're just, you're trying to, to, you're using what the bug tells you to try

(38m 5s)

> narrow down the different options and try and match them up. And I think that's fun. And the

(38m 11s)

> combining it with, you have to catch the bugs to match the bugs is, uh, is a fun, uh, a fun thing.

(38m 18s) **Codey:**

> yeah well and I think like they all have there's like a little all the

(38m 24s)

> different ways that they can be matched like there's all these different

(38m 27s)

> attributes and you're trying to be like okay how many legs how many you're trying

(38m 32s)

> to figure out like for each one what is their optimal and then I would think

(38m 37s)

> like as you're playing it you like some will be more like better matched but then

(38m 48s)

> you'll come upon another bug and you're like oh man that butterfly would have

(38m 51s)

> loved this moth or something like that you know I am intrigued you have my

(38m 54s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's cool

(38m 57s) **Codey:**

> attention

(38m 59s) **Al:**

> That is always the first and hardest thing with the game is getting someone interested in it

(39m 6s)

> The final one on our list is called Mandrake

(39m 10s)

> You were the last of the Mandrake's a

(39m 13s)

> Sorsarous line of gardeners at long last you've returned to your families abandoned home

(39m 19s)

> Make friends tend your gardens and put down roots fish gather and delve

(39m 24s)

> In the wilds make a place for yourself and uncover the mysteries your family left behind

(39m 29s)

> When we're on the stream when we're when we're watching this live, I was like this is this is just room factory, right?

(39m 30s) **Codey:**

> - Oh.

(39m 35s)

> - Yeah.

(39m 36s) **Al:**

> And I still I still stand by that. I think this is just I mean it's an interesting different our style

(39m 45s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, very, it describes itself as painterly

(39m 48s)

> and I would agree, accurate description, 10 out of 10.

(39m 52s)

> But like, I guess they also didn't say that

(39m 57s)

> like you are the Mandrake.

(40m)

> I'm really confused about why it was named it.

(40m 4s)

> But like, I liked the idea of people being like,

(40m 10s)

> like the world is dead and only some people can farm.

(40m 13s)

> I guess is that basically what you're saying

(40m 15s)

> it that is in factry, is that?

(40m 17s) **Al:**

> I don't know not that bad aspect of it. It's more like the I guess it's actually combat in this

(40m 23s)

> I was just assuming there was combat, but maybe there's not

(41m 17s) **Al:**

> The water looks weirdly realistic compared to the rest of the game

(41m 22s) **Codey:**

(46m 33s)
