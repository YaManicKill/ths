00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: But that's how much sleigh this buyer, collector's edition costs, and that's all they had.

65
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: But it's a super fun game if you've ever played the normal, regular sleigh this buyer.

66
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It's that, but instead of you can play it anywhere from one to four players, and it's co-op.

67
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: So instead of playing four people and trying to beat each other, whatever.

68
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You're working together and trying to use each other's skills to slay this buyer.

<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: My friend Kaylene, I really like how in the newer ones, you get to choose which house you have instead of just being like buy a house, give me give the bank $20,000 whatever.

90
00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:54.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: So then she went and bought the most modern version and so we were playing that it was very fun.

91
00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:59.379
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Our friend Jack ended up with like eight kids, was nuts.

92
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.300
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, so I played a lot of that and then other than not, I've been playing house flipper on Xbox.

93
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:15.899
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Got very into that. I won't play the second one, but I'm finishing the first one and then I've just cop this late this buyer bug again. So I've just been playing that as well.

94
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.819
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: On top of trying to finish the PhD and apply for jobs.

95
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.680
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: [laughing]

96
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.879
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So just a few things then.

97
00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:27.660
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I've applied. Yeah, I've applied for multiple jobs that could take me anywhere across the country.

98
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.879
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Are you going to get a break over?

99
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:37.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Haven't. No, no, it's possible that I might. Well, it would be quote unquote a break, but it wouldn't really be a break.

100
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:53.540
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: This upcoming weekend because Jeff's company holiday party, instead of just being like, they usually pay for everyone to go to like a Brazilian steakhouse or whatever and they just like get whatever you want, but this year they rented a beach house in Miami.

101
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yep.

102
00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:06.899
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: So we're just going there and then they've like book desk massages and top golf and like cooks to come to the house and jet skis and an Everglades tour and yoga.

103
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:13.379
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: stuff. So that's kind of a break, but like on the way there, I'm going to be like on the

104
00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:18.459
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: plane. I'm just going to be writing and then any moment that I have I'll probably be writing.

105
00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:25.620
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Like when I went to Hawaii with Jeff, we basically just it was it was just me doing work,

106
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:32.879
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: but in a different location. And I feel like that's going to happen again. Yes.

107
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.740
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, I mean that's sometimes that can be

108
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.080
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Sometimes that can be refreshing. I find that like quite often. I'll we'll go

109
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:40.460
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: To the Isle of Man and I'll still be working, but it's a school holidays

110
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.179
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So I'm the only one working, but I I find that

111
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.100
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Refreshing because it's like hey, I'm in a nice place. I'm in a place. It's not my normal place. I like being here

112
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.720
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yup, well that's, I'm going to hush now, that was a lot.

113
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.720
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: What about you?

114
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.759
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Oh, what are you up to?

115
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:04.259
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Well, so I'm in an I'm in that awkward period where I have recorded an episode that's coming out in three weeks

116
00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:08.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And so trying to remember what I said then and not just repeat myself

117
00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:11.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But I am playing I've been playing snackle

118
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.259
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't want to talk about that too much because I might be talking about it

119
00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:24.620
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Soon, but I so I don't want to talk about that much, but I am playing it and playing it on my Xbox ally

120
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.419
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I was using the kind of...

121
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:41.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: default windows and it was fine, but I get really annoyed by a bunch of it, so I'm now using SteamOS for it, but I've got it set up so I can have Windows and SteamOS, so I can put into Windows if I want to do GamePad stuff.

122
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:55.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But, Snack, I just have on Steam, so I'm just going to use Steam, and it's still a much better device than the Steam Deck in terms of, like, it's more powerful and I prefer the ergonomics to it.

123
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But yeah, I just I just wish

124
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.139
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: was so steam it's just steam OS is just so much better like on so many levels

125
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah

126
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:13.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: this like the sleep mode on Windows it's just terrible like if you just if you just press the

127
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:20.379
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: power button to turn off the screen it does it uses so much battery power it's basically running

128
00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:26.460
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: everything it's not it doesn't put anything to sleep and the screen will like flash on and then

129
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: go off 10 seconds.

130
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:51.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: the next time you're going to be in the next one.

131
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:59.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: and just as as you would expect, you know, it's just steamaways.

132
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That's what you expect it to do and windows goes some stuff.

134
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I feel like the problem is that they're trying to just go we want everything.

135
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We want it to be windows and so we're going to build windows differently,

136
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: but because it's all fundamentally still the same thing,

137
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: it still has all the disadvantage of windows.

138
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And so its power management is terrible and all of that is not fun.

139
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And like I don't know if it's possible to like not have a password on the lock screen for example.

140
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So every time you come to open up to play your game again,

141
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: which you put down and you press the power button because you've gone to the toilet

142
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: and you just you don't want it to sit in there with the screen on the whole time.

143
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: You come back, you press the power button and up you have to type in your password again to get in.

144
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's not great.

145
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.139
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, yeah Jeff also really really likes the steam deck. He got one and basically has just been reusing it to replay

146
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So there's lots of things.

147
00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:55.799
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: so long again

148
00:11:55.799 --> 00:12:01.779
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: And he said it's just so much faster than switch and the it feels better in the hand

149
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:12.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So that and that, yeah, that's probably all I want to talk about just now because I've talked about a lot in the game a year episode and that's coming out in three weeks.

150
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:18.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So you'll learn more about Snackle then and also maybe next week. That's what we've been up to.

151
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Oh, woo!

152
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:26.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: All right, so we have some pieces of news that were before the wholesome snack that we're going to go through first.

153
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:33.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So first up, Little Rocket Lab, they have, so I think we already...

154
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:40.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: did we already know about the Switch version? I can't remember. There is a Switch version and now a Switch 2 version coming out.

155
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:52.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: They come out tomorrow as we're recording, so they will be out now if you're listening to this unless you're currently in the chat listening to this because we are apparently live streaming this one.

156
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Hmm.

157
00:12:52.500 --> 00:13:02.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: As far as I can tell, the only difference between the Switch and the Switch 2 version is the Switch 2 version can run at 120 frames per second, which is madness.

158
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:08.679
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It's also 0.4 gigs more file size.

159
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:19.440
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Wow. So the upgrade is free. So good. If that's, that's all you're getting is 120 frames per second,

160
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:27.919
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: which feels unnecessary little unnecessarily large, right? 60 frames per second. Sure, I get that. 120

161
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:35.519
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: is madness. But I'm sure there'll be somebody who will be like, no, no, I need, I need those extra 60 frames per second.

162
00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:38.019
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But yeah, so that should be out now.

163
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.419
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: - Well, speaking of frames per second.

164
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:46.860
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yes, okay, so this one's interesting to star sand island have announced they're also releasing a switch to version

165
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.840
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's all coming it's all coming to switch to know

166
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.159
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So we already knew their switch versions coming we I don't believe we have an exact release date for them

167
00:13:55.159 --> 00:14:03.639
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And don't know whether it's coming out at the same time as steam, but it is coming in 20 twin is early 20 26 is what they said early 20 26

168
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:06.840
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, that says, the nebulous early 2026.

169
00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:09.919
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I guess we'll--

170
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: find out. I think we do officially have a date for on Steam as the first of February, apparently.

171
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't know if that's still the case. Let me check the Steam page.

172
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: No, that is no saying Q1, 2026. So maybe it's not the first of--

173
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.059
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: This is nuts.

174
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:38.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yes, so the Switch 2 version will have a higher performance, but what they're adding--

175
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: two different performance modes, either quality mode, which targets 45 frames per second at 1080,

176
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: and performance mode that delivers 60 frames per second, also at 1080.

177
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So basically, it's like, do you want 45 frames per second or 60?

178
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Because most of the time when they have two different modes of performance is like,

179
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.600
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: This is the one that has the higher resolution. This one is the one that has...

180
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.340
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Mm-hmm.

181
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.279
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: the higher frame rate, which is this is like, "No, no, they have the same resolution. It's just one is better."

182
00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:23.559
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I guess maybe that's if you want to preserve battery life, you go for the quality mode.

183
00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:26.440
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't know why they're calling it quality mode when it's the same resolution.

184
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:37.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yup, that to me so like my gut when I saw quality mode was like here's the one that has the good quality like

185
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah

186
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.399
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: you can play it better versus the prettier mode. No, and so like that's the thing is like that's where my brain went.

187
00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:43.919
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yes, but that's not what it is at all

188
00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:54.960
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: So I don't know if I don't like what would be the point. I guess maybe quality mode.

189
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't know.

190
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.360
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Maybe it just drains your battery less or something? That's like...

191
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.259
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I think that's the only thing I can think of.

192
00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:05.700
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: The other thing I can think of is that it was a mistake and actually it's different because

193
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.259
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: the YouTube video that the uploaded with this information is gone, they've deleted it.

194
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.179
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So was the video wrong and they need to fix it and re-upload it.

195
00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:19.860
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But then this was a week ago and the video's not back up.

196
00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:22.740
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So I don't know what's happening very weird.

197
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.779
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: There's also no information on whether the upgrade costs

198
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:33.299
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: money and it adds mouse mode and game chat as well and I think that's all we know so far.

199
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.620
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: But it says you can check out the reveal trailer bullet.

200
00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:41.539
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Amazing.

201
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.580
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Next we have a delay.

202
00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:49.379
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's been a while since we've had to delay and hopefully won't be the last this year

203
00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:53.299
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: because I still have four games listed as coming out this year.

204
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.899
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: At the overthrow and I have announced that their 1.0 is delayed till next year.

205
00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:03.620
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: They say first off we'd like to thank everyone for your continued patience and support for

206
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.539
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: overthrow and while we had initially hoped to release 1.0 this month after careful consideration

207
00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:12.420
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: the team feels it is necessary to move the launch to next year.

208
00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:18.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Our biggest priority is ensuring the game is in its absolute best shape for you all and this

209
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.299
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: additional time is necessary to accomplish that goal and deliver the best player experience.

210
00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:25.299
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We answer release.

211
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:35.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: into 1.0 with the airship update as soon as we can. I enjoy that. It's like just the boilerplate like oh we need more time. Thanks.

212
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.380
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: And let's go to the comments. Oh, Lord, she loading. Oh, something went wrong.

213
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.579
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: did you break steam? Oh yeah. Oh that's proper broken. I got it as well. Steam

214
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.180
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I did, I guess.

215
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.339
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Can you, can it, does it do anything for you? Oh, yeah, okay. Cool.

216
00:17:48.579 --> 00:17:54.579
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: appears to be experiencing downtime. Steam is down for routine maintenance every

217
00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:56.740
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Tuesday. Weird. Is it back?

218
00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:59.460
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: There you go. I found it. Take your time looking forward to it. That's perfectly fine.

219
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.180
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Thanks for the update. Much rather it be delayed than release when not ready. Yeah, see, this is

220
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.180
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: is all positive.

221
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.420
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You mentioned this in the most reason.

222
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.859
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You can delay as long as you're transparent about why.

223
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:21.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: think up to a point up to a point I think after after like two or three delays people

224
00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:14.299
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Oh, wait, someone just responded, "Bad!"

225
00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:25.740
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: start to get annoyed at that I do think it's good they've not announced another

226
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.680
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: time they've just said as soon as possible I do think that's probably the best way

227
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:35.160
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: to go about things but yeah after a few delays people start to as you can see

228
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:44.900
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Some people are also saying that the devs seem to be working on another title on the sidelines, so they're not even really focused on this game.

229
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That I feel like you don't know how they're working in you know

230
00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:53.819
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's not like it's very common for a lot

231
00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:59.400
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: You know teams that are expanding to expand by adding new new people on a different

232
00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:06.599
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Project rather than adding to your existing team because adding to your existing team doesn't necessarily speed anything up because they have to get

233
00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:11.160
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Unboarded they have to figure out what it's like they have to learn your processes and your tools

234
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.940
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So adding people to your team doesn't necessarily speed that up but adding them

235
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.299
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: to a new project allows you to get that started while you're finishing off an existing game. So I feel like that's a bit unfair assuming that but

236
00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:31.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I get I get why people get frustrated with that but also I feel I feel like that's common knowledge and remedies that that's how these things work, right?

237
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, I think so. It should be.

238
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:44.900
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: All right, next we have Luma Island have released their winter update. So this includes Christmas decorations and includes a limited time Luma egg. Now I that doesn't send great to me.

239
00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:05.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Like you have to get it and before the middle of January. And it sounds like it's redolph because it says here's a hint. It's got a red nose, but yeah, just I've not I'm not a huge fan of a lot of games doing this recently, which is where for a certain period of time you can do something in game.

240
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.900
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It's the FOMO. It keeps you engaged, keeps you chime in.

241
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah.

242
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: exactly not a fan of that. But then I also don't

243
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Gotta love some of the bug fixes though.

244
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.960
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: really play Lou violence so... [laughs]

245
00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:19.720
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Some of the bug fixes are fun.

246
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.559
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: So they also did the Luma's will now gather resources for you.

247
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You can turn, I do like this.

248
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.599
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You can toggle grass and plant growth on or off your farm.

249
00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:34.079
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I've wished that like animal crossing did that.

250
00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:35.619
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: like, stop, I don't want.

251
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.119
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: The flowers growing anymore, I don't know, because I've curated my little garden, like,

252
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.799
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, well, they just want you to be logging in every single day

253
00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:47.519
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: let it just stay the way it is, but it won't.

254
00:20:48.319 --> 00:20:54.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, I'm not doing that. Come on, Animal Crossing. We know what it is. I log in in the spring,

255
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I start playing, I get excited, and then by a month later, I'm not playing anymore, and then

256
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.440
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: suddenly I try and check in late fall, and I realize I missed so much, and then I just freak out.

257
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.720
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Luma's will also gather resources for you if you place them in their nests, so there are

258
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:21.680
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: water luma's, earth luma's, nature luma's, mining, and lost luma's. They dig up loot from threats,

259
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:34.160
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I don't know, assuming. Yeah, it must be something in the game. I do love the first bug fix.

260
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.839
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I got that far into Le Mansland to figure it.

261
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.019
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: This performance now remains stable during loss.

262
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: And I'm playing sessions instead of slowly degrading over time.

263
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That's one way of saying we fix the memories.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.059
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: any of these other ones are. Dogs should no longer stand frozen on that

265
00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:55.460
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: one strangely fascinating spot in town.

266
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.660
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: [laughs]

267
00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.660

269
00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:04.900
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So there's quite a lot in this.

270
00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:10.220
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So first up, they have the haunted house.

271
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.059
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: There's a new mini game.

272
00:22:12.059 --> 00:22:14.099
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's a partner only activity.

273
00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:16.180
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So you have to have a romance ball NPC

274
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.660
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: that you've already hung out with.

275
00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:22.420
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And Ling's mansion becomes a haunted house

276
00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.539
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: during the year.

277
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:30.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: This is a tattoo shop which I feel like I've not really seen in a farming game before being able to get tattoos.

278
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:39.519
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, so this character, um, Razi, she was, she's been in the game, but, and she's clearly

279
00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:43.960
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: a tattoo artist, but you couldn't get anything, so I'm excited that this is finally there.

280
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.279
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, she's one of the the mirror people.

281
00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:51.920
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Also, they've added some more stuff to NPCs.

282
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:56.920
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So romance ball NPCs that you're dating can initiate a hug with you.

283
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:03.279
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: If you're married, they can also kiss you and there's some more dynamic dialogue.

284
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.400
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So they're slowly trying to add more stuff to make it seem like your

285
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.960
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: spouse is not just a husk.

286
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: though they did

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.299
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: They do have it where your person leaves the house now

288
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Was I in the 1.2 update?

289
00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:24.940
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: That was before like in one of the original ones. Yeah, I think you actually mentioned it in a podcast recently

290
00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.859
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Was I 1.1?

293
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.759
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: right. I haven't played it in a while. There's another new hangout you can watch a film together.

294
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.460
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Like he leaves the house, which is great

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: There's also arcade minigames. There's a dance dash, mining minia, galaxy invaders, and mice

296
00:23:53.500 --> 00:24:04.579

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Fair enough. Also, there's some stuff about race growing, but I don't care about that. Pets now have

300
00:24:20.579 --> 00:24:26.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: a 20% chance to bring new gifts. And if you have two or more of the same type of pet, they'll

301
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:31.220
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: actually play together. Oh, I forgot that you could now get multiple pets because you remember

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Classic. They've also added an end of season recap screen. So, that's cool. You can just see what

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: you've gotten throughout the whole season, kind of like the end of day screen that you get as well.

310
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.339
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: There's just other stuff like points of interest.

343
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.819

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: it feels like every week they have a new update and it's like here's another character and nothing else

355
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:18.099
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, well, yeah, I think that's the yeah, like that's their that's their whole shtick right like they will always have things to add to it

356
00:28:18.099 --> 00:28:27.279
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Or if they don't have new characters, they'll be like oh now you can get Tiana wearing Cinderella's dress like

357
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.880
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, I just like there's too much I can't it's like it has to be your only game or you'll never keep up with that

358
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:40.759
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That's the voice of someone who has given up trying to keep up

359
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.839
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: [laughing]

360
00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:43.839
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: No notes.

361
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.759
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: All right, that's the news

362
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.640
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Kind of

363
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.559
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We're gonna we're gonna talk about the wholesome snack there were a few things in the wholesome snack

364
00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:56.960
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I think--

365
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:25.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I think it was about half an hour long, a wholesome snack, let's have a check, yeah it was about half an hour long, and yeah we watched it live, we streamed, we had, I think about four, four people chatting in the chat as well, most of whom have left, there are apparently two people left, but I don't know if they're actively listening because they're not sending any messages in the chat, but maybe that's because we said we were going to ignore that.

366
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.400
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yep. And we watched it live.

367
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: but yeah we were we were

368
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:45.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: after watching it so we was about half an hour and there were about five things that I felt were related to us that we're going to chat about and first stop we have we finally got some footage of wild society, the follow up to wild flowers and I guess I'm going to wait for Kevin's reaction to that.

369
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.660
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yep, I imagine that he's going to love it.

370
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:58.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It looked really good, and yeah.

371
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I know it's I know it's up. You're running a B and B aren't you? Are you running some sort of

372
00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:01.720
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: place? I don't know. I can't remember if there's some story around why you're doing it. But

373
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.200
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Well, so it's like a bed and breakfast

374
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.079
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: that for witches that your grandma used to own

375
00:30:07.079 --> 00:30:09.559
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: or something like that.

376
00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:13.759
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: And so you're building it up, you're decorating it.

377
00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:19.839
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: decorating looks really uh

378
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.980
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: satisfying gives me house flip revives hosting tea parties hosting

379
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:28.700
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, and they showed some of the decorating the rooms as well, so I mean, it looks

380
00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.700
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: saiances

381
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.700
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: fine.

382
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.740
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I think if you like that sort of thing, you're going to have a lot here.

383
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.259
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It looks very much like it's just wildflowers, but with a different kind of core loop

384
00:30:39.259 --> 00:30:47.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: of the B&amp;B rather than farming and then continuing on with some more story in that world.

385
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So I'm sure.

386
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:57.220
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Mm-hmm, and main character, who is a woman, has a lady friend.

387
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Kevin will we'll love it.

388
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:03.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, I'm going to guess it's like the previous one and you're choosing her to romance like

389
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: but yeah, it did very clearly show them.

390
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yes, dancing together.

391
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So more lesbian witches.

392
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.359
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We also got the news of wildflowers. The first game in the series is

393
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:28.019
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: coming to Xbox and PlayStation. It's already on Switch isn't it? I think I played it on Switch.

394
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: uh probs?

395
00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:33.359
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yes it is already on Switch. No I did not play on Switch. I didn't play it on Steam either.

396
00:31:33.359 --> 00:31:37.140
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I played this game though. What did I play it on if I didn't play it on either Switch or

397
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:43.460
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Steam? Is it just that I'm not logged in here? No I am logged in here. No, it's more I went

398
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:46.299
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Is it on your other st. Switch? The switch that got nuked?

399
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:51.160
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: on to the eShop and it says bye no. I can't remember when I played it.

400
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:56.880
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It must have been on Switch and it's just thinking that I don't own it on the web. Anyway yeah so

401
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:02.519
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: if you were waiting for that game to come to Xbox or PlayStation now is your time.

402
00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:08.319
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Did they announce when that was? Let's have a look. Is it available now? Nice. Yep.

403
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.359
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Uh, I think he said it was available now.

404
00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:14.880
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Available now. Nice. Cool. Next we have Spirit Crossing. So this describes itself as a

405
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.180
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: a beautiful cooperative life sim about building friendships and community.

406
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.319
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Now, this is the Netflix one wasn't it?

407
00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:32.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: This is a Netflix game, you don't need Netflix for it on Steam, but you do it on mobile.

408
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:39.299
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It was... let's see, we've got another blurb, but the friend bears, ad-loss spirits,

409
00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:47.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: ride fluffalo, and build a thriving village with other players in this multiplayer life sim from the creators of Cozy Grove.

410
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Oh, it's cozy growth people.

411
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.920
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: All this opportunities to express yourself, make new friends and enjoy a social experience

412
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: like any other.

413
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.480
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So is this a fully online

414
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I'm assuming so. Given that you're either playing on

415
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: um, on Netflix or on a mobile account.

416
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Over there, it's also on Steam. I don't, I don't, there's, this game

417
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: is kind of confusing. I don't know where this game begins and

418
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.839
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, I'll see you can like climb up cliff faces, which is interesting. I

419
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.099
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Think yeah, I think we're gonna need to know more more about this game in the future, but I'm intrigued

420
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:34.180
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It seems like you can cooperatively decorate a place, decorate your home, you talk to people,

421
00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.099
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: there's probably NPCs as well that you can talk to, something way more than,

422
00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:43.779
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: though I don't, I guess I don't know how many multiplayer people because it looked like there's like

423
00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:51.779
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: 15 or 20 people running around. Together, so I guess I don't know who would be an NPC and who

424
00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:55.099
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: isn't an NPC here.

425
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.059
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I'm guessing none of them are in PCs?

426
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.299
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I mean, I guess the spirits, right?

427
00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:01.660
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Also, you're writing Fluffalo. I don't know where you're going with them, though.

428
00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.619
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yes, yeah, yeah.

429
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:02.400
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: [Laughs]

430
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.940
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You just kind of ascend... ascend.

431
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.279
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It doesn't matter.

432
00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.200
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: You're just going with them, it doesn't matter where.

433
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.200
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: [Laughs]

434
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:17.420
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, it just, I... it looks cute, but I guess there's not to me, there's not enough information about what you will be doing with your friends.

435
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.579
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Like it says, express yourself among friends, keep each other safe.

436
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:27.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, it feels like it thinks it's giving you a lot of information, but actually it's really not.

437
00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:22.579
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: What?

438
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Well, I guess we'll keep an eye on it and see what happens with it.

439
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.239
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of giving spirit fair where it says, as you explore, you'll meet people

440
00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:40.880
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: and spirits who need help with patients and kindness. They'll begin to reveal more about themselves.

441
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:47.280
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Well, it's very spirit fair or coded, but, um, yeah, I don't know. I would need, I need to see more

442
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.639
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Also, as always, with multiplayer games,

443
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:56.679
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I'm just gonna struggle to find the time to play with people.

444
00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.760
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So I wonder if it'll be able to play on your owner

445
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.400
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: or whether it's online only,

446
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.320
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: and things will be really hard

447
00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.559
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: if you're only playing as one person.

448
00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:06.280
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Also, it says other players.

449
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.320
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So maybe it's not people you know.

450
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.960
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Maybe it's just, you randomly get added

451
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: into a specific village.

452
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.719
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Make new friends.

453
00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:15.559
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't know.

454
00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:17.239
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: There's a lot, well, we'll keep an eye on it.

455
00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:18.840
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We'll see what comes.

456
00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:21.679
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Oh, Cory's really been waiting for this whole time.

457
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: uh-huh

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.800
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: You're a bug, matchmaker.

469
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's, oh, that just, I only just got the catchmaker matchmaker.

470
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:08.059
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I rest in pepperonis to people on stream that heard me freak out about this um because it's just

471
00:36:08.059 --> 00:36:13.420
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I love the idea like and the butterfly that you are playing as or that like you

472
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:22.300
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: start with is like no I don't this one has too many legs and this one is I don't like this one

473
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:34.300
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: and it's just so silly um so I I like the idea of like going out and finding insects um I'm trying

474
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:39.900
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: to think if there were any non insects like they're if it's just arthropods in general um but going

475
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.300
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: out and finding them and bringing them back and being like...

476
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:50.139
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Do you two want to love each other? Do you two want to love each other and it's like...

477
00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:59.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: What is the minimum... How are you willing to... What is the word I'm trying to compromise?

478
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah

479
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:09.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Or how subtle? Like, I don't know. I also just really liked the animations of the bugs as well.

480
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.260
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: even before you get them on their little dinner plate.

481
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:19.820
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Uh, in their little like, oh gosh, what was it like lady in the tramp style dinner?

482
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:29.739
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: With their, yeah, I don't know. What did you think of it? I, I kind of was just like losing my mind. Um, I didn't even ask you what you thought of it.

483
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:35.519
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I think it's I think it's a very fun concept, um, I don't, it's definitely not for me.

484
00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:40.880
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I feel like they're like having to figure out the different preferences of different bugs

485
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: and like try and put them together just feels like it's gonna, you know, it doesn't scratch

486
00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:51.920
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: my brain in the way that game I want game to, um, but it's definitely a fun concept.

487
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.360
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And I, I see what they're doing with it. It's very clever. Um, and I'm sure lots of people will like it. It's, it's, I mean, it's basically a puzzle

488
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.440
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: game, right? Like you're just, you're trying to, to, you're using what the bug tells you to try

489
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:11.760
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: narrow down the different options and try and match them up. And I think that's fun. And the

490
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:19.599
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: combining it with, you have to catch the bugs to match the bugs is, uh, is a fun, uh, a fun thing.

491
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.719
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: yeah well and I think like they all have there's like a little all the

492
00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:27.760
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: different ways that they can be matched like there's all these different

493
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.559
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: attributes and you're trying to be like okay how many legs how many you're trying

494
00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:37.920
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: to figure out like for each one what is their optimal and then I would think

495
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:47.599
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: like as you're playing it you like some will be more like better matched but then

496
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.119
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: you'll come upon another bug and you're like oh man that butterfly would have

497
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:57.760
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: loved this moth or something like that you know I am intrigued you have my

498
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's cool

499
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.320
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: attention

500
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.059
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That is always the first and hardest thing with the game is getting someone interested in it

501
00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:10.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: The final one on our list is called Mandrake

502
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.320
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: You were the last of the Mandrake's a

503
00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:19.179
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Sorsarous line of gardeners at long last you've returned to your families abandoned home

504
00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.460
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Make friends tend your gardens and put down roots fish gather and delve

505
00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:29.159
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: In the wilds make a place for yourself and uncover the mysteries your family left behind

506
00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:35.019
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: When we're on the stream when we're when we're watching this live, I was like this is this is just room factory, right?

507
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.840
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: - Oh.

508
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.599
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: - Yeah.

509
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:43.780
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: And I still I still stand by that. I think this is just I mean it's an interesting different our style

510
00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.079
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: - Yeah, very, it describes itself as painterly

511
00:39:48.079 --> 00:39:51.960
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: and I would agree, accurate description, 10 out of 10.

512
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.639
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: But like, I guess they also didn't say that

513
00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:59.239
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: like you are the Mandrake.

514
00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:03.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I'm really confused about why it was named it.

515
00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:09.599
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: But like, I liked the idea of people being like,

516
00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:13.679
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: like the world is dead and only some people can farm.

517
00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:15.960
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I guess is that basically what you're saying

518
00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.719
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: it that is in factry, is that?

519
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't know not that bad aspect of it. It's more like the I guess it's actually combat in this

520
00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.300
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I was just assuming there was combat, but maybe there's not

521
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I don't remember seeing combat

522
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Okay fine not room factory then

523
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:35.219
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It's just that like nobody can nobody knows how to farm. There's a curse in a way that no one knows how to farm

524
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.940
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah

525
00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:39.659
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Except for people in your line like of your family

526
00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:37.739
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah

527
00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:44.940
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Okay, it's it's uh harvestman one world then that's what that was that concept behind that game

528
00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:47.059
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Okay

529
00:40:46.179 --> 00:40:48.179
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, fine

530
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:59.059
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: It's interesting I guess I'm not I think it's interesting. I don't know if I like it. I don't I don't I dislike it. It's more like

531
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.300
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I really like the art style

532
00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.420
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: feels

533
00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.380
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: busy and

534
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.219
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm not drawn to it personally

535
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Okay

536
00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:15.420
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I definitely see why one would be drawn to it

537
00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:18.239
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Just not you that's fair

538
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.139
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: The water looks weirdly realistic compared to the rest of the game

539
00:41:22.519 --> 00:41:26.599
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Well, yeah, I mean, I think that that's the painterly style

540
00:41:27.199 --> 00:41:32.679
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: But yeah, maybe this is just not not your bag of tea and that's okay cup of tea

541
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.460
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah

542
00:41:31.539 --> 00:41:36.139
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Or it is cuz I don't like tea so it is my cup of tea cuz I don't like cup

543
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.199
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: That's wild that you don't like tea as that

544
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.340
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Which bit not liking D? Oh?

545
00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.420
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, yuck leaf water

546
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: You

547
00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.420
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: uh again we'll keep an eye on this so keep an eye on all these games as they come out

548
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:54.940
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I don't think so spirit crossing said there's going to be an alpha soon catch maker and

549
00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:00.300
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Mandrake just say coming soon um I can't remember whether we have anything for a world

550
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: society in terms of a release date let's have a look on steam they just

551
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:15.699
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Now, but I did wishlist catchmakers, so listeners stay tuned.

552
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:25.460
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I have wish-listed spirit crossing, because I'm intrigued by it, but I don't know if I'll actually do anything with it.

553
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:36.260
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I might try it and see. It does help that I am already Netflix subscribers, so I do just get it. Yeah, we'll see.

554
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.599
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I just don't know if I've I've never like played a Netflix game

555
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:46.900
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Yeah, there's not a few of them, so Monument Valley 3 was Netflix.

556
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:55.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I think the newest cozy grove, which is the other game from these guys. I think the newest cozy grove was a called Camp Something.

557
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:06.179
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: That one was Netflix. Other than that, it's mostly like IP stuff, so there was a Stranger Things game stuff like that.

558
00:43:06.179 --> 00:43:16.900
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But they're definitely trying to do more stuff, and obviously it might get more interesting if they do actually buy one of brothers, because they're buying the game part of that as well.

559
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.500
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Yeah.

560
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:28.099
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But that's a whole other conversation, and who knows what is going to happen with that, because Trump's buddy is trying to buy it as well.

561
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.719
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: yep. Well, we'll see.

562
00:43:28.099 --> 00:43:31.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So he knows.

563
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:43.500
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: They're offering more money, but the whole company, whereas the Netflix one is just for some of it, and then they can sell off the rest of it to someone else, for even more money.

564
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So it's business and politics.

565
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:56.260
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We're going to show up together in many, many dodgy deals.

566
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.860
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It's just so fun.

567
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.719
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: What a fun timeline we're in.

568
00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.619
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Oh dear.

569
00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:00.940
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: All right.

570
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.579
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: We devolved there.

571
00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:06.139
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Shall we wrap up this podcast?

572
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:15.539
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I'm sure we felt we fell into a little bit of a of a sad reality is not fun anymore.

573
00:44:06.139 --> 00:44:08.139
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Cody, do you have anything?

574
00:44:08.139 --> 00:44:13.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I had to put those up there for a second.

575
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.980
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: [Laughter]

576
00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:17.900
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I want to get off the ride.

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Cody, do you have anything you'd like to share with us?

<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Uh, that Rodin's revenge is really fun.

579
00:44:26.639 --> 00:44:29.719

<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: wanted to tell you that you're stupid or how you're wrong.

<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: And I disagree.

<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: So we're not, we're not here to denigrate ourselves until like, I think so.

592
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:19.300
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Did I say stupid? I probably just meant it as like an off-handed like oh that's a stupid

593
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.300
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: thing to say or something like that I don't know. It's all right I'm not gonna believe anyone

594
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:28.179
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: of these say I'm stupid I know I'm not stupid. I may say stupid things sometimes and I made

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.380
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: Okay, good. Good, good, good.

<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: do stupid things. I mean isn't that most podcasts? Can't even remember what them that was.

597
00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:33.260
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I do think that was the podcast that you started off by saying that you guys were very tired.

598
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.699
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: It is.

613
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.239
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: farming game of the years, games of the year.

614
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:24.880
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Haven't decided when that one's coming out

615
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.119
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: because normally what I do is I'd release the game

616
00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:30.320
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: of the year episode on the last Wednesday

617
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.079
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: and then the non farming game of the year on the 31st.

618
00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:35.960
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: But the problem is the 31st is the last Wednesday.

619
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.880
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: So I needed to decide do they come out the same time?

620
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.760
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: Does the non farming game of the year come out next year

621
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.760
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: or does it come out before the game of the year episode?

622
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.099
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: I feel like they could come out at the same time.

623
00:46:48.099 --> 00:46:49.300
<v 61D8BF38-1ACC-484A-850F-B08EB2BFD595>Codey: That makes sense.

624
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.360
<v BB28DAD5-21B6-46A5-A421-A30982948D55>Al: I did also, we did also record the greenhouse episode first week.
