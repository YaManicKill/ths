(3m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I think the selection process was still undergoing.

(3m 7s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so basically they there was like a potential that we could get either this

(3m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, what, what breed are they, is she again?

(3m 36s) **Codey:**

> She's an Australian shepherd they're one of the most intelligent breeds and they just have so much energy so Stella when he first got her like she had energy but she was very like aloof as a puppy she was very like even keel just kind of … like a little derpy um

(3m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Oh, yeah, that's a smart one.

(3m 54s) **Codey:**

> and this one came out she's already really really smart and she already like with Stella Estella was trying to play with something that she was supposed to play with we could like take that and hide it and then give her a toy that she was supposed to play with and then um Stella would be like oh this is cool but like peppercorn is looking into peppercorn um she's like where'd that thing go I want to bite that thing like where did you put that thing so

(4m 43s) **Kevin:**

> fun quote. I mean a lot of it is fun but also things get torn to shreds and they just look adorable doing and that's that's the kicker.

(4m 48s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(4m 50s)

(5m 20s)

> And then when I finally like got past that place. It's kind of a part where the game gets harder

(5m 27s)

> Now I'm like in an area that's really like unforgiving and I'm just

(5m 31s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(5m 32s) **Codey:**

> I know I'll pick it back up eventually, but I just I'm really

(5m 35s)

(5m 42s)

> some of my roommate and I play Fortnite together every now and then like I'll have work and while he's playing I'll be like doing some work and then he'll be doing some stuff while I'm playing. So we just pass off back and forth every time we dive and Fortnite's, yeah go for it. Yeah.

(5m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that that's good. Yeah. Okay. Well, one second before I just want to point out you you were doing the syphian task of, you know, a PhD and you took break of the other syphian task and what to go play. So stop. Okay, but four night is good. That's a good. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

(6m 6s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(6m 8s)

> - Yeah.

(6m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(6m 42s)

> What's Scooby doo doo doo doo doo doo doo I missed that one!

(6m 43s) **Codey:**

> You'd be, yeah, Scooby-Doo isn't there.

(6m 46s)

> So there's like some quests where you have to go like talk to all the people.

(6m 50s)

> And then one of the quests, I was doing it, it's for Daphne.

(6m 54s)

> She like lost her luggage or something.

(6m 55s)

> So you go and try and find her luggage and you find out it was stolen by Mothman.

(7m) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(7m) **Codey:**

> And my roommate and I like screamed because we love

(7m 6s)

(7m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, you're you're you're in my bank country. Yeah

(7m 18s)

> Yeah, yeah

(7m 21s) **Codey:**

> There's a lot of that in this area and a bunch of us want to go and just look at the Mothman stuff statues booty.

(7m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(7m 27s)

> Yeah

(7m 27s) **Codey:**

> I don't know if you've heard about the booty of the Mothman statue.

(7m 31s)

> listeners of you haven't Google it. It's hilarious.

(7m 31s) **Kevin:**

> No

(7m 36s) **Codey:**

> So yeah, we really want to do that. So we like lost our mind and we're waiting for a mothman outfit to come out because we will we have put no money into Fortnite, but we will.

(7m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Okay. I mean, okay, like this is a lot because this is good stuff. First of all,

(7m 51s)

> I love Scooby doo. I'm a huge Scooby doo fan. Um, that's, so that's awesome. Uh,

(7m 53s) **Codey:**

> Yep, big same.

(7m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Mothman top top probably 10, maybe top five cryptids. That's a good one. Um, I'm looking up the butt.

(8m 3s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(8m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I get it. I get it now. Yep. No, that's, uh, um, yep.

(8m 8s) **Codey:**

> - He, he thick.

(8m 11s) **Kevin:**

> They're very, just like the real one.

(8m 14s) **Codey:**

> I don't know why,

(8m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, someone you, someone you, why?

(8m 15s) **Codey:**

> I don't know why they needed to make the statues so thick.

(8m 22s)

> But they did, and it's really funny.

(8m 25s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, why did Guillermo do it with the sound of water, the fishman?

(8m 25s) **Codey:**

> So yeah.

(8m 31s)

> Oh yeah, I haven't...

(8m 33s)

> See that yet, but he does some silly stuff, but yeah.

(8m 33s) **Kevin:**

> But we know that's good stuff.

(8m 38s) **Codey:**

> So yeah, that's been playing that a decent amount.

(8m 40s)

> I'd usually, like, after getting up in the morning and running the dogs for a bit, like,

(8m 44s)

> all before I jump into work, I'll play, like, a game or two.

(8m 48s)

> Oh, they also had kpop demon hunters in there for a while.

(8m 51s) **Kevin:**

> I know, I know, I'm here, you're sweating about it, thinking constantly.

(8m 53s) **Codey:**

> Um, and they still have a mode called Demon Rush, where it's basically just like Call of Duty

(9m 3s)

> where you have, like, demons, like, running at you and you have to survive these waves.

(9m 9s)

> Um, I really, I'll do, like, one or two of those, too, before, 'cause they take maybe, like,

(9m 9s) **Kevin:**

> That's pretty good.

(9m 14s) **Codey:**

> 10 minutes.

(9m 15s)

> Um, I'll do a couple of those, and then I'll, and then I'll be like, "Okay, time to work."

(9m 20s) **Kevin:**

> that's pretty good. I saw many of those cosmetics. They're really good. I've never been interested in Fortnite up till this until K-pop even has evidence by last week when I screamed. Anyway,

(9m 20s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(9m 31s)

> Yeah

(9m 36s)

> Yeah, so that's what I've been up to what I've even up to

(9m 38s) **Kevin:**

> that's good stuff. Okay, so I have some. Okay, first off, my pop corner time.

(9m 46s) **Codey:**

> uh-huh

(9m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Today I took like

(9m 50s)

> the office my office work office for a little bit because it was going to be a long for a few hours I was like I'll just watch them. It's fine because today most people were working around anyway, so it was chill It was good. He's he's he's officially won now, I guess

(9m 51s) **Codey:**

> oh

(10m 7s)

> No.

(10m 7s) **Kevin:**

> But he's still very poppy And he probably will be for another year if not longer because we spoil him

(10m 15s)

> But yeah, he was all behaved. He was fun. He was popular of course

(10m 20s)

> because he just got groomed, so he's very cute and then done fluffy and soft. But he was good, but yeah, he's at one point. I did have to like, okay, I'm gonna hop in a conference room because he was a little bored, a little whiny, and there's people talking, so you know, let's not have puppy welps on the zoom calls. But yeah, that was fun. He's very tuckered eyes, been sleeping all after I go back.

(10m 33s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(10m 50s) **Kevin:**

> So that was fun.

(10m 52s)

> Okay.

(10m 53s)

> So I'm a big podcast listener when I'm working because you know,

(10m 58s)

> it's easy to throw stuff audio.

(11m)

> It's different sense as opposed to my vision stuff when I'm working.

(11m 4s)

> Have you heard the thing about PAM?

(11m 7s) **Codey:**

> The thing about no. Okay.

(11m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(11m 9s)

> So it is a date line podcast.

(11m 12s)

> That's the one I listen to.

(11m 13s)

> It's not just a single, it's a series.

(11m 17s)

> many series like six episodes originally.

(11m 21s)

> This one got a lot of attention. I they eventually made I think Netflix made these series out of it

(11m 27s)

> It's a it's a wild one. It's about

(11m 31s)

> Okay, this guy arrives home and he finds his wife murdered. She's been stabbed and

(11m 39s)

> The investigation goes on and he basically this guy gets arrested and and is sent to jail for life He's found guilty, but he in fact did not do it

(11m 48s) **Codey:**

> Mmm. Yeah.

(11m 50s) **Kevin:**

> a lot of let's say shenanigans that the law enforcement get up to and the prosecutors

(11m 55s)

> Basically, there was another woman who took out a life insurance policy on the woman who died

(12m)

> So surprise I guess what her name is Pam and guess what she did it probably she hasn't been convicted But anyways, that's a setup and it's a wild rollercoaster I recommend to other people, but I will say this there is a second murder in this series involving this woman who's just like a

(12m 21s)

> Suburban soccer mom type lady

(12m 24s)

> But yeah, it's it's a good one. It's a wild story because just off the bat like the wrong person gets convicted

(12m 32s)

> Yeah, good times

(12m 35s)

> So I recommend that looks a date line podcast wherever it's also a mini series Renee

(12m 41s)

> That's why I think I forget every her name

(12m 45s) **Codey:**

> Brittany's cell wager? Uh-huh.

(12m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. Yeah, she she's the pretty she produced

(12m 50s)

> the series because she listened to the podcast series and said, I want to make this into a acting series and then she stars in it using prosthetics and like a fit.

(12m 58s) **Codey:**

> That is really funny because she played, she was in Chicago as Roxie Hart,

(13m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(13m 4s) **Codey:**

> which is a woman who murdered someone and gets it in like, basically gets away with it because her lawyer is good enough. So that's really funny.

(13m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(13m 8s)

> Yeah, that's good. Oh, let's go. I didn't know that. That's good

(13m 15s)

> Yeah, so let's check that out. That's the thing about Pam. I did some easy to listen six episodes or less than an hour each

(13m 22s)

> Anyways, okay, the video game world though the one thing people care about here

(13m 26s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(13m 28s) **Kevin:**

> It's not true, but Okay, so I've been playing a lot.

(13m 33s)

> Digimon cyber sleuth. That's a game that came out almost like 10 years ago.

(13m 39s)

> I knew I'd like a new Digimon came out that I want to play, but I had been able to get it.

(13m 44s)

> So I'm playing, you know, I went back to the original cyber sleuth.

(13m 49s)

> This game is still incredible. I loved it the first time, replaying it is still incredible.

(13m 54s)

> It's monster catching and

(13m 57s)

> monster collector turn-based battles. So, you know, a lot of, let's say, comfort food.

(14m 3s)

> For Pokemon fans, let's say that. But, of course, Digimon has their way of doing things.

(14m 12s)

> Not that they're family friendly, but they'll get more mature or go, you know,

(14m 16s)

> after different designs and things like that. And tonally, they can go pretty dark places.

(14m 23s)

> This game can go incredibly dark in places, also really funny. The writing's just good across the board. But I want to talk about one side quiz called the Perfect

(14m 29s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(14m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Girl Project. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. So the the I guess the setting for this world that the the game takes place in regular earth and Tokyo, but there's also an online like virtual reality world that everyone can log into and then you know, you have a virtual avatar and you just move around in cyberspace or whatever. Okay. So in this one side quest,

(14m 34s) **Codey:**

> - God, this is already.

(15m 3s) **Kevin:**

> it's called cyber sleuth because you're a detective basically and you've been hired because

(15m 8s)

> girls, there there have been these

(15m 12s)

> life-sized dolls. Let's call them with very realistic appearances of actual people

(15m 20s)

> of all all ladies and females, of course, being sold on the street. And so they're asking you to look into it because

(15m 28s)

> That probably means somebody somehow stole their avatar data and

(15m 33s)

> they're producing these these these dolls or whatever so you're already off to a great start right um well you dig into the case and eventually you learned there's there's a higher level to this plan it's called the perfect girl project basically they convince guys to sign up for the service where they can live online with virtual

(16m 3s)

> there's a pretty much whatever woman or female or whoever they want and just hang out with them so you know good stuff but here there's there's only one catch or two two catches one the guy has to be healthy and to he has to be willing to just basically never never log off that he has to agree to that and so where does that lead to well while the guys meant totally in cyberspace with these these perfect girl projects his body is implied to be shipped off to a foreign country for whatever reasons they would want a healthy body and so we get the kind of a kill shot at the end of like proof of one of the Vic because you encounter one victim and he tries to log out and he can't log out there's nowhere to log out to he says which is a message that hasn't been seen in the game otherwise.

(17m 3s)

> so so yeah that was fun that was wild to see them just go all in and then it was followed by a side quest where I helped the buddy find her rare manga that was it that's that's the kind of this tonal distance this game loves to do just go up and down like that from the most stuff to just shenanigans for giggles.

(17m 28s) **Codey:**

> Wild. That's a choice they're making.

(17m 33s) **Kevin:**

> um yeah good stuff but yeah that's did you on that the likes of the writing grades I recommend I like did you want. um okay but that's what I've been up to all right let's get on to game news now okay uh to start things off let's talk about not overcooked to overthrown that's the one with the you're not link and you can.

(18m 3s)

> pickup structures and throw them. Hence the name. Fun concept. Okay, big, their news, it's delayed. 1.0 is being delayed. I'll read the quote here. While I was not in easy call, we are fully committed to delivering the best possible version of the game and it would be a disservice both to our work and our community to rush the final release. That said, we want to reassure you that overthrown 0.0 is on track to launch before the end of the year. Um, that is, uh,

(18m 33s)

> uh, yeah. Okay. So that's the, that's pretty much the news and I mean, good for them because it's better to, to use the quote out foot here. The, the famous quote from, I guess, the great developers.

(18m 47s)

> So that came from them. I didn't realize that. Okay.

(18m 48s) **Codey:**

> Oh, no, no, so I put this here.

(18m 50s)

> One of the, there's a comment,

(18m 51s)

> I just went to the comments on this,

(18m 53s)

> 'cause I'm always really curious whenever a game gets like delayed or whatever, like what the fans say.

(18m 59s)

> So there was a commenter on this post,

(19m 4s)

> whose name, their name is Gungrave,

(19m 6s) **Kevin:**

> uh-huh

(19m 6s) **Codey:**

> and they said, "A finished game is good,

(19m 8s)

> but an unfinished game is forever bad."

(19m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I think that was me a motor who originally said it if I recall correctly someone I didn't end up here

(19m 14s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so, but...

(19m 16s)

> - 10 out of 10. - Correct.

(19m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(19m 18s) **Codey:**

> - What?

(19m 19s)

> - Take your time, get your stuff done,

(19m 22s)

> but don't worry about rushing it.

(19m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and hey, there's still aiming for this year, which that seems like a tight deadline, but okay

(19m 33s)

> They have airships that's there's a lot going on in this game, but it's dropping bombs

(19m 38s) **Codey:**

> the airships was wild, like they were like, "Oh, and here's a picture of the airships."

(19m 41s)

> And I'm like, "You're straight up dropping from someone's like on someone's,

(19m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(19m 48s) **Codey:**

> it looks like they're farm.

(19m 50s)

> It's just someone's farm just get an absolutely bomb dropped on, which is nuts."

(19m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not surprised like they're doing a lot in this game because you know physics based throwing and what not like

(20m 4s)

> That's a that's a lot. But take good for them for delaying. That's that's my opinion. Yeah, especially since you know a

(20m 10s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, take your time.

(20m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Like 20 good games are coming out. So we've got plenty to play until then

(20m 19s)

> Pokemon legends is going to be dropping after this podcast

(20m 21s) **Codey:**

> Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that because I'm like kind of out of that whole thing.

(20m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(20m 29s)

> Yeah, that's fine. Oh, I mean, well the game looks good. I like xy a lot. I like so I'm excited

(20m 36s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(20m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Megaholutrix exists. I don't want that

(20m 42s)

> Okay speaking of things that exists

(20m 46s)

> The Guardians of Azuma that that is exists. It has existed and a new patch up

(20m 54s)

> Is out actually one point one point. Oh, oh, yeah, all those decimals

(20m 59s)

> It's out for switch and switch to in Europe and Australia

(21m 5s)

> They added boss gauntlets which

(21m 10s)

> Go ahead Cody you wrote your notes

(21m 11s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so the Bosgon lids, it just seems like to me like it's basically just a hard mode.

(21m 17s)

> So for some bosses, so if you've completed the main quest, these Bosgon lids can be either acquired or purchased, I don't know exactly how, but it adds like, I think it was four different bosses that you can do that are just a little bit harder.

(21m 31s)

> So if you've hit like the main, the end of the main quest, it kind of just offers something more difficult to do.

(21m 38s)

> that's your up to difficulty.

(21m 40s) **Kevin:**

> down. There you go. And I mean, this is a room factory. So combat, I get people who play it for the combat. I presume so that that's a good one to add. But aside from that, the other part, because like linked banner of the spark, there's combat and there's not combat. Village life, they've added a new development zone to summer village.

(21m 46s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(22m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Just a whole bunch of new facilities and decorations. Expanding capacity of a whole bunch of stuff,

(22m 16s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(22m 17s) **Kevin:**

> which is, it's fun. A maximum bomb level 200. What was it before? That's a triple digits. That's big.

(22m 25s)

> And all sorts of bug fixes.

(22m 28s) **Codey:**

> I always, so in the, in one of the next, I think it is in the next thing, Al calls that a bug fix,

(22m 34s)

> he likes, and so I saw one on this that I thought was hilarious as well. So they said,

(22m 39s)

> fixed a bug where villagers tasked with farming would sometimes harvest crops even when the action was set to off. So it's like, you tell, you tell them you're like, you don't have to harvest, and it's just in their blood. It's in their DNA. They're digital DNA. They're like,

(22m 46s) **Kevin:**

> hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Yeah. Yeah. Like the Minecraft villagers even when you really don't want to hurt me, they'll do it.

(22m 55s) **Codey:**

> - I'm sorry, I have to harvest this, like.

(22m 58s)

[laughs]

(23m)

> I just think that's really, yeah.

(23m 4s)

> And you're like, please, leave my stuff alone.

(23m 4s) **Kevin:**

> That's what I'm going to do.

(23m 7s)

> Ah, that's good.

(23m 8s) **Codey:**

> But yeah, I thought that was funny.

(23m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Um, speaking of one point one point oh, updates, story of seasons, grandpas are, oh, is that it?

(23m 22s)

> That's so weird, it's coincidence because it's story of seasons and room factory.

(23m 26s)

> You get the same update number.

(23m 26s) **Codey:**

> Oh, you're right.

(23m 28s) **Kevin:**

> That's wild.

(23m 30s)

> Um, I'll also getting the one point one point oh update.

(23m 34s)

> Um, you know, so like the big thing is called happy bingo.

(23m 35s) **Codey:**

> I didn't even notice that which props to you.

(23m 41s) **Kevin:**

> And it is, as the name implies, Bingo.

(23m 46s)

> Basically, daily tasks, so you get a Bingo card from the nature sprites, and you gathering mushrooms, harvesting crops, selling things, I'm just kind of going based off the icon.

(23m 59s)

> Just, you know, day-to-day activities you do, you fill out spots, and if you get a Bingo on bizarre days, you can go to the nature sprites and claim rewards.

(24m 11s)

> And there are some cool ones, because you get a pirate outfit, I want to be a pirate

(24m 16s)

> outfit, like pirate outfits, visuals, so.

(24m 18s) **Codey:**

> Yep. I like, I just like the happy, I just like bingo. So anytime anyone could just make something a bingo, like you already have to do these tasks, but you can do them in a bingo style where it's like,

(24m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(24m 34s) **Codey:**

> okay, well, how like in what order should I complete the tasks? And then they also have like

(24m 40s)

> like a, if you do a horizontal or a vertical or a diagonal, like you get a different reward.

(24m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, oh yeah, I didn't catch that, that's good.

(24m 48s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so there's that. And then there's, if you complete all of them, then there's another,

(24m 53s)

> so there's like levels to the bingo as well. Um, so I, I feel like that, and it would also make you do things that you might not always do. Um, because if I, for example, yeah, you have to pet the thing 25 that,

(25m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Al has to pet the barn animal 25 times

(25m 11s) **Codey:**

> like I would do, I mean, I do that too, where I'm like, I don't want to do that. And so I will

(25m 17s)

> not do something.

(25m 18s)

> But if there's a little sweet treat associated with it, you betcha, I'm gonna do it.

(25m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean and outfit is a pretty big incentive like you even

(25m 32s)

> Side from pirate stuff that I like like just in general. That's a good one for this game

(25m 38s)

> So that's exciting and that's just

(25m 41s)

> Volume one in their image, so you know what else will they come up with? I don't know, but that's a cool. That's a cool way to do it

(25m 49s) **Codey:**

> Yup. Oh, and then I'll the bug fix in this that I'll comment it on he said I love weird bugs. So this

(25m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, all right

(25m 56s)

[Laughs]

(25m 56s) **Codey:**

> It's bug is fixed issues where dismounting from the horse would reset your bag color to the default outfits

(26m 5s) **Kevin:**

> The part I like is that, you know, maybe the devs don't even know themselves.

(26m 8s) **Codey:**

> I just like things like this just make me smile like how did this

(26m 13s)

> Happen like where in the code did it decide that it wanted

(26m 19s)

> To like reset this, you know like it's just it's just silly. That is just a silly thing

(26m 31s)

> Exactly!

(26m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Oh.

(26m 35s)

> Good, good old spaghetti code and you know the gen good tower that is coding good good for you guys dear for dealing with that. I can't

(26m 40s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(26m 47s) **Kevin:**

> All right, oh Tell the shyer so close you could have had a hat trick of the 1.1 point 1.0's

(26m 53s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(26m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Tell the shyer update 1.0 point 2.4 digit

(27m 1s)

> Farf decimal point places. Oh, that's good stuff

(27m 6s)

> To you to quote al's note your bug fixes. That's the tweet. Um, we're yeah, we're good. Oh

(27m 10s) **Codey:**

> That's it, that's it

(27m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Gosh, what was it? It was oh?

(27m 16s)

> It was a Pokemon game

(27m 19s)

> I can't remember what Pokemon game it was where the the patch notes would usually be various improvements to the game or something

(27m 26s)

> Just just no notes

(27m 29s)

> But Yeah, anyways

(27m 31s) **Codey:**

> Guys, yeah, that's it. That's it. That's that's what it is. So I think

(27m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(27m 36s)

> Yeah, there's a handful of patch notes or bug fixes and whatnot. Um, I

(27m 42s)

> I didn't play the game, so I can't pick out the funny ones

(27m 47s) **Codey:**

> I mean, I like that one. That one's gonna, oh, sorry. The tails of the Shire one. No, so the tails of the Shire folks did, um, they did something cute where they have it so that, um, the, it says things like, oh, your line got tangled. So we fixed something so you could focus on the fish. Um, or, uh, some of the hobbits weren't minding their personal space. And so they would overlap each other.

(27m 47s) **Kevin:**

> But

(28m 14s)

> I like this one, hobbits in turkey, I don't know what that means, we'll no longer see strange code word strings for flavors or for anything else for that matter, okay.

(28m 14s) **Codey:**

> Wednesday. So it's, I mean, they, they need a cute thing.

(28m 17s)

> They, they said cute little things, but yeah, it's just basic, basic bug fix.

(28m 33s)

> I think it just means that people that lived in Turkey that were playing like the country Turkey.

(28m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, okay, realtor, yeah, I don't know if that was a wrap.

(28m 42s) **Codey:**

> No, I think it's like real life Turkey.

(28m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay. I see. Oh, I get it now. Okay. Well, that's fine. Okay. All right. Next up,

(28m 50s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(28m 57s) **Kevin:**

> a more updates to be, I guess, because we got fields of mystery. Uh, sadly, no, um, strange merch drops, but, uh, but we got a road map here. Um, oh my gosh.

(29m 14s)

> How have you done enough villagers and romance? Yeah. Um, what does secret bachelorette mean?

(29m 18s) **Codey:**

> Nope, there can always be more.

(29m 23s) **Kevin:**

> How, what does that mean? That's one of the first bullet points secret bachelorette becomes unlockable. Were they always a bachelorette? Or are they, oh, you go, I don't know. Um, that's interesting. I, yeah. Okay. Um, but anyways, yeah, that's a road map. Um, we're, they've got stuff plan for early 2026.

(29m 44s)

> You know, there's nothing for this year and then stuff for later in the year with their 1.0 update.

(29m 50s)

> And even a post 1.0 update.

(29m 55s)

> But yeah, I mean, they've got the just romance, minds and dungeon stuff for the town, skills pretty much everything, right?

(30m 4s)

> Like they're still on early access with a little bit of everything.

(30m 7s)

> Let's see, you got any noteworthy picks out of this, Cody.

(30m 11s) **Codey:**

> uh the mine's one um I like the nuke they have new bugs so new bugs um apiaries and terrariums i'm always excited about that i'm always interested in like what part of apiaries and terrariums like how much can you modify terrariums there's a lot I mean there could be a whole game about just making a terrarium for your bugs.

(30m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I'm kind of surprised we don't have one. I mean there was what was the one? Oh my gosh The one you he's played I think that the pocket time. I got you one looking one

(30m 49s) **Codey:**

> like pocket, bug boo pocket. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Up, upgrade your terraria because like you have to start out at a, you know, basic thing, but then as you get more experienced, maybe you're given opportunities to do like more.

(30m 51s) **Kevin:**

> What's that called?

(30m 53s)

> That's the one. Yeah, like that link is in that direction, but not full on terrarium

(30m 59s)

> Yeah, you're right. That should be again and that'd be a fun game, I'd be down for that.

(31m 2s)

> collect different bugs and put them in different

(31m 5s)

> environments that be sick yeah

(31m 19s)

> Yeah, oh, I'd be down for that.

(31m 22s)

> Oh, man, and, uh, unlock different bugs and stuff.

(31m 27s)

> Oh, I'd be, uh, I'd love that.

(31m 28s)

> Um, yeah, it feels, it feels a mystery to do that.

(31m 33s)

[laughs]

(31m 33s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(31m 34s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know, you're, you're kind of general with your, your bullet points.

(31m 38s)

> So do that, you're feel listening, do it.

(31m 42s)

> Mary, Mary's in children, what?

(31m 45s)

> Like, I get it.

(31m 46s)

> It's the logical early.

(31m 49s)

> That logical conclusion to marriage, children.

(31m 51s)

> But I, what I don't get is why do games always feel the need to add that, the, the children part.

(31m 58s)

> Do you know nothing wrong with it or whatever?

(31m 59s)

> Just, uh, I don't know, it was misdepressing.

(32m 2s)

> It feels like they're just copying the homework at that point.

(32m 4s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I mean, it's it makes sense that it's always an option, but like personally like I wrote yuck cuz I just like why

(32m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Um, but I don't know.

(32m 8s)

> Yeah.

(32m 10s)

[laughs]

(32m 13s)

> I, I think it's to try to give the relationship part the mechanics more meaning or

(32m 19s)

> or something out of it but there's different ways, better ways.

(32m 20s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but like it could just the meaning can just be that it's

(32m 25s)

> If these people care about each other and they want to be together like you don't have to add a relation like a baby to it get these babies out of here

(32m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Look, I'd rather just see the development be spent on being able to do stuff with your spouse. That'd be fun, how about that?

(32m 39s) **Codey:**

> mm-hmm same big same

(32m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, good. But yeah, I mean, if you answer Mr. Chair, it'd start you like right so well.

(32m 49s)

> all this stuff, they are going to finish the storyline for 1.0. They say, that's the let's probably on the big ones. But let's see, and anything else, like I'm just reading, it's just

(33m 3s) **Codey:**

> Oh yeah, so they also have like the Saturday market.

(33m 7s)

> I really love a good Saturday market.

(33m 9s)

> I worked at one for a while.

(33m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(33m 12s) **Codey:**

> And I think it's just really fun.

(33m 13s)

> It brings the community together.

(33m 15s)

> So I like having like a set like market day.

(33m 19s)

> That was cool.

(33m 22s)

> Oh, they also know, I think you matter exactly,

(33m 24s)

> but they know that there's post up,

(33m 25s)

> there will be post 1.0 updates as well.

(33m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm thinking about Saturday markets now. I can't remember the last time because I know the feel like I know the feeling you're describing a one where it brings community. That's tough. Like we could at least in the, I have been one in the Atlanta area that feels like that. We have like a big

(33m 28s) **Codey:**

> So which is, I mean, good, they're not.

(33m 31s)

> but the end of 1.0.

(33m 34s)

> 1.0 will complete their vision, but they will continue to do stuff after.

(33m 55s)

> Mm-hmm.

(33m 57s) **Kevin:**

> farmers market that people know about because it's big and it's great because you get great deals and you know, it's supporting the farmers locally. But that feels a little more commercial, right? Because it's like they're, it's not just a stand. They're like big lots basically. Um, so yeah, I'm trying to, I can't, I'm not have to look that up. You know what I did a lot as a kid. I did the swap meet like we went to the swap meet a bunch as a kid and that was great. Um, so it's kind of like,

(33m 58s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(34m 18s)

> Oh, so what is that?

(34m 28s) **Kevin:**

> what does Saturday market, but it's like everyone's, it's more like garage sale feely at the same time. It's not stalls. Generally speaking, it's more like, again, a slightly bigger lot, but it's just random stuff. It's, it's basically a bunch of garage sale type things. Um, kind of, kind of like an antique market, but, um, but, uh, just brand up stuff. Yeah.

(34m 29s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. Okay.

(34m 52s)

> Okay, I do we have a few places here that have like

(35m 1s)

> Like it's antique markets, but there you can rent a booth and then you sell your stuff out of your booth

(35m 8s)

> That's kind of like that. I just I feel like I've I always heard about swap meets, but then I never

(35m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, it's just like hitting up a bunch of garage sales. I don't together

(35m 13s) **Codey:**

> Did any and then I just realized I was like, I don't even know really what that means

(35m 22s)

> Yeah, that makes sense

(35m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, which is just fun. I like a good garage sale

(35m 27s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(35m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Not not running one, but going on. Okay. Um, so fields of mystery a sadly. No swap meets or

(35m 35s)

> But it does have Saturday market so good good for you

(35m 40s)

> Okay, so that's all the updates to exist

(35m 43s)

> games or coming updates. Let's get into some new games. All right, this first one. I mean hats off on the title alone

(35m 54s)

> We get frog island

(35m 57s)

> That's a concept. I'm down with just off the bat

(36m 1s) **Codey:**

> Yep, you have my attention.

(36m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and like I like the art style

(36m 7s)

> It's it's not it's ice a isometric a bit very cutesy looking

(36m 12s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(36m 13s) **Kevin:**

> I'm I'm trying to think of how to what to compare it to because it was doing

(36m 16s) **Codey:**

> To me it looks a lot like

(36m 19s)

> Usagishima, so yeah, or necko oxime, but usagishima was like the main one that I

(36m 20s) **Kevin:**

> That's don't yes, that's the one

(36m 26s) **Codey:**

> Immediately I was like did the people who made usagishima make this game cuz it just seems very very similar, but

(36m 33s)

> But it's doing its own thing, too

(36m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay. All right. Let's read the description because I'm just admiring the beauty of the the heart here

(36m 39s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yeah

(36m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Trapped on mysterious island you are greeted by a woman who asked you to take care for frogs while she is away

(36m 46s)

> Very understandable sentiment and it was explored farm cooked fish and befriend magical frogs So you try to find a way to escape the island and figure out why you're even here in the first place

(36m 57s)

> Okay, see you lost me there cuz I

(37m)

> Don't need to understand why I've died or nor need to escape

(37m 5s) **Codey:**

> I have no questions, just, yes, the answers, yes, I'll be here.

(37m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Chef frog it's a orange frog at the chef at I

(37m 10s)

> Emergency frog why would

(37m 16s)

> Yeah, escape with that nope, I don't get that but

(37m 23s)

> But anyways, that's

(37m 25s)

> Wait, what I didn't see the wet frog science arm reading the note

(37m 29s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, so there's a during the in the video

(37m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Oh I see it!

(37m 34s) **Codey:**

> There's like an area where there's like a frog spawn a bunch of the frogs are like chillin and they're you know How like wet floor signs or it's like watch out like danger wet floor like they there's just a frog behind all of or a sign behind all of them It's just a wet frog

(37m 50s)

> Oh my gosh, it's so funny

(37m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(37m 52s)

> Yeah It's pretty good Also, there's a frog like in the middle of like it's on a roof and the roof on fire feels a little bit like this is fine dog

(38m 4s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, it's the- it's the this is fine nugget. I felt the same, me.

(38m 4s) **Kevin:**

> But this is fine frog

(38m 7s)

> This is fine frog

(38m 9s) **Codey:**

> Yup. Like, yep, this is- this is okay.

(38m 13s) **Kevin:**

> So that's March 20th of next year already got a

(38m 20s)

> The developer's literally called dev frog holy moly is getting credible

(38m 24s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yep, I saw that.

(38m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'll put me down for that. Okay

(38m 34s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(38m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Um, all right, let's see next up we have

(38m 38s)

> Oh gosh, okay Project Evertree. Sorry. It's a gosh because I've tried to remember who orange season was I had to go through the roll at X

(38m 46s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, I don't know.

(38m 46s)

> So there's a game called Orange Season that I don't know if we ever covered it or anything,

(38m 51s)

> but...

(38m 51s) **Kevin:**

> We talk about the news. I do remember the name coming up, but no, I don't think we actually covered the game itself

(38m 56s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so, but like they, the people that made Orange Season,

(39m 1s)

> okay, I'm just gonna read this.

(39m 2s)

> Orange Season was a passion project,

(39m 4s)

> put with a lot of challenges,

(39m 5s)

> and we tackled them as best we can.

(39m 7s)

> We learned a lot along the way,

(39m 8s)

> but ultimately some things were out of our control.

(39m 10s)

> That's why we brought another team to help with the development of Orange Season while we work on our next game,

(39m 14s)

> we trust that they will bring our vision

(39m 16s)

> into life. Patches will start to roll out next month for all platforms. We are building this new project from all the lessons we learned from orange season and your feedback. So to me, so to me, this is like a game that they haven't even like they're gonna start it, but they haven't started it yet, but they're letting you know that like orange season patches are still coming. We're still, they're still working on orange season, but they've more or less moved the development to us another team.

(39m 41s) **Kevin:**

> mmm yeah which hmm I get it and obviously we don't know the circumstances on you know their side but that's that's not a great look I mean it's probably rough for them too but um yup gotta gotta cut and run feels like right and they're not abandoning it but like they're just saying out right there they're switching years kind of.

(39m 53s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, to have to like, put your move your baby over.

(40m 3s)

> Yep.

(40m 11s) **Kevin:**

> There's still working on it. But the actual project ever tree is a quote cozy single player farm management game that followed the journey of Alessandra competing to be the best farmer in the summer camp manager farm alongside your companions complete chores for points and deal with the dynamics of a colorful cast in their teenage years.

(40m 36s)

> Um, I'm sorry. I'm just checking. There was no video or anything, right? It's just

(40m 40s) **Codey:**

> Nope, there's no video there's not that there's literally just the image

(40m 41s) **Kevin:**

> this one. Image of a big tree with purple leaves and Project Ever tree will go over it. Um, I get them. Anything. No, I wish them luck, I guess.

(40m 51s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yep, so it's just a we're they're gonna be doing it

(40m 59s)

> Gonna happen, but as it stands currently, there's not it doesn't look like there's

(41m 11s) **Kevin:**

> That could be fun. Um, but, uh, summer camp setting could be a fun idea. It depends if you have colorful casts. How colorful. That could be entertaining. Um, yeah. Um, all right. Yeah,

(41m 27s)

> it's hard to say there's, there's nothing. We got nothing to go off really other than the text. Um, but all right, there you go. So no, no, anything is to win or anything. So just keep an eye out. Good name, though, Project Ever.

(41m 30s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, yep.

(41m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. All right, that's that's that's it. That's the news we did it. We've increased the news for now.

(41m 48s) **Codey:**

> Wooooo!

(41m 50s) **Kevin:**

> So let's get into a linked banner of the spark. The game I bought on basically unreleased.

(41m 59s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(42m 1s)

> - Was it worth it?

(42m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, mmm. I am unsure.

(42m 5s) **Codey:**

> - Just a yes or no.

(42m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so all right, all right, let's let's let's start with the premise, right? Um,

(42m 16s)

> over here, I'll read the quote, uh, build the bright new world alongside a band of rescued robot buddies in this colorful action RPG about a ways of enemies and solar co-op then return home and use their parts to craft a thriving town assemble your crew and grow stronger with each new adventure.

(42m 33s)

> So this goes in the what we, uh, I'll coin to the rogue life. John,

(42m 40s) **Codey:**

> Well, they also, they say that they're rogue life as well.

(42m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, is that them? Oh, never mind. Okay, they coined it then, I think.

(42m 43s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, they say it like on their thing.

(42m 46s)

> Yeah, so they, they call themselves rogue life.

(42m 49s)

> Um, and then they also, uh, I saw this like, um, like,

(42m 57s)

> looking back at some of their previous posts, I saw this one that was like,

(43m 1s)

> Hades meets Animal Crossing.

(43m 3s)

> Maybe this was on the, maybe this was on the discussion, like the forum.

(43m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm

(43m 7s) **Codey:**

> Um, so yeah, I just do, yeah.

(43m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(43m 10s) **Codey:**

> The professor does it seem like Hades meets Animal Crossing to you.

(43m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Absolutely, um, yes, okay. Have you played either hate well you played him or something you played Hades?

(43m 14s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(43m 18s)

> Play Animal Crossing, no, no, I'm not played Hades.

(43m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, have you played cult of lion?

(43m 22s) **Codey:**

> No, I want to.

(43m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. All right. Well, uh, okay

(43m 26s)

> Okay, cult of lamb

(43m 27s) **Codey:**

> I know, I'm no help.

(43m 29s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, no, no, I'm frustrated because what I'm about to say

(43m 32s)

> I was really

(43m 34s)

> intrigued by this not intrigued like I was excited. I saw it the art style look cool the premise was good That's why I bought it on release

(43m 41s)

> Call to the lamb is the direct

(43m 44s)

> Comparison point because it's the same idea of half a game is broke like combat heavy and then half of it is developing a little settlement

(43m 54s)

> And here's here's the part that pains me like I bought the game I put in and it's not terribly expensive. I think it's just 20 USD. Yeah, thanks

(44m 4s)

> I put in many hours. I don't have an hour count, but at least two or three weeks of playing on the regular. But overall, like I put it down. I put it down. I'm not, you know, sometimes you put a game down because you get distracted or other stuff comes up. This one I put down just, I lost interest.

(44m 25s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(44m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Like, it doesn't happen often to me. Like, hopefully, I guess I did put it down technically. I didn't.

(44m 28s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(44m 34s) **Kevin:**

> I didn't beat it, but it wasn't out of lack of interest. I just got sidetracked or whatever. Anyway, the point I'm trying to get to is like call to the lamb just is just better in almost every category, which is, is rough. So let's, let's, let's get to it the brass tracks. There's two ways that the animal crossing park on the Haiti sport.

(44m 59s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(45m) **Kevin:**

> Let's start with the animal crossing part and the more cottage core e-part

(45m 4s)

> So visually, like the game works well for that because it's bright, it's colorful.

(45m 11s)

> I do like the art style, generally speaking, it's a little generic, like generic anime-y like Pokémon shown in e-style. The colors are bright and whatnot, but there's no environment or anything that really sticks out. There's some settings that feel like

(45m 34s)

> again, where the setting is robots have taken over the world and there's just a few humans,

(45m 40s)

> so a lot of it is, you know, robots and machines scattered about, but you're trying to reclaim the world and reclaim nature a bit so there's a lot of heavily-forested areas too.

(45m 51s)

> And so you're kind of blending it, so it's not bad, it's nice enough, but it just doesn't stick out like cult of the lamb or Hades. So that's...

(46m 4s)

> A little unfortunate, the music, nothing to write home about, it's pretty much the same thing, like no track sticks in my mind, but it's good enough for playing.

(46m 12s) **Codey:**

> Okay. Yep.

(46m 14s) **Kevin:**

> The building the town part, I'm going to hop to that because that's the animal crossing part.

(46m 23s)

> It's just fall short, this is the problem of the game, like the bar is higher, it helps everything it does,

(46m 32s)

> because it's a great

(46m 34s)

> good-based system, and you're just plotting decorations down, I think part of it is there's not enough customization options in the game. There's a few, but not enough to feel like animal crossing. And the unfortunate part is it's largely, it's largely or just ornamental.

(46m 59s)

> So call to the lamb when you build up your settlement, when you build up your settlement.

(47m 4s)

> and take care of your cult members or whatever, it actually benefits you in the combat part.

(47m 16s)

> It expands your abilities and your... just general upgrades and stuff like that.

(47m 23s)

> Call to the lamb does that very well of the cycle of going into combat for stuff to bring back your village, to increase stuff in the village, to go out into combat,

(47m 34s)

> or linked does not do that.

(47m 38s)

> Like you build up your town, kind of animal crossing style, and it's nice enough, but it's just... it's kind of its own reward,

(47m 47s)

> so how much you get out of that subjective, which is kind of unfortunate because for me, I just wasn't really feeling it.

(47m 55s)

> It was a little okay, but I think part of the challenge too is getting the enough resources to craft or build whatever you need.

(48m 4s)

> going to build a path you need a lot of a certain type of resource and and sometimes I can get a little tedious because it's either you're just killing a bunch of random enemies out in the field or you're shaking trees and and mining rocks which is just basic basically hit the button sort of stuff so yeah the the town part of it is a little a little lack lustrous

(48m 34s)

> I think the best part is the actual growing of the village villagers I should say because

(48m 44s)

> you there is a like animal crossing there is a set of facilities with npc's that run them and those are you know required are always there you have a black smith you have a chef you have a

(48m 58s)

> general store person and so on and so forth right and they're all robots

(49m 4s)

> but you also get villager robots who and I think you can get up to 10 in your village at one time but you can unlock up to 40 of them and so you can kind of swap them out it is fun to see the villagers kind of running around and doing stuff not not like anything super interactive or memorable but it's just when you fill it up the town it does feel a lot more lively with all these

(49m 33s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(49m 34s) **Kevin:**

> around um

(49m 35s) **Codey:**

> When I think like looking at the like it's you're basically it's just robots, right like yeah, so

(49m 44s)

> It's nice to yeah, add in the other member of something else

(49m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean

(49m 53s)

> That's definitely part of this game like it's clear. It's for robot people, right? Like which is what was a big draw for me?

(49m 59s)

> I like robots and and

(50m 2s)

> like Metabots and and stuff like that like the thought of collectible robot game that that sounded really cool to me

(50m 11s)

> And it again, it is nice, but it's

(50m 14s)

> Largely ornamental the designs are okay nothing like super sticks out to me

(50m 20s)

> But again, it's it's it's good enough

(50m 25s)

> the Let me think the

(50m 30s)

> One thing you oh, oh, yeah, okay, so I'm gonna kind of start sliding into the comments stuff But the progression is it's all quest based basically you talk to certain villagers You talk to the the facilities

(50m 44s)

> managers and they give you quests Clear X, you know, clear this level.

(50m 50s)

> Achieve this objective beat X number of enemies. It can vary and I think again, that's might be part of the TDM because it's just it's very, very quest like linear sort of thing.

(51m 5s)

> There's not a lot of flavor to it, right? The writings, okay, there's the personalities don't stick out like say animal crossing, right?

(51m 17s)

> All those shop keeps very clear.

(51m 20s)

> memorable personalities. Nothing like that. They try. I'll give them the sticker for an effort,

(51m 29s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(51m 29s) **Kevin:**

> but an attempt was indeed made, but it's just not hitting like Animal Crossing was. But that said, oh, you know what? Oh, I'm back. I'm back here one second. Fishing, let me talk about fishing real quick.

(51m 30s) **Codey:**

> - And attempt was made.

(51m 47s)

> mm-hmm. Oh, okay.

(51m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Because that's part of village life too. There is fishing in the game. I'm torn on the fishing minigame in this game. I like it more than stardoos, but it's challenging almost.

(52m 5s)

> Because what it is is basically it's a spinner and there's a colored part of the spinner and you have to hit the colored part. And you have to do that a few times to fill up the gauge and when the gauge fills up you catch the fish.

(52m 20s)

> But for some of the rare fish, that's hard and if you mess up, if you hit the spinner in an incorrect part, the gauge goes down sometimes a good amount.

(52m 31s)

> So it can be frustrating to kind of learn the timing properly.

(52m 37s)

> But that said, they do do some cool stuff. First of all, the fish are also all robotic.

(52m 43s)

> So that's fun. And you don't have a fishing rod.

(52m 48s)

> Oh, I haven't even talked about it.

(52m 50s)

> It's called the wire, it's a grappling hook, basically attached to your arm.

(52m 55s)

> What happens is fish will jump out of the water, and you have to hook them with your arm,

(53m)

> which is fun.

(53m 2s)

> And if you do the timing just so like at the height of their jump, you actually get like a bonus and like half the gauges feel or something like that when you're fishing.

(53m 12s)

> So that is a little fun.

(53m 14s)

> It's at least different.

(53m 15s)

> I'll say that.

(53m 16s)

> It's a little more dynamic.

(53m 17s)

> It's not, same old table we've seen in another game.

(53m 20s)

> So I gave them a thumbs up for the fishing that they're trying to do.

(53m 26s)

> But they also have, they don't have bugs, but they have these, what are they called,

(53m 32s)

> bitty-bots, like tiny little robots hiding around in trees and rocks and stuff like that.

(53m 33s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(53m 38s) **Kevin:**

> They don't look like bugs, sadly.

(53m 39s)

> They're just little robots with different designs.

(53m 41s)

> There's one that looks like a star, one that looks like, I think, a teardrop, something like that.

(53m 46s)

> a handful of designs. So that's kind of replacing by

(53m 50s)

> bugs and there's just another whole group of things to catch. And those are definitely the two most active part of town, kind of like animal crossing, but just not as engaging. There's no museum, sadly. You know, you have an encyclopedia page or whatever. I don't think that even has info, just like the collection page. But they try to at least make it their

(54m 20s)

> wop flavor. Um, yeah.

(54m 21s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but without like the incentive of like filling something and I think that's probably part of the fact that there's no other like real villagers or anything that's basically just you I mean that to me is just seems really lonely to like do this all by yourself, but I mean that's probably what it it's meant to convey so.

(54m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess so because like, I mean, you can't there's dialogue with the villagers and whatnot, but it's it's just not as fulfilling. They don't feel as alive as an animal crossing a villager.

(55m 2s)

> I will give them one thumbs up for one specific, very specific thing to you can do. You can grapple a villager and throw them into the river.

(55m 11s)

> They'll just respawn, but it's just a really funny animation and they incentivize you because every now and then you'll get a request from a villager to throw them in the water or throw other people in the water.

(55m 12s) **Codey:**

> What happens when you do that?

(55m 16s)

> Okay.

(55m 25s)

> What?

(55m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know why they just and usually and sometimes they'll just don't just don't question it. Just do it. Yeah, yeah.

(55m 35s) **Codey:**

> Just do it.

(55m 37s)

> They're just trying to see if you'll do it.

(55m 41s) **Kevin:**

> So yeah, let me talk about the facilities real quick because they're they're the closest like connective tissue to the to the combat portion, which I'll get to in a minute, but let's see, okay, there's a blacksmith's pretty straightforward. It's your weapon of grades or crafting and each facility manager has their own line of quests.

(56m 7s)

> So if you do stuff for the blacksmith you of course unlock new weapon types or

(56m 11s) **Codey:**

> mm-hmm I think I solved 80 weapon types is that okay got it that would make sense

(56m 11s) **Kevin:**

> different upgrades to other weapons and so on and so forth.

(56m 20s)

> I think there's like ten base weapon types and probably variations of thereof that's probably what they're saying yeah and I think you know what I this is probably one of the biggest criticism of the game actually the progression system kind of shoots itself in the foot because the blacksmith is a a very good example.

(56m 41s)

> So in Hades, for instance, you can access all the weapon types pretty quickly relative to how long you're playing the game until you hit true credits or whatever.

(56m 50s) **Codey:**

> Mm hmm.

(56m 55s) **Kevin:**

> So you get the chance to explore different weapons and figure them out.

(57m)

> In this game, because of the progression system where you have to do all the quests for the Blacksmith, you don't reach the final weapon type until his, I think,

(57m 11s)

> can ultimate weapon or his quest or whatever.

(57m 16s)

> So it feels like you're playing a lot of the game with a lot of options still kind of locked out.

(57m 23s)

> And you can, you know, kind of focus on the Blacksmith and Beeline it or whatever, but it still feels like you're missing out because you know,

(57m 32s)

> I think most people would be trying to do other quests and other stuff at the same time.

(57m 39s)

> And the weapon,

(57m 41s)

> let's talk more about the weapons in the combat, but it's just this kind of general idea of there's a lot of good features and upgrades that are locked behind this quest system because it's so linear it can take a while to get to.

(57m 55s)

> Okay, if anyone plays linked, do the chef quest lines first because he unlocks something probably the best feature of the game.

(58m 4s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(58m 4s) **Kevin:**

> And that is you can take your villagers out on combat with you.

(58m 9s)

> You can take up to two.

(58m 11s)

> First, you get one, but then you'll lock a second slot later and that's all from doing the quest lines or the chef quest lines excuse me.

(58m 21s)

> And that's not only very fun to have your villagers join you because they have different attacks and different combat cells, but it's also really, really helpful.

(58m 33s)

> So that that and again that's lock bind quest line and you don't really see it until you get there.

(58m 42s)

> Again, just critical upgrades that feel like block behind these quest lines and I wish you could access them faster.

(58m 50s)

> Let me think the other facilities they're not as critical to combat a lot of it is for the town upgrading you you get a craftsman guy who teaches you how to build different like fencing and decorations, benches, fences.

(59m 5s)

> Oh my goodness. There's this thing. I don't know if to call it a bug or whatever, but I'm building if when you go and I build a fence and I put you know the gate to enter the fence or whatever.

(59m 8s) **Codey:**

> Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm.

(59m 15s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know if it's been fixed yet, but I can't there's a gap there's always this gap between a fence post and the gate and it kills me.

(59m 22s)

> It kills me because you can walk through it even.

(59m 25s)

> So I can't have a complete fence and oh it's it's all I hate it so much.

(59m 32s) **Codey:**

> That, that would bother me.

(59m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's really bad. I was building my house and I'm putting a fence around it and then I don't get it.

(59m 42s)

> There is a greenhouse like plant crop specialist person.

(59m 47s)

> She's a researcher, I believe it is.

(59m 49s)

> And she, you can grow crops and fruit trees.

(59m 54s)

> There's not active, it's just you plant and you wait a while and they grow and you harvest them.

(1h 1s)

> So partially ornamental, but partially you get resources to cook food or whatever.

(1h 9s)

> Um, and, uh, yeah.

(1h 12s)

> You see, you get the, oh, character customization because there is a stylist.

(1h 15s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I see that there's a lot of that, so I was wondering about that.

(1h 16s) **Kevin:**

> Um, so you get different outfits.

(1h 21s)

> Um, you can buy different outfits from the stylist and the general shop or whatever.

(1h 26s)

> And then you can get dyes.

(1h 27s)

> Um, you get dyes from different resources from different crops and things like that.

(1h 33s)

> Um, and so then, you know, you get this wider range of outfits.

(1h 37s)

> they're just sets you don't unfortunately don't get to customize each like

(1h 42s)

> mix and match it's just a pick and outfit and then you can color it whatever color dye you want

(1h 47s)

> Which is fun. I think the outfits look nice and having a company color variations is fun

(1h 53s)

> but You do oh you can actually customize the character

(1h 58s)

> Like the the face and the body and the hair and all that stuff

(1h 1m 2s)

> But the camera is usually so zoomed out like it doesn't feel like it makes much of a difference like it's hard to see your character

(1h 1m 12s)

> moments where like at the start or end of a run and combat you'll it'll zoom in a bit more you can see it a bit more

(1h 1m 19s)

> but It feels like a little ways of potential that

(1h 1m 23s)

> Maybe this game would be better from a do better or feel better from a closer camera

(1h 1m 29s)

> Because it's very zoomed out so you can see the whole town

(1h 1m 32s)

> Which is fun because you see all the robots running around

(1h 1m 35s)

> But you can't zoom into yourself So it just feels like you're not seeing your character And I don't call them bad it's the same thing, it's a fairly zoomed out camera. So yeah, the character customizations there just feels like it's it's not landing because just don't get to enjoy it really. Okay, so with that, okay, I think that roughly covers the town and customizations. So let's talk about the combat. The combat is hard. You

(1h 2m 8s) **Codey:**

> Okay, you're using your wire still, okay.

(1h 2m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's probably the best thing. So yeah, it's two things. One, it's hard and it's kind of awkward. I say that because compared to other roguelike games, like Hades or cult of the lamb, it's a much slower pace of battle or the overall feel. Like in Hades and cult of lamb,

(1h 2m 26s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 2m 29s)

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 2m 34s) **Kevin:**

> you get a dash, a proper dash, you go from you know, one place to the other in a snap.

(1h 2m 39s)

> And this will game you get a role, which is...

(1h 2m 42s)

> maybe it's a taste thing, but I certainly don't enjoy it as much as the other games.

(1h 2m 59s)

> But they make up for that because you get the wire, the grappling hook, and you can use that on enemies.

(1h 3m 5s)

> It's the timing is a little weird to get used to, but you can drag them into you.

(1h 3m 12s)

> Or you can even do this thing where if you have enough damage on an enemy, you can just grab them and just auto kill them, you just pull them apart, which is fun.

(1h 3m 23s)

> So, like, that wire thing, they're heading in the right direction, just needs a little more polish.

(1h 3m 29s)

> And it also depends on the weapons you're using, because like I mentioned, there's, I think, like 10 different weapon types.

(1h 3m 37s)

> And they do play wildly differently.

(1h 3m 40s)

> Some feel a lot more better.

(1h 3m 42s)

> They're suited to using the grappling hook than others.

(1h 3m 46s)

> Like the X is there's an X that is a big slow X.

(1h 3m 52s)

> And that one doesn't work as well with the wire because the wire is in a quick motion and then trying to fall over the big slow swing doesn't feel that successful most of the time.

(1h 4m 2s)

> But say like your standard sword, sure you can pull them in and slice them up.

(1h 4m 5s)

> That works fairly fine.

(1h 4m 10s)

> There's not...

(1h 4m 13s)

> Some of the weapon types are...

(1h 4m 16s)

> I'll give them a golf clap for trying something different.

(1h 4m 20s)

> There is a guitar as a weapon type,

(1h 4m 20s) **Codey:**

> Okay. Okay.

(1h 4m 24s) **Kevin:**

> and you can swing it around like an act kind of,

(1h 4m 28s)

> or you can do a charge attack, and then you do the slide.

(1h 4m 32s)

> You know the guitar slide, and you're damaging enemies that way.

(1h 4m 36s)

> When I think it releases the sound waves then, which is a fun one.

(1h 4m 40s)

> Um, yeah.

(1h 4m 40s) **Codey:**

> That's something different, that's interesting.

(1h 4m 42s) **Kevin:**

> is different. They have, oh gosh, they have a chakra, I think it is called like a ring bladed ring that you throw around. That one's a fun one. I'm trying to remember what other ones are. There is a blaster gun like it's just a straight up gun. It's probably the best weapon in the game because one you do it from afar so you're very safe. But you I can also charge it up and just just

(1h 5m 12s)

> kill a lot of stuff just with the charge shots but yeah let's see there's claws that's a good one I'm trying to oh the board I forgot there's a surfboard that is a weapon too again you can kind of swing it around like you would with the board or if you do the charge attack you hop on it and you fly around on it just running everything over that's that's another fun

(1h 5m 29s) **Codey:**

> Oh.

(1h 5m 42s) **Kevin:**

> that one felt pretty creative and I think probably one of my favorite weapon types but yeah they have a bunch of standard stuff spear cannon so on and so forth so you know they do play differently but it's still it's a lax little and I think the biggest problem is the upgrade system so roguelike games how the pattern works you start or run you you get a floor you

(1h 6m 12s)

> the floor and then you get an upgrade at the end for your run the upgrades are not great they're they're pretty man the best you get like an attribute like electric or fire or ice or whatever even freeze or burn you know status effects but nothing is fundamentally changing your weapon playing your place out or anything call the lamb and Hades do that and they're very good at that where they can fund it.

(1h 6m 42s)

> It's just incremental percentage increases.

(1h 6m 47s)

> At the bare minimum, you feel very strong.

(1h 6m 52s)

> If you go far in a run, you get a lot of upgrades.

(1h 6m 55s)

> In Hades or Kuralami, you feel crazy strongly.

(1h 6m 58s)

> You're just clearing stuff if things are going well.

(1h 7m 1s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 7m 1s) **Kevin:**

> This game, not the case.

(1h 7m 3s)

> You can stack up as many upgrades and it's just incremental percentage increases.

(1h 7m 4s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 7m 9s) **Kevin:**

> increases, um, you, you don't.

(1h 7m 12s)

> You don't ever get the feeling of, like, power that, that feels so cool in Hades or cult of the blam. Um, and so that, and that's, and that's coupled by the, the difficulty because, you know, the enemies do a lot of damage, actually. Um, it, it's very easy to die and lose, you know, your run and you have to start all over, which is frustrating when the upgrade to so poor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But this is again, why the villagers are probably the best feature in the game when you add them in because then you have two villagers who are decoys. Um, they're also damaging. And if you fall,

(1h 7m 34s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm well, that's that's the rogue part of the

(1h 7m 54s) **Kevin:**

> they can resurrect you. Um, so yeah, that having the villagers fight with you, that's a good one. I wish I could upgrade them a bit more. There is a small upgrade system, but it's,

(1h 8m 4s)

> it's just, I think numerical of anything. Um, I wish I could maybe customize them or something,

(1h 8m 9s)

> to sadly, no, they're just they're

(1h 8m 12s)

> excellent decoy slash assists. But yeah, that's I think that roughly covers the combat. It's like it's it's good. It's not bad combat for the most part. But again, the bar is just very high and it's not not living up to it. Yeah, so that's I'm trying to think here for like

(1h 8m 16s) **Codey:**

> Just got to put them out in the front lines for the fodder.

(1h 8m 42s) **Kevin:**

> there's another element. I want to talk about it, but I nope, I lost it. But yeah, I think that roughly covers the game that they'll experience as a whole. Do you have any questions on all that? I know that was a lot kind of

(1h 8m 46s) **Codey:**

> - Okay.

(1h 8m 57s) **Kevin:**

> just word vomiting here. But um,

(1h 9m) **Codey:**

> No, I think I was mostly interested, like this game looks like it's a lot.

(1h 9m 5s)

> Um, like it's a lot, it's got a lot going on, but it also still has like that bit of loneliness to it. And I was wondering if that was like affected by the little bots at all.

(1h 9m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 9m 17s)

> Yeah

(1h 9m 17s) **Codey:**

> Which it sounds like it kind of is, but like not 100% you can play, this is just for the listeners,

(1h 9m 23s)

> you can play multiplayer. So you can have your friends come in and like help. So you can do that.

(1h 9m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yeah, you know what, actually that's a good point as some they did want to bring up.

(1h 9m 30s) **Codey:**

> That's cool.

(1h 9m 34s) **Kevin:**

> I think if the game is built for multiplayer, I haven't played with anyone, but like just based off the villagers, I bet it's a lot more fun to grab, you know, a couple of friends and play with them. Um, it feels like it's, it's geared towards that. If anyone wants to play, let me know.

(1h 9m 48s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, so

(1h 9m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, oh, now I remember the other thing I wanted to talk about. Yes, the

(1h 9m 54s) **Codey:**

> Yay

(1h 9m 56s) **Kevin:**

> So I played I got this on my switch. It's on switch. It's switch to I think on steam. I think the early access was on steam and in one point no drop with switch.

(1h 10m 10s)

> It does not run well on on switch loading times are brutal.

(1h 10m 13s) **Codey:**

> Oh.

(1h 10m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Frame rate isn't the best. It's it's not great. I'm sure it's a lot better on switch too.

(1h 10m 22s)

> I'm sure it can be a lot better on Steve.

(1h 10m 25s)

> It's standard switch version, little technically rough, which is a shame considering everything.

(1h 10m 33s)

> The loading times are the ones that kill me because when you lose the run and yet the weight and other, you know, 30 seconds or whatever to get back into town, it's not great.

(1h 10m 41s)

> Not great.

(1h 10m 43s) **Codey:**

> So I guess the another thing I wanted to ask is so it sounds like this game fell a little far front like a little far from the mark like it it could have what one thing do you think would improve this game to like make it so that you would pick it up more.

(1h 11m) **Kevin:**

> I think the upgrade stuff I talked about fixing the upgrades making them either more or just more impactful generally speaking right because whether that's increasing like the actual power where you can actually feel it or changing the playstyle of your weapon um I think that would fix it because like even if the the town stuff it was still a little weak per se I think if the combat was fun.

(1h 11m 30s)

> I think the upgrade system is probably the most love for me to get out of it.

(1h 11m 50s)

> Or you know, I'll offer you one on the other side on the downside.

(1h 11m 55s)

> If we got an actual museum to fill out, like I think that would be a lot more enticing to

(1h 12m)

> to go through stuff, but yeah, sadly, there is no, like the growth of the town is largely up to you.

(1h 12m 9s)

> How much you want to fill out on craft or whatever, but no actual go-post from a museum.

(1h 12m 15s)

> I think that would help a lot.

(1h 12m 17s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I think that that would be the other thing because it is such a lonely game and you don't have those characters like

(1h 12m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 12m 18s)

> Yeah.

(1h 12m 19s)

> Yeah.

(1h 12m 23s) **Codey:**

> Asking for you to do things kind of is just self-motivated, but I feel like there's there are definitely people who are the self-motivated type who want to collect everything who want to like

(1h 12m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, I, I guess if you look at the art, right? If you see that you see it's going to be robot heavy, like if, and it's rogue life, rogue like, I guess that's the more important part of the combat aspect, like it then ties to you. It's worth a shot. Like,

(1h 12m 33s) **Codey:**

> Do everything that you can so maybe so I guess like my last question would be who would you recommend this game for?

(1h 12m 58s) **Kevin:**

> It's not a terribly expensive game. It's only 20 USD.

(1h 13m 1s)

> They're actively working on it, so there still might be a future for this game.

(1h 13m 9s)

> But I may be a little more time in the oven, and it'll be a definite thumbs up.

(1h 13m 16s)

> But for now, it's just, I guess, mostly for a robot collector type person, a very specific or niche thing.

(1h 13m 24s)

> But that's what suckered me like. Oh man, I could call it robots for my town.

(1h 13m 28s)

> that part still on paper sounds cool and it kind of is to see the grown to town and run around but it's just so much of the stuff I have to get through like it's unfortunate it feels a little tedious at times like yeah yeah because yeah like the villagers they'll give you quite a solid time but they're from a handful of things either collect some fish collect some bugs maybe do a certain run and so on and so forth like it's just again not a lot of

(1h 14m 2s)

> which is unfortunate oh I know what stopped me in this game I just remember there was a thing that stopped me I got a mission I can't remember if it was from villager or whatnot but it was to do a run without a single no not getting hit or like what's it yeah yeah not getting hit I know hit run and that was brutal I couldn't do it that's what killed it for me um take yeah take that one I don't like that there are no

(1h 14m 31s)

> it runs hard um like maybe for post game or something but that's hard that's for the soaks on people

(1h 14m 32s) **Codey:**

> Yeah Yeah, I mean they do it like my husband is playing still playing right now and he was talking about like sometimes he'll tell me about some of the stuff he's struggling with and I'm like babe I think that the people would just tell you that uh get good like I think that that's as hornet as hornet

(1h 14m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, as, excuse me, as Hornet would say, "Get good!"

(1h 15m 2s) **Codey:**

> would say like you just need to get good

(1h 15m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 15m 6s)

> So, like, I, I, I look, I'll, of course there's all the memes in the fan art out on the internet, and everyone's about the saha, or whatever, but, um, but now the get good, that's the one, people aren't harping on that one enough, I love it.

(1h 15m 20s) **Codey:**

> because that's I mean that's the thing about that game is it's just like there's so much about it that's just you just gotta you just have to do with it.

(1h 15m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I'm terrified of that game I have I have to I have to be hall and I that's a requirement from what I've read be not even lore wise just get to whoa that's the warm up for so

(1h 15m 41s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(1h 15m 47s)

> - Yeah, it definitely, I mean, if you basically,

(1h 15m 51s)

> I feel like if you don't like Hollow Knight,

(1h 15m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, because what if it's hauling a barter?

(1h 16m 2s) **Codey:**

> It is. That's the tweet. Yeah.

(1h 16m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah Yeah, yeah, I think cherry like I love them and I hate them. They're sickos

(1h 16m 16s) **Codey:**

> Cool. Well, I think, I think that about wraps up our discussion of linked banner of the spark.

(1h 16m 23s)

> So I see this thing in the outro. Al, I don't know what this means. Okay. Okay.

(1h 16m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 16m 30s)

> Okay, I'll tell you I'll explain to you because it threw me off when I saw it

(1h 16m 34s)

> He's look he's just changed it because not everyone wants to plug something right we don't have to tell them the handle It's just here's your moment to do something like

(1h 16m 44s)

> I'm okay

(1h 16m 46s)

> Here, I'll take the lead because you know what's funny. I realized the other day. I have two

(1h 16m 51s)

> Unfortunately, it's still on Twitter because there's people I talked to there. I have two Twitter handles

(1h 16m 54s) **Codey:**

> mm-hmm. You okay? Uh-huh.

(1h 16m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Acupa press my personal and at spider squared my art account

(1h 17m 1s)

> Well, somehow I've it's become inverted where Acupa. I'm just seeing and just retweeting awesome Pokemon and Digimon fan artists and

(1h 17m 8s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(1h 17m 10s) **Kevin:**

> And sick art memes and soaksong and stuff like that

(1h 17m 15s)

> And then somehow and the spider squared. That's why I see more personal stuff or opinions and whatnot that I retweet

(1h 17m 21s) **Codey:**

[coughing]

(1h 17m 22s) **Kevin:**

> So, go to one of those for one of the other.

(1h 17m 24s)

> I don't know which one's which.

(1h 17m 26s)

> any more, but at least a there's a lot of good artists still on Twitter.

(1h 17m 30s)

> I'll say that as for the the hellscape it is and everything else.

(1h 17m 33s)

> There's a lot of great talent on there.

(1h 17m 36s)

> What about you, Cody?

(1h 17m 39s)

> Anything you want to plug or say?

(1h 17m 41s) **Codey:**

> So, uh, yeah, I mean, if you want to tap me,

(1h 17m 46s)

> if you can find me on Instagram at hiking beagle, beagle,

(1h 17m 48s)

> and/or on the podcasts, um, hate, uh, slack.

(1h 17m 53s)

> But I'm trying to think of like a fun,

(1h 17m 56s)

> something fun to say.

(1h 17m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I mean, I think we've already said it.

(1h 18m 1s)

> Get good!

(1h 18m 1s) **Codey:**

> Oh, oh, oh, okay, good.

(1h 18m 3s)

> No, no, okay, so here's something that's fun.

(1h 18m 5s)

> Um, anything to say to the audience,

(1h 18m 7s)

> I want to, I probably could have done this in the beginning,

(1h 18m 11s)

> um, I found a really cool bug.

(1h 18m 14s)

> So in my, no, no, no, in real life.

(1h 18m 15s) **Kevin:**

> - His name's Tornit.

(1h 18m 19s)

> Is it Hornit?

(1h 18m 20s) **Codey:**

> No, it's not.

(1h 18m 21s)

> Um, so it's a, there's this, um, family of wasps called crescited wasps or, um, jewel wasps.

(1h 18m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Oh. Oh.

(1h 18m 29s) **Codey:**

> And they're the, they look like little jewels,

(1h 18m 32s)

> and they're butts, look like little crowns.

(1h 18m 34s)

> 10 out of 10 recommend looking at, yeah, look at them.

(1h 18m 35s) **Kevin:**

> - What?

(1h 18m 37s)

> - I'm looking it up.

(1h 18m 38s) **Codey:**

> I'll put some in the slack.

(1h 18m 39s)

> Um, and.

(1h 18m 41s)

> But they're so that there's like the main sub family that looks like all of those, but there's this other sub family that doesn't have the same vibe as the others in the family, and I've never seen one of these, but I was going through my like tricky ID things that I've been putting off forever because I didn't want to do them.

(1h 18m 59s)

> Um, and I found one of these and then I looked it up. I was like, Oh, it's this and then I looked it up. This thing has not been seen in the United States East of Kansas.

(1h 19m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 19m 12s) **Codey:**

> So I have like a regional record. It has gone. So it is up in like, it is up in like K back. Um, and like Montreal and stuff like that, but it's not. It hasn't like jumped. No one's found it like over the lakes yet. Um, so I'm super excited about that. That's what I that's what I'm going to say to the audience.

(1h 19m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Wow That's wild

(1h 19m 28s)

> Yeah

(1h 19m 30s)

> That's that's cool. That's pretty cool, but all like

(1h 19m 35s)

> But also like what I love bugs but was that why why why?

(1h 19m 41s) **Codey:**

> Okay, here's the other thing.

(1h 19m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Those are the one like oh no, stay

(1h 19m 44s) **Codey:**

> The wasps that everyone thinks of.

(1h 19m 46s)

> Like when you think of wasps,

(1h 19m 47s)

> you think of like yellow jackets and hornets that are gonna like sting you, right?

(1h 19m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yes.

(1h 19m 50s) **Codey:**

> That is one family of wasps,

(1h 19m 54s)

> but there are so many other wasps.

(1h 19m 56s)

> And even those wasps are actually really hecking cool.

(1h 20m)

> It's just that they tend to put their nests in places that are inconvenient to us.

(1h 20m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, like my truck, yes, many times in the truck, I had to fight him off.

(1h 20m 5s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(1h 20m 11s)

> So I'm all for, I'm all for like if you,

(1h 20m 16s)

> if you have this like these in an inconvenient place,

(1h 20m 21s)

> remove them.

(1h 20m 22s)

> But if you, if they're like at the end of your yard and you never go over there, just let them live,

(1h 20m 28s)

> like they actually are really good at,

(1h 20m 30s)

> like yellow jackets and hornets eat your garden pests.

(1h 20m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I know that I appreciate them, but these jewel bugs are wasp that there's some that are iridescent.

(1h 20m 37s) **Codey:**

> but there's a bunch of other super, super cool bugs.

(1h 20m 41s)

> I mean, they look like little jewels and they're so cute.

(1h 20m 50s) **Kevin:**

> That that looks painted. I'm looking at one

(1h 20m 53s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, and looking at one other microscope is just so pretty and they they have a lot of like little divots in their.

(1h 21m 1s)

> I'm trying to think of the in their skin. I'm trying to think of like the non scientific way to say it, but in that. On their outside, they have like all these little divots and it looks like.

(1h 21m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Ha ha ha ha ha, the normie word.

(1h 21m 11s) **Codey:**

> like a jewel could like literally fit in there. It's like they are the crown, but they are also the jewel, but you could like socket a jewel right into them. They're so cool.

(1h 21m 20s) **Kevin:**

> That sounds like a silk song design.

(1h 21m 22s) **Codey:**

> That is what I wanted to say to the audience.

(1h 21m 23s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(1h 21m 27s)

> All right, there you go.

(1h 21m 29s)

> And if you audience want to say things to Al or the podcast, which will go to Al,

(1h 21m 34s)

> go to Tumblr and Blue Sky at THSPod to follow the show for notes and episodes.

(1h 21m 42s)

> Go to harvestseason.club.

(1h 21m 45s)

> We don't know if the feedback is still working or not.

(1h 21m 48s)

> I don't know.

(1h 21m 48s)

> I haven't heard.

(1h 21m 51s)

> I'll shoot.

(1h 21m 52s)

> Look, you know what?

(1h 21m 53s)

> You just need to get an email.

(1h 21m 55s)

> That's how other people do it.

(1h 21m 55s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(1h 21m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Let's be real.

(1h 21m 58s)

> Make it easier.

(1h 21m 59s)

> Everyone's got an email.

(1h 22m)

> That way people can email their dumb questions and comments that I want to hear and be subject to.

(1h 22m 5s)

> I say dumb with affection.

(1h 22m 7s)

> Because I sent I sent dumb emails to other podcasts.

(1h 22m 11s)

> Or if you want the cool club, the direct way of getting in touch.

(1h 22m 18s)

> Go to patreon.com/ths

(1h 22m 20s)

> but throw a few bucks towards Al's way. He's got children to feed. And you can get cool stuff. You can get access to the greenhouse series of non-cotted core related stuff. We got many topics that we need to sit down and do. Cody and I will rank bug did you, man. No, no, we won't. But we could. I mean, we could. Yeah.

(1h 22m 41s) **Codey:**

> Oh, dude, we should totally do that because then I'm curious if there are any bug Digimon that are like better.

(1h 22m 55s)

> Like what if Digimon is just better at bugs that we should also do whenever I think Greg's game might be out soon.

(1h 22m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, well...

(1h 23m 3s) **Codey:**

> So friend of the pod, Greg Leatherman is making a game and I am going to out myself that I don't remember at the name of the game.

(1h 23m 11s)

> So they're called Domus guy and it's in Kickstarter right now it's like basically Pokemon, but it's made by some really cool people and that we know and he has been posting these like cute little critters on his Instagram for hot minute and he actually consulted me on one of them.

(1h 23m 34s)

> So you'd be recommend looking at that so it's D-O-M-E-S-K-I.

(1h 23m 41s)

> Domus guy. You look check it out on them Kickstarter and do it. If you're going to the Pax Unplugged then you can come and meet Greg and talk to him all about it.

(1h 23m 55s)

> It actually already met its goal. So the goal was 10 grand and it hit 15k. There are still 62 hours to go. So I guess if you're listening to this at release like go go go go go go.

(1h 24m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah. Oh, that's, you know what? That's good. Cause I get my paycheck and I need to do that. Um, I just been waiting for this paycheck specifically. Um, but, uh, yes, good good shout out. I mean, it's, it's a tabletop monster collecting Greg's head of passion for both forever and ski. So he's the man for the job. Yeah.

(1h 24m 26s) **Codey:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 24m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Um, okay. So that's, uh, so that's that and you know what we should do is do a green hat.

(1h 24m 37s)

> House on that. That'd be sick. Yeah. Yeah. The designs. Yeah. Yeah. On blue again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look, look, Cody, you and I have a handful of good to.

(1h 24m 38s) **Codey:**

> We should. That's what I'm saying. We should do that when it comes out. Like, we should really I want to I want the book and I want to go through the, um, the bug doe this guy. Um, but we also, we also still need to do one on sonic three. Uh, and while blue, so blue, we all wanted to do one on blue, we too, possibly. So that could be like a three people. But like, we got a couple here on putting that in bug Digimon. Don't.

(1h 25m 7s) **Kevin:**

> We can still do the, I don't know if you finished a little house yet, but we can do the, we can do the greenhouse on the prairie episode and talk about how great, doc.

(1h 25m 8s) **Codey:**

> Oh, Rosie grim, grim cozy. Do dog bakers awesome. So a little weird and somebody else says I'm a little like.

(1h 25m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Go, go, go. We could talk about how great dog bakers. Um, he's the best.

(1h 25m 27s)

> Well, it was at the, him or was it the times? I mean, y'all know there's that one opposite in their mind there. That was him, it was a little bit of the times, but a little bit of him too.

(1h 25m 33s) **Codey:**

> But a little bit of him, yep.

(1h 25m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh.

(1h 25m 39s) **Codey:**

> To be discussed though, but if you want to follow the podcast, we highly recommend and support the podcast so that we can keep doing silly little things like this.

(1h 25m 47s)

> You can go to the patreon patreon.com/chspod.

(1h 25m 50s)

> You can follow the podcast on tumblr and blue sky at thspod.

(1h 25m 55s)

> You can provide feedback and you can get links and show notes and transcripts of each episode at theharvestisend.club. And...

(1h 26m 3s)

> Also, if you do the patreon, you get access to our Slack, which is bump in one of Al's friends recently joined and there's a lot more in real life on.
