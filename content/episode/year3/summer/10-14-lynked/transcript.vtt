<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah. Okay. I mean, okay, like this is a lot because this is good stuff. First of all,

88
00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:57.319
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I love Scooby doo. I'm a huge Scooby doo fan. Um, that's, so that's awesome. Uh,

89
00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.120
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yep, big same.

90
00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:05.240
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Mothman top top probably 10, maybe top five cryptids. That's a good one. Um, I'm looking up the butt.

91
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.180
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Mm-hmm.

92
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.240
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, I get it. I get it now. Yep. No, that's, uh, um, yep.

93
00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.360
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- He, he thick.

94
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.040
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They're very, just like the real one.

95
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.439
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I don't know why,

96
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.279
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh, someone you, someone you, why?

97
00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:19.779
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I don't know why they needed to make the statues so thick.

98
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.879
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>But they did, and it's really funny.

99
00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:33.200
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I mean, why did Guillermo do it with the sound of water, the fishman?

100
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:26.720
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So yeah.

101
00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:32.960
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh yeah, I haven't...

102
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>See that yet, but he does some silly stuff, but yeah.

103
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:45.019
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But we know that's good stuff.

104
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.399
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So yeah, that's been playing that a decent amount.

105
00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:44.740
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I'd usually, like, after getting up in the morning and running the dogs for a bit, like,

106
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.919
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>all before I jump into work, I'll play, like, a game or two.

107
00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:53.480
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh, they also had kpop demon hunters in there for a while.

108
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.639
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I know, I know, I'm here, you're sweating about it, thinking constantly.

109
00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:02.240
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, and they still have a mode called Demon Rush, where it's basically just like Call of Duty

110
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.240
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>where you have, like, demons, like, running at you and you have to survive these waves.

111
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.559
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, I really, I'll do, like, one or two of those, too, before, 'cause they take maybe, like,

112
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's pretty good.

113
00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:15.559
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>10 minutes.

114
00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:20.039
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, I'll do a couple of those, and then I'll, and then I'll be like, "Okay, time to work."

115
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:35.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>that's pretty good. I saw many of those cosmetics. They're really good. I've never been interested in Fortnite up till this until K-pop even has evidence by last week when I screamed. Anyway,

116
00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:22.039
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yep.

117
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah

118
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.580
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so that's what I've been up to what I've even up to

119
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:46.399
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>that's good stuff. Okay, so I have some. Okay, first off, my pop corner time.

120
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>uh-huh

121
00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.559
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Today I took like

122
00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:06.799
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>the office my office work office for a little bit because it was going to be a long for a few hours I was like I'll just watch them. It's fine because today most people were working around anyway, so it was chill It was good. He's he's he's officially won now, I guess

123
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.700
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>oh

124
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.840
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>No.

125
00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:13.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But he's still very poppy And he probably will be for another year if not longer because we spoil him

126
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.159
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But yeah, he was all behaved. He was fun. He was popular of course

127
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:48.279
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>because he just got groomed, so he's very cute and then done fluffy and soft. But he was good, but yeah, he's at one point. I did have to like, okay, I'm gonna hop in a conference room because he was a little bored, a little whiny, and there's people talking, so you know, let's not have puppy welps on the zoom calls. But yeah, that was fun. He's very tuckered eyes, been sleeping all after I go back.

128
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.759
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughing]

129
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So that was fun.

130
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay.

131
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So I'm a big podcast listener when I'm working because you know,

132
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>it's easy to throw stuff audio.

133
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's different sense as opposed to my vision stuff when I'm working.

134
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Have you heard the thing about PAM?

135
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>The thing about no. Okay.

136
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay.

137
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So it is a date line podcast.

138
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's the one I listen to.

139
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's not just a single, it's a series.

140
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>many series like six episodes originally.

141
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>This one got a lot of attention. I they eventually made I think Netflix made these series out of it

142
00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:29.399
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's a it's a wild one. It's about

143
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.799
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, this guy arrives home and he finds his wife murdered. She's been stabbed and

144
00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:48.320
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The investigation goes on and he basically this guy gets arrested and and is sent to jail for life He's found guilty, but he in fact did not do it

145
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mmm. Yeah.

146
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.679
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>a lot of let's say shenanigans that the law enforcement get up to and the prosecutors

147
00:11:55.759 --> 00:12:00.279
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Basically, there was another woman who took out a life insurance policy on the woman who died

148
00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:19.159
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So surprise I guess what her name is Pam and guess what she did it probably she hasn't been convicted But anyways, that's a setup and it's a wild rollercoaster I recommend to other people, but I will say this there is a second murder in this series involving this woman who's just like a

149
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.519
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Suburban soccer mom type lady

150
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But yeah, it's it's a good one. It's a wild story because just off the bat like the wrong person gets convicted

151
00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:34.639
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, good times

152
00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:40.440
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So I recommend that looks a date line podcast wherever it's also a mini series Renee

153
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.480
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's why I think I forget every her name

154
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.960
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Brittany's cell wager? Uh-huh.

155
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. Yeah, she she's the pretty she produced

156
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>the series because she listened to the podcast series and said, I want to make this into a acting series and then she stars in it using prosthetics and like a fit.

157
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.159
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That is really funny because she played, she was in Chicago as Roxie Hart,

158
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

159
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:11.279
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>which is a woman who murdered someone and gets it in like, basically gets away with it because her lawyer is good enough. So that's really funny.

160
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.200
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

161
00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:13.799
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, that's good. Oh, let's go. I didn't know that. That's good

162
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, so let's check that out. That's the thing about Pam. I did some easy to listen six episodes or less than an hour each

163
00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:26.799
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Anyways, okay, the video game world though the one thing people care about here

164
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

165
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.860
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's not true, but Okay, so I've been playing a lot.

166
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.120
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Digimon cyber sleuth. That's a game that came out almost like 10 years ago.

167
00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:44.120
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I knew I'd like a new Digimon came out that I want to play, but I had been able to get it.

168
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So I'm playing, you know, I went back to the original cyber sleuth.

169
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.879
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>This game is still incredible. I loved it the first time, replaying it is still incredible.

170
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.159
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's monster catching and

171
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>monster collector turn-based battles. So, you know, a lot of, let's say, comfort food.

172
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.799
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>For Pokemon fans, let's say that. But, of course, Digimon has their way of doing things.

173
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Not that they're family friendly, but they'll get more mature or go, you know,

174
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:23.639
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>after different designs and things like that. And tonally, they can go pretty dark places.

175
00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:33.080
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>This game can go incredibly dark in places, also really funny. The writing's just good across the board. But I want to talk about one side quiz called the Perfect

176
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Mm-hmm.

177
00:14:33.000 --> 00:15:02.879
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Girl Project. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. So the the I guess the setting for this world that the the game takes place in regular earth and Tokyo, but there's also an online like virtual reality world that everyone can log into and then you know, you have a virtual avatar and you just move around in cyberspace or whatever. Okay. So in this one side quest,

178
00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:37.080
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- God, this is already.

179
00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:07.320
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>it's called cyber sleuth because you're a detective basically and you've been hired because

180
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.240
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>girls, there there have been these

181
00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:18.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>life-sized dolls. Let's call them with very realistic appearances of actual people

182
00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:27.639
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>of all all ladies and females, of course, being sold on the street. And so they're asking you to look into it because

183
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.919
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That probably means somebody somehow stole their avatar data and

184
00:15:33.000 --> 00:16:02.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>they're producing these these these dolls or whatever so you're already off to a great start right um well you dig into the case and eventually you learned there's there's a higher level to this plan it's called the perfect girl project basically they convince guys to sign up for the service where they can live online with virtual

185
00:16:03.000 --> 00:17:03.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>there's a pretty much whatever woman or female or whoever they want and just hang out with them so you know good stuff but here there's there's only one catch or two two catches one the guy has to be healthy and to he has to be willing to just basically never never log off that he has to agree to that and so where does that lead to well while the guys meant totally in cyberspace with these these perfect girl projects his body is implied to be shipped off to a foreign country for whatever reasons they would want a healthy body and so we get the kind of a kill shot at the end of like proof of one of the Vic because you encounter one victim and he tries to log out and he can't log out there's nowhere to log out to he says which is a message that hasn't been seen in the game otherwise.

186
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:33.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>so so yeah that was fun that was wild to see them just go all in and then it was followed by a side quest where I helped the buddy find her rare manga that was it that's that's the kind of this tonal distance this game loves to do just go up and down like that from the most stuff to just shenanigans for giggles.

187
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Wild. That's a choice they're making.

188
00:17:33.000 --> 00:18:03.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>um yeah good stuff but yeah that's did you on that the likes of the writing grades I recommend I like did you want. um okay but that's what I've been up to all right let's get on to game news now okay uh to start things off let's talk about not overcooked to overthrown that's the one with the you're not link and you can.

189
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:32.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>pickup structures and throw them. Hence the name. Fun concept. Okay, big, their news, it's delayed. 1.0 is being delayed. I'll read the quote here. While I was not in easy call, we are fully committed to delivering the best possible version of the game and it would be a disservice both to our work and our community to rush the final release. That said, we want to reassure you that overthrown 0.0 is on track to launch before the end of the year. Um, that is, uh,

190
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:47.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>uh, yeah. Okay. So that's the, that's pretty much the news and I mean, good for them because it's better to, to use the quote out foot here. The, the famous quote from, I guess, the great developers.

191
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So that came from them. I didn't realize that. Okay.

192
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.160
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh, no, no, so I put this here.

193
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.839
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>One of the, there's a comment,

194
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.200
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I just went to the comments on this,

195
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.880
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>'cause I'm always really curious whenever a game gets like delayed or whatever, like what the fans say.

196
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So there was a commenter on this post,

197
00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:06.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>whose name, their name is Gungrave,

198
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>uh-huh

199
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.720
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>and they said, "A finished game is good,

200
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.720
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but an unfinished game is forever bad."

201
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.599
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, I think that was me a motor who originally said it if I recall correctly someone I didn't end up here

202
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so, but...

203
00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:17.799
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- 10 out of 10. - Correct.

204
00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:19.119
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah

205
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.640
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- What?

206
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.279
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Take your time, get your stuff done,

207
00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:24.640
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but don't worry about rushing it.

208
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, and hey, there's still aiming for this year, which that seems like a tight deadline, but okay

209
00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:42.339
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They have airships that's there's a lot going on in this game, but it's dropping bombs

210
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.299
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>the airships was wild, like they were like, "Oh, and here's a picture of the airships."

211
00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:48.799
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>And I'm like, "You're straight up dropping from someone's like on someone's,

212
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.440
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

213
00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>it looks like they're farm.

214
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>It's just someone's farm just get an absolutely bomb dropped on, which is nuts."

215
00:19:53.500 --> 00:20:04.019
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not surprised like they're doing a lot in this game because you know physics based throwing and what not like

216
00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:13.180
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's a that's a lot. But take good for them for delaying. That's that's my opinion. Yeah, especially since you know a

217
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, take your time.

218
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.740
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Like 20 good games are coming out. So we've got plenty to play until then

219
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.859
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Pokemon legends is going to be dropping after this podcast

220
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:29.900
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that because I'm like kind of out of that whole thing.

221
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.220
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

222
00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:37.900
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, that's fine. Oh, I mean, well the game looks good. I like xy a lot. I like so I'm excited

223
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm

224
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.220
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Megaholutrix exists. I don't want that

225
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:45.420
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay speaking of things that exists

226
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:53.180
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The Guardians of Azuma that that is exists. It has existed and a new patch up

227
00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.299
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Is out actually one point one point. Oh, oh, yeah, all those decimals

228
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.819
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's out for switch and switch to in Europe and Australia

229
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.859
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They added boss gauntlets which

230
00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:12.059
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Go ahead Cody you wrote your notes

231
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:17.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so the Bosgon lids, it just seems like to me like it's basically just a hard mode.

232
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:31.839
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So for some bosses, so if you've completed the main quest, these Bosgon lids can be either acquired or purchased, I don't know exactly how, but it adds like, I think it was four different bosses that you can do that are just a little bit harder.

233
00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:38.160
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So if you've hit like the main, the end of the main quest, it kind of just offers something more difficult to do.

234
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.460
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>that's your up to difficulty.

235
00:21:40.500 --> 00:22:10.259
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>down. There you go. And I mean, this is a room factory. So combat, I get people who play it for the combat. I presume so that that's a good one to add. But aside from that, the other part, because like linked banner of the spark, there's combat and there's not combat. Village life, they've added a new development zone to summer village.

236
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.559
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

237
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:16.259
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Just a whole bunch of new facilities and decorations. Expanding capacity of a whole bunch of stuff,

238
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.339
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

239
00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:24.740
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>which is, it's fun. A maximum bomb level 200. What was it before? That's a triple digits. That's big.

240
00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:27.380
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And all sorts of bug fixes.

241
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I always, so in the, in one of the next, I think it is in the next thing, Al calls that a bug fix,

242
00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:38.400
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>he likes, and so I saw one on this that I thought was hilarious as well. So they said,

243
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:55.519
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>fixed a bug where villagers tasked with farming would sometimes harvest crops even when the action was set to off. So it's like, you tell, you tell them you're like, you don't have to harvest, and it's just in their blood. It's in their DNA. They're digital DNA. They're like,

244
00:22:46.500 --> 00:23:04.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Yeah. Yeah. Like the Minecraft villagers even when you really don't want to hurt me, they'll do it.

245
00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:58.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- I'm sorry, I have to harvest this, like.

246
00:22:58.839 --> 00:23:00.740
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughs]

247
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.319
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I just think that's really, yeah.

248
00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:06.839
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>And you're like, please, leave my stuff alone.

249
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's what I'm going to do.

250
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:13.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Ah, that's good.

251
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.319
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>But yeah, I thought that was funny.

252
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:22.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, speaking of one point one point oh, updates, story of seasons, grandpas are, oh, is that it?

253
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's so weird, it's coincidence because it's story of seasons and room factory.

254
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You get the same update number.

255
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh, you're right.

256
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's wild.

257
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, I'll also getting the one point one point oh update.

258
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:41.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, you know, so like the big thing is called happy bingo.

259
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I didn't even notice that which props to you.

260
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.019
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And it is, as the name implies, Bingo.

261
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:59.380
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Basically, daily tasks, so you get a Bingo card from the nature sprites, and you gathering mushrooms, harvesting crops, selling things, I'm just kind of going based off the icon.

262
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:11.599
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Just, you know, day-to-day activities you do, you fill out spots, and if you get a Bingo on bizarre days, you can go to the nature sprites and claim rewards.

263
00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:16.460
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And there are some cool ones, because you get a pirate outfit, I want to be a pirate

264
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.579
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>outfit, like pirate outfits, visuals, so.

265
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:33.460
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yep. I like, I just like the happy, I just like bingo. So anytime anyone could just make something a bingo, like you already have to do these tasks, but you can do them in a bingo style where it's like,

266
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

267
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.299
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>okay, well, how like in what order should I complete the tasks? And then they also have like

268
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.859
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>like a, if you do a horizontal or a vertical or a diagonal, like you get a different reward.

269
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Ooh, oh yeah, I didn't catch that, that's good.

270
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.940
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so there's that. And then there's, if you complete all of them, then there's another,

271
00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:11.619
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>so there's like levels to the bingo as well. Um, so I, I feel like that, and it would also make you do things that you might not always do. Um, because if I, for example, yeah, you have to pet the thing 25 that,

272
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Al has to pet the barn animal 25 times

273
00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:16.180
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>like I would do, I mean, I do that too, where I'm like, I don't want to do that. And so I will

274
00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:18.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>not do something.

275
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:26.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>But if there's a little sweet treat associated with it, you betcha, I'm gonna do it.

276
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.279
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean and outfit is a pretty big incentive like you even

277
00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:37.220
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Side from pirate stuff that I like like just in general. That's a good one for this game

278
00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:40.599
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So that's exciting and that's just

279
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Volume one in their image, so you know what else will they come up with? I don't know, but that's a cool. That's a cool way to do it

280
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.220
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yup. Oh, and then I'll the bug fix in this that I'll comment it on he said I love weird bugs. So this

281

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The part I like is that, you know, maybe the devs don't even know themselves.

285
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.019
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I just like things like this just make me smile like how did this

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I can't remember what Pokemon game it was where the the patch notes would usually be various improvements to the game or something

301
00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:28.119
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Just just no notes

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, there's a handful of patch notes or bug fixes and whatnot. Um, I

306
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.700
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I didn't play the game, so I can't pick out the funny ones

307
00:27:47.500 --> 00:28:14.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I mean, I like that one. That one's gonna, oh, sorry. The tails of the Shire one. No, so the tails of the Shire folks did, um, they did something cute where they have it so that, um, the, it says things like, oh, your line got tangled. So we fixed something so you could focus on the fish. Um, or, uh, some of the hobbits weren't minding their personal space. And so they would overlap each other.

308
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.700
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But

309
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:39.680
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I like this one, hobbits in turkey, I don't know what that means, we'll no longer see strange code word strings for flavors or for anything else for that matter, okay.

310
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.460
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Wednesday. So it's, I mean, they, they need a cute thing.

312
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.599
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I think it just means that people that lived in Turkey that were playing like the country Turkey.

313
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah. Oh, okay, realtor, yeah, I don't know if that was a wrap.

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>What's that called?

338
00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:34.660
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>[laughs]

341
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.900
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So do that, you're feel listening, do it.

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's the logical early.

345
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.480
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That logical conclusion to marriage, children.

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But I, what I don't get is why do games always feel the need to add that, the, the children part.

347
00:31:58.319 --> 00:31:59.799
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Do you know nothing wrong with it or whatever?

348
00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:02.200
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Just, uh, I don't know, it was misdepressing.

349
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.640
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It feels like they're just copying the homework at that point.

350
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:11.880
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, I mean, it's it makes sense that it's always an option, but like personally like I wrote yuck cuz I just like why

351
00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, but I don't know.

352
00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:08.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah.

353
00:32:10.839 --> 00:32:11.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>[laughs]

354
00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:18.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I, I think it's to try to give the relationship part the mechanics more meaning or

355
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.759
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>or something out of it but there's different ways, better ways.

356
00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:24.779
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, but like it could just the meaning can just be that it's

357
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:32.660
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>If these people care about each other and they want to be together like you don't have to add a relation like a baby to it get these babies out of here

358
00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:43.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Look, I'd rather just see the development be spent on being able to do stuff with your spouse. That'd be fun, how about that?

359
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:46.059
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>mm-hmm same big same

360
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah. Oh, good. But yeah, I mean, if you answer Mr. Chair, it'd start you like right so well.

361
00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:03.579
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>all this stuff, they are going to finish the storyline for 1.0. They say, that's the let's probably on the big ones. But let's see, and anything else, like I'm just reading, it's just

362
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.160
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh yeah, so they also have like the Saturday market.

363
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.440
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I really love a good Saturday market.

364
00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.480
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I worked at one for a while.

365
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay.

366
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.839
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>And I think it's just really fun.

367
00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:15.039
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>It brings the community together.

368
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:19.039
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So I like having like a set like market day.

369
00:33:19.039 --> 00:33:20.240
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That was cool.

370
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.160
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh, they also know, I think you matter exactly,

371
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.759
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but they know that there's post up,

372
00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:28.319
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>there will be post 1.0 updates as well.

373
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:56.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm thinking about Saturday markets now. I can't remember the last time because I know the feel like I know the feeling you're describing a one where it brings community. That's tough. Like we could at least in the, I have been one in the Atlanta area that feels like that. We have like a big

374
00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:31.519
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So which is, I mean, good, they're not.

375
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:33.019
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but the end of 1.0.

376
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.799
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>1.0 will complete their vision, but they will continue to do stuff after.

377
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

378
00:33:57.039 --> 00:34:27.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>farmers market that people know about because it's big and it's great because you get great deals and you know, it's supporting the farmers locally. But that feels a little more commercial, right? Because it's like they're, it's not just a stand. They're like big lots basically. Um, so yeah, I'm trying to, I can't, I'm not have to look that up. You know what I did a lot as a kid. I did the swap meet like we went to the swap meet a bunch as a kid and that was great. Um, so it's kind of like,

379
00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

380
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.920
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh, so what is that?

381
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:52.860
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>what does Saturday market, but it's like everyone's, it's more like garage sale feely at the same time. It's not stalls. Generally speaking, it's more like, again, a slightly bigger lot, but it's just random stuff. It's, it's basically a bunch of garage sale type things. Um, kind of, kind of like an antique market, but, um, but, uh, just brand up stuff. Yeah.

382
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.300
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm. Okay.

383
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.719
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay, I do we have a few places here that have like

384
00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:06.860
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Like it's antique markets, but there you can rent a booth and then you sell your stuff out of your booth

385
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.719
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That's kind of like that. I just I feel like I've I always heard about swap meets, but then I never

386
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:21.619
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah, it's just like hitting up a bunch of garage sales. I don't together

387
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.280
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Did any and then I just realized I was like, I don't even know really what that means

388
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, that makes sense

389
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.420
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, which is just fun. I like a good garage sale

390
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm

391
00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:34.980
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Not not running one, but going on. Okay. Um, so fields of mystery a sadly. No swap meets or

392
00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:38.980
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But it does have Saturday market so good good for you

393
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.480
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, so that's all the updates to exist

394
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:53.780
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>games or coming updates. Let's get into some new games. All right, this first one. I mean hats off on the title alone

395
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.820
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>We get frog island

396
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's a concept. I'm down with just off the bat

397
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.440
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yep, you have my attention.

398
00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:07.099
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, and like I like the art style

399
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:13.199
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's it's not it's ice a isometric a bit very cutesy looking

400
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm

401
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:17.900
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'm I'm trying to think of how to what to compare it to because it was doing

402
00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:18.699
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>To me it looks a lot like

403
00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:26.619
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Usagishima, so yeah, or necko oxime, but usagishima was like the main one that I

404
00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:22.699
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's don't yes, that's the one

405
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:32.579
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Immediately I was like did the people who made usagishima make this game cuz it just seems very very similar, but

406
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.780
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>But it's doing its own thing, too

407
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.320
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, okay. All right. Let's read the description because I'm just admiring the beauty of the the heart here

408
00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.940
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, yeah

409
00:36:40.619 --> 00:36:46.380
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Trapped on mysterious island you are greeted by a woman who asked you to take care for frogs while she is away

410
00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:57.219
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Very understandable sentiment and it was explored farm cooked fish and befriend magical frogs So you try to find a way to escape the island and figure out why you're even here in the first place

411
00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.460
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, see you lost me there cuz I

412
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.659
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Don't need to understand why I've died or nor need to escape

413
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:16.519
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I have no questions, just, yes, the answers, yes, I'll be here.

414
00:37:05.699 --> 00:37:08.900

418
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.179

<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Yeah, I don't know.

437
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So there's a game called Orange Season that I don't know if we ever covered it or anything,

438
00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:51.920
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but...

439
00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:56.219
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>We talk about the news. I do remember the name coming up, but no, I don't think we actually covered the game itself

440
00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.320
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so, but like they, the people that made Orange Season,

441
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.280
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>okay, I'm just gonna read this.

442
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Orange Season was a passion project,

443
00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:05.880
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>put with a lot of challenges,

444
00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.440
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>and we tackled them as best we can.

445
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.400
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>We learned a lot along the way,

446
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.400
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but ultimately some things were out of our control.

447
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.599
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That's why we brought another team to help with the development of Orange Season while we work on our next game,

448
00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:16.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>we trust that they will bring our vision

449
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:46.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>into life. Patches will start to roll out next month for all platforms. We are building this new project from all the lessons we learned from orange season and your feedback. So to me, so to me, this is like a game that they haven't even like they're gonna start it, but they haven't started it yet, but they're letting you know that like orange season patches are still coming. We're still, they're still working on orange season, but they've more or less moved the development to us another team.

450
00:39:41.000 --> 00:40:10.719
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>mmm yeah which hmm I get it and obviously we don't know the circumstances on you know their side but that's that's not a great look I mean it's probably rough for them too but um yup gotta gotta cut and run feels like right and they're not abandoning it but like they're just saying out right there they're switching years kind of.

451
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:03.199
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, to have to like, put your move your baby over.

452
00:40:03.199 --> 00:40:09.679
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yep.

453
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:36.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There's still working on it. But the actual project ever tree is a quote cozy single player farm management game that followed the journey of Alessandra competing to be the best farmer in the summer camp manager farm alongside your companions complete chores for points and deal with the dynamics of a colorful cast in their teenage years.

454
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, I'm sorry. I'm just checking. There was no video or anything, right? It's just

455
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:46.579
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Nope, there's no video there's not that there's literally just the image

456
00:40:41.000 --> 00:41:10.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>this one. Image of a big tree with purple leaves and Project Ever tree will go over it. Um, I get them. Anything. No, I wish them luck, I guess.

457
00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.860
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, yep, so it's just a we're they're gonna be doing it

458
00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:04.659
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Gonna happen, but as it stands currently, there's not it doesn't look like there's

459
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:27.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That could be fun. Um, but, uh, summer camp setting could be a fun idea. It depends if you have colorful casts. How colorful. That could be entertaining. Um, yeah. Um, all right. Yeah,

460
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:40.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>it's hard to say there's, there's nothing. We got nothing to go off really other than the text. Um, but all right, there you go. So no, no, anything is to win or anything. So just keep an eye out. Good name, though, Project Ever.

461
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.360
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, yep.

462
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:49.320
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay. All right, that's that's that's it. That's the news we did it. We've increased the news for now.

463
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Wooooo!

464
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:58.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So let's get into a linked banner of the spark. The game I bought on basically unreleased.

465
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.320
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughing]

466
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Was it worth it?

467
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:11.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, well, mmm. I am unsure.

468
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.519
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Just a yes or no.

469
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.119
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, so all right, all right, let's let's let's start with the premise, right? Um,

470
00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:32.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>over here, I'll read the quote, uh, build the bright new world alongside a band of rescued robot buddies in this colorful action RPG about a ways of enemies and solar co-op then return home and use their parts to craft a thriving town assemble your crew and grow stronger with each new adventure.

471
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:40.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So this goes in the what we, uh, I'll coin to the rogue life. John,

472
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.599
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Well, they also, they say that they're rogue life as well.

473
00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:46.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh, is that them? Oh, never mind. Okay, they coined it then, I think.

474
00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:46.559
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, they say it like on their thing.

475
00:42:46.559 --> 00:42:49.199
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so they, they call themselves rogue life.

476
00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:57.360
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, and then they also, uh, I saw this like, um, like,

477
00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:01.599
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>looking back at some of their previous posts, I saw this one that was like,

478
00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:03.679
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Hades meets Animal Crossing.

479
00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:07.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Maybe this was on the, maybe this was on the discussion, like the forum.

480
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Mm-hmm

481
00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:10.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, so yeah, I just do, yeah.

482
00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:11.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay

483
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.599
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>The professor does it seem like Hades meets Animal Crossing to you.

484
00:43:13.679 --> 00:43:18.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Absolutely, um, yes, okay. Have you played either hate well you played him or something you played Hades?

485
00:43:14.599 --> 00:43:18.099
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay.

486
00:43:18.099 --> 00:43:22.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Play Animal Crossing, no, no, I'm not played Hades.

487
00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:22.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, have you played cult of lion?

488
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.199
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>No, I want to.

489
00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:25.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay. All right. Well, uh, okay

490
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, cult of lamb

491
00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:29.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I know, I'm no help.

492
00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:32.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>No, no, no, no, I'm frustrated because what I'm about to say

493
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I was really

494
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>intrigued by this not intrigued like I was excited. I saw it the art style look cool the premise was good That's why I bought it on release

495
00:43:41.519 --> 00:43:44.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Call to the lamb is the direct

496
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:53.559
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Comparison point because it's the same idea of half a game is broke like combat heavy and then half of it is developing a little settlement

497
00:43:54.440 --> 00:44:04.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And here's here's the part that pains me like I bought the game I put in and it's not terribly expensive. I think it's just 20 USD. Yeah, thanks

498
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:28.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I put in many hours. I don't have an hour count, but at least two or three weeks of playing on the regular. But overall, like I put it down. I put it down. I'm not, you know, sometimes you put a game down because you get distracted or other stuff comes up. This one I put down just, I lost interest.

499
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

500
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Like, it doesn't happen often to me. Like, hopefully, I guess I did put it down technically. I didn't.

501
00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:30.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay.

502
00:44:34.000 --> 00:45:00.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I didn't beat it, but it wasn't out of lack of interest. I just got sidetracked or whatever. Anyway, the point I'm trying to get to is like call to the lamb just is just better in almost every category, which is, is rough. So let's, let's, let's get to it the brass tracks. There's two ways that the animal crossing park on the Haiti sport.

503
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

504
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.659
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Let's start with the animal crossing part and the more cottage core e-part

505
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So visually, like the game works well for that because it's bright, it's colorful.

506
00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:33.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I do like the art style, generally speaking, it's a little generic, like generic anime-y like PokÃ©mon shown in e-style. The colors are bright and whatnot, but there's no environment or anything that really sticks out. There's some settings that feel like

507
00:45:34.599 --> 00:45:40.440
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>again, where the setting is robots have taken over the world and there's just a few humans,

508
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:51.679
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>so a lot of it is, you know, robots and machines scattered about, but you're trying to reclaim the world and reclaim nature a bit so there's a lot of heavily-forested areas too.

509
00:45:51.679 --> 00:46:03.719
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And so you're kind of blending it, so it's not bad, it's nice enough, but it just doesn't stick out like cult of the lamb or Hades. So that's...

510
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:14.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>A little unfortunate, the music, nothing to write home about, it's pretty much the same thing, like no track sticks in my mind, but it's good enough for playing.

511
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:18.019
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay. Yep.

512
00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:23.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The building the town part, I'm going to hop to that because that's the animal crossing part.

513
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's just fall short, this is the problem of the game, like the bar is higher, it helps everything it does,

514
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>because it's a great

515
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:59.599
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>good-based system, and you're just plotting decorations down, I think part of it is there's not enough customization options in the game. There's a few, but not enough to feel like animal crossing. And the unfortunate part is it's largely, it's largely or just ornamental.

516
00:46:59.599 --> 00:47:03.980
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So call to the lamb when you build up your settlement, when you build up your settlement.

517
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:16.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>and take care of your cult members or whatever, it actually benefits you in the combat part.

518
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It expands your abilities and your... just general upgrades and stuff like that.

519
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:33.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Call to the lamb does that very well of the cycle of going into combat for stuff to bring back your village, to increase stuff in the village, to go out into combat,

520
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>or linked does not do that.

521
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:47.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Like you build up your town, kind of animal crossing style, and it's nice enough, but it's just... it's kind of its own reward,

522
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:55.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>so how much you get out of that subjective, which is kind of unfortunate because for me, I just wasn't really feeling it.

523
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It was a little okay, but I think part of the challenge too is getting the enough resources to craft or build whatever you need.

524
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:36.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>going to build a path you need a lot of a certain type of resource and and sometimes I can get a little tedious because it's either you're just killing a bunch of random enemies out in the field or you're shaking trees and and mining rocks which is just basic basically hit the button sort of stuff so yeah the the town part of it is a little a little lack lustrous

525
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:43.199
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think the best part is the actual growing of the village villagers I should say because

526
00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:56.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>you there is a like animal crossing there is a set of facilities with npc's that run them and those are you know required are always there you have a black smith you have a chef you have a

527
00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:03.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>general store person and so on and so forth right and they're all robots

528
00:49:04.719 --> 00:49:33.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>but you also get villager robots who and I think you can get up to 10 in your village at one time but you can unlock up to 40 of them and so you can kind of swap them out it is fun to see the villagers kind of running around and doing stuff not not like anything super interactive or memorable but it's just when you fill it up the town it does feel a lot more lively with all these

529
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah

530
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.199
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>around um

531
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:43.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>When I think like looking at the like it's you're basically it's just robots, right like yeah, so

532
00:49:44.099 --> 00:49:49.239
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>It's nice to yeah, add in the other member of something else

533
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.559
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean

534
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:59.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's definitely part of this game like it's clear. It's for robot people, right? Like which is what was a big draw for me?

535
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I like robots and and

536
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:10.219
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>like Metabots and and stuff like that like the thought of collectible robot game that that sounded really cool to me

537
00:50:11.079 --> 00:50:13.480
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And it again, it is nice, but it's

538
00:50:14.599 --> 00:50:18.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Largely ornamental the designs are okay nothing like super sticks out to me

539
00:50:20.639 --> 00:50:23.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But again, it's it's it's good enough

540
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.440
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>the Let me think the

541
00:50:30.039 --> 00:50:43.539
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>One thing you oh, oh, yeah, okay, so I'm gonna kind of start sliding into the comments stuff But the progression is it's all quest based basically you talk to certain villagers You talk to the the facilities

542
00:50:44.039 --> 00:50:49.699
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>managers and they give you quests Clear X, you know, clear this level.

543
00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:05.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Achieve this objective beat X number of enemies. It can vary and I think again, that's might be part of the TDM because it's just it's very, very quest like linear sort of thing.

544
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:17.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There's not a lot of flavor to it, right? The writings, okay, there's the personalities don't stick out like say animal crossing, right?

545
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>All those shop keeps very clear.

546
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:29.559
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>memorable personalities. Nothing like that. They try. I'll give them the sticker for an effort,

547
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.820
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughs]

548
00:51:29.559 --> 00:51:49.900
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>but an attempt was indeed made, but it's just not hitting like Animal Crossing was. But that said, oh, you know what? Oh, I'm back. I'm back here one second. Fishing, let me talk about fishing real quick.

549
00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.980
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- And attempt was made.

550
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:52.179
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>mm-hmm. Oh, okay.

551
00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:05.599
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Because that's part of village life too. There is fishing in the game. I'm torn on the fishing minigame in this game. I like it more than stardoos, but it's challenging almost.

552
00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:19.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Because what it is is basically it's a spinner and there's a colored part of the spinner and you have to hit the colored part. And you have to do that a few times to fill up the gauge and when the gauge fills up you catch the fish.

553
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:31.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But for some of the rare fish, that's hard and if you mess up, if you hit the spinner in an incorrect part, the gauge goes down sometimes a good amount.

554
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So it can be frustrating to kind of learn the timing properly.

555
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But that said, they do do some cool stuff. First of all, the fish are also all robotic.

556
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So that's fun. And you don't have a fishing rod.

557
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.260
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh, I haven't even talked about it.

558
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's called the wire, it's a grappling hook, basically attached to your arm.

559
00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.559
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>What happens is fish will jump out of the water, and you have to hook them with your arm,

560
00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:02.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>which is fun.

561
00:53:02.039 --> 00:53:12.480
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And if you do the timing just so like at the height of their jump, you actually get like a bonus and like half the gauges feel or something like that when you're fishing.

562
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So that is a little fun.

563
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's at least different.

564
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'll say that.

565
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's a little more dynamic.

566
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's not, same old table we've seen in another game.

567
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.480
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So I gave them a thumbs up for the fishing that they're trying to do.

568
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.019
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But they also have, they don't have bugs, but they have these, what are they called,

569
00:53:32.019 --> 00:53:38.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>bitty-bots, like tiny little robots hiding around in trees and rocks and stuff like that.

570
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay.

571
00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:39.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They don't look like bugs, sadly.

572
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.559
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They're just little robots with different designs.

573
00:53:41.559 --> 00:53:46.519
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There's one that looks like a star, one that looks like, I think, a teardrop, something like that.

574
00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:49.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>a handful of designs. So that's kind of replacing by

575
00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:19.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>bugs and there's just another whole group of things to catch. And those are definitely the two most active part of town, kind of like animal crossing, but just not as engaging. There's no museum, sadly. You know, you have an encyclopedia page or whatever. I don't think that even has info, just like the collection page. But they try to at least make it their

576
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>wop flavor. Um, yeah.

577
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:51.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, but without like the incentive of like filling something and I think that's probably part of the fact that there's no other like real villagers or anything that's basically just you I mean that to me is just seems really lonely to like do this all by yourself, but I mean that's probably what it it's meant to convey so.

578
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:59.619
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess so because like, I mean, you can't there's dialogue with the villagers and whatnot, but it's it's just not as fulfilling. They don't feel as alive as an animal crossing a villager.

579
00:55:02.059 --> 00:55:11.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I will give them one thumbs up for one specific, very specific thing to you can do. You can grapple a villager and throw them into the river.

580
00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:25.260
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They'll just respawn, but it's just a really funny animation and they incentivize you because every now and then you'll get a request from a villager to throw them in the water or throw other people in the water.

581
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>What happens when you do that?

582
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay.

583
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.260
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>What?

584
00:55:29.739 --> 00:55:41.420
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I don't know why they just and usually and sometimes they'll just don't just don't question it. Just do it. Yeah, yeah.

585
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:36.320
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Just do it.

586
00:55:37.679 --> 00:55:39.800
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>They're just trying to see if you'll do it.

587
00:55:41.500 --> 00:56:07.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So yeah, let me talk about the facilities real quick because they're they're the closest like connective tissue to the to the combat portion, which I'll get to in a minute, but let's see, okay, there's a blacksmith's pretty straightforward. It's your weapon of grades or crafting and each facility manager has their own line of quests.

588
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:11.460
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So if you do stuff for the blacksmith you of course unlock new weapon types or

589
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:28.519
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>mm-hmm I think I solved 80 weapon types is that okay got it that would make sense

590
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:20.980
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>different upgrades to other weapons and so on and so forth.

591
00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:41.300
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think there's like ten base weapon types and probably variations of thereof that's probably what they're saying yeah and I think you know what I this is probably one of the biggest criticism of the game actually the progression system kind of shoots itself in the foot because the blacksmith is a a very good example.

592
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:55.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So in Hades, for instance, you can access all the weapon types pretty quickly relative to how long you're playing the game until you hit true credits or whatever.

593
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:50.840
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm hmm.

594
00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:00.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So you get the chance to explore different weapons and figure them out.

595
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:11.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>In this game, because of the progression system where you have to do all the quests for the Blacksmith, you don't reach the final weapon type until his, I think,

596
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:16.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>can ultimate weapon or his quest or whatever.

597
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:23.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So it feels like you're playing a lot of the game with a lot of options still kind of locked out.

598
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:32.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And you can, you know, kind of focus on the Blacksmith and Beeline it or whatever, but it still feels like you're missing out because you know,

599
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:39.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think most people would be trying to do other quests and other stuff at the same time.

600
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:41.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And the weapon,

601
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:55.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>let's talk more about the weapons in the combat, but it's just this kind of general idea of there's a lot of good features and upgrades that are locked behind this quest system because it's so linear it can take a while to get to.

602
00:57:55.500 --> 00:58:04.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, if anyone plays linked, do the chef quest lines first because he unlocks something probably the best feature of the game.

603
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

604
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:09.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And that is you can take your villagers out on combat with you.

605
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You can take up to two.

606
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:21.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>First, you get one, but then you'll lock a second slot later and that's all from doing the quest lines or the chef quest lines excuse me.

607
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:33.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And that's not only very fun to have your villagers join you because they have different attacks and different combat cells, but it's also really, really helpful.

608
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:40.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So that that and again that's lock bind quest line and you don't really see it until you get there.

609
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:50.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Again, just critical upgrades that feel like block behind these quest lines and I wish you could access them faster.

610
00:58:50.500 --> 00:59:05.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Let me think the other facilities they're not as critical to combat a lot of it is for the town upgrading you you get a craftsman guy who teaches you how to build different like fencing and decorations, benches, fences.

611
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:15.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh my goodness. There's this thing. I don't know if to call it a bug or whatever, but I'm building if when you go and I build a fence and I put you know the gate to enter the fence or whatever.

612
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.760
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm.

613
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:22.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I don't know if it's been fixed yet, but I can't there's a gap there's always this gap between a fence post and the gate and it kills me.

614
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It kills me because you can walk through it even.

615
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:32.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So I can't have a complete fence and oh it's it's all I hate it so much.

616
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.800
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That, that would bother me.

617
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:40.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, it's really bad. I was building my house and I'm putting a fence around it and then I don't get it.

618
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There is a greenhouse like plant crop specialist person.

619
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>She's a researcher, I believe it is.

620
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And she, you can grow crops and fruit trees.

621
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There's not active, it's just you plant and you wait a while and they grow and you harvest them.

622
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:09.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So partially ornamental, but partially you get resources to cook food or whatever.

623
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, and, uh, yeah.

624
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You see, you get the, oh, character customization because there is a stylist.

625
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.400
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah. Yeah, I see that there's a lot of that, so I was wondering about that.

626
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, so you get different outfits.

627
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, you can buy different outfits from the stylist and the general shop or whatever.

628
01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And then you can get dyes.

629
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.199
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, you get dyes from different resources from different crops and things like that.

630
01:00:33.199 --> 01:00:37.599
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, and so then, you know, you get this wider range of outfits.

631
01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:41.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>they're just sets you don't unfortunately don't get to customize each like

632
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>mix and match it's just a pick and outfit and then you can color it whatever color dye you want

633
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Which is fun. I think the outfits look nice and having a company color variations is fun

634
01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.219
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>but You do oh you can actually customize the character

635
01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:02.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Like the the face and the body and the hair and all that stuff

636
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:09.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But the camera is usually so zoomed out like it doesn't feel like it makes much of a difference like it's hard to see your character

637
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>moments where like at the start or end of a run and combat you'll it'll zoom in a bit more you can see it a bit more

638
01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:22.239
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>but It feels like a little ways of potential that

639
01:01:23.199 --> 01:01:28.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Maybe this game would be better from a do better or feel better from a closer camera

640
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Because it's very zoomed out so you can see the whole town

641
01:01:32.239 --> 01:01:34.639
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Which is fun because you see all the robots running around

642
01:01:35.280 --> 01:02:11.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But you can't zoom into yourself So it just feels like you're not seeing your character And I don't call them bad it's the same thing, it's a fairly zoomed out camera. So yeah, the character customizations there just feels like it's it's not landing because just don't get to enjoy it really. Okay, so with that, okay, I think that roughly covers the town and customizations. So let's talk about the combat. The combat is hard. You

643
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.840
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay, you're using your wire still, okay.

644
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:34.360
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, that's probably the best thing. So yeah, it's two things. One, it's hard and it's kind of awkward. I say that because compared to other roguelike games, like Hades or cult of the lamb, it's a much slower pace of battle or the overall feel. Like in Hades and cult of lamb,

645
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.099
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

646
01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:31.099
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm.

647
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.639
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>you get a dash, a proper dash, you go from you know, one place to the other in a snap.

648
01:02:39.639 --> 01:02:41.980
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And this will game you get a role, which is...

649
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:59.059
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>maybe it's a taste thing, but I certainly don't enjoy it as much as the other games.

650
01:02:59.059 --> 01:03:05.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But they make up for that because you get the wire, the grappling hook, and you can use that on enemies.

651
01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's the timing is a little weird to get used to, but you can drag them into you.

652
01:03:12.199 --> 01:03:23.699
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Or you can even do this thing where if you have enough damage on an enemy, you can just grab them and just auto kill them, you just pull them apart, which is fun.

653
01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:29.900
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So, like, that wire thing, they're heading in the right direction, just needs a little more polish.

654
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:37.699
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And it also depends on the weapons you're using, because like I mentioned, there's, I think, like 10 different weapon types.

655
01:03:37.699 --> 01:03:40.619
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And they do play wildly differently.

656
01:03:40.619 --> 01:03:42.059
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Some feel a lot more better.

657
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.239
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They're suited to using the grappling hook than others.

658
01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:52.519
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Like the X is there's an X that is a big slow X.

659
01:03:52.519 --> 01:04:02.760
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And that one doesn't work as well with the wire because the wire is in a quick motion and then trying to fall over the big slow swing doesn't feel that successful most of the time.

660
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But say like your standard sword, sure you can pull them in and slice them up.

661
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That works fairly fine.

662
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There's not...

663
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Some of the weapon types are...

664
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'll give them a golf clap for trying something different.

665
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>There is a guitar as a weapon type,

666
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay. Okay.

667
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>and you can swing it around like an act kind of,

668
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>or you can do a charge attack, and then you do the slide.

669
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You know the guitar slide, and you're damaging enemies that way.

670
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>When I think it releases the sound waves then, which is a fun one.

671
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Um, yeah.

672
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That's something different, that's interesting.

673
01:04:42.500 --> 01:05:12.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>is different. They have, oh gosh, they have a chakra, I think it is called like a ring bladed ring that you throw around. That one's a fun one. I'm trying to remember what other ones are. There is a blaster gun like it's just a straight up gun. It's probably the best weapon in the game because one you do it from afar so you're very safe. But you I can also charge it up and just just

674
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:41.659
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>kill a lot of stuff just with the charge shots but yeah let's see there's claws that's a good one I'm trying to oh the board I forgot there's a surfboard that is a weapon too again you can kind of swing it around like you would with the board or if you do the charge attack you hop on it and you fly around on it just running everything over that's that's another fun

675
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh.

676
01:05:42.500 --> 01:06:12.219
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>that one felt pretty creative and I think probably one of my favorite weapon types but yeah they have a bunch of standard stuff spear cannon so on and so forth so you know they do play differently but it's still it's a lax little and I think the biggest problem is the upgrade system so roguelike games how the pattern works you start or run you you get a floor you

677
01:06:12.579 --> 01:06:42.400
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>the floor and then you get an upgrade at the end for your run the upgrades are not great they're they're pretty man the best you get like an attribute like electric or fire or ice or whatever even freeze or burn you know status effects but nothing is fundamentally changing your weapon playing your place out or anything call the lamb and Hades do that and they're very good at that where they can fund it.

678
01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:47.460
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's just incremental percentage increases.

679
01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:52.219
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>At the bare minimum, you feel very strong.

680
01:06:52.219 --> 01:06:55.300
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>If you go far in a run, you get a lot of upgrades.

681
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.739
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>In Hades or Kuralami, you feel crazy strongly.

682
01:06:58.739 --> 01:07:01.579
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You're just clearing stuff if things are going well.

683
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm

684
01:07:01.579 --> 01:07:03.460
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>This game, not the case.

685
01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:09.019
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You can stack up as many upgrades and it's just incremental percentage increases.

686
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.300
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm

687
01:07:09.019 --> 01:07:12.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>increases, um, you, you don't.

688
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:54.179
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>You don't ever get the feeling of, like, power that, that feels so cool in Hades or cult of the blam. Um, and so that, and that's, and that's coupled by the, the difficulty because, you know, the enemies do a lot of damage, actually. Um, it, it's very easy to die and lose, you know, your run and you have to start all over, which is frustrating when the upgrade to so poor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But this is again, why the villagers are probably the best feature in the game when you add them in because then you have two villagers who are decoys. Um, they're also damaging. And if you fall,

689
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.639
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Mm-hmm well, that's that's the rogue part of the

690
01:07:54.179 --> 01:08:04.659
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>they can resurrect you. Um, so yeah, that having the villagers fight with you, that's a good one. I wish I could upgrade them a bit more. There is a small upgrade system, but it's,

691
01:08:04.659 --> 01:08:09.900
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>it's just, I think numerical of anything. Um, I wish I could maybe customize them or something,

692
01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.460
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>to sadly, no, they're just they're

693
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:42.380
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>excellent decoy slash assists. But yeah, that's I think that roughly covers the combat. It's like it's it's good. It's not bad combat for the most part. But again, the bar is just very high and it's not not living up to it. Yeah, so that's I'm trying to think here for like

694
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Just got to put them out in the front lines for the fodder.

695
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:57.260
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>there's another element. I want to talk about it, but I nope, I lost it. But yeah, I think that roughly covers the game that they'll experience as a whole. Do you have any questions on all that? I know that was a lot kind of

696
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Okay.

697
01:08:57.859 --> 01:09:00.020
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>just word vomiting here. But um,

698
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.119
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>No, I think I was mostly interested, like this game looks like it's a lot.

699
01:09:05.119 --> 01:09:16.800
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, like it's a lot, it's got a lot going on, but it also still has like that bit of loneliness to it. And I was wondering if that was like affected by the little bots at all.

700
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Mm-hmm

701
01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.340
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

702
01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.600
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Which it sounds like it kind of is, but like not 100% you can play, this is just for the listeners,

703
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:29.920
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>you can play multiplayer. So you can have your friends come in and like help. So you can do that.

704
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:34.140
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yes, yeah, you know what, actually that's a good point as some they did want to bring up.

705
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.039
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That's cool.

706
01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:51.739
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think if the game is built for multiplayer, I haven't played with anyone, but like just based off the villagers, I bet it's a lot more fun to grab, you know, a couple of friends and play with them. Um, it feels like it's, it's geared towards that. If anyone wants to play, let me know.

707
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, so

708
01:09:51.739 --> 01:09:55.180
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh, oh, now I remember the other thing I wanted to talk about. Yes, the

709
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yay

710
01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:08.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So I played I got this on my switch. It's on switch. It's switch to I think on steam. I think the early access was on steam and in one point no drop with switch.

711
01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:15.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It does not run well on on switch loading times are brutal.

712
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Oh.

713
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:22.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Frame rate isn't the best. It's it's not great. I'm sure it's a lot better on switch too.

714
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.699
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'm sure it can be a lot better on Steve.

715
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:33.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's standard switch version, little technically rough, which is a shame considering everything.

716
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:41.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The loading times are the ones that kill me because when you lose the run and yet the weight and other, you know, 30 seconds or whatever to get back into town, it's not great.

717
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Not great.

718
01:10:43.000 --> 01:11:00.199
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So I guess the another thing I wanted to ask is so it sounds like this game fell a little far front like a little far from the mark like it it could have what one thing do you think would improve this game to like make it so that you would pick it up more.

719
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:30.420
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think the upgrade stuff I talked about fixing the upgrades making them either more or just more impactful generally speaking right because whether that's increasing like the actual power where you can actually feel it or changing the playstyle of your weapon um I think that would fix it because like even if the the town stuff it was still a little weak per se I think if the combat was fun.

720
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:50.819
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think the upgrade system is probably the most love for me to get out of it.

721
01:11:50.819 --> 01:11:55.260
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Or you know, I'll offer you one on the other side on the downside.

722
01:11:55.260 --> 01:12:00.619
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>If we got an actual museum to fill out, like I think that would be a lot more enticing to

723
01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:09.899
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>to go through stuff, but yeah, sadly, there is no, like the growth of the town is largely up to you.

724
01:12:09.899 --> 01:12:15.140
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>How much you want to fill out on craft or whatever, but no actual go-post from a museum.

725
01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.140
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I think that would help a lot.

726
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.920
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, I think that that would be the other thing because it is such a lonely game and you don't have those characters like

727
01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.140
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah.

728
01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.140
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah.

729
01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:26.140
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah.

730
01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:33.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Asking for you to do things kind of is just self-motivated, but I feel like there's there are definitely people who are the self-motivated type who want to collect everything who want to like

731
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:58.220
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, I, I guess if you look at the art, right? If you see that you see it's going to be robot heavy, like if, and it's rogue life, rogue like, I guess that's the more important part of the combat aspect, like it then ties to you. It's worth a shot. Like,

732
01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:40.600
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Do everything that you can so maybe so I guess like my last question would be who would you recommend this game for?

733
01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.100
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>It's not a terribly expensive game. It's only 20 USD.

734
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:09.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>They're actively working on it, so there still might be a future for this game.

735
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:16.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But I may be a little more time in the oven, and it'll be a definite thumbs up.

736
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:24.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But for now, it's just, I guess, mostly for a robot collector type person, a very specific or niche thing.

737
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But that's what suckered me like. Oh man, I could call it robots for my town.

738
01:13:28.500 --> 01:14:01.220
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>that part still on paper sounds cool and it kind of is to see the grown to town and run around but it's just so much of the stuff I have to get through like it's unfortunate it feels a little tedious at times like yeah yeah because yeah like the villagers they'll give you quite a solid time but they're from a handful of things either collect some fish collect some bugs maybe do a certain run and so on and so forth like it's just again not a lot of

739
01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:31.100
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>which is unfortunate oh I know what stopped me in this game I just remember there was a thing that stopped me I got a mission I can't remember if it was from villager or whatnot but it was to do a run without a single no not getting hit or like what's it yeah yeah not getting hit I know hit run and that was brutal I couldn't do it that's what killed it for me um take yeah take that one I don't like that there are no

740
01:14:31.659 --> 01:14:43.659
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>it runs hard um like maybe for post game or something but that's hard that's for the soaks on people

741
01:14:32.500 --> 01:15:04.180
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah Yeah, I mean they do it like my husband is playing still playing right now and he was talking about like sometimes he'll tell me about some of the stuff he's struggling with and I'm like babe I think that the people would just tell you that uh get good like I think that that's as hornet as hornet

742
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.220
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Uh, as, excuse me, as Hornet would say, "Get good!"

743
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.699
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>would say like you just need to get good

744
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.020
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah.

745
01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:21.500
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So, like, I, I, I look, I'll, of course there's all the memes in the fan art out on the internet, and everyone's about the saha, or whatever, but, um, but now the get good, that's the one, people aren't harping on that one enough, I love it.

746
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:32.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>because that's I mean that's the thing about that game is it's just like there's so much about it that's just you just gotta you just have to do with it.

747
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:46.439
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'm terrified of that game I have I have to I have to be hall and I that's a requirement from what I've read be not even lore wise just get to whoa that's the warm up for so

748
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.760
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughs]

749
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Yeah, it definitely, I mean, if you basically,

750
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.600
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I feel like if you don't like Hollow Knight,

751
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.899
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah, yeah, because what if it's hauling a barter?

752
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.619
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>It is. That's the tweet. Yeah.

753
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:12.579
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah Yeah, yeah, I think cherry like I love them and I hate them. They're sickos

754
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:23.199
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Cool. Well, I think, I think that about wraps up our discussion of linked banner of the spark.

755
01:16:23.199 --> 01:16:34.319
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So I see this thing in the outro. Al, I don't know what this means. Okay. Okay.

756
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

757
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Okay, I'll tell you I'll explain to you because it threw me off when I saw it

758
01:16:34.079 --> 01:16:43.520
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>He's look he's just changed it because not everyone wants to plug something right we don't have to tell them the handle It's just here's your moment to do something like

759
01:16:44.239 --> 01:16:46.239
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'm okay

760
01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Here, I'll take the lead because you know what's funny. I realized the other day. I have two

761
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Unfortunately, it's still on Twitter because there's people I talked to there. I have two Twitter handles

762
01:16:54.500 --> 01:17:00.659
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>mm-hmm. You okay? Uh-huh.

763
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.960
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Acupa press my personal and at spider squared my art account

764
01:17:01.439 --> 01:17:10.239
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Well, somehow I've it's become inverted where Acupa. I'm just seeing and just retweeting awesome Pokemon and Digimon fan artists and

765
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.979
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughter]

766
01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.399
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And sick art memes and soaksong and stuff like that

767
01:17:15.359 --> 01:17:21.680
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>And then somehow and the spider squared. That's why I see more personal stuff or opinions and whatnot that I retweet

768
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[coughing]

769
01:17:22.319 --> 01:17:24.880
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So, go to one of those for one of the other.

770
01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.920
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I don't know which one's which.

771
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.079

787
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.399

790
01:18:19.319 --> 01:18:20.159
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Is it Hornit?

01:18:20.079 --> 01:18:21.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>No, it's not.

792
01:18:21.079 --> 01:18:29.640

<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>and they're butts, look like little crowns.

796
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>10 out of 10 recommend looking at, yeah, look at them.

797
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.340
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>- What?

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.079
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>- I'm looking it up.

799
01:18:38.079 --> 01:18:39.359
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I'll put some in the slack.

801
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:59.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>But they're so that there's like the main sub family that looks like all of those, but there's this other sub family that doesn't have the same vibe as the others in the family, and I've never seen one of these, but I was going through my like tricky ID things that I've been putting off forever because I didn't want to do them.

802
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:10.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Um, and I found one of these and then I looked it up. I was like, Oh, it's this and then I looked it up. This thing has not been seen in the United States East of Kansas.

803
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh

<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So I have like a regional record. It has gone. So it is up in like, it is up in like K back. Um, and like Montreal and stuff like that, but it's not. It hasn't like jumped. No one's found it like over the lakes yet. Um, so I'm super excited about that. That's what I that's what I'm going to say to the audience.

805
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Wow That's wild

806
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah

807
01:19:30.279 --> 01:19:35.039
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That's that's cool. That's pretty cool, but all like

808
01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:40.399
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>But also like what I love bugs but was that why why why?

809
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.539
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Okay, here's the other thing.

810
01:19:41.279 --> 01:19:44.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Those are the one like oh no, stay

811
01:19:44.539 --> 01:19:46.439
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>The wasps that everyone thinks of.

812
01:19:46.439 --> 01:19:47.439
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Like when you think of wasps,

813
01:19:47.439 --> 01:19:50.600
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>you think of like yellow jackets and hornets that are gonna like sting you, right?

814
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:50.840
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yes.

815
01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.319
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That is one family of wasps,

816
01:19:54.319 --> 01:19:56.720
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but there are so many other wasps.

817
01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.239
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>And even those wasps are actually really hecking cool.

818
01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:05.319
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>It's just that they tend to put their nests in places that are inconvenient to us.

819
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:11.939
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yes, like my truck, yes, many times in the truck, I had to fight him off.

820
01:20:05.319 --> 01:20:07.579
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>[laughing]

821
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.600
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>So I'm all for, I'm all for like if you,

822
01:20:16.399 --> 01:20:21.399
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>if you have this like these in an inconvenient place,

823
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.359
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>remove them.

824
01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:28.199
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>But if you, if they're like at the end of your yard and you never go over there, just let them live,

825
01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:30.079
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>like they actually are really good at,

826
01:20:30.079 --> 01:20:33.479
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>like yellow jackets and hornets eat your garden pests.

827
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:45.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Yeah, yeah, I know that I appreciate them, but these jewel bugs are wasp that there's some that are iridescent.

828
01:20:37.359 --> 01:20:41.000
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>but there's a bunch of other super, super cool bugs.

829
01:20:41.399 --> 01:20:50.920
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I mean, they look like little jewels and they're so cute.

830
01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.180
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That that looks painted. I'm looking at one

831
01:20:53.399 --> 01:20:59.640
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>Yeah, and looking at one other microscope is just so pretty and they they have a lot of like little divots in their.

832
01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:11.039
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>I'm trying to think of the in their skin. I'm trying to think of like the non scientific way to say it, but in that. On their outside, they have like all these little divots and it looks like.

833
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.520
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Ha ha ha ha ha, the normie word.

834
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:20.159
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>like a jewel could like literally fit in there. It's like they are the crown, but they are also the jewel, but you could like socket a jewel right into them. They're so cool.

835
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.600
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That sounds like a silk song design.

836
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.239
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>That is what I wanted to say to the audience.

837
01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.359
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>[laughs]

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So here as to whether Digimon does bugs good or not well that depends

905
01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.800
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Because you see the Digimon philosophy is as they get bigger or higher level

906
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:49.340
<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>- Mm-hmm.

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The question I think will set the tone here.

910
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>I'm posting the image on the slat and that thread.

<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>it. Oh, I see it at the end of the abdomen where the where the where the where the go-nads would be, you know what? It tracks. So some laws of fun fact, some off males when they mate with a female they actually put in what's called a

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>That is Mothmon.

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>He looks kind of like a little sentai guy.

915
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>He has the moth wings.

<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>On the thorax or not, that's the wrong one.

917
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>The end of admin.

920
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>So there you go. That's the Digimon philosophy.

921
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>[Laughter]

<v 1E8585E7-8BC4-4931-A652-EE8BA020278D>her plug. So they put in something so that she literally cannot make another male. And it kind of like some of the project tylenus of it is like a gun. So this tracks the tracks.

923
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:41.619
<v 41E583B7-DAE9-4661-B8CE-A9CBF57B6676>Oh, I've heard of those things. That's, oh, that's why. Oh.
