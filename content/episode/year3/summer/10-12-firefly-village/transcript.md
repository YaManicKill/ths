(37s) **Al:**

> And we are here today to talk about cottagecore games.

(40s) **Aislinn:**

> Whoo!

(43s) **Al:**

> Hello, Azeland. It's been a while. How are you?

(45s) **Aislinn:**

> I am good.

(46s)

> I am happy to be sitting.

(50s)

> I've been running around like a lot as of recently.

(56s)

> So I'm very happy to be sitting.

(58s)

> And yeah, I'm good.

(1m)

> I'm good, I'm good.

(1m 2s) **Al:**

> Cool. I am also good. I don't tend to run around, but I do tend to be busy. My kids are now in bed, so this is the best time of the day.

(1m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> Wonderful, perfect. This is peak sitting right now.

(1m 17s) **Al:**

> Yes, I've you I haven't finished listening to your latest podcast episode and I remember at the beginning you mentioned you can have alluded to K-pop demon hunters. I presume you don't talk about that later on in the episode.

(1m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> No, I know, I do not. I do not.

(1m 33s) **Al:**

> No, but you have presumably seen the film. Yes, so the I'm thinking of when they're walking back to their their lounge after their show at the beginning and just chanting couch. That is that is how I feel many evenings.

(1m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> I have. I have watched it once, and I did enjoy it.

(1m 49s)

> that is what I crave desperately right now in life. I crave couch and then just the immediate

(2m 2s)

> just cut to and we're debuting a new single is just how I feel.

(2m 5s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yes. There is no rest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

(2m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> Illusion is the illusion of the couch.

(2m 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah. So we are not here to talk about K-pop demon hunters. Although maybe, but who knows?

(2m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> if it comes up you know who knows oh my gosh yeah you've definitely seen it

(2m 24s) **Al:**

> We'll see. I've seen it more than you though. Apparently, I've seen it three times now.

(2m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> more than me

(2m 33s) **Al:**

> One of my top films of the year.

(2m 34s) **Aislinn:**

> wow that's crazy

(2m 36s) **Al:**

> So, I know, right?

(2m 39s)

> Like imagine, I often think about how I think teenage me would hate adult me.

(2m 49s)

> You go back and tell like 15 year old me that one year his, I mean, first of all,

(2m 54s)

> he'd say, what is K-pop?

(2m 56s)

> But guess that like, you know, well, yeah, it wasn't really, I think I was aware of it.

(3m 1s)

> You know, when I was 15, was that 20 years ago?

(3m 5s)

> But if you, if you went back 20 years ago and told me that in 20 years,

(3m 11s)

> your favorite, one of your favorite films of the year will be a, uh, uh, but a K-pop band.

(3m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> That's just how it would be with K-pop, you know?

(3m 18s) **Al:**

> Uh, he would be very confused and very disappointed in what I became.

(3m 24s)

> But, uh, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, uh, where was I?

(3m 31s)

> Yes, we're- we are instead here to talk about Coach Gorgames.

(3m 35s)

> The main topic this episode is Firefly Village, which we will get onto.

(3m 40s)

> Before that, we have a bunch of news.

(3m 42s)

> But first of all, Aislyn, what have you been up to?

(3m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> I have been up to a lot of working, that's nothing new.

(3m 52s)

> I just finished the post game or specifically the looker stuff and Pokemon X, and that

(3m 59s)

> is better than the entirety of Pokemon X.

(4m 4s)

> In my opinion, I loved, I loved the looker storyline and everything.

(4m 5s) **Al:**

> Wow. Oh man.

(4m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> But other words...

(4m 15s)

> I've been still working through Persona 3 reload, and I've been watching one of my friends while I wander stop for the first time.

(4m 23s) **Al:**

> Hmm.

(4m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> So in a way, I'm kind of replying the game.

(4m 26s)

> So that's been really, really nice because I gifted her.

(4m 29s)

> I was like, it was on her wishlist for a while and I was like, "You need to play this game."

(4m 34s)

> And we were in a call and I was like, "You know what? You need to play this game.

(4m 39s)

> I'm going to give you the game."

(4m 40s)

> And then during one of our gaming sessions, you're going to play the game and I'm going to watch.

(4m 43s)

> And that's what we're doing now.

(4m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah, the, one to stop is definitely on my list of games I'm going to play before the end of the year,

(4m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> Because I just love the game.

(4m 52s) **Al:**

> especially when I find out how short it is. I'm like, oh yes, I definitely like, when I see a game that is,

(5m)

> people really like and is a game that I think I'll like, and you can complete it in 10 hours,

(5m 6s)

> that sounds perfect to me. So, you know, that's like, that's like a week of playing a game for me,

(5m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> - Yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely a bite-sized game,

(5m 13s) **Al:**

> like, some other games we might be talking about later this episode.

(5m 15s) **Aislinn:**

> which is really nice.

(5m 19s)

> - True, I think.

(5m 23s)

> - Spoiler.

(5m 24s)

[laughing]

(5m 25s) **Al:**

> Um, the other, my other question for you is persona. Is this your first persona game?

(5m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> - That don't make sense later.

(5m 32s) **Al:**

> Of you played others, right? Okay. Would I like a persona game?

(5m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> - Yes, Persona 3 Reload is my first Persona game.

(5m 38s)

> Oh. I...

(5m 40s)

> Um... Yeah.

(5m 40s) **Al:**

> I know they're not short, right? So I know that I know that

(5m 43s)

> about them, it's not like I only play short games. I do play longer games. I have

(5m 48s)

> put, you know, Pokemon Viola, I currently have like 350 hours in, right? So I, you know,

(5m 54s)

> and I put like 150 hours into tears of the kingdom in the first month, right? So like I am open

(6m 1s)

> to games where I put in, you know, over 100 hours. I am aware that that is a thing that

(6m 7s)

> would probably have to happen if I was to get the full experience of this game. But is I don't

(6m 13s)

> know, if persona games are the sort of games I would like or not. Ooh, my favorite parts

(6m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> What is this going to be a very odd question, but what are your favorite parts of Pokemon like Pokemon games?

(6m 26s) **Al:**

> of Pokemon games would be the collecting of the Pokemon. Yeah.

(6m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, because I'm like, if it's the, if you don't mind or you enjoy like the grinding to an

(6m 42s)

> extent, I think you would enjoy persona. If you don't like a grindy experience, I might be just a

(6m 51s)

> little bit hesitant, but the dialogue and the story. And again, to be fair, this is A, I have a

(6m 58s)

> for a rich persona 3.

(7m)

> It's my first persona game, so I don't know if this carries over the English.

(7m 7s)

> Carries over to other persona games, but it's very dialogue/story heavy.

(7m 15s)

> And you do just kind of like a lot of repetitive tasks in a way to get more dialogue

(7m 15s) **Al:**

> So I guess one thing to talk about is do I like grinding? Do I like doing repetitive tasks

(7m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> and get to know the characters, and then you grind up and level up your characters

(7m 28s)

> is to do like boss battles and stuff.

(7m 42s) **Al:**

> four hours to get to an end.

(7m 45s)

> Well, what games do we talk about on this podcast?

(7m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> I was going to say, with that said, with all of the farming games that are very repetitive...

(7m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I don't I feel like grinding is not and I'm not the biggest fan of grinding in

(8m 7s)

> Pokemon games, but I think it's because of the type of game it is. I prefer to do the collecting

(8m 13s)

> and get through the story.

(8m 15s)

> And then, well, as Kevin said, I do shiny hunt.

(8m 18s)

> So let's not pretend like I don't do grinding.

(8m 20s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(8m 23s) **Al:**

> But I think if I expect that going into a game that

(8m 28s)

> is a different thing, right, I wouldn't want grinding

(8m 31s)

> in a Mario Kart game, for example.

(8m 34s)

> Because I'd be like, this is not--

(8m 34s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Well, obviously, you don't want to grind the rails in the new Mario Kart.

(8m 35s) **Al:**

> I'm not here for grinding.

(8m 36s)

> Well, I don't think you grind on rails, hey, hey.

(8m 40s)

> But I don't want to have to play the same course 100 times

(8m 46s)

> that's-- I'm here to play the courses until I've gotten first

(8m 51s)

> in all of them, and then I move on to the next.

(8m 53s)

> I'm here for that fun.

(8m 55s)

> But do I have in other games and enjoy those games?

(8m 59s)

> Absolutely.

(9m)

> I think until maybe a month ago, I would have

(9m 5s)

> said, I'm not a big fan of dialogue heavy games.

(9m 8s)

> However, story season's grand bazaar changed me on that.

(9m 12s)

> in the, um, I presume you've not heard the episode on Gram.

(9m 15s)

> One of the things I really like about how they did dialogue in that game is, uh, one,

(9m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> No, I have not been able to listen to it yet.

(9m 23s) **Al:**

> it has, uh, not full voice acting, but all the dialogue that matters, like all the story-based

(9m 29s)

> stuff has, has full voice acting. Um, but also the conversations you can set to auto advance.

(9m 38s)

> So what I was doing, because part of my problem is I, I will sit with a game and I'll be like,

(9m 43s)

> you know, I'll just, I'll, I'll be playing and it'll come to,

(9m 45s)

> a dialogue bit and I'll just like mash through the dialogue. And it's not, I don't want to hear the dialogue. It's that when I'm not a big reading fan, right? Like I just not super fun. I don't enjoy looking at text. I'm reading it. Ironic that I am a software developer and that entire job is text based, but I don't enjoy.

(9m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(10m 4s)

> You could burn down you know you don't want to keep reading during your off time

(10m 6s) **Al:**

> Maybe that's, maybe that's the reason. Maybe it's, you know, and it's why I'm not a huge book reader. I just don't like looking at text and trying to figure out what it is.

(10m 16s)

> So that I think as part of it, but also like my hands sometimes just need something to do and I struggle to hold a console or a controller and not press buttons on it, right? And you're sitting there for ages, reading text, not pressing buttons. That's not how, that's not how games work. Games work when you press buttons. So why did with story season's grounds bizarre is that when the dialogue came on, I pressed the also thing turned up the volume and put the switch down and took my hands away and played with a fiddle toy or something.

(10m 45s)

> Um, which is what I'm doing just now, I'm playing with a fiddle toy. So I don't do other things. Um, and that I actually enjoyed the story and the dialogue from the characters much more being able to sit there fiddle and hear the story rather than having to read and wait and press about it at the right time. The other thing is like obviously quite often, uh, text will be really slow and you have to press to speed it up, but the problem is if you press too quickly, you then advance to the next.

(11m 15s)

> Part of the text and you've missed the previous text. Um, and that's a big problem I have in Pokemon games all the time, right? It's like trying to advance the text, but not skip the text. Um, so being able to do that and like actually just slowing down that part of the game and forcing me to have my hands not on the switch meant that I enjoyed that a lot more. So I know persona three is not I suspect persona three being how old it is. We'll not have fill vice acting. Um,

(11m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(11m 21s)

> Oh my god, yeah

(11m 45s)

> No, it does, for the most part, it does.

(11m 45s) **Al:**

> Oh, he does. Oh, really interesting. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

(11m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> It has a lot of voice acting.

(11m 50s)

> It has a couple cut scenes.

(11m 53s)

> There is, it's definitely still text dialogue,

(11m 57s)

> relatively heavy, but there is a good amount of voice acting.

(12m 2s)

> So I think it's something to consider.

(12m 4s)

> I think it's worth giving a shot.

(12m 6s)

> I have been really enjoying it,

(12m 7s)

> but I also like reading, but there is still voice acting,

(12m 11s)

> but I also have it, I'm playing it in Japanese voice acting,

(12m 15s)

> just prefer to play a game from like in the native region

(12m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I'm a big, I'm a big, uh, a dub guy, uh, not because not because I,

(12m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> where the game came from in their language.

(12m 23s)

> So I'm just reading it all.

(12m 29s) **Al:**

> like I totally, because I'm one of these people that people hate who I watch the dub of squid game.

(12m 35s)

> Um, and, uh, I know that people really hate that. And yes, when you have a dub quite often,

(12m 42s)

> especially when it's a Japanese to English dub, quite often the, uh, speech can be a bit weird

(12m 49s)

> not been like translated into a natural way of speaking. And so some of it can be a bit jilted

(12m 55s)

> and I get that. I, I just, and it's not that I don't like, it's not that I hate reading subtitles

(13m 1s)

> because I watch everything with subtitles, um, because I find it helpful to like back up where I

(13m 7s)

> was here and go, yes, that's what I heard. That's fine. Let's continue. It's that I, I don't like

(13m 13s)

> how I can't look away from the screen at any time or you miss stuff. When you are listening,

(13m 19s)

> to something in English and you've got subtitles, it's like you've got two ways of getting the

(13m 23s)

> information in, um, which as people will tell you all the time is the best way to take information in

(13m 28s)

> is with multiple ways, right? Listening and reading at the same time is a, is a, you take in much more

(13m 34s)

> that way. Um, but also it means that like if I'm playing game or I'm doing, I can like look somewhere

(13m 41s)

> else and I don't miss a sentence, right? Whereas if you're, if you're listening in a, in Japanese or

(13m 47s)

> or whatever, you just can't.

(13m 49s)

> Because I watch Pokemon in Japanese, but that's because I'm too lazy to wait for the dub to come out, because it's so late, and so I watch fan translations of the the Pokemon anime, but like that's one 20 minute episode a week, right?

(14m 6s)

> It's a whole different thing.

(14m 6s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, that's, that's, that's, yeah.

(14m 9s) **Al:**

> And also it's Pokemon, it doesn't really, the story doesn't hugely matter if you miss a sentence, you still get the idea of it, whereas with squid game in particular, if you miss one sentence, you could miss a huge twist.

(14m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> And also true.

(14m 19s) **Al:**

> Right, like there was a lot of things happening. So that's why I generally watch dubs, even though some of the voice acting is not the best.

(14m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(14m 28s)

> Yeah, I will say I am a dub hater for myself and only myself.

(14m 35s)

> I, anyone else that listens or watches anything with that's like dubbed.

(14m 41s)

> It's fine. It's not affecting me. It's just a personal preference. I'm just like, no.

(14m 42s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(14m 43s)

> Yeah, yeah.

(14m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm like, you know, I'm a subtitle elitist for myself and only myself.

(14m 46s) **Al:**

> That's fair, yeah.

(14m 52s) **Aislinn:**

> Because again, I'm like, it doesn't, it doesn't matter. And I agree with you that being able

(14m 56s)

> I was able to listen to it in English.

(14m 58s)

> And also have subtitles does allow you to take in the information better, so if I did the same thing, I probably would take in the information better.

(15m 6s)

> But I just, I just definitely have this preference towards, again, just listening to something in the language that it was made in.

(15m 14s)

> Whether it be a movie, a show, a game, whatever it may be, but with that said, I will say I have heard very, very, very good things about specifically the personas areas and their English translations,

(15m 28s)

> in acting, I've heard it's really, really, really good.

(15m 32s) **Al:**

> It definitely depends on whether it's done right or not because I've only seen one of the studio Ghibli films

(15m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> So, yeah.

(15m 39s) **Al:**

> It was the newest one the boy in the head and but it was it had excellent voice acting in English

(15m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(15m 45s)

> Yeah

(15m 45s) **Al:**

> And and I've heard that generally their films are very good with the dubs

(15m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, they have they get like some big time like American or not always American, but like big time like actress

(15m 55s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, they had they had Robert Robert Patterson was in the in the boy in the head and like yeah, they do but yeah

(15m 58s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(16m 2s) **Al:**

> Absolutely

(16m 3s)

> Depends on how much effort they've put in and it's just sometimes a lot of them

(16m 7s)

> Especially Netflix ones do tend to be like it was somebody in a box reading

(16m 13s) **Aislinn:**

[laughs]

(16m 14s) **Al:**

> Like an automatic translation of what was said and they like have weird

(16m 20s)

> Intonation of words and you're just like that's not how people talk. Why are you saying it like that?

(16m 22s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(16m 25s) **Al:**

> So yeah, it definitely massively depends so I can see how

(16m 32s)

> I think if it's I can see how games would be better than film and TV because I think you

(16m 41s)

> How do I

(16m 43s) **Aislinn:**

> I feel like you have the budget for it, first of all.

(16m 44s) **Al:**

> That is a that is part especially the big ones, right?

(16m 48s)

> But I think you know like for example the

(16m 53s)

> You know the Zelda ones to use the kingdom and breath of the world had pretty good voice acting

(16m 59s)

> Yeah, I know some people found Zelda annoying

(17m 2s)

> that's not an issue with voice acting. That's just it was an a posh English accent. That was the issue, you know, no matter who is you're going to be annoyed by a posh English accent, same.

(17m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> Fair enough.

(17m 18s) **Al:**

> I think that people if you're putting in the effort to be voice acting in a game, you care about the voice acting. If you're not putting if you don't care about voice acting, you're probably not putting it in the game at all.

(17m 26s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(17m 32s) **Al:**

> Whereas you can't do a film without words. Well, I mean, you can, but people don't want that now, right? So it's easier to not care as much about the effort of a dub when you're making a film because you care about the original or whatever, and not necessarily. And it's different people doing the translation and the dubbing. It's not the original creators.

(17m 37s) **Aislinn:**

> Well, I was gonna say you can, but...

(17m 59s) **Al:**

> So the effort isn't necessarily there.

(18m 2s)

> There is much.

(18m 2s) **Aislinn:**

> I will say I'm not I'm not confident in this, but I do wonder to bring it back to K-pop demon Hunter.

(18m 4s) **Al:**

> So.

(18m 11s) **Aislinn:**

> I will say I do wonder how these dubs for the other languages are if they also sound like it's in a box. So that's all my list of things to look up later.

(18m 21s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(18m 23s)

> With that so yeah, because it was Sony but Sony are

(18m 28s)

> They're a South Korean company aren't they Sony

(18m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> That is a great question. I have no idea

(18m 35s) **Al:**

> No, Sony and American apparently I thought Sony were South Korean that American interesting, okay, my bad

(18m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> I was gonna it's a

(18m 40s)

> If you want to know it's it's Japanese

(18m 44s) **Al:**

> Wait, really oh, yeah, yeah, I'm mistreating this thing Sony

(18m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> My reliable source Wikipedia tells me

(18m 49s) **Al:**

> And sorry, interactive entries.

(18m 51s)

> Entertainment LLC is an American video game in digital age and to date company, all of Japanese

(18m 55s)

> conglomerate Sony Group Corporation.

(18m 57s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(18m 57s) **Al:**

> So they're Japanese.

(18m 58s)

> Okay.

(18m 59s)

> There was this, but what is there, where did their animation happen, Sony animation?

(19m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> I think it was because it was Korean Americans that made K-pop demon hunters, I want to say.

(19m 9s)

> So it's an American branch of Sony, worked on by Koreans and Korean Americans question mark.

(19m 14s) **Al:**

> So Sony Sony Sony so any Sony pictures animation is American American some situation owned by Sony based in Los Angeles

(19m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> This is all big question marks.

(19m 25s) **Al:**

> I guess not that surprising

(19m 28s)

> But yeah, no, I'm I'm aware that the

(19m 31s)

> Singers and music was written by Korean Americans. Yeah, but I guess

(19m 37s)

> What was my point?

(19m 39s)

> It's not as simple as going. It's an American thing

(19m 42s)

> What is it sound like in other language?

(19m 44s)

> which is because it's it's both and but also I was making that assumption based on Sony being South Korean not being Japanese, which is very different

(19m 56s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm glad we, I'm glad we figured that out.

(19m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah, okay. I don't know what we figured out. We figured something out

(20m 3s) **Aislinn:**

(21m 40s) **Al:**

> Fast within this speed limit. You can be you can be fast while also driving legally. Thank you.

(21m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> True, you could be slow while also driving legally. So you, you make a good point.

(21m 53s) **Al:**

(22m 55s) **Aislinn:**

> It's crazy yeah, he's like significantly better than me and maybe even better than my husband. I don't know

(23m 4s) **Al:**

> I think these things are very much about how early you start doing these things right because I've seen a lot of people who grew up with 3D platformers, not understand and know how to use 2D platformers, which is very interesting.

(23m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> That's crazy

(23m 18s)

> is interesting, it makes sense though, because I do struggle with 3D platformers because

(23m 22s)

> of just like the depth of fields, but 2D platforms is generally easier for me, but I also

(23m 27s)

> grew up probably with more 2D platformers versus 3D.

(23m 30s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(23m 32s)

> When I was I grew up playing basically both at the same time because I grew up playing Sonic

> If any game is is gonna mess with your field of vision it's Crash Bandicoot

(23m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> I only have like the Vegas memory.

(27m 43s)

> Can you tell I've never played any of these games?

(27m 43s) **Al:**

(27m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> they look completely different.

(27m 56s) **Al:**

> They are I

(27m 58s) **Aislinn:**

> I can tell.

(27m 59s) **Al:**

> Guess it could be that it might I mean my assumption immediate was like items

(28m 5s)

> Cosmetics and stuff

(28m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> You're telling me these cute cows are not going to be in Guardians of Azuma?

(28m 13s) **Al:**

> Look, I mean if there's anything that would improve room factory game. It's a more whimsy

(28m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, it's very like, it takes itself, it feels like it takes itself very seriously.

(28m 24s) **Al:**

> It's gotten more it's got yeah, it's it's gotten more like that over time because room factory originally was just

(28m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> And I'm like, "Are we just farming?"

(28m 31s) **Al:**

> Harvestman, but also combat

(28m 34s)

> But it's gotten it's gotten more gritty and more serious

(28m 38s)

> It's the

(28m 41s)

> Zack Snyder

(28m 43s) **Aislinn:**

> I love that, love that comparison.

(28m 48s)

> I like the, I, when I, because I, again, I've never played this game before.

(28m 51s)

> I, seeing the fact that it's like combat, but it's also a farming game.

(28m 55s)

> I was like, oh, this is interesting.

(28m 56s)

> But it did feel like it was taking itself a little bit too seriously.

(28m 59s)

> And I was like, we need a little bit of like, ha, ha funny, like cute whimsy,

(29m 2s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, in four, the, when you were carrying like a stack of

(29m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> somewhere in there.

(29m 4s)

> And I'm like, I don't know if I'm getting that.

(29m 6s)

> That guy just said in the trailer, lovely weather we're having.

(29m 8s)

> I need a little more.

(29m 16s) **Al:**

> turnips or wherever, you would literally see the stack above your head. So it did have some

(29m 21s)

> silliness like that, but they've kind of, I don't think they had that in five. I don't remember

(29m 25s)

> them having that in five. So they're kind of like, yeah, they removed some of the whimsy and kind

(29m 31s)

> kind of gone more.

(29m 32s)

> So I think as they're leveling up and go I a lot of that happened when they moved made the move to like 3d relevant 2d.

(29m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm. Maybe I'll check on an older, older one.

(29m 45s) **Al:**

> I don't like them but maybe you will.

(29m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh.

(29m 50s)

> It might be worth the shot.

(29m 51s) **Al:**

> Some people I mean lots of people do.

(29m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> They keep making them for a reason.

(29m 55s) **Al:**

> Lots of people that you can go back and listen to our Run Factory 4S episode if you want.

(29m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> You know what? I will. I will do that.

(30m 2s)

> Ah, that's my list.

(30m 3s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(30m 5s)

> Never ending list.

(30m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> Literally.

(30m 9s) **Al:**

> Next we have a discountee update. This is the deep pockets update.

(30m 13s)

> It is coming soon. Although the beta for it is out now if you want to subscribe to the

(30m 18s)

> beta channel on Steam. You can add a basement to your shop. They call it they say dig a basement.

(30m 25s)

> You need more space and can't expand outwards. What but straight down this update adds a new

(30m 30s)

> a new quest line that sees you expanding this guarantee once again.

(30m 32s)

> But as you've known out there and nothing in blum-kest, blum-kest, blum-kest comes easy and there might be some other people in town who take an unexpected interest in your new basement project.

(30m 42s)

> I really hope this is like that tunnel girl on TikTok. Do you remember that?

(30m 47s)

> Were you aware of that? Are you not aware of this? There was this, there was this, there was this woman on TikTok who was referred to as "Turno Girl" and she was building a tunnel under her house.

(30m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> What what I'm not on tick-nock first of all tunnel girl on tick-tock

(31m 2s) **Al:**

> But she just lived in like a suburb, right? So she was like essentially digging like underneath her neighbor's houses.

(31m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh... Oh my god. Oh...

(31m 12s) **Al:**

> And she had no like permission to do this. She didn't have like a parameter or anything. And it was just this wild like couple of weeks where she was digging this massive tunnel under her house before the local government sure died.

(31m 26s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing it on on YouTube. I'm seeing it via Reddit because again, I don't have tik-tok

(31m 34s)

> Oh my god, this is this is new. This is new information to me. This is this is white. What why?

(31m 44s) **Al:**

> It looks like she did eventually manage to get approval for the tunnel and she got a proper

(31m 48s)

> permit and is doing the tunnel the proper way. But yeah, she got a mandatory evacuate and no,

(31m 52s) **Aislinn:**

> As long as it's not under other people's houses, sure!

(31m 58s) **Al:**

> that was a mandatory evaluation. I remember mess read that, I mean. But yeah, she got to, it was

(32m 2s)

> December last year that she was told to stop constructing and they would evaluate it and then

(32m 9s)

> She would get there. Permit. It's just...

(32m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> This is crazy.

(32m 14s) **Al:**

> It's mad that you just start doing that without checking if you should or not.

(32m 20s)

> Like, and I'm not saying that people don't, you know, it does look like she knew, or she learned enough to know what she was doing.

(32m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> She was crushing it, she was doing great for what I saw.

(32m 32s) **Al:**

> Apparently so, and apparently it was fine. It's just like, we have a, you know, system to make sure that people know where they're doing, and she wasn't following that, so yeah.

(32m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(32m 43s)

> Man imagine I'm just reflecting back on like when I lived with my parents in the town that would grew up in it

(32m 51s)

> Was like an incorporated village type of thing and they'd like told you like you have to like you have to like mow your grass

(32m 56s)

> In order to keep up with like the the the the rules of the town

(33m)

> I guess or whatever, but one of my neighbors he installed like a curb in front of his house and he got in trouble for that

(33m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I've heard people complain about being told off for the

(33m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> So if you got a drink.

(33m 11s)

> Just for installing a curb in front of his house. Imagine the trouble that you could get in trouble for.

(33m 20s) **Al:**

> grass being the wrong length and stuff like that. And she managed to go months of digging a tunnel

(33m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(33m 26s) **Al:**

> under her ass. Anyway, so I hope this storyline includes something about that. That would be really

(33m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> The duality of man.

(33m 32s)

> Crazy.

(33m 37s) **Al:**

> funny. Uh, uh,

(33m 39s)

> they also got upgrades to your shop. Um,

(33m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> and give us tunnel girl.

(33m 46s) **Al:**

> their little up your shop. They've got new items to the reward shop. Um,

(33m 51s)

> they've got, um, new, uh, decorations for the outside of your shop. Um,

(33m 59s)

> and obviously quality of life and bug fixes discount. He's definitely on my list of,

(34m 3s)

> I want to play it at some point, uh, but I haven't done yet.

(34m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> let me know how it is when you do because I like watched I watched a streamer

(34m 12s)

> play it for like a little bit and I just wasn't sure if I liked it or not so to get like a full

(34m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it has a thousand, a thousand mostly positive reviews.

(34m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> in-depth analysis rather than like having to like watch the full game would be nice so

(34m 22s)

> because it looks really cute it looks very very cute and I think yeah so it's got to be decent

(34m 31s)

> and I like the undertone that they have had with the game where it's like

(34m 37s)

> description of the game selling more frozen fries will surely heal this broken community dot

(34m 42s)

> dot dot right so I like that like undertone of like there is more to this game than you

(34m 49s)

> you perceive kind of like wanders stop it's like wandershop you think it's just a cozy

(34m 54s)

> team making game and it's like nope it's way more than that buckle in

(34m 57s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The, um, how long to beat for discount he's giving 16 and a half hours for the main story 20 hours for completionist. So that's definitely, uh, that's, that's pretty good. Pretty good length.

(35m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> That's not bad.

(35m 11s) **Al:**

> That's, uh, a week if I'm in the mood for it two weeks if I'm going casually.

(35m 18s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I would I would say something

(35m 19s) **Al:**

> Um, okay. Next, we got a couple of other pieces of news. First stop, um, concerned eight has said.

(35m 27s)

> That's, that's, that's, that's all the news about that. Uh, we are definitely at the point of over analyzing concerned eight tweets.

(35m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> yep yep why why I just I just want to know why I thought we were done after 1.6 and we were

(35m 44s) **Al:**

> No. No. What happened is, what happened is he had ideas. So, well, so you, you, you obviously

(35m 44s) **Aislinn:**

> going to focus and lock in on haunted chocolate here what happened what I mean I know he said

(35m 50s)

> in one of those interviews but uh give us haunted chocolates here

(35m 58s) **Al:**

> hadn't had the news in the previous podcast, which is where we pointed out that he says that

(36m 5s)

> he is not really doing the work on this, but he's the ideas and helping move it forward rather

(36m 14s)

> implementing it. His team is big enough now, and he trusts them enough that he can like get

(36m 18s)

> them to do most of the work. And he's doing basically all the chocolate, the chocolate to taunt

(36m 25s)

> dear, uh, onto his chocolate here, uh, instead. So he says it shouldn't delay haunted chocolate

(36m 27s) **Aislinn:**

[laughs]

(36m 32s) **Al:**

> here much. That's what he's saying. So it sounds like he's got a much more sensible, uh,

(36m 34s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, okay. All right, I'll take it. Yeah, I am very...

(36m 39s) **Al:**

> Stardew Valley balance, if you

(36m 42s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, all right, we'll take that. We'll take them. I definitely miss the news. I'm very back

(36m 45s) **Al:**

> I mean, we're I mean, let's not pretend like we're

(36m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> loyalty podcast. So this all, this all tracks, this all makes sense.

(36m 52s) **Al:**

> getting it before I try to be. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, look, I

(37m 2s)

> wouldn't it's it's always it's hard to

(37m 4s)

> predict these things, but if you gave me an

(37m 6s)

> over under 2030, I would struggle to decide which one I

(37m 10s)

> I was going for at this point.

(37m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, you know, I might, I might agree. Maybe I'll just lock in just 20-30s, call it a day.

(37m 20s) **Al:**

> I think I would do the under on 2030, but I wouldn't do the under on 2028.

(37m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> Maybe that's the way to go. How much longer?

(37m 28s)

> So 20-29.

(37m 30s) **Al:**

> I think 2028/29 is probably what I would be expecting at this point, but I think three years

(37m 37s)

> ago I probably said 2026, so who even knows who even knows when did this game get announced?

(37m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> So here we are.

(37m 43s)

> I don't even know, it's, I feel like I've just heard about it for forever.

(37m 52s) **Al:**

> in 2021.

(37m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Ooh, it hurts.

(37m 57s)

> I understand.

(37m 58s)

> But, oh, it hurts.

(38m) **Al:**

> on my bad nor it was 2020 began working on it October 2021 was when he announced it. So we are coming

(38m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay. Okay, all right. So maybe, you know, 2028 is sounding pretty good.

(38m 14s)

> 2020, I feel like eight years is sounding pretty...

(38m 24s)

> that what it was really.

(38m 27s)

> But he's got the game development cycle down, you know?

(38m 30s)

> He knows how to expedite the process a little bit here

(38m 34s)

> and there, but then also I'm sure he's including

(38m 36s)

> like a lot more depth to this game.

(38m 39s)

> Not that started doesn't already have that,

(38m 41s)

> but hopefully those two like balance each other out.

(38m 43s)

> So it's like the eight year mark, 2028.

(38m 45s) **Al:**

> My bad. It looks like

(38m 52s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, well, bye.

(38m 54s)

> Thank you.

(38m 55s) **Al:**

> five years. Wait, when was it released? He started working on it in 2011 and it was released

(39m 3s)

> in 2016, so that's five years. But you're probably right, it probably is like a lot of the things

(39m 11s)

> that he would have added to stars you in updates are probably things you'll want to include

(39m 18s)

> similar sort of things in the base game for this one, right? Like he's got a lot more of

(39m 22s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, so he shut the-

(39m 25s) **Al:**

> ideas of how he wants games to feel as a whole. I get that.

(39m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, definitely. Like there obviously at the end of the day, there's absolutely no

(39m 33s)

> Russian when it comes, you know, is when it, whenever it comes. And I'm sure it'll be great

(39m 38s)

> no matter what, but I wonder, I wonder how like his skills of game development have allowed him

(39m 47s)

> to like what, what, what's the, what's the words I'm looking for? He's home the skills. I'm sure

(39m 54s)

> a number of the skills with game development. I wonder how that affects his workflow speed.

(40m)

> versus implementing the new ideas that he has. I'm curious to see how that pans out in regards to

(40m 6s)

> like a timeline, because yeah, four, four, point five or five years for a Stardew, we're at this point

(40m 13s)

> approaching where we are at about five years for want to chocolate here. So it could be maybe another

(40m 20s)

> two years. Who knows? I know. But at least he's not actively working on this one at least.

(40m 21s) **Al:**

> Who knows it doesn't help that it doesn't help that he keeps doing starchy valley stuff

(40m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> So that hopefully that gives us some hope.

(40m 32s) **Al:**

> All right, the other piece of news we've got is faith arm

(40m 35s)

> So this complicated history around faith arm is that the company that developed

(40m 48s)

> Phoenix Labs. They are the people who made dauntless. So they made faith farm and they released it in 2023.

(40m 57s)

> And then the company basically died. They said that in 2024, they laid off most of their company

(41m 6s)

> and said that they were just going to be focusing on dauntless and faith farm, no other of their

(41m 10s)

> games. They canceled multiple games, including one game that was apparently only weeks away from

(41m 16s)

> from being released in early access.

(41m 18s) **Aislinn:**

> What could I vaguely remember hearing about this?

(41m 18s) **Al:**

> And then, yeah, then in the beginning of this year, they laid off the rest of their development team and announced that they were going to shut down the online components of faith farm and presumably don't look because that's like a basically a fully online game, wasn't it?

(41m 35s)

> Yeah, the game servers were shut down to me this year.

(41m 39s)

> So the online part of faith farm, which was not huge, I didn't actually use the online component at all, but it was shut down a few weeks ago, I think.

(41m 48s)

> The, we have found out that apparently faith farm has now been purchased by a company called Gambit digital, who are a collective of.

(42m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> figure out what they were, too. I was like, I, they have two games to their name,

(42m 9s) **Al:**

> An experienced collective, an experienced collective of video game leaders proudly announced

(42m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> faith farm and bloody hell hotel. And I'm like, I don't know what's going on.

(42m 16s) **Al:**

> their acquisition of the game, including the existing title and ongoing IP rights.

(42m 21s)

> The exciting partnership ensures that players can continue enjoying the game's enchanting

(42m 26s)

> live services while opening new possibilities for the future of Azordia.

(42m 30s)

> The collective composed of Gambit Digital, GameCloud Network, Pure Wonder Interactive,

(42m 36s)

> fatty acid with a pH.

(42m 39s)

> Bring together expertise and resources to enhance the player experience and drive innovative development of the faith farm franchise is a franchise if you got one thing, I don't know the group.

(42m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, that's an interesting choice of word.

(42m 54s) **Al:**

> The group will work together to nurture long term growth with gambit digital serving as the publisher of record for faith farm moving forward, originally developed and published by Phoenix Labs and launched in September 2023 two years ago, that is.

(43m 7s)

> Faye Farm quickly cultivated a thriving

(43m 9s)

> community with more than 500,000 players across all platforms, the new ownership team is thrilled to collaborate closely with this passionate community, ensuring the enchanting online experience continues to flourish.

(43m 22s)

> Players can look forward to an exciting future announcement to lad even more magic to their isodia and adventure.

(43m 29s)

> Pascal Nataf, Nataf, Pascal Nataf, co-founder of Gambit Digital added Faye Farm has captured the hearts of players around the world and were honored to help.

(43m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> - Sure.

(43m 39s) **Al:**

> Guide is next chapter, as a studio written in Canada would especially proud that this partnership will ensure Faye Farm remains a Canadian IP when the continues to celebrate this community while staying true to the spirit that made us audio so special in the first place.

(43m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> I hope for those that love Faith Arm I hope this means I hope this allows for the game to kind of

(44m)

> have like a comeback and come back to have the servers supported.

(44m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I'm really fascinated by this like why is it multiple companies that are buying it and also

(44m 13s)

> Gambit

(44m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean they did say they were a collective. So maybe that's part of it. I don't know how these

(44m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(44m 20s)

> So it looks like so it looks like Gambit digital digital is a new company that was only founded at the beginning of this month

(44m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> that makes sense, considering they only have two games.

(44m 31s)

> So that, that makes sense.

(44m 32s)

> Yeah, I can't help with you just a little bit hesitant

(44m 35s)

> because of never hearing a game, but digital

(44m 37s)

> and them just being so new.

(44m 39s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and hey, we know all in a game.

(44m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> And how did they get the finances to purchase the game?

(44m 43s) **Al:**

> Oh, that's that's always a question for these companies like how did you get finances it's always

(44m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> You know, I'm sure they also got financial help

(44m 51s)

> from the game cloud network,

(44m 52s)

> peer wonder interactive and fatty acid.

(44m 56s)

> Whoever they are too, I don't know.

(44m 59s)

> I hope, I hope it's good for those that love the game.

(45m 3s)

> But I can't help but be hesitant because there's just not enough information out there as to what all of this means.

(45m 9s)

> It's all just like buzzwords.

(45m 11s) **Al:**

> Oh no. Fatty acid or a generative AI studio.

(45m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, no.

(45m 18s) **Al:**

> Oh, bye. What a, what a, that's exactly what we want.

(45m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, no.

(45m 23s)

> Oh, gosh.

(45m 27s)

> All right, I don't have much faith.

(45m 29s)

> Good thing my heart is not poured into Fay Farm.

(45m 34s) **Al:**

> I can't see much about people.

(45m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> All I got from GameCloud Network was that they are.

(45m 40s)

> What seems to be like a mobile game?

(45m 44s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, that makes sense for the name, right?

(45m 44s) **Aislinn:**

> Like, company?

(45m 49s)

> True, true, you actually, yeah, very true.

(45m 52s) **Al:**

> GameCloud Network has brought together global leaders in advertising, enterprise media, and gaming to create a revolutionary way to authentically engage modern consumers.

(46m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> that that is all buzzwords to me. That is 1000% all buzzwords.

(46m 8s) **Al:**

> It's all buzzwords to everyone.

(46m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh yeah I do see this generative studio. Oh my god. No that I am a generative AI hater.

(46m 21s) **Al:**

> And what does it mean? What does it mean to be a collective of companies?

(46m 26s) **Aislinn:**

> Y'all rich and banded together.

(46m 31s) **Al:**

> because it's not like a company being owned by multiple companies like how, you know, Game Freak is

(46m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, oh, yeah

(46m 36s) **Al:**

> and now Game Freak, the Pokemon companies are a Game Freak or one of the companies.

(46m 39s)

> The Pokemon company is a company, the owns Pokemon, and then there are other companies

(46m 45s)

> that own that company. But having multiple companies owning the rights to

(46m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> It seems like they all specialize in different things, so like Gambit is the publisher, game cloud, maybe like bringing it to...

(46m 59s)

> I- Bay Farm is not a mobile game, right?

(47m 3s) **Al:**

> I don't think so. It's on steam and it's on a switch and I think it's on

(47m 11s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, so if it's assuming it's not a mobile confirmed and not a mobile game

(47m 15s)

> Then maybe game cloud is going to be bringing it to mobile

(47m 18s)

> Whatever pure wonder interactive is I have not a single clue and then

(47m 22s)

> What generative AI is going to be used with faith farm?

(47m 27s)

> Future game development. I'm not sure. I think they're just all using their different like specialties to come together for the game

(47m 36s)

> May or may not make or break the game. I don't know my hands are up in the arms at my

(47m 41s)

> hands. My arms are up in the air right now because I'm just like I don't know. I don't

(47m 47s) **Al:**

> I don't know what to say, I guess we'll just have to see what happens.

(47m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> know what to say either. Yay!

(47m 54s) **Al:**

> All right, let's go on to our final piece of news, which is a brand new game has been

(48m 3s)

> announced by Pocketpayer, that is the PowerWorld developer.

(48m 9s)

> They have announced a new game called PowerWorld PAL Farm, that is the full title PowerWorld

(48m 15s)

> power. And join me.

(48m 17s)

> By farming life with mysterious creatures known as pals, team up with them to grow your

(48m 22s)

> farm at your own pace in this brand new creature collecting farming sim, freely playable

(48m 28s)

> and multiplayer.

(48m 29s)

> Um, if you play Power World.

(48m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> - No.

(48m 34s)

[laughing]

(48m 36s)

> - Okay, can you hear my enthusiasm in my voice?

(48m 42s) **Al:**

> So, oh by, so this is a funny like fool circle moment for today because I woke up this morning

(48m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> - Oh boy indeed.

(48m 55s) **Al:**

> and the first thing I saw on my phone was this, like half six in the morning as I'm like waking

(49m) **Aislinn:**

[sigh]

(49m 4s) **Al:**

> up because my son has got me up and I'm like what is life and I'm looking and I'm like oh,

(49m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(49m 9s) **Al:**

> I want no power

(49m 12s)

> I'm not sure what to say.

(49m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> I know

(49m 25s) **Al:**

> It looks interesting.

(49m 26s)

> I mean, obviously I'm going to play it, right?

(49m 29s)

> Let's not pretend anything.

(49m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah

(49m 32s) **Al:**

> You appear to the like various standard things in farming games like shopkeepers and

(49m 42s)

> Blacksmiths and stuff exist in this game, but they are pals.

(49m 48s)

> So the shopkeeper is Patalia, one of the pals, and then the blacksmith is Anubis.

(49m 57s)

> And there's a cro-crowd-crowdage-ro, who is the master of sunbathing, apparently.

(50m 5s)

> I'm not sure why they show you him fishing, if he's the master of sunbathing.

(50m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> It beats me. I mean, you got a sunbathe to fish, right? I think I don't. Sure.

(50m 12s) **Al:**

> >> Sure, sure, whatever, I'm not sure you understand fishing.

(50m 17s)

> And you're talking to these pals, which I don't think pals talk in

(50m 24s)

> power world, so that's an interesting change.

(50m 27s)

> And then one of the pals has a chainsaw, which is very on brand for

(50m 30s)

> power world.

(50m 31s)

> I do think that some of it looks very funny.

(50m 33s)

> There's a moment where this pal like starts up the chainsaw and

(50m 37s)

> is going around cut down trees while you're also cut down trees with an axe.

(50m 40s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(50m 40s) **Al:**

> Why you have the act

(50m 42s)

> you've given the pal a chainsaw I don't know but then the the the the tree falls down and squishes another pal which is a very funny moment and then you're apparently playing Russian roulette with some creepy shadow did and then

(50m 52s) **Aislinn:**

> for a little guy yeah that that makes no sense to me well

(51m 3s) **Al:**

> like I i think this is very much leaning on the same sort of humor and stuff that pal world had and it's clearly trying to be

(51m 13s)

> like right at the end of the video you have a pal come up to you and and a very animal crossing way is like talking to you says oh you're the newbie you just moved in you seem pretty cool and then you're player character.

(51m 27s)

> Yeah, I know yeah the pal says i'm confident in my ability to reach people be my friend and then the player character gets a pal ball, I can't remember what they call pal or whatever is and throws it at the confused pal and catches it.

(51m 42s)

> So it's clearly trying to be funny and satirical and well it's working for me so far i'm I'm used I wasn't expecting this.

(51m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> I wasn't expecting this either. Like, this, this genuine, when I saw this in the notes, I was like,

(51m 58s)

> oh, oh, interesting. I mean, the game itself looks like really good. I'm just, I'm, I'm just

(52m) **Al:**

[laughs]

(52m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> in the camp of just still being hesitant because of everything that happened in the past.

(52m 13s)

> So I can't help but just go in with a sense of just, you know what I mean?

(52m 21s)

> But the game itself does look good.

(52m 23s)

> Like, visually very good.

(52m 26s)

> And the satirical humor, I think, is cute.

(52m 30s)

> I just don't understand this Russian roulette thing.

(52m 32s)

> Like, what are we doing here?

(52m 33s)

> How does that relate to anything else with farming?

(52m 34s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(52m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> Why are we Russian rouletteting in a farming game?

(52m 40s)

> But I guess that is the humor of the game, right?

(52m 42s)

> I don't know.

(52m 44s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I'm fascinated.

(52m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> Who is this guy?

(52m 48s)

> He looks like he could be from like Assassin's Creed, but also not.

(52m 51s)

> not. And I only say that because it was

(52m 53s)

> I could see that. I could see that. I'm curious to see how this plays out. I will say that. I'm very

(52m 55s) **Al:**

> I don't even feel like it feels like a dragon-coise character to me more like.

(53m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> curious to see how this plays out. I'm intrigued. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(53m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah, look, whoever happens is going to sell well, because power world did and people are fascinated by this company.

(53m 14s)

> Uh, yeah, uh, yes.

(53m 19s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(53m 19s) **Al:**

> Interestingly, I don't know. I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but the

(53m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> Just yes.

(53m 24s) **Al:**

> announced that, um, power is going to exit early access next year, which is his inference.

(53m 30s)

> Um, they also announced that this game is being developed by a different team.

(53m 35s)

> as a new team.

(53m 37s)

> So if you were worried about that, which I'm sure some people would be

(53m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Hey, there's that. At least it's not a, it's not another haunted chocolatier type of moment.

(53m 56s) **Al:**

> Well, is anything is anything on to joke with your woman. I really am fascinated and I I love to see

(54m 5s)

> Rumor has it there. Oh, so right. Okay. Have read a paragraph here on the island. There is a marketplace run by residents and pals where you can buy and sell crops and crafted goods

(54m 15s) **Aislinn:**

> Our we're reading the same thing

(54m 15s) **Al:**

> rare

(54m 16s)

> Rare items can sometimes be found there. Rumor has it. There's also a forbidden black market hidden away in the islands for our site

(54m 23s)

> guns suspicious fertilizer

(54m 26s)

> all sorts of things to trade. The consequences of buying these items are entirely

(54m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> crazy. This is nuts. I'm intrigued. I'm intrigued. I'm definitely intrigued.

(54m 36s) **Al:**

> Look, I am, at least partially in, I'm definitely something of the monkey or the gun, yeah.

(54m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> I like the little gif of above right above that marketplace thing of just this little guy,

(54m 51s)

> just yep, this guy just pulling up with yep.

(54m 55s) **Al:**

> What looks like a shotgun, but apparently is automatic rifle.

(55m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> I know, yeah! The logistics of it did not make sense.

(55m 6s) **Al:**

> I mean, if this game has some like real ethical questions that make you decide things and you can get benefits from that. But you also then have to deal with the consequences of it. I, I'm, yeah, let's go for it. If there are consequences for me giving a pal of chainsaw.

(55m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, you know what, true. It doesn't have to make sense.

(55m 29s)

> We'll see what happened.

(55m 33s) **Al:**

> I also find it interesting, this is a third person.

(55m 36s)

> game because pow world is first person.

(55m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh yeah, that's right. Maybe it's because it's being developed by someone else. It also, like, generally farming games are third person, so they probably did that for that reason.

(55m 49s) **Al:**

> Yeah. There are first person farming games, but yeah, I don't like one.

(55m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> I can't even think of one off the top of my head.

(55m 55s) **Al:**

> All right. Well, there we go. That's, that's the thing.

(56m 1s)

> Do you have anything to talk about with a poco pia before we go on to the main topic?

(56m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> with Pocopia. Oh, man. Um, um, I'm, I'm, I'm losing all of my time to that. I know that for sure.

(56m 7s) **Al:**

> Let it know. I'm let, let's let poco come on farming game.

(56m 11s)

> That's a no.

(56m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> As long as it's good. I, I don't, I just don't know what the gameplay mechanic is going to be.

(56m 21s)

> I hope it's not just, well, you know, I'll still take it, but I hope it's not just

(56m 25s)

> Hannibal Crossing, copy and paste the Pokemon, but I will, I will still happily take it, if that's

(56m 31s)

> the case. Um, I'm looking forward to it. I'm definitely looking forward to it, and I'm definitely

(56m 35s)

> I'm actually going to be...

(56m 37s)

> losing, I'm sure, a lot of time in the game, regardless of how good it is.

(56m 42s)

> 'Cause it looks very cute. I just hope it doesn't feel empty.

(56m 45s)

> It's my only concern, but...

(56m 47s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, I'm very intrigued to see how it ends up. It looks very much like a dragon quest builders to to me

(56m 53s)

> Which is a more involved than animal

(57m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, so that's good. I've never played Dragon Quest to be fair, so I'm not familiar, but if you say it seems like it's going to be more involved, and that's nice to hear, because again, yeah, I just don't want it to be, I don't want it to feel like empty and feel like so slow, like Animal Crossing does when you first start.

(57m 21s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah, I mean, I think a huge part of that is is it just being like real-time based

(57m 27s)

> That massively slows down

(57m 30s)

> What you can do in any?

(57m 33s)

> You know gaming session

(57m 36s)

> So I highly doubt

(57m 42s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I think so too. It would be kind of nice actually to have kind of the essence of animal crossing

(57m 47s)

> in the sense of like real time-based, but still a way to be able to play as much as you want.

(57m 55s)

> I don't know what that would look like, but that would be nice, but I'm also not expecting

(57m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think the problem is it's hard to do crops on that sort of thing and and not

(58m 7s)

> Because if you it's real time, right, it doesn't make any sense for the crops to grow in a day

(58m 12s)

> And so you're massively reducing how much you can do in any

(58m 16s)

> in any week right like

(58m 20s)

> It just changes how you think about things and I certainly would not like that

(58m 25s)

> I think it only works in an animal crossing because it's such a small part.

(58m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, yeah, it's a good point. Okay. Yeah, I don't know yeah

(58m 32s)

> I don't know what that would look even if you use like fertilizer or something

(58m 35s)

> I don't even know if that would

(58m 37s)

> be able to

(58m 40s)

> Speed up anything because again, like you said the real-time aspect does kind of put a hindrance on that

(58m 45s)

> But either way I

(58m 47s)

> You could give me anything and I would be happy just because it's a cozy Pokemon game. I don't care

(58m 50s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(58m 52s) **Aislinn:**

> I am I am weak. I am losing again all of my time to it. I I am I'm happy

(58m 59s)

> I'm looking forward to it a lot

(59m 1s) **Al:**

> Yep. All right, let's go on to the main topic of the podcast and that is Firefly Village.

(59m 9s)

> So I started this game playing this game on the 18th of September. It is currently the 23rd of

(59m 17s)

> September and I have 100% of the game. It took me seven hours to do that.

(59m 26s)

> Aslan, I know you were planning on possibly putting an hour or so of time into this

(59m 31s)

> game, did you manage to do that at all?

(59m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> I did not, unfortunately, I wanted to before recording,

(59m 37s)

> but because of my running around this morning,

(59m 40s)

> I was not able to, but knowing that you were able

(59m 45s)

> to get the game done that quickly,

(59m 48s)

> does put this on my radar, higher, 'cause it looks cute.

(59m 51s) **Al:**

> So, yeah, so let's, so introduction, it is basically a very simple

(59m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> But I'll let you talk about it more

(59m 54s)

> before I talk about what it looks like.

(1h 1s) **Al:**

> stargy lake. So it's, it's, it's very clearly taking a lot of, you know,

(1h 7s)

> influence from stargy valley. You take over a farm, you start growing crops, you have a

(1h 16s)

> village where you have other people that you talk to, and you build up your farm,

(1h 21s)

> there's relationships, blah blah blah, all the usual things. But what I would say I guess is

(1h 27s)

> it is all of those things simple, and it's very deliberately simple. And I find that very

(1h 33s)

> interesting. It's not, it doesn't feel incomplete, but it feels very deliberately simple. So I will get

(1h 40s)

> into that in the examples in the mechanics, but I guess that's just how I wanted to talk about the

(1h 45s)

> game as a whole. Starting off kind of visuals-wise is obviously pixel art.

(1h 52s)

> you know, not, not top down, not side-on, there was a 45 degrees on, I don't know how you would describe

(1h 58s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, the classic.

(1h 59s) **Al:**

> 45 degree angle pixel art grid based game. Your, your standard stargy like visuals.

(1h 1m 11s)

> The, it does however have like character art for when you're in the portraits, when you're talking to

(1h 1m 16s)

> them, which a lot of games have done recently as well. Um, it's

(1h 1m 21s)

> kind of what you see is what you get. If you look up on, on steam, um, what you see there is

(1h 1m 27s)

> exactly what you'll, you'll, you'll end up with. It's not more or less than that. It's very much,

(1h 1m 32s)

> you know, fair advertising on the visuals aspect. Um, and control-wise, it feels very similar

(1h 1m 39s)

> to stargy as well. You're kind of like moving in a grid based aspect. It took me a little bit of

(1h 1m 44s)

> time to get used to the controls just because I feel like there's a little bit more of a delay

(1h 1m 48s)

> on stopping moving than I would expect normally.

(1h 1m 51s)

> So quite often I would like move one square more than I was expecting, but that you get, yeah, well, just like when you let when you let go of the button and moves more than you would have expected to after stopping pressing the button. Right.

(1h 2m 2s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, interesting. Okay.

(1h 2m 3s) **Al:**

> But I think that's just something you get used to very quickly, right, because you just your brain starts to adapt to that and you start lifting it earlier than you normally would have.

(1h 2m 13s)

> Other than that is pretty standard. This is where we get into I'm going to talk about the days and the seasons. This is where we get into.

(1h 2m 21s)

> But some of the simplicity of it. So the, the days feel a little bit shorter than stardew. I haven't actually timed it, but it feels like maybe you're getting like five to six minutes in a day, where does I think stardew is like 11 minutes in a day, something like that.

(1h 2m 39s)

> It is, it is a fast day, but generally that doesn't feel faster than you would want because everything is scaled down massively, right, like scale off.

(1h 2m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Ok.

(1h 2m 51s) **Al:**

> Village things that there are to do stuff like that is massively scaled down. You don't feel like you feel like you've got enough time to do what you want to do.

(1h 2m 56s) **Aislinn:**

> Ok.

(1h 3m 1s) **Al:**

> Seasons are seven days. So a week is a season.

(1h 3m 8s)

> There's some interesting advantages and some disadvantages. So the advantage I guess is that you can very quickly get through a year and it's quite satisfying to get through a year.

(1h 3m 21s)

> I suspect most people who play stardew valley don't ever get through a full year. I suspect they kind of get to like middle of autumn or fall and kind of that's done right because most people don't complete things, but it would be very easy to get through a year, you know, very quickly. Like if you were like playing as a session, you could probably get through a year in about an hour and a half.

(1h 3m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh wow.

(1h 3m 51s) **Al:**

> Which feels very satisfying to me being able to do it that quickly and get through everything. I guess one of the disadvantages of it is if you don't get things done at the beginning of the season, you're not going to get them done right because you like some things take five days to grow.

(1h 4m 7s)

> If you don't plan to on the first day or the second day or the third day, that's it, you can't grow it that season. So having said that, because you then only have, you know, 21 days to wait till the seasons back.

(1h 4m 21s)

> Again, it doesn't feel frustrating. Like I had done. So I did two full years and I had almost everything done, but there was like one thing I hadn't done in summer. And so I like sped run speed run speed run. I very quickly went. I very quickly did spring so I could get to summer and then do the thing that I'd missed the previous summer because it's just seven days. It's really easy to do that.

(1h 4m 38s) **Aislinn:**

> I don't know what the phrase is either.

(1h 4m 48s)

> So you would do you mind if I ask a question before you keep going?

(1h 4m 52s)

> So it doesn't feel because I guess my like reading the description of the game of it,

(1h 4m 57s)

> saying a bite-sized streamline farming sim made me think that it potentially could feel rushed.

(1h 5m 5s)

> So would you say it's like that perfect pace? Is it a good middle ground of like feeling like it's

(1h 5m 10s)

> moving? It really is a streamline game, but doesn't feel like forced or rushed.

(1h 5m 16s) **Al:**

> I think it depends on what you're looking for, right?

(1h 5m 18s)

> Like, I could see some people feeling it's rushed

(1h 5m 22s)

> because, you know, I 100% did it in seven hours.

(1h 5m 25s)

> That is fast, right?

(1h 5m 29s)

> I can totally see why some people were like,

(1h 5m 31s)

> that's too fast.

(1h 5m 32s)

> I want slower.

(1h 5m 35s)

> Having said that, like, you can take it slower, right?

(1h 5m 39s)

> Like, obviously, there is a setting for making your days slower.

(1h 5m 46s)

> Because I didn't feel the need to.

(1h 5m 49s)

> But I can see why someone wanted to do that.

(1h 5m 52s)

> And it's not like you're forced to do any of the things

(1h 5m 55s)

> quickly, right?

(1h 5m 55s)

> Like, I got to the point where I was trying to do it

(1h 5m 58s)

> reasonably quickly so that I could, you know,

(1h 6m 1s)

> have done a decent amount before the podcast.

(1h 6m 4s)

> And then I realized I was like, you know,

(1h 6m 7s)

> 60% through the game.

(1h 6m 9s)

> And I was like, oh, well, never really want to complete

(1h 6m 11s)

> everything before the podcast regarding, right?

(1h 6m 14s)

> So I...

(1h 6m 16s)

> I've rushed through everything to do that. You could absolutely expand this out quite a lot and take it much slower.

(1h 6m 22s)

> I also have a problem where I tend to speedrun the first.

(1h 6m 26s)

> We bet of farming games anyway because I find when you can't do a huge amount quite boring.

(1h 6m 32s)

> So I will do my crops and I'll do the kind of basic things that you need to do to, you know, build up relationships and stuff like that.

(1h 6m 39s)

> And then I'll just go to sleep. I'll go to sleep at like, you know, midday in spring one.

(1h 6m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 6m 44s) **Al:**

> Uh, just to kind of like speed things off.

(1h 6m 46s)

> I didn't feel the need to do that in this one because obviously one the days are quicker and to there's just more happening quicker.

(1h 6m 55s)

> So yeah, I guess it just depends on what you're looking for, but you could definitely do that.

(1h 7m 2s) **Aislinn:**

> that they give you the option because that would be my one point of concern. I think I would

(1h 7m 8s)

> enjoy the fact that it's like moving at a good pace like moving pretty quickly and I don't mind.

(1h 7m 12s)

> The fact that it takes seven hours to 100% the game. But if I was in like another move where I

(1h 7m 18s)

> moved, where I did want to take things slower, I would have been curious if it felt like the game

(1h 7m 23s)

> was rushing me. But it's nice to know that you have the option to like make the game feel slower if you

(1h 7m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah, they've got standard day length and relaxed day length.

(1h 7m 32s) **Aislinn:**

> Nice, okay, that's good to hear.

(1h 7m 34s) **Al:**

> Mechanics wise, there's quite a few interesting things they do here,

(1h 7m 38s)

> and I will you will continue to hear the theme of simplified.

(1h 7m 44s)

> I guess maybe streamlined is probably, that's what they use.

(1h 7m 47s)

> I get why they're using that phrase, but also I do feel like it's accurate

(1h 7m 52s)

> to say simplified as well, like it's all simple.

(1h 7m 58s)

> farming wise.

(1h 7m 59s)

> It is the standard loop, you throw down a seed, you water it, you water it the next

(1h 8m 5s)

> day, and then after a certain number of days, you harvest it.

(1h 8m 9s)

> I guess you don't have, I can never remember the right word, not owing, telling the land,

(1h 8m 15s)

> you don't tell the land, it's automatic.

(1h 8m 19s)

> There's not like, there's, you don't sow seeds on individual plots, you, you sow them

(1h 8m 25s)

> pair a three by three plot so you like you choose a seed

(1h 8m 29s)

> and it will automatically go to the three by three plot so it kind of speeds that up a little bit.

(1h 8m 36s)

> You've essentially got then six plots of farming land each of which is a three by three and so you

(1h 8m 46s)

> buy six seeds and then you saw those six seeds and that gives you are was it nine by six plot of land

(1h 8m 56s)

> and probably not doing justice. This is lots of numbers.

(1h 8m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> I lost you like five numbers ago. I'm terrible with numbers. I'm just like looking up into the

(1h 8m 59s) **Al:**

> But basically, you're not sewing them on an individual square basis.

(1h 9m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> ceiling to be like 9x5, 3x4, like what is going on. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I can work with that.

(1h 9m 18s) **Al:**

> You're doing a three by three block. So if you choose a seed, it automatically throws it to

(1h 9m 23s)

> three by three, rather than doing each individual square.

(1h 9m 26s) **Aislinn:**

> I can understand that okay

(1h 9m 30s) **Al:**

> Watering is exactly as you expect. You can either one watering can upgrade.

(1h 9m 39s)

> The first watering can does a one square. You're like water each individual squares individually.

(1h 9m 45s)

> But then you get there's a one upgrade that is a three by three. So that speeds things up.

(1h 9m 51s)

> But it's still again very simple, right? You wake up in the morning, you go see your plants,

(1h 9m 57s)

> you water them and then.

(1h 9m 59s)

> Eventually, one of the days you'll you'll harvest them, which can it be anything from two days to five days, I think, depending on which plant is.

(1h 10m 8s)

> But it's exactly what you would expect other than the three by three plot being automatic, everything else is exactly the same, right?

(1h 10m 16s)

> You sow the seed you water it, you harvest it. It's farming. One more, do you want? There aren't any more of the complicated things, though, there's no like fertilizer and stuff like that.

(1h 10m 22s) **Aislinn:**

> Bear bear

(1h 10m 26s)

> Okay, you don't really need it because if everything goes by so fast anyway as I would I would

(1h 10m 30s) **Al:**

> Well, exactly, and it doesn't have like quality of it. It's just you have a crop, you have a crop, right? Like, if you have a tobacco, it's a tomato.

(1h 10m 38s) **Aislinn:**

> Yes. Yeah.

(1h 10m 41s) **Al:**

> If you're trying to be a, you know, a streamlined farming game, you don't add things like that. I totally get why that that's not there.

(1h 10m 49s)

> Oh, I forgot about an overall thing, your bag. This is the one thing I don't like about the bag, but I get why they've done it, but I still don't like it. There aren't, there's no stack.

(1h 10m 59s)

> So if you have six tomatoes, that takes up six spaces, not a fan of that. But having said that, there's very little you do with things in this game, other than sell them.

(1h 11m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> What? No.

(1h 11m 16s) **Al:**

> So essentially, you pick up your tomatoes and you throw them straight in the shipping bin. So you don't tend to be storing anything, but that's good because the storage in this game is terrible, right?

(1h 11m 27s)

> your bag is your

(1h 11m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> 11, I see 11. I'm watching the pre-recorded broadcast on the Steam page as we're talking.

(1h 11m 29s) **Al:**

> bag is get this 11 spaces you can store 11 things in your bag

(1h 11m 40s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm just watching the gameplay. I just saw the 11 spots that you have.

(1h 11m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, so it's a three by four grid, but one of them is taken up by the bin. So it's not 12. It's a living

(1h 11m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh my gosh. Okay. It's not terrible because of everything else you've said, but I'm just like,

(1h 11m 53s) **Al:**

> Really silly, but

(1h 11m 56s) **Aislinn:**

> oh, if we could just get like a little patch for that, that would be kind.

(1h 11m 56s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and I was I was I was very annoyed by that initially and then I was like, oh, you know what?

(1h 12m 3s)

> It's fine because of everything else in the game kind of pushing you towards like just get it done

(1h 12m 10s)

> the you can buy.

(1h 12m 13s)

> one chest and that gives you 12 spaces in it. I think it's 12 rather than 11. Let me check. I've got the game running here. Nope. That's a living as well. The noise six. It's six. My bad. It's six. The chest is six. The chest is also like 4000 monies. It's very expensive compared to a lot of things in the game. So I didn't buy the chest till the end of the game because there was no point. I wasn't really using it for anything either.

(1h 12m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> It's six, even less.

(1h 12m 41s) **Al:**

> Like the only

(1h 12m 43s)

> There is one big disadvantage to this storage and that is if you go and buy a bunch of seeds

(1h 12m 48s)

> Because you don't think about the storage, right? You go buy 11 seeds because that's how many can store though

(1h 12m 53s)

> You shouldn't be buying 11 but let's say you buy 11 seeds because you buy them actually

(1h 12m 57s)

> No, you actually know I just remembered that this it doesn't let you buy more than six seeds at once

(1h 13m 2s)

> Because that's how many you can you can so but if you buy six and then you buy another six

(1h 13m 8s)

> You have to keep those in storage

(1h 13m 11s)

> And because they won't stack.

(1h 13m 13s)

> You now have six out of your living spaces in your inventory stored up, unless you have the chest, in which case your entire chest is full of seeds, until the next time you can use them, which might be 21 days.

(1h 13m 27s)

> Right? Because of your seasons.

(1h 13m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Goodness. Yeah.

(1h 13m 32s) **Al:**

> So, it's not a big problem, but if you're not thinking about things early on, you might be in the position where you either have to sell seeds you've just bought, or, or...

(1h 13m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(1h 13m 43s) **Al:**

> have terrible storage for the next year.

(1h 13m 46s) **Aislinn:**

[laughs]

(1h 13m 47s)

> Okay, definitely noted for myself,

(1h 13m 50s)

> 'cause I likely will eventually play this game.

(1h 13m 52s)

> So definitely, definitely noted.

(1h 13m 55s)

> Oh, yup, my bag is full.

(1h 13m 57s)

> Okay, I watched that happen with all the turnips.

(1h 14m)

> Yeah, okay, at least the shipment chest

(1h 14m 2s)

> is like right there too,

(1h 14m 3s)

> but that is overall like frustrating

(1h 14m 8s)

> and I don't see a reason why.

(1h 14m 11s)

> You shouldn't be able to stack things in your storage.

(1h 14m 17s)

> Like I know the game is encouraging you to keep going and again just bringing it back to that streamlined gameplay loop.

(1h 14m 26s)

> But I feel like you can still have a streamlined gameplay loop but allow at least stacking in your back.

(1h 14m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I do think it would, I think it would be better to have stacking.

(1h 14m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> I don't think it would hurt the game in any way.

(1h 14m 41s) **Al:**

> There's no stamina in this game. It's purely the time. So if you have the time to do a

(1h 14m 45s)

> thing, you can do the thing.

(1h 14m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, that's nice, actually.

(1h 14m 48s) **Al:**

> I am, yeah, I'm definitely moving towards the, I, I do think that you should either have

(1h 14m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> If I want to mine forever.

(1h 14m 55s) **Al:**

> stamina or time, uh, automatic time. And I, it was the one thing I liked about

(1h 15m 1s)

> you could do that island or wherever it was called.

(1h 15m 4s)

> That terrible game. The one thing I liked about that was it flipped that

(1h 15m 8s)

> around and it had stamina but it didn't have time like you just decided

(1h 15m 13s)

> when it was the end of the day and I'd like more more games to kind of play

(1h 15m 18s)

> around with that idea but it does annoy me now when games have both and it's like

(1h 15m 24s)

> I have a limited amount of time but I also have a limited amount of stamina and

(1h 15m 29s)

> And so it's like, what are you focusing on doing?

(1h 15m 34s)

> And it's like, if you use up all your stamina, you don't feel like you should just go to bed straight away because you also have limited, having those two limitations, they're always in competition with each other and I don't like that.

(1h 15m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. I agree. I'm the same way. I mean, there's there's definitely a reason why I installed mods for Stardew was to be able to give myself the option.

(1h 15m 57s)

> If I want to keep mining for the entire day, but let the time run, I could just turn on the mod and click unlimited stamina and I could just keep mining if I want to if that's what I'm feeling in that moment.

(1h 16m 8s)

> So I also wish that more games played around with either or of those and allowed for like more.

(1h 16m 16s)

> More flexibility, depending on your preferred playstyle.

(1h 16m 20s) **Al:**

> Yep, yup, yup, yup.

(1h 16m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> For me, it's like the essence of like limited time takes away from the coziness of a game for me because I feel pressured.

(1h 16m 28s)

> Even though I know I don't I know I don't actually have to, but like I still can't help but feel that pressure because of the time clicking.

(1h 16m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. I think that's the thing is like I'm fine with either of them existing, but only one of them, because you know, having a limitation makes sense in your game, but having two of them makes it like especially as you say in cozy games, having two of them makes it doubly stressful, because like in this game, when the time runs out, you're like, okay, fine. I did all the things I needed to do today, and yeah, I didn't get everything done I wanted to, but it's fine because I've not wasted stamina.

(1h 16m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 17m 4s) **Al:**

> Because the stamina doesn't exist, and I used up all my time, and I was doing things the entire time in that time, so it's not like I wasted anything.

(1h 17m 10s)

> Whereas the problem is it's like when you run out of stamina and you either have to go to bed or have to, you know, eat something to give you more stamina, you feel like you're wasting something, because you're like to take advantage of this limited resource, I have to use up a different limited resource.

(1h 17m 11s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(1h 17m 16s)

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 17m 18s)

> Yeah.

(1h 17m 28s)

> Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I definitely, you are, you are preaching to the choir right now. I want 1,000% agree,

(1h 17m 35s)

> and that has been a big issue for me, I think, with truly, truly getting into, like, more farming games in general,

(1h 17m 42s)

> is it just, it's, it's like shuffling of resources and feeling like the pressure.

(1h 17m 48s)

> Even though I know it's not actually supposed to be pressure, like you can do whatever you want,

(1h 17m 53s)

> you could do absolutely nothing but me being me.

(1h 17m 55s) **Al:**

> Yeah. It's still an arbitrary number that it's taking down the entire time.

(1h 17m 58s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I can't exactly. I can't help but feel the pressure.

(1h 18m 1s) **Al:**

> For sure. Yeah. So I like that animals. So this is an interesting one. So you can have a dog.

(1h 18m 11s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(1h 18m 12s) **Al:**

> There's a dog. The dog does nothing else doesn't exist, but you don't have to, you know,

(1h 18m 16s)

> have to do anything for them either. So that's fine. You just, you know, say hello to him in the

(1h 18m 20s)

> morning. He has a little love heart. All good. You move on with your day. Um,

(1h 18m 25s)

> there are cows and chickens. You can buy three cows and three chickens. Um,

(1h 18m 31s)

> you don't have to feed them. You interact with them once a day to get their buy

(1h 18m 35s)

> product and they're happy. And that's it. Pretty much. Um, you can also buy our mayonnaise

(1h 18m 40s) **Aislinn:**

> Huh, okay, that's simple.

(1h 18m 43s) **Al:**

> machine and our cheese machine. Um, but it's just you interact with it and it automatically

(1h 18m 50s)

> turns everyone you have in storage in your bag into that thing.

(1h 18m 55s)

> So if you interact with it and you have one egg, you get one mayonnaise. If you

(1h 18m 58s)

> interact you have three eggs you get three mayonnaise. But that's pretty much it.

(1h 19m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay. That's nice that it lets you do everything in one go rather than like you have to make one mayonnaise at a time, individually, you can make three in one go if you have the three with you. That's nice, but I guess you also have to be careful if you didn't want to make mayonnaise or multiple mayonnaise and you just want to one. Now you just made for five.

(1h 19m 20s) **Al:**

> I don't think, yeah, I don't think you care, right?

(1h 19m 24s)

> The only time I think you would actually care is if for some reason you wanted to make a fried egg

(1h 19m 28s)

> because there's cooking in this game. But like, there are three things you can do with an egg.

(1h 19m 32s)

> You can sell it for like 60 or you can turn into mayonnaise and sell it for 100 or you can turn it

(1h 19m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> - Okay.

(1h 19m 41s) **Al:**

> into a fried egg and sell it for 70. So it's like, why are you doing anything other than turning

(1h 19m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> - Oh.

(1h 19m 48s) **Al:**

> and to me, it is.

(1h 19m 50s)

> I made exactly one fried egg and it was for the achievement.

(1h 19m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> - Yeah, you know what?

(1h 19m 51s)

> All rosely to mayonnaise, got it.

(1h 20m)

> I'll see if you're the achievement hunter then you're doing the fried egg otherwise you're rolling in mayonnaise

(1h 20m 6s) **Al:**

> exactly.

(1h 20m 9s)

> Because there is cooking in this game, the cooking is very simple, streamlined, if

(1h 20m 14s)

> you will, you interact with the kitchen, you choose one piece of food and it either turns

(1h 20m 23s)

> into a different piece of food or nothing happens.

(1h 20m 26s)

> You can do three things a day, so you can do three cooking's a day in total, and some

(1h 20m 32s)

> things turn into food and some don't.

(1h 20m 34s)

> with you if you... if you...

(1h 20m 37s)

> if you interact with an egg, it turns into a fried egg, if you interact with a tomato, it turns into a tomato soup, if you interact with corn, it turns into popcorn, if you interact with lettuce, it turns into coleslaw, if you interact with cheese, it does nothing, if you interact with milk, it does nothing, these things are just things.

(1h 20m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> If you interact with, if you interact with lettuce and you don't have mayonnaise, you still

(1h 20m 59s)

> get coleslaw, double the mayonnaise, oh, all roads lead to mayonnaise, you're just rolling in mayonnaise,

(1h 21m) **Al:**

> You do. It's one item, one thing. It's obviously a very... it's obviously a very simple...

(1h 21m 6s)

> coleslaw. As you say, everything... everything leads to mayonnaise.

(1h 21m 15s)

> The coleslaw is very funny as well. It looks like it's like rainbow colored.

(1h 21m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> oh, mayonnaise, that's

(1h 21m 22s) **Al:**

> I don't know what to say.

(1h 21m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> it. Very big.

(1h 21m 25s) **Al:**

> Mayonnaise.

(1h 21m 27s)

> All roads indeed mayonnaise is obviously this episode title.

(1h 21m 32s)

> mining is a pretty much

(1h 21m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Thank God. That's so good. That's so good. I'd be a wreck

(1h 22m 5s)

> Oh, yeah. So...

(1h 22m 6s) **Al:**

> possible to store that all with their. But the ores the ores do count towards your storage, but you don't use them for anything other than gifts and selling.

(1h 22m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, all right, so the separate storage for wood and rocks is that just an unlimited storage or is that also limited?

(1h 22m 27s) **Al:**

> I don't know. I never went higher than 230 because I didn't need more than that and by the

(1h 22m 33s)

> time I needed that much I'd already used at all. It's only for house upgrades and the top

(1h 22m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay. All right. Cool.

(1h 22m 39s) **Al:**

> one is 200 of each. So yeah, I suspect if there is a limit, it's like $9.99 and you

(1h 22m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay. That's in my brain. That's basically all emitted.

(1h 22m 45s)

> Okay.

(1h 22m 49s)

> Okay.

(1h 22m 50s) **Al:**

> don't need more than like 800 in the entire game. I'm not going to find out if the

(1h 22m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Cool. All right.

(1h 22m 57s) **Al:**

> there's a limit. I'm not wasting time. Because it's one, it's one rock gives you one rock.

(1h 22m 57s) **Aislinn:**

> No, that's totally okay. If anything, that might.

(1h 23m 2s) **Al:**

> So I'd have to do a thousand rocks. I'm not doing that.

(1h 23m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> That might be, it may or may not be if I am able to find more time and I'm not running around as much, that might be something that I may try to investigate because I love mining. So that could be a personal projects. Yeah.

(1h 23m 13s) **Al:**

> That's the real grinding for you.

(1h 23m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> That could be my personal project.

(1h 23m 29s) **Al:**

> Fishing is basically animal crossing fishing.

(1h 23m 33s)

> So you see a shadow in the water, you real, you cast, there you go, you cast your fishing

(1h 23m 41s)

> into the water.

(1h 23m 43s)

> You see an exclamation mark, you press the button, you reel in.

(1h 23m 47s)

> There's different like fish.

(1h 23m 49s)

> I think there's like 12 fish or something like that.

(1h 23m 53s)

> I lost track.

(1h 23m 54s)

> Okay, here's my real complaint about this game.

(1h 23m 57s)

> There is no list of what fish and crops you've got and which ones you haven't caught.

(1h 24m 3s)

> It's very annoying because it's like there is an achievement to catch one of every fish.

(1h 24m 6s)

> But I was like, I don't know which fish I've caught and which ones I've not caught.

(1h 24m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, yeah. That is. I guess you'd have to break out an Excel sheet.

(1h 24m 10s) **Al:**

> And that's very annoying.

(1h 24m 13s)

> I would like a list of all the fish I've got.

(1h 24m 15s)

> Well, I mean, I even then, how would I know what I've done before?

(1h 24m 18s)

> I don't know why I've done in the past if there's no log of it, right?

(1h 24m 22s) **Aislinn:**

> You got it. You got to manually type out the Excel sheet. Every time you catch a fish.

(1h 24m 26s) **Al:**

> But no, even then, I would, but you'd have to know beforehand to do that.

(1h 24m 30s)

> I spent a year in game not knowing there wasn't a list and not knowing that I'd even existed.

(1h 24m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, I know.

(1h 24m 36s)

> Yeah, that, that, that, I...

(1h 24m 39s)

> I would agree. That's, that's pretty nuts that there's no list in game, especially since the achievement exists. Yeah, the achievement exists.

(1h 24m 44s) **Al:**

> because clearly they're keeping track of it, they're keeping track of it. Tell me, tell me what I have.

(1h 24m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> That is valid. That is very valid.

(1h 24m 51s) **Al:**

> What? The village layout is quite simple. You've got your farm and then there's like the town

(1h 24m 57s)

> and then there's a foresty area with like a river. There's a shop for buying seeds and stuff

(1h 25m 5s)

> from. There's an animal shop and then there's kind of your usual people around and about and

(1h 25m 11s)

> the usual archetypes. The shop is

(1h 25m 14s)

> interesting. This one is also very similar to Animal Crossing. It will start like four items a day,

(1h 25m 20s)

> and they're randomly generated. But that adds to the annoyance of the seasons being seven days,

(1h 25m 27s)

> right? Because this is why it took me so long to do tomatoes, specifically for the cooking

(1h 25m 34s)

> achievement. I hadn't done tomato soup because I didn't have the cooking facilities because that's

(1h 25m 42s)

> like the first house upgrade and have that in the first

(1h 25m 44s)

> car here and then the second year I was trying to do all of the cooking as I was going so I was like growing all of the crops I could I didn't get tomatoes in the shop until day four of the season and they take five days to grow.

(1h 25m 58s)

> So I just couldn't grow tomatoes that year.

(1h 25m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, yeah.

(1h 26m 1s) **Al:**

> That was really annoying is like why am I not the first day I was like okay fine I've not got them today not the end of the world I'll get them I might get them tomorrow.

(1h 26m 11s)

> go in the second date, still not there.

(1h 26m 14s)

> And it's impossible for me to grow them.

(1h 26m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think I also would agree with your complaint there,

(1h 26m 29s)

> but I'm a little bit more lax on that in the sense that at least like, it's a cozy

(1h 26m 36s)

> game at the end of the day. You're not supposed to rush it. So like, sure, but like, no, I

(1h 26m 40s) **Al:**

> rush it. I would, I'd already done a bunch of it. This was me trying to finish the achievements,

(1h 26m 43s) **Aislinn:**

> Go!

(1h 26m 45s) **Al:**

> and I had to just speedrun a year to get the next season so I could actually grow the tomatoes.

(1h 26m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, but the grind of farming, I thought you liked farming!

(1h 26m 55s) **Al:**

> I had done literally everything else in the game by this point.

(1h 27m) **Aislinn:**

> But you gotta keep grinding your farming, you know? It's therapeutic, you know? It's cozy!

(1h 27m 6s) **Al:**

> I spent a lot of time sleeping that year. Let's put it that way.

(1h 27m 11s)

> I was hibernating.

(1h 27m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> You're a sleep your character caught up all the

(1h 27m 17s)

> your character caught up on all the lost sleep over the past two years and the third year just trying to make to all the energy preservation with sleeping when into the tomato soup that you made.

(1h 27m 26s) **Al:**

> That was an amazing tomato soup, the whole one bowl of it I made.

(1h 27m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> Gonna be have like gold flex in it. It's a sprinkling of truffle like.

(1h 27m 40s) **Al:**

> There are festivals in the game. They're on specific days and they're specific things.

(1h 27m 47s)

> I won't say too much about them because I feel like that would kind of

(1h 27m 51s)

> ruin the story for people. But they're fun. I enjoyed them. The tie-in to the characters a lot,

(1h 27m 59s)

> and again, I'm not going to talk about individual characters, but I found most of the characters

(1h 28m 5s)

> interesting and fun to get to know. They are similar

(1h 28m 10s)

> to everything else in the game. They are simplified, streamlined, sorry, but they were fun and a lot of them are kind of, you know,

(1h 28m 21s)

> trophy caricatures as they're not on the level of stargy, but they were they were fun anyway. The relationship system is the max of three hearts and it's basically just by gifting them.

(1h 28m 40s)

> There are gifts that they will dislike and there are gifts that they will love, but I found that most items most people liked. So it took quite a while for me to find a gift that someone disliked or that they loved, but you do get it and you get quite a big boost for a love and you do get a downgrade for dislike and it was very sad when I first gave someone something they disliked and I'm like, whoa, what was this reaction? My word, calm down.

(1h 29m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> is there is when you find out that character dislikes, I guess in this case mushrooms, for example,

(1h 29m 11s) **Al:**

> I'm sorry that I didn't know you didn't like mushrooms, right? You never told me that.

(1h 29m 22s) **Aislinn:**

> is there a documentation anywhere in the game or is that also lacking? Okay, question answered.

(1h 29m 26s) **Al:**

> What do you think, yeah, no, I would like, this goes back to the same thing about the fishing

(1h 29m 35s)

> thing. I would like more documentation of this stuff. I'd like a list of the characters and their

(1h 29m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, I guess noted for myself to just take physical notes.

(1h 29m 40s) **Al:**

> heart levels and what I've learned about them that would be nice. They do tell, yeah, they do

(1h 29m 48s)

> also tell you in just conversation sometimes, like they'll be like, oh, I did have one guy tell me

(1h 29m 53s)

> that he didn't like sunflower seeds at one point, and I was like, "Oh!"

(1h 29m 56s)

> It's interesting, I wonder why he's told me that, and then I realized this, because he doesn't want you to give him sunflower seeds, and you know, I've had people tell me, like, "Oh, I love this," or whatever. It's great. It's kind of like, just generic text as you're talking to them, but it's there. But you've got to

(1h 30m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> - Okay, good to know.

(1h 30m 18s)

> Yeah, definitely I would just have a little notebook

(1h 30m 20s)

> or like a little Excel sheet or something

(1h 30m 21s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1h 30m 23s)

> Excel probably feels over the top.

(1h 30m 25s)

> There's like four relationships.

(1h 30m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, so physical notes are notes in my phone or something.

(1h 30m 31s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's four characters and they all have,

(1h 30m 34s)

> I think, one dislike and one love.

(1h 30m 38s)

> But it's fine.

(1h 30m 40s)

> It was fun, so once you get them to one star,

(1h 30m 43s)

> they'll ask you if you wanna go in and hang out,

(1h 30m 46s)

> and you have a little cutscene with them.

(1h 30m 48s)

> And then when you get them to three stars,

(1h 30m 49s)

> So don't do it again and don't.

(1h 30m 51s)

> Talk about how much they like you and there's very definitely some flirting happening, but there's no explicit

(1h 31m)

> Romantic rest their relationships, but at least one of them was very much flirting with you and it's clear there's something there, but there's no

(1h 31m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, does it feel like this game because I did notice that this or firefly village was

(1h 31m 20s)

> The first game it seems like for this to this developer

(1h 31m 24s)

> Does it feel like there could be a follow-up game in regards to these characters?

(1h 31m 29s)

> So does it seem like it's like kind of a standalone game since you said that it just kind of like alludes to a romantic something something

(1h 31m 35s)

> But doesn't like explicitly

(1h 31m 38s) **Al:**

> I would be more likely, I think, that they would update the game rather than another game that

(1h 31m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> - Right, okay, that's a better question.

(1h 31m 45s) **Al:**

> includes that. I don't, I don't think the characters are interesting enough to be like,

(1h 31m 50s)

> oh, here there's the Firefly Village Extended Universe. It would be fun to have a little bit more

(1h 31m 54s) **Aislinn:**

[laughs]

(1h 31m 57s) **Al:**

> with the characters, but that's, that's about it.

(1h 31m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

(1h 32m 1s)

> Yeah, that's that's actually a better question.

(1h 32m 3s)

> So you can see this game potentially having like a future update whether it's free update or DLC or...

(1h 32m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't want to pressure any end of indie dev to do anything like that, but I feel like if there was an update that included, you know, further relationship progression and a few other things, then I could see that it would feel natural, it wouldn't feel

(1h 32m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, cool. Good to know. Yeah, obviously we're not expecting it or like saying with this need DLC blah, blah, blah

(1h 32m 35s)

> It's just more so like does it feel like it could potentially happen if the opportunity to present itself which seems to be the case

(1h 32m 36s) **Al:**

> No, no, no.

(1h 32m 36s)

> I think, yeah, yeah.

(1h 32m 43s)

> Yeah, I mean, I think for what the game is,

(1h 32m 46s)

> like it costs nine dollars, I think, seven pounds.

(1h 32m 52s)

> It is, it feels very much worth it.

(1h 32m 55s)

> It's a fun little experience, right?

(1h 32m 57s)

> Like, you're not expecting for that amount of money

(1h 32m 59s)

> to have a stargy experience.

(1h 33m 2s)

> It's from a single day, I mean, I know stargy was as well,

(1h 33m 6s)

> it feels, streamlined as the right term for it.

(1h 33m 11s)

> And I have very much enjoyed it.

(1h 33m 14s)

> And for what the money that it is,

(1h 33m 15s)

> it was a fun little, you know, under 10 hour experience.

(1h 33m 21s)

> I always find it funny when people complain

(1h 33m 22s)

> about games being too short,

(1h 33m 24s)

> when they're like 10 hours long,

(1h 33m 26s)

> 'cause I'm like, that's like five films for the price of one.

(1h 33m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, right

(1h 33m 33s) **Al:**

> You know, I get it when it's like $70.

(1h 33m 36s)

> But when it's less than 10, you know, you're getting multiple films worth of content for the

(1h 33m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I agree. I mean, just from you telling me about it, like, I feel inclined to want to play this game sooner rather than later.

(1h 33m 55s)

> So that in itself is telling someone that does not like to have multiple farming games in the rotation.

(1h 34m 2s)

> And just struggles to pick them up in general, because as much as I like them, it's also like how many farming games do I need.

(1h 34m 8s)

> But I like that this one is like very, as the word that they use, they picked very good words to describe this game.

(1h 34m 13s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I think of it kind of like, um, uh, Christmas films. Every Christmas film, you know,

(1h 34m 24s)

> what's going to happen in that Christmas film, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable

(1h 34m 27s)

> if you like Christmas films. This is very much like the standard tropey farming game. And

(1h 34m 35s)

> you know what you're getting out of this. But that's what you're expecting. And that's

(1h 34m 39s)

> what you enjoy and you see these things. You're like, "Oh, it's this thing. I love this thing."

(1h 34m 44s)

> Please, excuse me.

(1h 34m 46s)

> So, like, if that sounds fun to you, then this is something that you might want.

(1h 34m 50s)

> And if it sounds like something you're like, "Oh, I hate these tropes, then don't watch it."

(1h 34m 56s)

> Right? Like, if you hate cheesy Christmas films, don't go watch a cheesy Christmas film. I don't know what you want from me.

(1h 35m) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, okay. Yeah. No, that sounds, I mean, I do like, I do love rather the essence of farming games.

(1h 35m 8s)

> So to have it in a more digestible version is nice, especially because as of as of recently when I do pick up games,

(1h 35m 15s)

> I pick up games in like 30 minute increments. So I could stretch this out over a good while. I make it feel like

(1h 35m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. For sure. And yeah. And in that sort of that time period, if you're

(1h 35m 22s) **Aislinn:**

> fully valuable without it feeling like overwhelming like start you can feel like even like for me,

(1h 35m 27s)

> like fields of mystery I can feel, etc.

(1h 35m 33s) **Al:**

> playing half an hour at a time, you could either like do like two to three days if you're like

(1h 35m 38s)

> taking things relaxed or you could get through a week and have a season every playthrough and you

(1h 35m 43s)

> would still get you know a good like five to ten game.

(1h 35m 49s)

> The game sessions in it before you're feeling like you've done everything.

(1h 35m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, that sounds great. That sounds perfect, honestly. Something just more digestible and less lower

(1h 36m)

> lower stakes but still feeling like a full farming game experience.

(1h 36m 6s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah, I agree. I think if if it sounds interesting to you

(1h 36m 11s)

> Listener then it's probably worth it. You know, it's it's cheap enough as well that it's

(1h 36m 16s)

> You don't feel you know

(1h 36m 19s)

> Horrible if it's not something you stick a whole bunch of time into

(1h 36m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean, it looks it just looks cute.

(1h 36m 24s) **Al:**

> Oh here we go. I've got his four four minutes apparently. It says on the

(1h 36m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, perfect.

(1h 36m 34s)

> I had another question.

(1h 36m 37s)

> I'm trying to think, oh, with, okay,

(1h 36m 40s)

> so with the game being shorter,

(1h 36m 43s)

> does it still feel like it's like more impactful

(1h 36m 48s)

> or like meaningful?

(1h 36m 49s)

> Like, does it leave a mark on you at all?

(1h 36m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I'm not gonna be sitting here in two years thinking about this the way I do do with

(1h 36m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> Obviously, it doesn't have to be like a strong mark

(1h 36m 54s)

> as a farming game.

(1h 36m 55s)

> But in regards to like the characters,

(1h 36m 56s)

> you said you enjoyed them even though they're trophy,

(1h 36m 58s)

> but does it leave like a little bit of an impact on you?

(1h 37m 5s) **Al:**

> stargy, you know, five years later, six, seven years later, whether eight years late, I forget so

(1h 37m 10s)

> many years. Um, like, I'm not gonna still be thinking about any of these characters the way I think

(1h 37m 16s)

> about Linus from Stardew, right? But you know I had fun

(1h 37m 21s)

> and there is enough there to be like you know I've spent nearly a week

(1h 37m 27s)

> thinking about this game and enjoying it and that's quite a lot for something as

(1h 37m 33s)

> simple as it is. You're not gonna, your life isn't gonna be changed playing it, but it's fun, you know.

(1h 37m 37s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(1h 37m 39s)

> Because I was thinking in like the the mindset of like going back to Wanda stop

(1h 37m 44s)

> Playing that game how short it was, but it's still it has been ruminating and I don't know how long it's going to ruminate in my brain

(1h 37m 51s)

> But it has been ruminating in my brain for quite a while since I've played it and again very short game

(1h 37m 59s)

> very simple gameplay loop

(1h 38m 1s)

> left a very big impact on me, but that doesn't

(1h 38m 7s)

> This game well, it seems like this game doesn't necessarily do that, but it doesn't take away from the game either, which is nice

(1h 38m 12s)

> I

(1h 38m 14s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, no, not really, not a huge amount.

(1h 38m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> Was just curious if there was like a character moment or something that was like oh man

(1h 38m 18s)

> I'm gonna remember this for a little bit

(1h 38m 21s) **Al:**

> I mean, I liked a kind of the cutscenes,

(1h 38m 26s)

> but there's not a humongous amount

(1h 38m 27s)

> that I'm still remembering about them now.

(1h 38m 30s)

> But that's, yeah, that is what it is.

(1h 38m 32s)

> I will say the one thing I think if you love the idea

(1h 38m 39s)

> of expanding a farm and seeing it go from something small

(1h 38m 44s)

> this is the one thing that I think we'd be missing

(1h 38m 46s)

> from this is very static.

(1h 38m 48s)

> You expand your house and you upgrade your watering can once,

(1h 38m 54s)

> but that's about it.

(1h 38m 55s)

> There's no like adding of land.

(1h 38m 57s)

> There's no like, you can basically,

(1h 39m)

> the day one you can plant all of the plants

(1h 39m 3s)

> that you're able to plant in the same as

(1h 39m 5s)

> at the end of the game.

(1h 39m 6s)

> So there's not like that you know, greater progression

(1h 39m 11s) **Aislinn:**

> Right, I mean that's I think that's okay. Well, if you wanted to like

(1h 39m 15s)

> Would the game feel satisfying if you did want to like replay it even since you're not able to like continue expecting?

(1h 39m 22s) **Al:**

> I could see somebody trying, uh, I could see, uh, speed runner getting into this.

(1h 39m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, all right, that's actually pretty cool.

(1h 39m 30s) **Al:**

> I'm being like, how, how do I, you know, make the, the most efficient possible?

(1h 39m 37s)

> I could see you someone doing that.

(1h 39m 38s) **Aislinn:**

> But otherwise, past that, maybe not. Okay, fair. Okay, fair.

(1h 39m 41s) **Al:**

> Probably not.

(1h 39m 42s)

> Yeah, it probably not.

(1h 39m 44s)

> There's, there's not a huge amount of replay value there.

(1h 39m 47s)

> I don't think other than speed running.

(1h 39m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, I mean, it's less than $10, so that makes sense. Maybe replay it again, and when you forget

(1h 39m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(1h 39m 55s) **Aislinn:**

> most of the story, like, five years down the line, when haunt or chocolatier is still not out, you know?
