<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Cool. I am also good. I don't tend to run around, but I do tend to be busy. My kids are now in bed, so this is the best time of the day.

14
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Wonderful, perfect. This is peak sitting right now.

15
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:31.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yes, I've you I haven't finished listening to your latest podcast episode and I remember at the beginning you mentioned you can have alluded to K-pop demon hunters. I presume you don't talk about that later on in the episode.

16
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.819
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>No, I know, I do not. I do not.

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:59.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>No, but you have presumably seen the film. Yes, so the I'm thinking of when they're walking back to their their lounge after their show at the beginning and just chanting couch. That is that is how I feel many evenings.

18
00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.620
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I have. I have watched it once, and I did enjoy it.

19
00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:02.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>that is what I crave desperately right now in life. I crave couch and then just the immediate

20
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>just cut to and we're debuting a new single is just how I feel.

21
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. Yes. There is no rest. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

22
00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:18.060
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Illusion is the illusion of the couch.

23
00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:24.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. So we are not here to talk about K-pop demon hunters. Although maybe, but who knows?

24
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.080
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>if it comes up you know who knows oh my gosh yeah you've definitely seen it

25
00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:30.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>We'll see. I've seen it more than you though. Apparently, I've seen it three times now.

26
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>more than me

27
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.879
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>One of my top films of the year.

28
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:40.400
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>wow that's crazy

29
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.560
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So, I know, right?

30
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like imagine, I often think about how I think teenage me would hate adult me.

31
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.360
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You go back and tell like 15 year old me that one year his, I mean, first of all,

32
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>he'd say, what is K-pop?

33
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.159
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But guess that like, you know, well, yeah, it wasn't really, I think I was aware of it.

34
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You know, when I was 15, was that 20 years ago?

35
00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.439
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But if you, if you went back 20 years ago and told me that in 20 years,

36
00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:17.719
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>your favorite, one of your favorite films of the year will be a, uh, uh, but a K-pop band.

37
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:26.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That's just how it would be with K-pop, you know?

38
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.280
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Uh, he would be very confused and very disappointed in what I became.

39
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But, uh, yeah, well, yeah, yeah, uh, where was I?

40
00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yes, we're- we are instead here to talk about Coach Gorgames.

41
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.639
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The main topic this episode is Firefly Village, which we will get onto.

42
00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.879
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Before that, we have a bunch of news.

43
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.919
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But first of all, Aislyn, what have you been up to?

44
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I have been up to a lot of working, that's nothing new.

45
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.979
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I just finished the post game or specifically the looker stuff and Pokemon X, and that

46
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.740
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is better than the entirety of Pokemon X.

47
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:13.719
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>In my opinion, I loved, I loved the looker storyline and everything.

48
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.020
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Wow. Oh man.

49
00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.719
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But other words...

50
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I've been still working through Persona 3 reload, and I've been watching one of my friends while I wander stop for the first time.

51
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.839
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Hmm.

52
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So in a way, I'm kind of replying the game.

53
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So that's been really, really nice because I gifted her.

54
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I was like, it was on her wishlist for a while and I was like, "You need to play this game."

55
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And we were in a call and I was like, "You know what? You need to play this game.

56
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm going to give you the game."

57
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And then during one of our gaming sessions, you're going to play the game and I'm going to watch.

58
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.600
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And that's what we're doing now.

59
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.139
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, the, one to stop is definitely on my list of games I'm going to play before the end of the year,

60
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Because I just love the game.

61
00:04:52.139 --> 00:05:00.620
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>especially when I find out how short it is. I'm like, oh yes, I definitely like, when I see a game that is,

62
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.540
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>people really like and is a game that I think I'll like, and you can complete it in 10 hours,

63
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that sounds perfect to me. So, you know, that's like, that's like a week of playing a game for me,

64
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely a bite-sized game,

65
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>like, some other games we might be talking about later this episode.

66
00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>which is really nice.

67
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- True, I think.

68
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Spoiler.

69
00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.680
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughing]

70
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:32.139
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Um, the other, my other question for you is persona. Is this your first persona game?

71
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.759
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- That don't make sense later.

72
00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Of you played others, right? Okay. Would I like a persona game?

73
00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.959
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Yes, Persona 3 Reload is my first Persona game.

74
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh. I...

75
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Um... Yeah.

76
00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.800
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I know they're not short, right? So I know that I know that

77
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.220
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>about them, it's not like I only play short games. I do play longer games. I have

78
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>put, you know, Pokemon Viola, I currently have like 350 hours in, right? So I, you know,

79
00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.899
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and I put like 150 hours into tears of the kingdom in the first month, right? So like I am open

80
00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:07.100
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>to games where I put in, you know, over 100 hours. I am aware that that is a thing that

81
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>would probably have to happen if I was to get the full experience of this game. But is I don't

82
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:26.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>know, if persona games are the sort of games I would like or not. Ooh, my favorite parts

83
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.339
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>What is this going to be a very odd question, but what are your favorite parts of Pokemon like Pokemon games?

84
00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:32.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>of Pokemon games would be the collecting of the Pokemon. Yeah.

85
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:42.899
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, because I'm like, if it's the, if you don't mind or you enjoy like the grinding to an

86
00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:51.540
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>extent, I think you would enjoy persona. If you don't like a grindy experience, I might be just a

87
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.259
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>little bit hesitant, but the dialogue and the story. And again, to be fair, this is A, I have a

88
00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>for a rich persona 3.

89
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's my first persona game, so I don't know if this carries over the English.

90
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Carries over to other persona games, but it's very dialogue/story heavy.

91
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:24.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And you do just kind of like a lot of repetitive tasks in a way to get more dialogue

92
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:41.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I guess one thing to talk about is do I like grinding? Do I like doing repetitive tasks

93
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and get to know the characters, and then you grind up and level up your characters

94
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is to do like boss battles and stuff.

95
00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:45.459
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>four hours to get to an end.

96
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.660
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, what games do we talk about on this podcast?

97
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:58.720
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I was going to say, with that said, with all of the farming games that are very repetitive...

98
00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:07.660
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. Yeah, I don't I feel like grinding is not and I'm not the biggest fan of grinding in

99
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:13.620
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Pokemon games, but I think it's because of the type of game it is. I prefer to do the collecting

100
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.459
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and get through the story.

101
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then, well, as Kevin said, I do shiny hunt.

102
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.860
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So let's not pretend like I don't do grinding.

103
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughing]

104
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.180
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But I think if I expect that going into a game that

105
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.180
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>is a different thing, right, I wouldn't want grinding

106
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in a Mario Kart game, for example.

107
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because I'd be like, this is not--

108
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:43.299
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah. Well, obviously, you don't want to grind the rails in the new Mario Kart.

109
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I'm not here for grinding.

110
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, I don't think you grind on rails, hey, hey.

111
00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:44.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But I don't want to have to play the same course 100 times

112
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that's-- I'm here to play the courses until I've gotten first

113
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in all of them, and then I move on to the next.

114
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.379
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I'm here for that fun.

115
00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:59.019
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But do I have in other games and enjoy those games?

116
00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:00.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Absolutely.

117
00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:05.019
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think until maybe a month ago, I would have

118
00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:08.100
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>said, I'm not a big fan of dialogue heavy games.

119
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.899
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>However, story season's grand bazaar changed me on that.

120
00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:15.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in the, um, I presume you've not heard the episode on Gram.

121
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:23.139
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>One of the things I really like about how they did dialogue in that game is, uh, one,

122
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.299
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>No, I have not been able to listen to it yet.

123
00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:29.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>it has, uh, not full voice acting, but all the dialogue that matters, like all the story-based

124
00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:38.179
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>stuff has, has full voice acting. Um, but also the conversations you can set to auto advance.

125
00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:43.100
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So what I was doing, because part of my problem is I, I will sit with a game and I'll be like,

126
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.240
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you know, I'll just, I'll, I'll be playing and it'll come to,

127
00:09:45.500 --> 00:10:06.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>a dialogue bit and I'll just like mash through the dialogue. And it's not, I don't want to hear the dialogue. It's that when I'm not a big reading fan, right? Like I just not super fun. I don't enjoy looking at text. I'm reading it. Ironic that I am a software developer and that entire job is text based, but I don't enjoy.

128
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah

129
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.759
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You could burn down you know you don't want to keep reading during your off time

130
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:15.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Maybe that's, maybe that's the reason. Maybe it's, you know, and it's why I'm not a huge book reader. I just don't like looking at text and trying to figure out what it is.

131
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:44.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So that I think as part of it, but also like my hands sometimes just need something to do and I struggle to hold a console or a controller and not press buttons on it, right? And you're sitting there for ages, reading text, not pressing buttons. That's not how, that's not how games work. Games work when you press buttons. So why did with story season's grounds bizarre is that when the dialogue came on, I pressed the also thing turned up the volume and put the switch down and took my hands away and played with a fiddle toy or something.

132
00:10:45.500 --> 00:11:15.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Um, which is what I'm doing just now, I'm playing with a fiddle toy. So I don't do other things. Um, and that I actually enjoyed the story and the dialogue from the characters much more being able to sit there fiddle and hear the story rather than having to read and wait and press about it at the right time. The other thing is like obviously quite often, uh, text will be really slow and you have to press to speed it up, but the problem is if you press too quickly, you then advance to the next.

133
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:45.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Part of the text and you've missed the previous text. Um, and that's a big problem I have in Pokemon games all the time, right? It's like trying to advance the text, but not skip the text. Um, so being able to do that and like actually just slowing down that part of the game and forcing me to have my hands not on the switch meant that I enjoyed that a lot more. So I know persona three is not I suspect persona three being how old it is. We'll not have fill vice acting. Um,

134
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Mm-hmm

135
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.740
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh my god, yeah

136
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.700
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>No, it does, for the most part, it does.

137
00:11:45.500 --> 00:12:15.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh, he does. Oh, really interesting. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

138
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.379
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It has a lot of voice acting.

139
00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:51.980
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It has a couple cut scenes.

140
00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:57.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>There is, it's definitely still text dialogue,

141
00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:01.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>relatively heavy, but there is a good amount of voice acting.

142
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.659
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So I think it's something to consider.

143
00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:06.059
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I think it's worth giving a shot.

144
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.659
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I have been really enjoying it,

145
00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:11.740
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but I also like reading, but there is still voice acting,

146
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.299
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but I also have it, I'm playing it in Japanese voice acting,

147
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.820
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>just prefer to play a game from like in the native region

148
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.080
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, that's fair. That's fair. I'm a big, I'm a big, uh, a dub guy, uh, not because not because I,

149
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.700
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>where the game came from in their language.

150
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So I'm just reading it all.

151
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.080
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>like I totally, because I'm one of these people that people hate who I watch the dub of squid game.

152
00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:42.919
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Um, and, uh, I know that people really hate that. And yes, when you have a dub quite often,

153
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:48.360
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>especially when it's a Japanese to English dub, quite often the, uh, speech can be a bit weird

154
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>not been like translated into a natural way of speaking. And so some of it can be a bit jilted

155
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and I get that. I, I just, and it's not that I don't like, it's not that I hate reading subtitles

156
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>because I watch everything with subtitles, um, because I find it helpful to like back up where I

157
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:13.320
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>was here and go, yes, that's what I heard. That's fine. Let's continue. It's that I, I don't like

158
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:19.080
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>how I can't look away from the screen at any time or you miss stuff. When you are listening,

159
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.080
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>to something in English and you've got subtitles, it's like you've got two ways of getting the

160
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>information in, um, which as people will tell you all the time is the best way to take information in

161
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.200
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>is with multiple ways, right? Listening and reading at the same time is a, is a, you take in much more

162
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:41.639
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that way. Um, but also it means that like if I'm playing game or I'm doing, I can like look somewhere

163
00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:47.559
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>else and I don't miss a sentence, right? Whereas if you're, if you're listening in a, in Japanese or

164
00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:49.039
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>or whatever, you just can't.

165
00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:06.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because I watch Pokemon in Japanese, but that's because I'm too lazy to wait for the dub to come out, because it's so late, and so I watch fan translations of the the Pokemon anime, but like that's one 20 minute episode a week, right?

166
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's a whole different thing.

167
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.740
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, that's, that's, that's, yeah.

168
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And also it's Pokemon, it doesn't really, the story doesn't hugely matter if you miss a sentence, you still get the idea of it, whereas with squid game in particular, if you miss one sentence, you could miss a huge twist.

169
00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:14.220
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And also true.

170
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:28.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Right, like there was a lot of things happening. So that's why I generally watch dubs, even though some of the voice acting is not the best.

171
00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:20.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

172
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, I will say I am a dub hater for myself and only myself.

173
00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:40.100
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I, anyone else that listens or watches anything with that's like dubbed.

174
00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:45.220
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's fine. It's not affecting me. It's just a personal preference. I'm just like, no.

175
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.860
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>[laughing]

176
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, yeah.

177
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:52.100
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm like, you know, I'm a subtitle elitist for myself and only myself.

178
00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.100
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That's fair, yeah.

179
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.179
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Because again, I'm like, it doesn't, it doesn't matter. And I agree with you that being able

180
00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.179
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I was able to listen to it in English.

181
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:06.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And also have subtitles does allow you to take in the information better, so if I did the same thing, I probably would take in the information better.

182
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:14.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But I just, I just definitely have this preference towards, again, just listening to something in the language that it was made in.

183
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:27.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Whether it be a movie, a show, a game, whatever it may be, but with that said, I will say I have heard very, very, very good things about specifically the personas areas and their English translations,

184
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>in acting, I've heard it's really, really, really good.

185
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.080
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It definitely depends on whether it's done right or not because I've only seen one of the studio Ghibli films

186
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So, yeah.

187
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It was the newest one the boy in the head and but it was it had excellent voice acting in English

188
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Mm-hmm

189
00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:47.179
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah

190
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And and I've heard that generally their films are very good with the dubs

191
00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:57.919
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, they have they get like some big time like American or not always American, but like big time like actress

192
00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:01.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, yeah, they had they had Robert Robert Patterson was in the in the boy in the head and like yeah, they do but yeah

193
00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:00.779
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah

194
00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Absolutely

195
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Depends on how much effort they've put in and it's just sometimes a lot of them

196
00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:13.360
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Especially Netflix ones do tend to be like it was somebody in a box reading

197
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughs]

198
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like an automatic translation of what was said and they like have weird

199
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.879
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Intonation of words and you're just like that's not how people talk. Why are you saying it like that?

200
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.080
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughing]

201
00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:29.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So yeah, it definitely massively depends so I can see how

202
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:41.039
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think if it's I can see how games would be better than film and TV because I think you

203
00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.679
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>How do I

204
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.059
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I feel like you have the budget for it, first of all.

205
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.080
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That is a that is part especially the big ones, right?

206
00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:52.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But I think you know like for example the

207
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You know the Zelda ones to use the kingdom and breath of the world had pretty good voice acting

208
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I know some people found Zelda annoying

209
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:14.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that's not an issue with voice acting. That's just it was an a posh English accent. That was the issue, you know, no matter who is you're going to be annoyed by a posh English accent, same.

210
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Fair enough.

211
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:31.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think that people if you're putting in the effort to be voice acting in a game, you care about the voice acting. If you're not putting if you don't care about voice acting, you're probably not putting it in the game at all.

212
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah

213
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:59.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Whereas you can't do a film without words. Well, I mean, you can, but people don't want that now, right? So it's easier to not care as much about the effort of a dub when you're making a film because you care about the original or whatever, and not necessarily. And it's different people doing the translation and the dubbing. It's not the original creators.

214
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.259
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Well, I was gonna say you can, but...

215
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So the effort isn't necessarily there.

216
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There is much.

217
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:09.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I will say I'm not I'm not confident in this, but I do wonder to bring it back to K-pop demon Hunter.

218
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So.

219
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:22.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I will say I do wonder how these dubs for the other languages are if they also sound like it's in a box. So that's all my list of things to look up later.

220
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah

221
00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:27.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>With that so yeah, because it was Sony but Sony are

222
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>They're a South Korean company aren't they Sony

223
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.900
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That is a great question. I have no idea

224
00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:41.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>No, Sony and American apparently I thought Sony were South Korean that American interesting, okay, my bad

225
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I was gonna it's a

226
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.119
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>If you want to know it's it's Japanese

227
00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:48.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Wait, really oh, yeah, yeah, I'm mistreating this thing Sony

228
00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:50.940
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>My reliable source Wikipedia tells me

229
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And sorry, interactive entries.

230
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Entertainment LLC is an American video game in digital age and to date company, all of Japanese

231
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>conglomerate Sony Group Corporation.

232
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

233
00:18:57.519 --> 00:18:58.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So they're Japanese.

234
00:18:58.519 --> 00:18:59.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Okay.

235
00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:04.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There was this, but what is there, where did their animation happen, Sony animation?

236
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.960
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I think it was because it was Korean Americans that made K-pop demon hunters, I want to say.

237
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:17.640
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So it's an American branch of Sony, worked on by Koreans and Korean Americans question mark.

238
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:25.859
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So Sony Sony Sony so any Sony pictures animation is American American some situation owned by Sony based in Los Angeles

239
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.839
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>This is all big question marks.

240
00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:27.859
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I guess not that surprising

241
00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But yeah, no, I'm I'm aware that the

242
00:19:31.779 --> 00:19:35.859
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Singers and music was written by Korean Americans. Yeah, but I guess

243
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.220
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>What was my point?

244
00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:42.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's not as simple as going. It's an American thing

245
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>What is it sound like in other language?

246
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:55.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>which is because it's it's both and but also I was making that assumption based on Sony being South Korean not being Japanese, which is very different

247
00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:03.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm glad we, I'm glad we figured that out.

248
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, okay. I don't know what we figured out. We figured something out

249
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:09.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>We, we figured Ellie's so funny's not South Korean.

250
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:16.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And we figured it out that I'm going to try and bring things back to K-pop demon hunters for, for funsies.

251
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, break in the news.

265
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:17.400
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>into it if it was like, I'm seeing it live. Otherwise, like, I'm sitting in my, in with my earbuds on,

268
00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:31.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Just driving driving down the road very fast with your windows open.

269
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.200
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>We're driving within the speed limit paying attention obviously.

270
00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:44.279
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, and then the speed limit fast. That has to within the speed limit.

271
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:48.400
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Fast within this speed limit. You can be you can be fast while also driving legally. Thank you.

272
00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:51.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>True, you could be slow while also driving legally. So you, you make a good point.

273
00:21:53.039 --> 00:22:01.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Okay, so that's what you've been up to. I have been playing firefighter village, which we'll talk about later in the

274
00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:11.039
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>episode and I also got Craig my youngest into playing Donkey Kong, but answer and he is enjoying that. So that's fun.

275
00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:14.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It takes he doesn't play a lot of games because he gets like really obsessed with games.

276
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.839
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>He's basically been playing astro bot for the last year. He is he's a hundred. He's done everything

277
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Aww, I love that.

278
00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:27.599
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in the game. There were a couple of bosses that he needed to my help with, but other than that,

279
00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:39.759
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>he did basically everything. And yeah, there's there's one level in the newest batch of update levels

280
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Like even like the challenge levels?

281
00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:35.619
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh my gosh, I'm impressed.

282
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>hasn't done yet. The mega mixed mastery. That that is the one he hasn't done, but he's gotten very close. He's in the,

283
00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:52.880
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>he's managed to get to the last section of it. And I think it's only a wee bit before he manages to finish,

284
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.559
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>he's he's freely good, which is terrifying. Yeah.

285
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:03.480
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's crazy yeah, he's like significantly better than me and maybe even better than my husband. I don't know

286
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:18.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think these things are very much about how early you start doing these things right because I've seen a lot of people who grew up with 3D platformers, not understand and know how to use 2D platformers, which is very interesting.

287
00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:06.299
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That's crazy

288
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.359
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is interesting, it makes sense though, because I do struggle with 3D platformers because

289
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:27.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>of just like the depth of fields, but 2D platforms is generally easier for me, but I also

290
00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:31.759
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>grew up probably with more 2D platformers versus 3D.

291
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah

292
00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:38.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>When I was I grew up playing basically both at the same time because I grew up playing Sonic

293
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then straight into Crash Bandicoot

294
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.099
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Ah, ah, so you have the balance.

295
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Which if

296
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.160
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>If any game is is gonna mess with your field of vision it's Crash Bandicoot

297
00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:54.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I only have like the Vegas memory.

298

<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>adjustments that further enrich the player experience. So this is introducing a

323
00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:27.480
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>new minigame, the magic of the Geitah, Geitah. It's an instrument. It looks kind of

<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>they look completely different.

361
00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:58.339
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>They are I

362
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I can tell.

363
00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:04.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Guess it could be that it might I mean my assumption immediate was like items

364
00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:07.099
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Cosmetics and stuff

365
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.759
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You're telling me these cute cows are not going to be in Guardians of Azuma?

366
00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Look, I mean if there's anything that would improve room factory game. It's a more whimsy

367
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.680
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, it's very like, it takes itself, it feels like it takes itself very seriously.

368
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:31.140
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's gotten more it's got yeah, it's it's gotten more like that over time because room factory originally was just

369
00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:26.839
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And I'm like, "Are we just farming?"

370
00:28:31.779 --> 00:28:33.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Harvestman, but also combat

371
00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:37.700
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But it's gotten it's gotten more gritty and more serious

372
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's the

373
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.380
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Zack Snyder

374
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I love that, love that comparison.

375
00:28:48.539 --> 00:28:51.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I like the, I, when I, because I, again, I've never played this game before.

376
00:28:51.579 --> 00:28:55.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I, seeing the fact that it's like combat, but it's also a farming game.

377
00:28:55.019 --> 00:28:56.779
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I was like, oh, this is interesting.

378
00:28:56.779 --> 00:28:59.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But it did feel like it was taking itself a little bit too seriously.

379
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.099
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And I was like, we need a little bit of like, ha, ha funny, like cute whimsy,

380
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:16.339
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, in four, the, when you were carrying like a stack of

381
00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:04.059
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>somewhere in there.

382
00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:06.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And I'm like, I don't know if I'm getting that.

383
00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.940
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That guy just said in the trailer, lovely weather we're having.

384
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.140
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I need a little more.

385
00:29:16.339 --> 00:29:21.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>turnips or wherever, you would literally see the stack above your head. So it did have some

386
00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:25.380
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>silliness like that, but they've kind of, I don't think they had that in five. I don't remember

387
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:31.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>them having that in five. So they're kind of like, yeah, they removed some of the whimsy and kind

388
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>kind of gone more.

389
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:40.819
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I think as they're leveling up and go I a lot of that happened when they moved made the move to like 3d relevant 2d.

390
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Mm-hmm. Maybe I'll check on an older, older one.

391
00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:48.660
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't like them but maybe you will.

392
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.200
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh.

393
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.900
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It might be worth the shot.

394
00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:53.299
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Some people I mean lots of people do.

395
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.700
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>They keep making them for a reason.

396
00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:58.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Lots of people that you can go back and listen to our Run Factory 4S episode if you want.

397
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.299
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You know what? I will. I will do that.

398
00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:03.799
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Ah, that's my list.

399
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.220
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>[laughs]

400
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Never ending list.

401
00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:08.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Literally.

402
00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:13.859
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Next we have a discountee update. This is the deep pockets update.

403
00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:18.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It is coming soon. Although the beta for it is out now if you want to subscribe to the

404
00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:25.140
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>beta channel on Steam. You can add a basement to your shop. They call it they say dig a basement.

405
00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.099
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You need more space and can't expand outwards. What but straight down this update adds a new

406
00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>a new quest line that sees you expanding this guarantee once again.

407
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:42.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But as you've known out there and nothing in blum-kest, blum-kest, blum-kest comes easy and there might be some other people in town who take an unexpected interest in your new basement project.

408
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:47.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I really hope this is like that tunnel girl on TikTok. Do you remember that?

409
00:30:47.500 --> 00:31:01.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Were you aware of that? Are you not aware of this? There was this, there was this, there was this woman on TikTok who was referred to as "Turno Girl" and she was building a tunnel under her house.

410
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.619
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>What what I'm not on tick-nock first of all tunnel girl on tick-tock

411
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:12.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But she just lived in like a suburb, right? So she was like essentially digging like underneath her neighbor's houses.

412
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.440
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh... Oh my god. Oh...

413
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:26.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And she had no like permission to do this. She didn't have like a parameter or anything. And it was just this wild like couple of weeks where she was digging this massive tunnel under her house before the local government sure died.

414
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:33.220
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing it on on YouTube. I'm seeing it via Reddit because again, I don't have tik-tok

415
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:43.140
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh my god, this is this is new. This is new information to me. This is this is white. What why?

416
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.400
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It looks like she did eventually manage to get approval for the tunnel and she got a proper

417
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:58.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>permit and is doing the tunnel the proper way. But yeah, she got a mandatory evacuate and no,

418
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>As long as it's not under other people's houses, sure!

419
00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:02.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that was a mandatory evaluation. I remember mess read that, I mean. But yeah, she got to, it was

420
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:09.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>December last year that she was told to stop constructing and they would evaluate it and then

421
00:32:09.839 --> 00:32:13.839
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>She would get there. Permit. It's just...

422
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>This is crazy.

423
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's mad that you just start doing that without checking if you should or not.

424
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like, and I'm not saying that people don't, you know, it does look like she knew, or she learned enough to know what she was doing.

425
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.180
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>She was crushing it, she was doing great for what I saw.

426
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:43.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Apparently so, and apparently it was fine. It's just like, we have a, you know, system to make sure that people know where they're doing, and she wasn't following that, so yeah.

427
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah

428
00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:51.200
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Man imagine I'm just reflecting back on like when I lived with my parents in the town that would grew up in it

429
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.299
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Was like an incorporated village type of thing and they'd like told you like you have to like you have to like mow your grass

430
00:32:56.759 --> 00:33:00.839
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>In order to keep up with like the the the the rules of the town

431
00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:08.559
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I guess or whatever, but one of my neighbors he installed like a curb in front of his house and he got in trouble for that

432
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:20.759
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I've heard people complain about being told off for the

433
00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:11.319
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So if you got a drink.

434
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Just for installing a curb in front of his house. Imagine the trouble that you could get in trouble for.

435
00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:26.759
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>grass being the wrong length and stuff like that. And she managed to go months of digging a tunnel

436
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

437
00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:37.640
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>under her ass. Anyway, so I hope this storyline includes something about that. That would be really

438
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>The duality of man.

439
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Crazy.

440
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>funny. Uh, uh,

441
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.559
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>they also got upgrades to your shop. Um,

442
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and give us tunnel girl.

443
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.839
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>their little up your shop. They've got new items to the reward shop. Um,

444
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:59.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>they've got, um, new, uh, decorations for the outside of your shop. Um,

445
00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:03.880
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and obviously quality of life and bug fixes discount. He's definitely on my list of,

446
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.839
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I want to play it at some point, uh, but I haven't done yet.

447
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>let me know how it is when you do because I like watched I watched a streamer

448
00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:17.480
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>play it for like a little bit and I just wasn't sure if I liked it or not so to get like a full

449
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:28.480
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it has a thousand, a thousand mostly positive reviews.

450
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>in-depth analysis rather than like having to like watch the full game would be nice so

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:30.679
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>because it looks really cute it looks very very cute and I think yeah so it's got to be decent

452
00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:35.719
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and I like the undertone that they have had with the game where it's like

453
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>description of the game selling more frozen fries will surely heal this broken community dot

454
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:48.039
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>dot dot right so I like that like undertone of like there is more to this game than you

455
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.239
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>you perceive kind of like wanders stop it's like wandershop you think it's just a cozy

456
00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.039
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>team making game and it's like nope it's way more than that buckle in

457
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:11.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The, um, how long to beat for discount he's giving 16 and a half hours for the main story 20 hours for completionist. So that's definitely, uh, that's, that's pretty good. Pretty good length.

458
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That's not bad.

459
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:19.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That's, uh, a week if I'm in the mood for it two weeks if I'm going casually.

460
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, I would I would say something

461
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:27.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Um, okay. Next, we got a couple of other pieces of news. First stop, um, concerned eight has said.

462
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:38.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That's, that's, that's, that's all the news about that. Uh, we are definitely at the point of over analyzing concerned eight tweets.

463
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:44.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>yep yep why why I just I just want to know why I thought we were done after 1.6 and we were

464
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:58.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>No. No. What happened is, what happened is he had ideas. So, well, so you, you, you obviously

465
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>going to focus and lock in on haunted chocolate here what happened what I mean I know he said

466
00:35:50.880 --> 00:36:00.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>in one of those interviews but uh give us haunted chocolates here

467
00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:05.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>hadn't had the news in the previous podcast, which is where we pointed out that he says that

468
00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:13.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>he is not really doing the work on this, but he's the ideas and helping move it forward rather

469
00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:18.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>implementing it. His team is big enough now, and he trusts them enough that he can like get

470
00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:25.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>them to do most of the work. And he's doing basically all the chocolate, the chocolate to taunt

471
00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:32.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>dear, uh, onto his chocolate here, uh, instead. So he says it shouldn't delay haunted chocolate

472
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughs]

473
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:39.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>here much. That's what he's saying. So it sounds like he's got a much more sensible, uh,

474
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.860
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, okay. All right, I'll take it. Yeah, I am very...

475
00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:43.280
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Stardew Valley balance, if you

476
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:46.659
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, all right, we'll take that. We'll take them. I definitely miss the news. I'm very back

477
00:36:45.099 --> 00:36:52.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I mean, we're I mean, let's not pretend like we're

478
00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:49.940
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>loyalty podcast. So this all, this all tracks, this all makes sense.

479
00:36:52.420 --> 00:37:02.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>getting it before I try to be. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, look, I

480
00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:04.219
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>wouldn't it's it's always it's hard to

481
00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:06.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>predict these things, but if you gave me an

482
00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:10.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>over under 2030, I would struggle to decide which one I

483
00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:13.679
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I was going for at this point.

484
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, you know, I might, I might agree. Maybe I'll just lock in just 20-30s, call it a day.

485
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:30.599
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think I would do the under on 2030, but I wouldn't do the under on 2028.

486
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Maybe that's the way to go. How much longer?

487
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So 20-29.

488
00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:37.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think 2028/29 is probably what I would be expecting at this point, but I think three years

489
00:37:37.239 --> 00:37:46.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>ago I probably said 2026, so who even knows who even knows when did this game get announced?

490
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So here we are.

491
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:54.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't even know, it's, I feel like I've just heard about it for forever.

492
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in 2021.

493
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Ooh, it hurts.

494
00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I understand.

495
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But, oh, it hurts.

496
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:07.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>on my bad nor it was 2020 began working on it October 2021 was when he announced it. So we are coming

497
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.440
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay. Okay, all right. So maybe, you know, 2028 is sounding pretty good.

498
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>2020, I feel like eight years is sounding pretty...

499
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>that what it was really.

500
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But he's got the game development cycle down, you know?

501
00:38:30.699 --> 00:38:34.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>He knows how to expedite the process a little bit here

502
00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and there, but then also I'm sure he's including

503
00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:39.219
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>like a lot more depth to this game.

504
00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:41.099
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Not that started doesn't already have that,

505
00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:43.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but hopefully those two like balance each other out.

506
00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:46.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So it's like the eight year mark, 2028.

507
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>My bad. It looks like

508
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, well, bye.

509
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Thank you.

510
00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:03.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>five years. Wait, when was it released? He started working on it in 2011 and it was released

511
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:11.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in 2016, so that's five years. But you're probably right, it probably is like a lot of the things

512
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:18.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that he would have added to stars you in updates are probably things you'll want to include

513
00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:24.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>similar sort of things in the base game for this one, right? Like he's got a lot more of

514
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, so he shut the-

515
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>ideas of how he wants games to feel as a whole. I get that.

516
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, definitely. Like there obviously at the end of the day, there's absolutely no

517
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.400
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Russian when it comes, you know, is when it, whenever it comes. And I'm sure it'll be great

518
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:47.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>no matter what, but I wonder, I wonder how like his skills of game development have allowed him

519
00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:54.239
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>to like what, what, what's the, what's the words I'm looking for? He's home the skills. I'm sure

520
00:39:54.239 --> 00:39:59.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>a number of the skills with game development. I wonder how that affects his workflow speed.

521
00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:06.159
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>versus implementing the new ideas that he has. I'm curious to see how that pans out in regards to

522
00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:13.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>like a timeline, because yeah, four, four, point five or five years for a Stardew, we're at this point

523
00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:20.320
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>approaching where we are at about five years for want to chocolate here. So it could be maybe another

524
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:30.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>two years. Who knows? I know. But at least he's not actively working on this one at least.

525
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:25.599
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Who knows it doesn't help that it doesn't help that he keeps doing starchy valley stuff

526
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So that hopefully that gives us some hope.

527
00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:34.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>All right, the other piece of news we've got is faith arm

528
00:40:35.659 --> 00:40:42.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So this complicated history around faith arm is that the company that developed

529
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:56.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Phoenix Labs. They are the people who made dauntless. So they made faith farm and they released it in 2023.

530
00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:06.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then the company basically died. They said that in 2024, they laid off most of their company

531
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and said that they were just going to be focusing on dauntless and faith farm, no other of their

532
00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:16.260
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>games. They canceled multiple games, including one game that was apparently only weeks away from

533
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>from being released in early access.

534
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>What could I vaguely remember hearing about this?

535
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:35.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then, yeah, then in the beginning of this year, they laid off the rest of their development team and announced that they were going to shut down the online components of faith farm and presumably don't look because that's like a basically a fully online game, wasn't it?

536
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, the game servers were shut down to me this year.

537
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:48.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So the online part of faith farm, which was not huge, I didn't actually use the online component at all, but it was shut down a few weeks ago, I think.

538
00:41:48.500 --> 00:42:00.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The, we have found out that apparently faith farm has now been purchased by a company called Gambit digital, who are a collective of.

539
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>figure out what they were, too. I was like, I, they have two games to their name,

<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I'm really fascinated by this like why is it multiple companies that are buying it and also

559
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Gambit

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.679
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I mean they did say they were a collective. So maybe that's part of it. I don't know how these

561
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.400
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah

562
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So it looks like so it looks like Gambit digital digital is a new company that was only founded at the beginning of this month

563
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>that makes sense, considering they only have two games.

564
00:44:31.019 --> 00:44:32.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So that, that makes sense.

565
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.320
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, I can't help with you just a little bit hesitant

566
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.679
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>because of never hearing a game, but digital

567
00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:39.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and them just being so new.

568
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, and hey, we know all in a game.

569
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And how did they get the finances to purchase the game?

570
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh, that's that's always a question for these companies like how did you get finances it's always

571
00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:51.159
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You know, I'm sure they also got financial help

572
00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:52.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>from the game cloud network,

573
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>peer wonder interactive and fatty acid.

574
00:44:56.639 --> 00:44:58.860
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Whoever they are too, I don't know.

575
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I hope, I hope it's good for those that love the game.

576
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:09.639
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But I can't help but be hesitant because there's just not enough information out there as to what all of this means.

577
00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:11.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's all just like buzzwords.

578
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.280
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh no. Fatty acid or a generative AI studio.

579
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.599
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, no.

580
00:45:18.599 --> 00:45:22.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh, bye. What a, what a, that's exactly what we want.

581
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.559
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, no.

582
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, gosh.

583
00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>All right, I don't have much faith.

584
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Good thing my heart is not poured into Fay Farm.

585
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I can't see much about people.

586
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>All I got from GameCloud Network was that they are.

587
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>What seems to be like a mobile game?

588
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.159
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I mean, that makes sense for the name, right?

589
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Like, company?

590
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>True, true, you actually, yeah, very true.

591
00:45:52.679 --> 00:46:01.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>GameCloud Network has brought together global leaders in advertising, enterprise media, and gaming to create a revolutionary way to authentically engage modern consumers.

592
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:11.139
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>that that is all buzzwords to me. That is 1000% all buzzwords.

593
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's all buzzwords to everyone.

594
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:21.139
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh yeah I do see this generative studio. Oh my god. No that I am a generative AI hater.

595
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And what does it mean? What does it mean to be a collective of companies?

596
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:28.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Y'all rich and banded together.

597
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.139
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>because it's not like a company being owned by multiple companies like how, you know, Game Freak is

598
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.219
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, oh, yeah

599
00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:39.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and now Game Freak, the Pokemon companies are a Game Freak or one of the companies.

600
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The Pokemon company is a company, the owns Pokemon, and then there are other companies

601
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that own that company. But having multiple companies owning the rights to

602
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It seems like they all specialize in different things, so like Gambit is the publisher, game cloud, maybe like bringing it to...

603
00:46:59.699 --> 00:47:01.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I- Bay Farm is not a mobile game, right?

604
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:08.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't think so. It's on steam and it's on a switch and I think it's on

605
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, so if it's assuming it's not a mobile confirmed and not a mobile game

606
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Then maybe game cloud is going to be bringing it to mobile

607
00:47:18.099 --> 00:47:22.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Whatever pure wonder interactive is I have not a single clue and then

608
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>What generative AI is going to be used with faith farm?

609
00:47:27.659 --> 00:47:36.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Future game development. I'm not sure. I think they're just all using their different like specialties to come together for the game

610
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:41.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>May or may not make or break the game. I don't know my hands are up in the arms at my

611
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:50.260
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>hands. My arms are up in the air right now because I'm just like I don't know. I don't

612
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:54.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't know what to say, I guess we'll just have to see what happens.

613
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:56.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>know what to say either. Yay!

614
00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:03.980

633
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I know

634
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It looks interesting.

635
00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I mean, obviously I'm going to play it, right?

636
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Let's not pretend anything.

637
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Mm-hmm. Yeah

638
00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:40.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You appear to the like various standard things in farming games like shopkeepers and

639
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.880
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Blacksmiths and stuff exist in this game, but they are pals.

640
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:57.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So the shopkeeper is Patalia, one of the pals, and then the blacksmith is Anubis.

641
00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:05.219
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And there's a cro-crowd-crowdage-ro, who is the master of sunbathing, apparently.

642
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:09.440
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I'm not sure why they show you him fishing, if he's the master of sunbathing.

643
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.719
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It beats me. I mean, you got a sunbathe to fish, right? I think I don't. Sure.

644
00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:17.360
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>>> Sure, sure, whatever, I'm not sure you understand fishing.

645
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:24.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And you're talking to these pals, which I don't think pals talk in

646
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.480
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>power world, so that's an interesting change.

647
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then one of the pals has a chainsaw, which is very on brand for

648
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>power world.

649
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I do think that some of it looks very funny.

650
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's a moment where this pal like starts up the chainsaw and

651
00:50:37.079 --> 00:50:40.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>is going around cut down trees while you're also cut down trees with an axe.

652
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

653
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Why you have the act

654
00:50:42.000 --> 00:51:03.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you've given the pal a chainsaw I don't know but then the the the the tree falls down and squishes another pal which is a very funny moment and then you're apparently playing Russian roulette with some creepy shadow did and then

655
00:50:52.500 --> 00:51:05.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>for a little guy yeah that that makes no sense to me well

656
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:12.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>like I i think this is very much leaning on the same sort of humor and stuff that pal world had and it's clearly trying to be

657
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:27.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>like right at the end of the video you have a pal come up to you and and a very animal crossing way is like talking to you says oh you're the newbie you just moved in you seem pretty cool and then you're player character.

658
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:42.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I know yeah the pal says i'm confident in my ability to reach people be my friend and then the player character gets a pal ball, I can't remember what they call pal or whatever is and throws it at the confused pal and catches it.

659
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:53.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So it's clearly trying to be funny and satirical and well it's working for me so far i'm I'm used I wasn't expecting this.

660
00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:58.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I wasn't expecting this either. Like, this, this genuine, when I saw this in the notes, I was like,

661
00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:08.139
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>oh, oh, interesting. I mean, the game itself looks like really good. I'm just, I'm, I'm just

662
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>[laughs]

663
00:52:08.139 --> 00:52:13.260
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>in the camp of just still being hesitant because of everything that happened in the past.

664
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:20.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So I can't help but just go in with a sense of just, you know what I mean?

665
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But the game itself does look good.

666
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Like, visually very good.

667
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:30.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And the satirical humor, I think, is cute.

668
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I just don't understand this Russian roulette thing.

669
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Like, what are we doing here?

670
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>How does that relate to anything else with farming?

671
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>[laughing]

672
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Why are we Russian rouletteting in a farming game?

673
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But I guess that is the humor of the game, right?

674
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't know.

675
00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:48.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>- Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I'm fascinated.

676
00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Who is this guy?

677
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>He looks like he could be from like Assassin's Creed, but also not.

678
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>not. And I only say that because it was

679
00:52:53.500 --> 00:53:05.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I could see that. I could see that. I'm curious to see how this plays out. I will say that. I'm very

680
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't even feel like it feels like a dragon-coise character to me more like.

681
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:12.940
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>curious to see how this plays out. I'm intrigued. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:14.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, look, whoever happens is going to sell well, because power world did and people are fascinated by this company.

683
00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:18.380
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Uh, yeah, uh, yes.

684
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.260
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughing]

685
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Interestingly, I don't know. I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but the

686
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.260
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Just yes.

687
00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:30.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>announced that, um, power is going to exit early access next year, which is his inference.

688
00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:35.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Um, they also announced that this game is being developed by a different team.

689
00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>as a new team.

690
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:47.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So if you were worried about that, which I'm sure some people would be

691
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:55.780
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Hey, there's that. At least it's not a, it's not another haunted chocolatier type of moment.

692
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:05.280
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, is anything is anything on to joke with your woman. I really am fascinated and I I love to see

693
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:14.860
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Rumor has it there. Oh, so right. Okay. Have read a paragraph here on the island. There is a marketplace run by residents and pals where you can buy and sell crops and crafted goods

694
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Our we're reading the same thing

695
00:54:15.099 --> 00:54:16.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>rare

696
00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:23.639
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Rare items can sometimes be found there. Rumor has it. There's also a forbidden black market hidden away in the islands for our site

697
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>guns suspicious fertilizer

698
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>all sorts of things to trade. The consequences of buying these items are entirely

699
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:43.780
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>crazy. This is nuts. I'm intrigued. I'm intrigued. I'm definitely intrigued.

700
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:51.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Look, I am, at least partially in, I'm definitely something of the monkey or the gun, yeah.

701
00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:51.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I like the little gif of above right above that marketplace thing of just this little guy,

702
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>just yep, this guy just pulling up with yep.

703
00:54:55.539 --> 00:55:01.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>What looks like a shotgun, but apparently is automatic rifle.

704
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I know, yeah! The logistics of it did not make sense.

705
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:28.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I mean, if this game has some like real ethical questions that make you decide things and you can get benefits from that. But you also then have to deal with the consequences of it. I, I'm, yeah, let's go for it. If there are consequences for me giving a pal of chainsaw.

706
00:55:09.099 --> 00:55:12.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, you know what, true. It doesn't have to make sense.

707
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.480
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>We'll see what happened.

708
00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:36.519
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I also find it interesting, this is a third person.

709
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:41.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>game because pow world is first person.

710
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:50.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh yeah, that's right. Maybe it's because it's being developed by someone else. It also, like, generally farming games are third person, so they probably did that for that reason.

711
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. There are first person farming games, but yeah, I don't like one.

712
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I can't even think of one off the top of my head.

713
00:55:55.579 --> 00:55:58.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>All right. Well, there we go. That's, that's the thing.

714
00:56:01.739 --> 00:56:06.219
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Do you have anything to talk about with a poco pia before we go on to the main topic?

715
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:16.360
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>with Pocopia. Oh, man. Um, um, I'm, I'm, I'm losing all of my time to that. I know that for sure.

716
00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:09.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Let it know. I'm let, let's let poco come on farming game.

717
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:12.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That's a no.

718
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:21.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>As long as it's good. I, I don't, I just don't know what the gameplay mechanic is going to be.

719
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I hope it's not just, well, you know, I'll still take it, but I hope it's not just

720
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Hannibal Crossing, copy and paste the Pokemon, but I will, I will still happily take it, if that's

721
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>the case. Um, I'm looking forward to it. I'm definitely looking forward to it, and I'm definitely

722
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:38.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm actually going to be...

723
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>losing, I'm sure, a lot of time in the game, regardless of how good it is.

724
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>'Cause it looks very cute. I just hope it doesn't feel empty.

725
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's my only concern, but...

726
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.159
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, yeah, I'm very intrigued to see how it ends up. It looks very much like a dragon quest builders to to me

727
00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:59.039
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Which is a more involved than animal

728
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:22.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, so that's good. I've never played Dragon Quest to be fair, so I'm not familiar, but if you say it seems like it's going to be more involved, and that's nice to hear, because again, yeah, I just don't want it to be, I don't want it to feel like empty and feel like so slow, like Animal Crossing does when you first start.

729
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:26.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh, yeah, I mean, I think a huge part of that is is it just being like real-time based

730
00:57:27.619 --> 00:57:29.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That massively slows down

731
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>What you can do in any?

732
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You know gaming session

733
00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I highly doubt

734
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:47.940
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, I think so too. It would be kind of nice actually to have kind of the essence of animal crossing

735
00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:54.900
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>in the sense of like real time-based, but still a way to be able to play as much as you want.

736
00:57:55.699 --> 00:57:59.380
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't know what that would look like, but that would be nice, but I'm also not expecting

737
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:05.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I think the problem is it's hard to do crops on that sort of thing and and not

738
00:58:07.099 --> 00:58:11.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because if you it's real time, right, it doesn't make any sense for the crops to grow in a day

739
00:58:12.099 --> 00:58:15.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And so you're massively reducing how much you can do in any

740
00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:18.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>in any week right like

741
00:58:20.099 --> 00:58:25.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It just changes how you think about things and I certainly would not like that

742
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think it only works in an animal crossing because it's such a small part.

743
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.519
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, yeah, it's a good point. Okay. Yeah, I don't know yeah

744
00:58:32.519 --> 00:58:35.760
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't know what that would look even if you use like fertilizer or something

745
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.760
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't even know if that would

746
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.239
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>be able to

747
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:44.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Speed up anything because again, like you said the real-time aspect does kind of put a hindrance on that

748
00:58:45.239 --> 00:58:47.239
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But either way I

749
00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:52.960
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You could give me anything and I would be happy just because it's a cozy Pokemon game. I don't care

750
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>[laughs]

751
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:58.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I am I am weak. I am losing again all of my time to it. I I am I'm happy

752
00:58:59.719 --> 00:59:01.719
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm looking forward to it a lot

753
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:07.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yep. All right, let's go on to the main topic of the podcast and that is Firefly Village.

754
00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:17.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I started this game playing this game on the 18th of September. It is currently the 23rd of

755
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:24.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>September and I have 100% of the game. It took me seven hours to do that.

756
00:59:26.539 --> 00:59:31.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Aslan, I know you were planning on possibly putting an hour or so of time into this

757
00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:37.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>game, did you manage to do that at all?

758
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.059
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I did not, unfortunately, I wanted to before recording,

759
00:59:37.059 --> 00:59:40.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but because of my running around this morning,

760
00:59:40.019 --> 00:59:45.019
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I was not able to, but knowing that you were able

761
00:59:45.019 --> 00:59:48.380
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>to get the game done that quickly,

762
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>does put this on my radar, higher, 'cause it looks cute.

763
00:59:51.500 --> 01:00:01.820
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So, yeah, so let's, so introduction, it is basically a very simple

764
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But I'll let you talk about it more

765
00:59:54.699 --> 00:59:57.619
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>before I talk about what it looks like.

766
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>stargy lake. So it's, it's, it's very clearly taking a lot of, you know,

767
01:00:07.739 --> 01:00:16.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>influence from stargy valley. You take over a farm, you start growing crops, you have a

768
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>village where you have other people that you talk to, and you build up your farm,

769
01:00:21.659 --> 01:00:27.099
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>there's relationships, blah blah blah, all the usual things. But what I would say I guess is

770
01:00:27.099 --> 01:00:33.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>it is all of those things simple, and it's very deliberately simple. And I find that very

771
01:00:33.739 --> 01:00:40.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>interesting. It's not, it doesn't feel incomplete, but it feels very deliberately simple. So I will get

772
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.099
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>into that in the examples in the mechanics, but I guess that's just how I wanted to talk about the

773
01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:51.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>game as a whole. Starting off kind of visuals-wise is obviously pixel art.

774
01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:59.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you know, not, not top down, not side-on, there was a 45 degrees on, I don't know how you would describe

775
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, the classic.

776
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:09.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>45 degree angle pixel art grid based game. Your, your standard stargy like visuals.

777
01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:16.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The, it does however have like character art for when you're in the portraits, when you're talking to

778
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:21.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>them, which a lot of games have done recently as well. Um, it's

779
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:27.179
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>kind of what you see is what you get. If you look up on, on steam, um, what you see there is

780
01:01:27.179 --> 01:01:32.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>exactly what you'll, you'll, you'll end up with. It's not more or less than that. It's very much,

781
01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:39.980
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you know, fair advertising on the visuals aspect. Um, and control-wise, it feels very similar

782
01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>to stargy as well. You're kind of like moving in a grid based aspect. It took me a little bit of

783
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:48.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>time to get used to the controls just because I feel like there's a little bit more of a delay

784
01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:51.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>on stopping moving than I would expect normally.

785
01:01:51.500 --> 01:02:03.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So quite often I would like move one square more than I was expecting, but that you get, yeah, well, just like when you let when you let go of the button and moves more than you would have expected to after stopping pressing the button. Right.

786
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, interesting. Okay.

787
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:13.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But I think that's just something you get used to very quickly, right, because you just your brain starts to adapt to that and you start lifting it earlier than you normally would have.

788
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:21.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Other than that is pretty standard. This is where we get into I'm going to talk about the days and the seasons. This is where we get into.

789
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:39.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But some of the simplicity of it. So the, the days feel a little bit shorter than stardew. I haven't actually timed it, but it feels like maybe you're getting like five to six minutes in a day, where does I think stardew is like 11 minutes in a day, something like that.

790
01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:51.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It is, it is a fast day, but generally that doesn't feel faster than you would want because everything is scaled down massively, right, like scale off.

791
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Ok.

792
01:02:51.500 --> 01:03:01.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Village things that there are to do stuff like that is massively scaled down. You don't feel like you feel like you've got enough time to do what you want to do.

793
01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Ok.

794
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:08.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Seasons are seven days. So a week is a season.

795
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:21.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's some interesting advantages and some disadvantages. So the advantage I guess is that you can very quickly get through a year and it's quite satisfying to get through a year.

796
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:50.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I suspect most people who play stardew valley don't ever get through a full year. I suspect they kind of get to like middle of autumn or fall and kind of that's done right because most people don't complete things, but it would be very easy to get through a year, you know, very quickly. Like if you were like playing as a session, you could probably get through a year in about an hour and a half.

797
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh wow.

798
01:03:51.500 --> 01:04:07.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Which feels very satisfying to me being able to do it that quickly and get through everything. I guess one of the disadvantages of it is if you don't get things done at the beginning of the season, you're not going to get them done right because you like some things take five days to grow.

799
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:21.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>If you don't plan to on the first day or the second day or the third day, that's it, you can't grow it that season. So having said that, because you then only have, you know, 21 days to wait till the seasons back.

800
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:51.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Again, it doesn't feel frustrating. Like I had done. So I did two full years and I had almost everything done, but there was like one thing I hadn't done in summer. And so I like sped run speed run speed run. I very quickly went. I very quickly did spring so I could get to summer and then do the thing that I'd missed the previous summer because it's just seven days. It's really easy to do that.

801
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't know what the phrase is either.

802
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So you would do you mind if I ask a question before you keep going?

803
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So it doesn't feel because I guess my like reading the description of the game of it,

804
01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:04.400
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>saying a bite-sized streamline farming sim made me think that it potentially could feel rushed.

805
01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:10.159
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So would you say it's like that perfect pace? Is it a good middle ground of like feeling like it's

806
01:05:10.159 --> 01:05:15.679
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>moving? It really is a streamline game, but doesn't feel like forced or rushed.

807
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think it depends on what you're looking for, right?

808
01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like, I could see some people feeling it's rushed

809
01:05:22.739 --> 01:05:25.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>because, you know, I 100% did it in seven hours.

810
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That is fast, right?

811
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.260
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I can totally see why some people were like,

812
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that's too fast.

813
01:05:32.739 --> 01:05:34.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I want slower.

814
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.860
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Having said that, like, you can take it slower, right?

815
01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:43.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like, obviously, there is a setting for making your days slower.

816
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because I didn't feel the need to.

817
01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:52.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But I can see why someone wanted to do that.

818
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.059
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And it's not like you're forced to do any of the things

819
01:05:55.059 --> 01:05:55.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>quickly, right?

820
01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.900
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like, I got to the point where I was trying to do it

821
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>reasonably quickly so that I could, you know,

822
01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:04.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>have done a decent amount before the podcast.

823
01:06:04.579 --> 01:06:07.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then I realized I was like, you know,

824
01:06:07.699 --> 01:06:09.099
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>60% through the game.

825
01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:11.019
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And I was like, oh, well, never really want to complete

826
01:06:11.019 --> 01:06:13.780
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>everything before the podcast regarding, right?

827
01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.940
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I...

828
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I've rushed through everything to do that. You could absolutely expand this out quite a lot and take it much slower.

829
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I also have a problem where I tend to speedrun the first.

830
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>We bet of farming games anyway because I find when you can't do a huge amount quite boring.

831
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I will do my crops and I'll do the kind of basic things that you need to do to, you know, build up relationships and stuff like that.

832
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then I'll just go to sleep. I'll go to sleep at like, you know, midday in spring one.

833
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

834
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Uh, just to kind of like speed things off.

835
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I didn't feel the need to do that in this one because obviously one the days are quicker and to there's just more happening quicker.

836
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So yeah, I guess it just depends on what you're looking for, but you could definitely do that.

837
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:08.179
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>that they give you the option because that would be my one point of concern. I think I would

838
01:07:08.179 --> 01:07:12.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>enjoy the fact that it's like moving at a good pace like moving pretty quickly and I don't mind.

839
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:18.179
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>The fact that it takes seven hours to 100% the game. But if I was in like another move where I

840
01:07:18.179 --> 01:07:23.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>moved, where I did want to take things slower, I would have been curious if it felt like the game

841
01:07:23.699 --> 01:07:28.980
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>was rushing me. But it's nice to know that you have the option to like make the game feel slower if you

842
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:34.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, they've got standard day length and relaxed day length.

843
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Nice, okay, that's good to hear.

844
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.860
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Mechanics wise, there's quite a few interesting things they do here,

845
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:44.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and I will you will continue to hear the theme of simplified.

846
01:07:44.619 --> 01:07:47.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I guess maybe streamlined is probably, that's what they use.

847
01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:52.139
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I get why they're using that phrase, but also I do feel like it's accurate

848
01:07:52.139 --> 01:07:57.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>to say simplified as well, like it's all simple.

849
01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>farming wise.

850
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:05.179
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It is the standard loop, you throw down a seed, you water it, you water it the next

851
01:08:05.179 --> 01:08:09.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>day, and then after a certain number of days, you harvest it.

852
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:15.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I guess you don't have, I can never remember the right word, not owing, telling the land,

853
01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:19.979
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you don't tell the land, it's automatic.

854
01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:25.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's not like, there's, you don't sow seeds on individual plots, you, you sow them

855
01:08:25.579 --> 01:08:31.180
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>pair a three by three plot so you like you choose a seed

856
01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:36.619
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and it will automatically go to the three by three plot so it kind of speeds that up a little bit.

857
01:08:36.619 --> 01:08:46.140
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You've essentially got then six plots of farming land each of which is a three by three and so you

858
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:56.220
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>buy six seeds and then you saw those six seeds and that gives you are was it nine by six plot of land

859
01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:59.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and probably not doing justice. This is lots of numbers.

860
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:07.020
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I lost you like five numbers ago. I'm terrible with numbers. I'm just like looking up into the

861
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:18.060
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But basically, you're not sewing them on an individual square basis.

862
01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:26.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>ceiling to be like 9x5, 3x4, like what is going on. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I can work with that.

863
01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:23.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You're doing a three by three block. So if you choose a seed, it automatically throws it to

864
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:31.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>three by three, rather than doing each individual square.

865
01:09:26.699 --> 01:09:28.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I can understand that okay

866
01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:38.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Watering is exactly as you expect. You can either one watering can upgrade.

867
01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:45.100
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The first watering can does a one square. You're like water each individual squares individually.

868
01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:51.979
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But then you get there's a one upgrade that is a three by three. So that speeds things up.

869
01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:57.020
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But it's still again very simple, right? You wake up in the morning, you go see your plants,

870
01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you water them and then.

871
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:08.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Eventually, one of the days you'll you'll harvest them, which can it be anything from two days to five days, I think, depending on which plant is.

872
01:10:08.739 --> 01:10:16.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But it's exactly what you would expect other than the three by three plot being automatic, everything else is exactly the same, right?

873
01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:26.819
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You sow the seed you water it, you harvest it. It's farming. One more, do you want? There aren't any more of the complicated things, though, there's no like fertilizer and stuff like that.

874
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Bear bear

875
01:10:26.659 --> 01:10:31.020
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, you don't really need it because if everything goes by so fast anyway as I would I would

876
01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:41.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, exactly, and it doesn't have like quality of it. It's just you have a crop, you have a crop, right? Like, if you have a tobacco, it's a tomato.

877
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yes. Yeah.

878
01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:49.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>If you're trying to be a, you know, a streamlined farming game, you don't add things like that. I totally get why that that's not there.

879
01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:59.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh, I forgot about an overall thing, your bag. This is the one thing I don't like about the bag, but I get why they've done it, but I still don't like it. There aren't, there's no stack.

880
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:16.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So if you have six tomatoes, that takes up six spaces, not a fan of that. But having said that, there's very little you do with things in this game, other than sell them.

881
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>What? No.

882
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:27.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So essentially, you pick up your tomatoes and you throw them straight in the shipping bin. So you don't tend to be storing anything, but that's good because the storage in this game is terrible, right?

883
01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>your bag is your

884
01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:40.680
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>11, I see 11. I'm watching the pre-recorded broadcast on the Steam page as we're talking.

885
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:37.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>bag is get this 11 spaces you can store 11 things in your bag

886
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm just watching the gameplay. I just saw the 11 spots that you have.

887
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, yeah, so it's a three by four grid, but one of them is taken up by the bin. So it's not 12. It's a living

888
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:56.020
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh my gosh. Okay. It's not terrible because of everything else you've said, but I'm just like,

889
01:11:53.319 --> 01:11:55.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Really silly, but

890
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:59.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>oh, if we could just get like a little patch for that, that would be kind.

891
01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:03.640
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, and I was I was I was very annoyed by that initially and then I was like, oh, you know what?

892
01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.880
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's fine because of everything else in the game kind of pushing you towards like just get it done

893
01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:12.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>the you can buy.

894
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:41.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>one chest and that gives you 12 spaces in it. I think it's 12 rather than 11. Let me check. I've got the game running here. Nope. That's a living as well. The noise six. It's six. My bad. It's six. The chest is six. The chest is also like 4000 monies. It's very expensive compared to a lot of things in the game. So I didn't buy the chest till the end of the game because there was no point. I wasn't really using it for anything either.

895
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's six, even less.

896
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like the only

897
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There is one big disadvantage to this storage and that is if you go and buy a bunch of seeds

898
01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.180
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because you don't think about the storage, right? You go buy 11 seeds because that's how many can store though

899
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.800
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You shouldn't be buying 11 but let's say you buy 11 seeds because you buy them actually

900
01:12:57.159 --> 01:13:02.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>No, you actually know I just remembered that this it doesn't let you buy more than six seeds at once

901
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because that's how many you can you can so but if you buy six and then you buy another six

902
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You have to keep those in storage

903
01:13:11.079 --> 01:13:12.979
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And because they won't stack.

904
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:27.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You now have six out of your living spaces in your inventory stored up, unless you have the chest, in which case your entire chest is full of seeds, until the next time you can use them, which might be 21 days.

905
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Right? Because of your seasons.

906
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Goodness. Yeah.

907
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:43.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So, it's not a big problem, but if you're not thinking about things early on, you might be in the position where you either have to sell seeds you've just bought, or, or...

908
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:42.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

909
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:51.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>have terrible storage for the next year.

910
01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.220
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughs]

911
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, definitely noted for myself,

912
01:13:50.539 --> 01:13:52.939
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>'cause I likely will eventually play this game.

913
01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:55.819
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So definitely, definitely noted.

914
01:13:55.819 --> 01:13:57.180
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, yup, my bag is full.

915
01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.100
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, I watched that happen with all the turnips.

916
01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.779
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, okay, at least the shipment chest

917
01:14:02.779 --> 01:14:03.899
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is like right there too,

918
01:14:03.899 --> 01:14:08.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but that is overall like frustrating

919
01:14:08.579 --> 01:14:11.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and I don't see a reason why.

920
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:17.439
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You shouldn't be able to stack things in your storage.

921
01:14:17.439 --> 01:14:26.260
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Like I know the game is encouraging you to keep going and again just bringing it back to that streamlined gameplay loop.

922
01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:32.739
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But I feel like you can still have a streamlined gameplay loop but allow at least stacking in your back.

923
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I do think it would, I think it would be better to have stacking.

924
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I don't think it would hurt the game in any way.

925
01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:45.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's no stamina in this game. It's purely the time. So if you have the time to do a

926
01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>thing, you can do the thing.

927
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, that's nice, actually.

928
01:14:48.319 --> 01:14:54.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I am, yeah, I'm definitely moving towards the, I, I do think that you should either have

929
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.380
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>If I want to mine forever.

930
01:14:55.119 --> 01:15:01.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>stamina or time, uh, automatic time. And I, it was the one thing I liked about

931
01:15:01.319 --> 01:15:03.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you could do that island or wherever it was called.

932
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That terrible game. The one thing I liked about that was it flipped that

933
01:15:08.079 --> 01:15:13.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>around and it had stamina but it didn't have time like you just decided

934
01:15:13.279 --> 01:15:18.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>when it was the end of the day and I'd like more more games to kind of play

935
01:15:18.399 --> 01:15:24.800
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>around with that idea but it does annoy me now when games have both and it's like

936
01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I have a limited amount of time but I also have a limited amount of stamina and

937
01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And so it's like, what are you focusing on doing?

938
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:46.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And it's like, if you use up all your stamina, you don't feel like you should just go to bed straight away because you also have limited, having those two limitations, they're always in competition with each other and I don't like that.

939
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:57.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah. I agree. I'm the same way. I mean, there's there's definitely a reason why I installed mods for Stardew was to be able to give myself the option.

940
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:08.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>If I want to keep mining for the entire day, but let the time run, I could just turn on the mod and click unlimited stamina and I could just keep mining if I want to if that's what I'm feeling in that moment.

941
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:16.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So I also wish that more games played around with either or of those and allowed for like more.

942
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>More flexibility, depending on your preferred playstyle.

943
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yep, yup, yup, yup.

944
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:28.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>For me, it's like the essence of like limited time takes away from the coziness of a game for me because I feel pressured.

945
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Even though I know I don't I know I don't actually have to, but like I still can't help but feel that pressure because of the time clicking.

946
01:16:34.000 --> 01:17:03.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, yeah. I think that's the thing is like I'm fine with either of them existing, but only one of them, because you know, having a limitation makes sense in your game, but having two of them makes it like especially as you say in cozy games, having two of them makes it doubly stressful, because like in this game, when the time runs out, you're like, okay, fine. I did all the things I needed to do today, and yeah, I didn't get everything done I wanted to, but it's fine because I've not wasted stamina.

947
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah. Yeah.

948
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.800
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because the stamina doesn't exist, and I used up all my time, and I was doing things the entire time in that time, so it's not like I wasted anything.

949
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:27.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Whereas the problem is it's like when you run out of stamina and you either have to go to bed or have to, you know, eat something to give you more stamina, you feel like you're wasting something, because you're like to take advantage of this limited resource, I have to use up a different limited resource.

950
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

951
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Mm-hmm.

952
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah.

953
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.279
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I definitely, you are, you are preaching to the choir right now. I want 1,000% agree,

954
01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:42.960
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>and that has been a big issue for me, I think, with truly, truly getting into, like, more farming games in general,

955
01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is it just, it's, it's like shuffling of resources and feeling like the pressure.

956
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Even though I know it's not actually supposed to be pressure, like you can do whatever you want,

957
01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:56.640
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>you could do absolutely nothing but me being me.

958
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. It's still an arbitrary number that it's taking down the entire time.

959
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, I can't exactly. I can't help but feel the pressure.

960
01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:12.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>For sure. Yeah. So I like that animals. So this is an interesting one. So you can have a dog.

961
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughing]

962
01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's a dog. The dog does nothing else doesn't exist, but you don't have to, you know,

963
01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>have to do anything for them either. So that's fine. You just, you know, say hello to him in the

964
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>morning. He has a little love heart. All good. You move on with your day. Um,

965
01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:31.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>there are cows and chickens. You can buy three cows and three chickens. Um,

966
01:18:31.399 --> 01:18:35.640
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you don't have to feed them. You interact with them once a day to get their buy

967
01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:43.800
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>product and they're happy. And that's it. Pretty much. Um, you can also buy our mayonnaise

968
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Huh, okay, that's simple.

969
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:50.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>machine and our cheese machine. Um, but it's just you interact with it and it automatically

970
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>turns everyone you have in storage in your bag into that thing.

971
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So if you interact with it and you have one egg, you get one mayonnaise. If you

972
01:18:58.119 --> 01:19:03.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>interact you have three eggs you get three mayonnaise. But that's pretty much it.

973
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:22.359
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay. That's nice that it lets you do everything in one go rather than like you have to make one mayonnaise at a time, individually, you can make three in one go if you have the three with you. That's nice, but I guess you also have to be careful if you didn't want to make mayonnaise or multiple mayonnaise and you just want to one. Now you just made for five.

974
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't think, yeah, I don't think you care, right?

975
01:19:24.079 --> 01:19:28.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The only time I think you would actually care is if for some reason you wanted to make a fried egg

976
01:19:28.079 --> 01:19:32.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>because there's cooking in this game. But like, there are three things you can do with an egg.

977
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:41.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You can sell it for like 60 or you can turn into mayonnaise and sell it for 100 or you can turn it

978
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Okay.

979
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:48.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>into a fried egg and sell it for 70. So it's like, why are you doing anything other than turning

980
01:19:46.279 --> 01:19:47.119
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Oh.

981
01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.560
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and to me, it is.

982
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:58.640
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I made exactly one fried egg and it was for the achievement.

983
01:19:50.239 --> 01:19:51.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Yeah, you know what?

984
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>All rosely to mayonnaise, got it.

985
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:09.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'll see if you're the achievement hunter then you're doing the fried egg otherwise you're rolling in mayonnaise

986
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>exactly.

987
01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:14.640
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Because there is cooking in this game, the cooking is very simple, streamlined, if

988
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:23.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you will, you interact with the kitchen, you choose one piece of food and it either turns

989
01:20:23.279 --> 01:20:26.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>into a different piece of food or nothing happens.

990
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:32.359
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You can do three things a day, so you can do three cooking's a day in total, and some

991
01:20:32.359 --> 01:20:34.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>things turn into food and some don't.

992
01:20:34.319 --> 01:20:35.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>with you if you... if you...

993
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:56.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>if you interact with an egg, it turns into a fried egg, if you interact with a tomato, it turns into a tomato soup, if you interact with corn, it turns into popcorn, if you interact with lettuce, it turns into coleslaw, if you interact with cheese, it does nothing, if you interact with milk, it does nothing, these things are just things.

994
01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:59.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>If you interact with, if you interact with lettuce and you don't have mayonnaise, you still

995
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:16.220
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>get coleslaw, double the mayonnaise, oh, all roads lead to mayonnaise, you're just rolling in mayonnaise,

996
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You do. It's one item, one thing. It's obviously a very... it's obviously a very simple...

997
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>coleslaw. As you say, everything... everything leads to mayonnaise.

998
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The coleslaw is very funny as well. It looks like it's like rainbow colored.

999
01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:24.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>oh, mayonnaise, that's

1000
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't know what to say.

1001
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:31.939
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>it. Very big.

1002
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Mayonnaise.

1003
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>All roads indeed mayonnaise is obviously this episode title.

1004
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>mining is a pretty much

1005
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Thank God. That's so good. That's so good. I'd be a wreck

1006
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.600
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, yeah. So...

1007
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:17.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>possible to store that all with their. But the ores the ores do count towards your storage, but you don't use them for anything other than gifts and selling.

1008
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:26.460
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, all right, so the separate storage for wood and rocks is that just an unlimited storage or is that also limited?

1009
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:33.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't know. I never went higher than 230 because I didn't need more than that and by the

1010
01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:39.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>time I needed that much I'd already used at all. It's only for house upgrades and the top

1011
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:39.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay. All right. Cool.

1012
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:50.460
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>one is 200 of each. So yeah, I suspect if there is a limit, it's like $9.99 and you

1013
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay. That's in my brain. That's basically all emitted.

1014
01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay.

1015
01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay.

1016
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:57.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>don't need more than like 800 in the entire game. I'm not going to find out if the

1017
01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Cool. All right.

1018
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>there's a limit. I'm not wasting time. Because it's one, it's one rock gives you one rock.

1019
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>No, that's totally okay. If anything, that might.

1020
01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.979
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I'd have to do a thousand rocks. I'm not doing that.

1021
01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:24.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That might be, it may or may not be if I am able to find more time and I'm not running around as much, that might be something that I may try to investigate because I love mining. So that could be a personal projects. Yeah.

1022
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:29.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That's the real grinding for you.

1023
01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That could be my personal project.

1024
01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:33.060
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Fishing is basically animal crossing fishing.

1025
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:41.859
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So you see a shadow in the water, you real, you cast, there you go, you cast your fishing

1026
01:23:41.859 --> 01:23:44.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>into the water.

1027
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You see an exclamation mark, you press the button, you reel in.

1028
01:23:47.079 --> 01:23:49.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's different like fish.

1029
01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.159
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think there's like 12 fish or something like that.

1030
01:23:53.159 --> 01:23:54.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I lost track.

1031
01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Okay, here's my real complaint about this game.

1032
01:23:57.119 --> 01:24:03.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There is no list of what fish and crops you've got and which ones you haven't caught.

1033
01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:06.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's very annoying because it's like there is an achievement to catch one of every fish.

1034
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But I was like, I don't know which fish I've caught and which ones I've not caught.

1035
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.039
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, yeah. That is. I guess you'd have to break out an Excel sheet.

1036
01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:12.159
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And that's very annoying.

1037
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.359
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I would like a list of all the fish I've got.

1038
01:24:15.359 --> 01:24:18.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, I mean, I even then, how would I know what I've done before?

1039
01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:22.359
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't know why I've done in the past if there's no log of it, right?

1040
01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.399
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You got it. You got to manually type out the Excel sheet. Every time you catch a fish.

1041
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.359
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But no, even then, I would, but you'd have to know beforehand to do that.

1042
01:24:30.359 --> 01:24:35.439
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I spent a year in game not knowing there wasn't a list and not knowing that I'd even existed.

1043
01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, I know.

1044
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, that, that, that, I...

1045
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:48.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I would agree. That's, that's pretty nuts that there's no list in game, especially since the achievement exists. Yeah, the achievement exists.

1046
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.359
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>because clearly they're keeping track of it, they're keeping track of it. Tell me, tell me what I have.

1047
01:24:50.899 --> 01:24:52.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>That is valid. That is very valid.

1048
01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:57.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>What? The village layout is quite simple. You've got your farm and then there's like the town

1049
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:05.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and then there's a foresty area with like a river. There's a shop for buying seeds and stuff

1050
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>from. There's an animal shop and then there's kind of your usual people around and about and

1051
01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>the usual archetypes. The shop is

1052
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>interesting. This one is also very similar to Animal Crossing. It will start like four items a day,

1053
01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and they're randomly generated. But that adds to the annoyance of the seasons being seven days,

1054
01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:34.479
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>right? Because this is why it took me so long to do tomatoes, specifically for the cooking

1055
01:25:34.479 --> 01:25:42.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>achievement. I hadn't done tomato soup because I didn't have the cooking facilities because that's

1056
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>like the first house upgrade and have that in the first

1057
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:58.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>car here and then the second year I was trying to do all of the cooking as I was going so I was like growing all of the crops I could I didn't get tomatoes in the shop until day four of the season and they take five days to grow.

1058
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So I just couldn't grow tomatoes that year.

1059
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.439
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, yeah.

1060
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:11.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That was really annoying is like why am I not the first day I was like okay fine I've not got them today not the end of the world I'll get them I might get them tomorrow.

1061
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>go in the second date, still not there.

1062
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:24.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And it's impossible for me to grow them.

1063
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:29.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think I also would agree with your complaint there,

1064
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:36.619
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but I'm a little bit more lax on that in the sense that at least like, it's a cozy

1065
01:26:36.619 --> 01:26:43.960
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>game at the end of the day. You're not supposed to rush it. So like, sure, but like, no, I

1066
01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:45.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>rush it. I would, I'd already done a bunch of it. This was me trying to finish the achievements,

1067
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Go!

1068
01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and I had to just speedrun a year to get the next season so I could actually grow the tomatoes.

1069
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:54.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, but the grind of farming, I thought you liked farming!

1070
01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:59.060
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I had done literally everything else in the game by this point.

1071
01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.840
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But you gotta keep grinding your farming, you know? It's therapeutic, you know? It's cozy!

1072
01:27:06.739 --> 01:27:09.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I spent a lot of time sleeping that year. Let's put it that way.

1073
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I was hibernating.

1074
01:27:12.039 --> 01:27:16.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>You're a sleep your character caught up all the

1075
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:27.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>your character caught up on all the lost sleep over the past two years and the third year just trying to make to all the energy preservation with sleeping when into the tomato soup that you made.

1076
01:27:26.979 --> 01:27:30.579
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>That was an amazing tomato soup, the whole one bowl of it I made.

1077
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Gonna be have like gold flex in it. It's a sprinkling of truffle like.

1078
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:46.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There are festivals in the game. They're on specific days and they're specific things.

1079
01:27:47.859 --> 01:27:50.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I won't say too much about them because I feel like that would kind of

1080
01:27:51.779 --> 01:27:59.380
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>ruin the story for people. But they're fun. I enjoyed them. The tie-in to the characters a lot,

1081
01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:05.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and again, I'm not going to talk about individual characters, but I found most of the characters

1082
01:28:05.699 --> 01:28:10.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>interesting and fun to get to know. They are similar

1083
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:21.939
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>to everything else in the game. They are simplified, streamlined, sorry, but they were fun and a lot of them are kind of, you know,

1084
01:28:21.939 --> 01:28:39.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>trophy caricatures as they're not on the level of stargy, but they were they were fun anyway. The relationship system is the max of three hearts and it's basically just by gifting them.

1085
01:28:40.659 --> 01:29:09.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There are gifts that they will dislike and there are gifts that they will love, but I found that most items most people liked. So it took quite a while for me to find a gift that someone disliked or that they loved, but you do get it and you get quite a big boost for a love and you do get a downgrade for dislike and it was very sad when I first gave someone something they disliked and I'm like, whoa, what was this reaction? My word, calm down.

1086
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:22.220
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is there is when you find out that character dislikes, I guess in this case mushrooms, for example,

1087
01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:15.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I'm sorry that I didn't know you didn't like mushrooms, right? You never told me that.

1088
01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:30.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>is there a documentation anywhere in the game or is that also lacking? Okay, question answered.

1089
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:35.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>What do you think, yeah, no, I would like, this goes back to the same thing about the fishing

1090
01:29:35.779 --> 01:29:40.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>thing. I would like more documentation of this stuff. I'd like a list of the characters and their

1091
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, I guess noted for myself to just take physical notes.

1092
01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:48.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>heart levels and what I've learned about them that would be nice. They do tell, yeah, they do

1093
01:29:48.739 --> 01:29:53.699
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>also tell you in just conversation sometimes, like they'll be like, oh, I did have one guy tell me

1094
01:29:53.699 --> 01:29:56.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that he didn't like sunflower seeds at one point, and I was like, "Oh!"

1095
01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:26.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's interesting, I wonder why he's told me that, and then I realized this, because he doesn't want you to give him sunflower seeds, and you know, I've had people tell me, like, "Oh, I love this," or whatever. It's great. It's kind of like, just generic text as you're talking to them, but it's there. But you've got to

1096
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Okay, good to know.

1097
01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:20.279
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, definitely I would just have a little notebook

1098
01:30:20.279 --> 01:30:22.520
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>or like a little Excel sheet or something

1099
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.819
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah.

1100
01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:25.340
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Excel probably feels over the top.

1101
01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:28.659
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's like four relationships.

1102
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.239
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, so physical notes are notes in my phone or something.

1103
01:30:31.779 --> 01:30:34.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, it's four characters and they all have,

1104
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think, one dislike and one love.

1105
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.539
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But it's fine.

1106
01:30:40.539 --> 01:30:43.819
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It was fun, so once you get them to one star,

1107
01:30:43.819 --> 01:30:46.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>they'll ask you if you wanna go in and hang out,

1108
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.380
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and you have a little cutscene with them.

1109
01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:49.899
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And then when you get them to three stars,

1110
01:30:49.899 --> 01:30:51.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So don't do it again and don't.

1111
01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:59.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Talk about how much they like you and there's very definitely some flirting happening, but there's no explicit

1112
01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:10.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Romantic rest their relationships, but at least one of them was very much flirting with you and it's clear there's something there, but there's no

1113
01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:19.899
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, does it feel like this game because I did notice that this or firefly village was

1114
01:31:20.659 --> 01:31:23.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>The first game it seems like for this to this developer

1115
01:31:24.619 --> 01:31:29.439
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Does it feel like there could be a follow-up game in regards to these characters?

1116
01:31:29.439 --> 01:31:35.899
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So does it seem like it's like kind of a standalone game since you said that it just kind of like alludes to a romantic something something

1117
01:31:35.899 --> 01:31:37.899
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But doesn't like explicitly

1118
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I would be more likely, I think, that they would update the game rather than another game that

1119
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>- Right, okay, that's a better question.

1120
01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:50.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>includes that. I don't, I don't think the characters are interesting enough to be like,

1121
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>oh, here there's the Firefly Village Extended Universe. It would be fun to have a little bit more

1122
01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.399
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>[laughs]

1123
01:31:57.199 --> 01:31:58.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>with the characters, but that's, that's about it.

1124
01:31:59.699 --> 01:32:01.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

1125
01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.300
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, that's that's actually a better question.

1126
01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:09.699
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So you can see this game potentially having like a future update whether it's free update or DLC or...

1127
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:39.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't want to pressure any end of indie dev to do anything like that, but I feel like if there was an update that included, you know, further relationship progression and a few other things, then I could see that it would feel natural, it wouldn't feel

1128
01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:35.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, cool. Good to know. Yeah, obviously we're not expecting it or like saying with this need DLC blah, blah, blah

1129
01:32:35.579 --> 01:32:42.560
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>It's just more so like does it feel like it could potentially happen if the opportunity to present itself which seems to be the case

1130
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:36.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>No, no, no.

1131
01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I think, yeah, yeah.

1132
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.439
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I mean, I think for what the game is,

1133
01:32:46.439 --> 01:32:51.439
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>like it costs nine dollars, I think, seven pounds.

1134
01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It is, it feels very much worth it.

1135
01:32:55.399 --> 01:32:57.439
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's a fun little experience, right?

1136
01:32:57.439 --> 01:32:59.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Like, you're not expecting for that amount of money

1137
01:32:59.399 --> 01:33:02.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>to have a stargy experience.

1138
01:33:02.279 --> 01:33:05.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>It's from a single day, I mean, I know stargy was as well,

1139
01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>it feels, streamlined as the right term for it.

1140
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.439
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And I have very much enjoyed it.

1141
01:33:14.439 --> 01:33:15.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And for what the money that it is,

1142
01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:20.119
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>it was a fun little, you know, under 10 hour experience.

1143
01:33:21.239 --> 01:33:22.840
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I always find it funny when people complain

1144
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>about games being too short,

1145
01:33:24.319 --> 01:33:26.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>when they're like 10 hours long,

1146
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:31.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>'cause I'm like, that's like five films for the price of one.

1147
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, right

1148
01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.039
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You know, I get it when it's like $70.

1149
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:44.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But when it's less than 10, you know, you're getting multiple films worth of content for the

1150
01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:55.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, I agree. I mean, just from you telling me about it, like, I feel inclined to want to play this game sooner rather than later.

1151
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So that in itself is telling someone that does not like to have multiple farming games in the rotation.

1152
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:08.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>And just struggles to pick them up in general, because as much as I like them, it's also like how many farming games do I need.

1153
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:15.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But I like that this one is like very, as the word that they use, they picked very good words to describe this game.

1154
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:24.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. Yeah, I think of it kind of like, um, uh, Christmas films. Every Christmas film, you know,

1155
01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:27.520
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>what's going to happen in that Christmas film, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable

1156
01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:35.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>if you like Christmas films. This is very much like the standard tropey farming game. And

1157
01:34:35.079 --> 01:34:39.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>you know what you're getting out of this. But that's what you're expecting. And that's

1158
01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.720
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>what you enjoy and you see these things. You're like, "Oh, it's this thing. I love this thing."

1159
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Please, excuse me.

1160
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So, like, if that sounds fun to you, then this is something that you might want.

1161
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>And if it sounds like something you're like, "Oh, I hate these tropes, then don't watch it."

1162
01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Right? Like, if you hate cheesy Christmas films, don't go watch a cheesy Christmas film. I don't know what you want from me.

1163
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:08.319
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, okay. Yeah. No, that sounds, I mean, I do like, I do love rather the essence of farming games.

1164
01:35:08.319 --> 01:35:15.520
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>So to have it in a more digestible version is nice, especially because as of as of recently when I do pick up games,

1165
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:22.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I pick up games in like 30 minute increments. So I could stretch this out over a good while. I make it feel like

1166
01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:33.180
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. For sure. And yeah. And in that sort of that time period, if you're

1167
01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.600
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>fully valuable without it feeling like overwhelming like start you can feel like even like for me,

1168
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.279
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>like fields of mystery I can feel, etc.

1169
01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:38.939
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>playing half an hour at a time, you could either like do like two to three days if you're like

1170
01:35:38.939 --> 01:35:43.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>taking things relaxed or you could get through a week and have a season every playthrough and you

1171
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:49.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>would still get you know a good like five to ten game.

1172
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:55.819
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>The game sessions in it before you're feeling like you've done everything.

1173
01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah, that sounds great. That sounds perfect, honestly. Something just more digestible and less lower

1174
01:36:00.479 --> 01:36:05.359
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>lower stakes but still feeling like a full farming game experience.

1175
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.159
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yes, yeah, I agree. I think if if it sounds interesting to you

1176
01:36:11.279 --> 01:36:15.560
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Listener then it's probably worth it. You know, it's it's cheap enough as well that it's

1177
01:36:16.359 --> 01:36:18.359
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You don't feel you know

1178
01:36:19.159 --> 01:36:22.880
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Horrible if it's not something you stick a whole bunch of time into

1179
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.779
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I mean, it looks it just looks cute.

1180
01:36:24.279 --> 01:36:28.079
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Oh here we go. I've got his four four minutes apparently. It says on the

1181
01:36:31.979 --> 01:36:32.819
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Oh, perfect.

1182
01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:37.399
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I had another question.

1183
01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:40.640
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm trying to think, oh, with, okay,

1184
01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.760
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>so with the game being shorter,

1185
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.079
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>does it still feel like it's like more impactful

1186
01:36:48.079 --> 01:36:49.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>or like meaningful?

1187
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.239
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Like, does it leave a mark on you at all?

1188
01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:05.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, I'm not gonna be sitting here in two years thinking about this the way I do do with

1189
01:36:51.239 --> 01:36:53.340
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Obviously, it doesn't have to be like a strong mark

1190
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.479
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>as a farming game.

1191
01:36:55.479 --> 01:36:56.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But in regards to like the characters,

1192
01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.319
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>you said you enjoyed them even though they're trophy,

1193
01:36:58.319 --> 01:37:00.800
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>but does it leave like a little bit of an impact on you?

1194
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>stargy, you know, five years later, six, seven years later, whether eight years late, I forget so

1195
01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:16.039
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>many years. Um, like, I'm not gonna still be thinking about any of these characters the way I think

1196
01:37:16.039 --> 01:37:20.920
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>about Linus from Stardew, right? But you know I had fun

1197
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>and there is enough there to be like you know I've spent nearly a week

1198
01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:33.199
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>thinking about this game and enjoying it and that's quite a lot for something as

1199
01:37:33.199 --> 01:37:41.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>simple as it is. You're not gonna, your life isn't gonna be changed playing it, but it's fun, you know.

1200
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Yeah

1201
01:37:39.239 --> 01:37:43.560
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Because I was thinking in like the the mindset of like going back to Wanda stop

1202
01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:51.579
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Playing that game how short it was, but it's still it has been ruminating and I don't know how long it's going to ruminate in my brain

1203
01:37:51.579 --> 01:37:58.520
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But it has been ruminating in my brain for quite a while since I've played it and again very short game

1204
01:37:59.159 --> 01:38:01.159
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>very simple gameplay loop

1205
01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.560
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>left a very big impact on me, but that doesn't

1206
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>This game well, it seems like this game doesn't necessarily do that, but it doesn't take away from the game either, which is nice

1207
01:38:12.199 --> 01:38:14.199
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I

1208
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>- Yeah, no, not really, not a huge amount.

1209
01:38:14.199 --> 01:38:18.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Was just curious if there was like a character moment or something that was like oh man

1210
01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I'm gonna remember this for a little bit

1211
01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.479
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I mean, I liked a kind of the cutscenes,

1212
01:38:26.479 --> 01:38:27.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>but there's not a humongous amount

1213
01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:29.600
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that I'm still remembering about them now.

1214
01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>But that's, yeah, that is what it is.

1215
01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.960
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I will say the one thing I think if you love the idea

1216
01:38:39.319 --> 01:38:43.279
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>of expanding a farm and seeing it go from something small

1217
01:38:44.399 --> 01:38:46.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>this is the one thing that I think we'd be missing

1218
01:38:46.319 --> 01:38:48.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>from this is very static.

1219
01:38:48.239 --> 01:38:53.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>You expand your house and you upgrade your watering can once,

1220
01:38:54.199 --> 01:38:55.140
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>but that's about it.

1221
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:57.760
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's no like adding of land.

1222
01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:00.319
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's no like, you can basically,

1223
01:39:00.319 --> 01:39:03.680
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>the day one you can plant all of the plants

1224
01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.399
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>that you're able to plant in the same as

1225
01:39:05.399 --> 01:39:06.239
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>at the end of the game.

1226
01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:10.000
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>So there's not like that you know, greater progression

1227
01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.140
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Right, I mean that's I think that's okay. Well, if you wanted to like

1228
01:39:15.619 --> 01:39:21.539
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Would the game feel satisfying if you did want to like replay it even since you're not able to like continue expecting?

1229
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:29.060
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I could see somebody trying, uh, I could see, uh, speed runner getting into this.

1230
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.720
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, all right, that's actually pretty cool.

1231
01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:37.779
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I'm being like, how, how do I, you know, make the, the most efficient possible?

1232
01:39:37.859 --> 01:39:39.420
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I could see you someone doing that.

1233
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.640
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But otherwise, past that, maybe not. Okay, fair. Okay, fair.

1234
01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.180
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Probably not.

1235
01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.500
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, it probably not.

1236
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:47.300
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>There's, there's not a huge amount of replay value there.

1237
01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.020
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>I don't think other than speed running.

1238
01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:55.920
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Okay, I mean, it's less than $10, so that makes sense. Maybe replay it again, and when you forget

1239
01:39:52.500 --> 01:40:05.260
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1240
01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.880
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>most of the story, like, five years down the line, when haunt or chocolatier is still not out, you know?

1241
01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:05.979
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>All right.

1242
01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.739
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>Well, thank you.

1243
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:24.420
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>you for having me? Really the biggest thing is, thank you for having me again, even though

1244
01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.979
<v 071F8E1F-F4EE-4C5D-BAEB-5E14546E6A4C>where you can be found.

1245
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:29.380
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I wasn't able to get around to playing this game. I look forward to playing this game.

1246
01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:40.720
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>If you want to find me elsewhere, you can find me on multiple social medias at Ace Trainer,

1247
01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:42.039
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>I.S. Trainer.

1248
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:58.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Whether it's blue sky, instagram, threads, just not Twitter, essentially, obviously I stream on Twitch, but as of right now I'm doing a lot of co-working because I am melting over preparing for a work-turning that I have coming up in October.

1249
01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:11.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>But otherwise Chris and I also just as you were mentioning in the being of the podcast, we are trying to get back into the swing of things with Moo and Coo, so we have our own podcast Moo and Coo that we're trying to get back into.

1250
01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:29.500
<v 751A7F52-E3E6-40CC-A271-FEB57BEAFE6E>Otherwise though, nothing really else.
