## Intro

(30s) **Al:**

> Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al.

(36s) **Kevin :**

> - My name is Kevin.

(37s) **Al:**

> And we are here today to talk about Cockscore Games.

(41s) **Kevin :**

> Ooh.

(43s) **Al:**

> A happy Thanksgiving Kevin.

(46s) **Kevin :**

> - Thank you.

(46s)

> And I'll have a turkey day of Americans.

(49s) **Al:**

> Maybe we should have said that in last week's episode, but I wasn't on the

(50s) **Kevin :**

> It's a viewsonic.

(52s)

> - Yeah.

(54s)

> It's fine.

(55s)

> Well, I hope you guys enjoyed it.

(57s)

> It helps.

(58s)

> - I hope, oh.

(59s)

> Okay, so you know the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade.

(1m 2s)

> I'm gonna presume you know it

(1m 3s) **Al:**

> I am aware of it, yes, I am aware of it from film and TV.

(1m 3s) **Kevin :**

> because it gets attention.

(1m 7s)

> - Okay.

(1m 9s)

> - Yeah.

(1m 10s)

> Well, there you go.

(1m 11s)

> It's, it is, it gets the most coverage out of any parade

(1m 14s)

> in the U.S.

(1m 15s)

> I will say I think that's fair assessment.

(1m 18s)

> So of course it's, you know,

(1m 20s)

> ever parades are, it's just a big old advertising opportunity.

(1m 26s)

> So all the floats are, you know, like pop culture

(1m 29s)

> and sort of the performances and yada, yada.

(1m 33s)

> Anyways, actually you've,

(1m 36s)

> video games and anime and weeb stuff.

(1m 39s)

> We got Pac-Man, Mario, I believe is in,

(1m 42s)

> I didn't watch it.

(1m 43s)

> I just saw some of the highlights.

(1m 45s)

> Loofy from one piece.

(1m 47s)

> Sonic, infamously popped and did not make into the parade.

(1m 51s) **Al:**

> - Oh no.

(1m 51s) **Kevin :**

> Much like in the 1993 parade, I believe it was in '93.

(1m 56s) **Al:**

> - Why does it sound like you've got a photographic memory

(1m 57s) **Kevin :**

> At some point in the '90s.

(2m) **Al:**

> of all of the Macy's Thanksgiving Daybreak's?

(2m 5s) **Kevin :**

> at least Sonic.

(2m 6s)

> But, yeah, you're right, but actually best of all, so they have musical performances, and these very wildly, some very perhaps antiquated acts and others, you know, they vary, so you got a lot of high school marching bands and so.

(2m 9s) **Al:**

> - I am amused at the idea of you going,

(2m 11s)

> "Oh, it's just an advertising thing."

(2m 12s)

> The name is an advertising thing.

(2m 15s)

> Never mind the rest of it.

(2m 34s) **Kevin :**

> But true.

(2m 36s)

> Because it is 2025, you betcha they got the singing voices of huntrix and we got a live performance of gold and that was pretty good. It was pretty good.

(2m 43s) **Al:**

> I did see that. I did see that. Although from what I can tell life might be a

(2m 47s) **Kevin :**

> It's pretty good.

(2m 49s) **Al:**

> little bit of a stretch. We don't judge people for lip-syncing if people

(2m 51s) **Kevin :**

> Yes. Got them. Yeah. Okay.

(2m 55s) **Al:**

> have fun, that's the important thing. But I also saw many videos of what's

(3m 2s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, I know.

(3m 6s)

> What's his name? Yeah, I know you talk about the doctor. What's his face? Yeah, they're promoter. You tell what they're promoter. What's your name? Yeah, that's the one. Yeah, doctor.

(3m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah, Bobby, but I can't remember his Ken young that's his name. I saw many videos of him

(3m 21s)

> Like

(3m 21s) **Kevin :**

> Yep. I've been

(3m 22s) **Al:**

> recording with his phone and smiling

(3m 24s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, that was great. I loved it. Oh, I didn't bite to the fortnight, but I was very tempting. Just so awareness. Oh,

(3m 34s) **Al:**

> So why are we here? That's a good question. I just realized my headphones are on backwards

(3m 36s) **Kevin :**

> How are we here?

(3m 41s) **Al:**

> and it's messing my brain up. There we go, that's better. We are here today to talk

(3m 47s)

> about cottagecore games, but specifically, I'm going to talk about Ashwood Valley, which

(3m 52s)

> is a game that I played some of. Let's put it this way. Let's put it this way. It's not

(3m 56s) **Kevin :**

> I didn't get to but I heard things and and all the siblings

(4m 2s) **Al:**

> as bad as sugar do I?

(4m 4s) **Kevin :**

> well um that I don't know that that's how that feels like the lowest bar you can compare to

(4m 11s) **Al:**

> It is, but it gets over the bar.

(4m 13s) **Kevin :**

> yeah okay all right okay fine at least one

(4m 13s) **Al:**

> So it's a thing.

(4m 19s)

> I won't be putting it forward for Game of the Year.

(4m 20s) **Kevin :**

> less negative thing or the actual sweet

(4m 21s) **Al:**

> Let's put it that way.

(4m 26s)

> So we're gonna talk about that.

(4m 28s)

> We've got a bunch of news.

## What Have We Been Up To

(4m 30s) **Al:**

> The first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?

(4m 32s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, stress stress primarily.

(4m 36s)

> Um, yeah, I'm really stressed.

(4m 39s)

> Um, okay, let's see the two gaming wise things that ever tell you watched fantastic before finally got around to it.

(4m 45s)

> Um, first steps.

(4m 46s) **Al:**

> I don't think you did. What did you think?

(4m 47s) **Kevin :**

> For Stanley, what are the things called?

(4m 48s)

> Yeah, uh, good movie.

(4m 50s)

> Um, yeah, I don't know like it was, it felt very nice to have a quote-unquote light MCU film to watch, right?

(4m 59s)

> not everything is tied into the big govark.

(5m 2s) **Al:**

> Right, that's what you mean by light. I was like I'm not sure what's light about it

(5m 2s) **Kevin :**

> and yes, yes, yeah.

(5m 5s) **Al:**

> They were trying to collect us was trying to eat the world

(5m 9s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, Galactus was really well done.

(5m 11s)

> How cool is that, huh?

(5m 12s)

> So I have one of the goofiest villains.

(5m 15s) **Al:**

> I love when they're in a ship.

(5m 19s)

> Spoilers for fantastic four or first steps.

(5m 20s) **Kevin :**

> - Yeah.

(5m 22s)

> - Fantastic for.

(5m 23s)

> - Yeah.

(5m 24s) **Al:**

> If you want to go watch it now, it's on Disney+.

(5m 26s)

> This is a good film.

(5m 27s)

> I enjoyed it.

(5m 28s)

> My joint second favorite superhero film of the year.

(5m 35s)

> The-- when they're on Galactus's ship,

(5m 38s)

> and they've been taken into the room to meet Galactus.

(5m 39s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(5m 42s)

> Yeah

(5m 42s) **Al:**

> And you're kind of looking around going, oh, where's Galactus?

(5m 45s)

> and then-- because it's just like dark.

(5m 45s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(5m 47s) **Al:**

> And then you just see his lies light, eyes light up.

(5m 50s)

> And then he stands up, and you're like, oh, my word.

(5m 53s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, he's a big boy

(5m 54s) **Al:**

> He's really intimidating.

(5m 57s) **Kevin :**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, that's good. It's well done. Um, I like everyone's performances, you know of the four was well done

(6m 7s)

> Maybe a little too much info.

(6m 9s)

> It was fun.

(6m 11s) **Al:**

> They got to get him ready for secret wars, right? Come on.

(6m 22s) **Kevin :**

> This can't be as great for this for two thumbs up.

(6m 27s)

> Other than that, we've got...

(6m 30s)

> You know, actually, I got back into Marvel's snap.

(6m 33s) **Al:**

> Oh, I haven't heard that name in a while.

(6m 34s) **Kevin :**

> I just think I took mostly, October.

(6m 37s)

> I'm at still play it on the regular

(6m 39s)

> In a good place like it's I don't know how to put this like it's nothing here

(6m 52s)

> Okay, I'll tell you what brought me back in the added man spider in

(6m 56s)

> And any time man spiders added into something I'm in

(7m 1s)

> But other than that it's it's been fine

(7m 4s)

> The metagame's okay, there's so there's so many cards and holy money

(7m 9s)

> but overall it's fine I enjoyed what about and then of course Kirby Air

(7m 16s)

> Riders continues to exist and I play and like the game fits good oh okay

(7m 24s)

> there's this so I talked about city trial I don't know you're familiar

(7m 30s)

> you heard it stuff I talked about it but you basically it's a mode where you

(7m 34s)

> You run around, you collect buffs for a big little mini game, show it out at the end with the...

(7m 39s)

> whatever you combined. Part of it is you can basically swap machines as you find them around on the map.

(7m 46s)

> Obviously some machines are better suited for others, but one of the funniest events that can happen, and actually happen in my first game.

(7m 58s)

> But if you die at... or if you don't have a vehicle at the end, because if you go hit and you die, you lose your vehicle. You're given like the worst vehicle in the game's called compact stuff.

(8m 9s)

> And so that happened in my first game, but it's just really funny because I've had it like where I'm dying as the countdown is going to zero to the end of the match.

(8m 22s)

> And I've even lost some machines because of that. But anyways, that's just the chaos. That is Kirby AirRider.

(8m 31s)

> It's good stuff. I'm trying to think of what's saved without going too far into detail. But...

(8m 40s)

> I like it. Oh, okay, you know, I'll say this. Some of the bouncing, so all the previous vehicles from the first game returned.

(8m 48s)

> And that was pretty young, so maybe I didn't fully grasp how to utilize all of them, but I felt like there was always some balance issues. Some stars were much better than others, some were much worse than others.

(9m 1s)

> Soccer, I fine tuned it. Everything feels good to use now. So, you know, thumbs up for that. When it's cyber, it's no shocker.

(9m 9s)

> But yeah, Kirby AirRider's good. The art is still good. The people making the machines. Plus the smiling friends coming out now. Good stuff.

(9m 18s)

> Alright, what about UL? What's going on?

(9m 20s) **Al:**

> Let's see, what have I been up? Ah, yes, Pokémon.

(9m 27s)

> Well, obviously I was playing some Ashwood Valley this week, but I have also finished everything

(9m 33s)

> in Pokémon Legends CA except the last battles thing which you need to do to get the shiny charm,

(9m 41s)

> but I don't know if I'm going to, like, we've got a week and a half until the DLC comes out,

(9m 48s)

> And so it fuels.

(9m 48s) **Kevin :**

> It's about to finish everything for a week, except for, you know, in a week.

(9m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(9m 52s)

> Yeah, well, you know, this is like when I say so I will talk about my my my youngest enjoys playing

(10m)

> Astrobot, right?

(10m 2s)

> And I'll tell people oh yeah he he'd finished the entire game and creates like oh no I didn't

(10m 6s)

> there's one level I haven't done and I'm like okay but that was like added in as an update

(10m 10s)

> as the fifth update to the game, right?

(10m 12s)

> Like you've finished the entire base game and then four out of five of the updates they added

(10m 18s)

> like you can't you can't be like, "Oh, I didn't"

(10m 20s)

> I finished the game because they added something new after I stopped playing. That's not how that works.

(10m 21s) **Kevin :**

[laughs]

(10m 25s)

> The goal post moving. Good times. [laughs]

(10m 29s) **Al:**

> So I have finished. I have done everything in Pokemon ZA that exists except the battle, the

(10m 30s) **Kevin :**

> But did you, though?

(10m 37s) **Al:**

> do a thousand battles. I think I'm at like 550 or something. I just don't it's so many. It's so many battles.

(10m 41s) **Kevin :**

> That sounds like so much.

(10m 46s) **Al:**

> So, like, do I want to just like grind out those battles in the next week and a half?

(10m 50s)

> Just for the possibility that might do some more shiny hunting is such an unnecessary thing, a thousand bars

(10m 56s) **Kevin :**

> you know that that remind well okay first of all I will are you excited for the

(11m 6s)

> deal sir are you going to play it when it drops or you're going to take a break

(11m 7s) **Al:**

> Oh, no. Yeah. No, I've already bought it. I am the problem, and I recognize this, but I also

(11m 16s)

> like playing the game, right? Like I'm not, I've talked many times about how the things that people don't

(11m 23s)

> like about the, you know, the most recent Pokémon games are legitimate and fair, but they're not

(11m 29s)

> things that change how much I enjoy it. Like the, oh, it's such a small map and there's nowhere to

(11m 34s)

> explore okay cool I don't like exploring

(11m 37s)

> you know that's not what I'm in for I'm not in for exploring oh the story is

(11m 39s) **Kevin :**

[laughter]

(11m 43s) **Al:**

> pretty boring yeah okay fine I'm not in it for that yeah you know so it doesn't

(11m 49s)

> bother me and yeah like the DLC is just basically Lumios again but in gray

(11m 56s)

> scale and I'm like okay cool great I don't need to learn any new maps

(12m)

> fantastic we all like different things and that's fine so yeah I am

(12m 7s)

> the person that people hate because I keep buying the games and I keep buying

(12m 12s)

> everything because I like it I'm sorry but I like it that's just who I am

(12m 17s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, no, I, I say that I get it and also I'm probably going to still want to play in by this game. So, you know, I'm part of the problem too. So, I can't blame you.

(12m 25s) **Al:**

> I just need to buy a second hand and then you'll be less of the problem, right?

(12m 27s) **Kevin :**

> Um, but, uh,

(12m 35s)

> I guess it was fine before we used to buy all the games all the time. They were good back then.

(12m 43s) **Al:**

> Where they are of your expectations change, that's the question.

(12m 47s) **Kevin :**

> Wait, repeat. I went with it in my expectation change. Oh,

(12m 49s) **Al:**

> Where are they, where are they good back then, or have your expectations changed?

(12m 54s)

> That's always my question about program.

(12m 55s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, um, no, no, no, no. No, I'm going to say they were better back then. My, so here's the thing,

(13m 3s)

> my expectations for Pokemon has never been particularly high. It's like a very comfort food sort of

(13m 10s)

> thing. Like, I know what I'm going to get on and I would enjoy it. Just I know there's better out

(13m 17s)

> there, but that's fine. Um, so yeah, and because, you know, Pokemon was very formulaic for a good while. Um, so, yeah, I don't think my expectations change just

(13m 29s)

> I legitimately, you know what? I think,

(13m 30s) **Al:**

> Well, I mean in so much as in so much as like we've all grown up, right?

(13m 34s)

> And so obviously our expectations are going to be different than the where is a kid and and I'm not saying I'm not saying this to excuse things, right?

(13m 38s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay.

(13m 40s) **Al:**

> Like game series have to

(13m 43s)

> Move forward right like if every game was just the same as it was 20 years ago

(13m 47s)

> We would get bored of everything, right?

(13m 48s)

> I'm not saying the things shouldn't change, but like where are they better or where they just?

(13m 54s)

> We expect more and should get

(13m 57s) **Kevin :**

> There's, you know, this makes me think I think there's another element to this and that is the

(14m 4s)

> things the world changing around it right like you

(14m 8s)

> right yeah because when you look at Pokemon on the DS or the GBA or whatever right what are you

(14m 13s)

> comparing it to other games on that console right like it stands out but now we saw on the switch

(14m 18s)

> next to Xenoblade and Breath of the Wild I obviously you know those are completely different genres and

(14m 23s)

> directions but the point is like it feels like the potential should be higher but it's not meaning it but

(14m 29s)

> also look at Scarlet Violet and the technical issues like there there's there's clearly at least within

(14m 35s)

> in the last five years, there's absolutely been.

(14m 38s)

> There are signs of their having issues and the quality.

(14m 42s) **Al:**

> I do think that those, I think this carland violet are, are unique case, right?

(14m 48s)

> Like, Legends Arceus didn't have those issues.

(14m 52s)

> Legends ZA doesn't have those issues, certain shield didn't have those issues.

(14m 57s)

> Brilliant diamond and shining peril had some issues, but it's not on the same thing.

(15m 1s)

> It's hard to compare, even if it isn't as buggy, it's hard to compare because it's like a

(15m 6s)

> couple, you know, it's traditional to the top down or sat on Pokemon.

(15m 8s) **Kevin :**

> - Yeah.

(15m 10s)

> - Yeah.

(15m 12s) **Al:**

> It's hard to compare anyway, but like, all the other Switch games have not really had the same issues at all.

(15m 21s)

> And I'm not playing Legends ZA on the Switch, but from people that are playing on it,

(15m 25s)

> as far as I can tell, it's fine. It's not, like, it's not amazing, but it's not anywhere new

(15m 30s)

> to as bad a skyland violet were, right? Like, that is a unique, and I would love to see the

(15m 34s)

> behind the scenes on why they shoved out what they did when they did. I wonder if part of the

(15m 40s)

> problem was.

(15m 42s)

> that it got caught up in the Covid delays, right? Like we not for a fact, but like you'd be very

(15m 48s)

> surprised if, if, if, you know, legends are curious and brilliant downshowing peril had been delayed,

(15m 54s)

> right? I think we all know it is almost definite that those two games got delayed. And therefore,

(16m 1s)

> that would have knock on effects for Scarlet and Violet, right? And so the question is, did they,

(16m 6s)

> should, was the issue that they just didn't get the time they needed for that?

(16m 12s)

> And was that because of the delays? And therefore, was not going to be an issue for the next game,

(16m 17s)

> because they had reset their cycle by ruining Scarlet and Violet in its launch, right?

(16m 24s)

> Is that, is that how the, and that's why the in-legency is fine, because they had

(16m 30s)

> taken all of the brunt on those games, whereas actually they should have just

(16m 34s)

> continued to fix it and just gone, oh well, we're just going to have to have an extra year that doesn't

(16m 38s)

> and have a game that we don't want to have.

(16m 40s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(16m 42s) **Al:**

> I think there's perfectly legitimate complaints to have about this game, about the story, about the limitations of what the world is, of the exploration, blah, blah, blah, that can't be solved by just doing better next time.

(16m 42s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, it is

(17m) **Al:**

> That's a fundamental change to how you think about games.

(17m) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(17m 4s) **Al:**

> But, I think the bogginess of Scarlet and Violet, I think it's... unless... maybe we need to wait for the...

(17m 12s)

> next gen games right gen 10 and see how they are. But I think if there's not massive issues in them, like, there wasn't Scarlet and Violet, like, I think it's probably safe to say that that was a wall.

(17m 16s) **Kevin :**

> okay you know what that yeah okay to the like to the lows it went to from

(17m 29s)

> especially the technical side that's fine that's fair you can call it the outlier

(17m 35s) **Al:**

> That's that is why I'm specifically talking about right like the the technical parts of that like story wise gameplay wise all these things right you can't write that off as a one off obviously because that is just what they've been doing for a long time and you know you can say there's like.

(17m 37s) **Kevin :**

> yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah yeah right

(17m 46s)

> Yeah, yep, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.

(17m 50s) **Al:**

> One offs with in the positive direction right like I rarely see a pokemon fan who didn't love legends arcius and less you just didn't like fundamentally the changes to how the game and play worked.

(18m 2s)

> But in terms of like everything else, I don't like

(18m 5s)

> everyone who I see complaining about

(18m 7s)

> legends of the years, like I can't believe this is the

(18m 9s)

> follow up to legends arceus, right? Like that's how the

(18m 12s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(18m 12s) **Al:**

> frame it, if they're disappointed in it. So I think it's

(18m 16s)

> probably fair to say that that was probably an outlier

(18m 19s)

> in the positive direction in terms of story. But yeah, it's

(18m 24s)

> it's not like every Pokemon game has been buggy, you know,

(18m 28s)

> and every game has technical issues, right? Literally every

(18m 29s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(18m 31s) **Al:**

> game has technical issues. I think it's probably

(18m 35s)

> to say the two big buggy games would be the first ones

(18m 38s)

> in Scarlet and Violet, right? But anyway, I, yeah, I like, I

(18m 40s) **Kevin :**

[laughs]

(18m 42s)

> Oh man.

(18m 48s) **Al:**

> very much enjoyed my time with ZA and I will be playing

(18m 51s)

> the DLC because I would enjoy a little bit more of that. And

(18m 55s)

> I get the people who say that should be base game, but I'm

(18m 59s)

> going to, I'm going to continue to be part of the problem

(19m 1s)

> by the BLC. (laughs)

(19m 2s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, sure. Yeah.

(19m 5s) **Al:**

> I don't get the choice of it being base game, right?

(19m 8s)

> I have the choice of do I say,

(19m 10s)

> oh, that should not be paid updates and not experience it myself,

(19m 16s)

> or do I go, yeah, this is a terrible situation,

(19m 19s)

> and I'm not helping the situation by buying it,

(19m 21s)

> but also one individual's not gonna change anything,

(19m 24s)

> and I would like to experience it,

(19m 25s)

> so therefore I'm going to pay an experience it.

(19m 29s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. Yeah. You'll imagine if they just let it be free.

(19m 29s) **Al:**

> And none of those situations are, there's no ideal there, right?

(19m 38s) **Kevin :**

> Wow. Like how much that would improve the image of all situation?

(19m 44s) **Al:**

> Possibly. Yeah. Yeah, but I

(19m 48s)

> When was the last time they gave us something for free? I guess maybe this garlic and violet switch to updates

(19m 53s) **Kevin :**

> yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Okay. That's the, that's the line. I mean, it was

(19m 54s) **Al:**

> So they are possible it is possible for them to do that. Can you imagine if they charged for that?

(20m 2s)

> Would I have paid for that probably that's bad

(20m 7s)

> But it would have been absolutely terrible terrible marketing

(20m 14s) **Kevin :**

> already bad enough. They put the real flag and he'll see. Oh, oh, oh, come on.

(20m 21s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(20m 24s) **Kevin :**

> that, you know, that's, I think that's part of the whole, just the, the overall issue of like

(20m 29s)

> a really better back then. Like, it's the money hungry, like, ringing their hands is so

(20m 35s)

> transparent. These days it feels like, right. Um, well, yeah. Yeah. You're like, like, you can't

(20m 40s) **Al:**

> Yes, I also do think that sometimes people overuse the phrase cash grab though, um, like

(20m 48s)

> It's like when when they

(20m 49s) **Kevin :**

> called Scarlet Violet. Cash, grabbing you probably but...

(20m 53s)

> ...or four million into the health team.

(20m 55s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's like I just feel like it's it's such a an overused term

(20m 59s)

> It's like I saw people saying oh

(21m 1s)

> When they announced that they were making a second kpop demon hunters people like oh such a cash grab and you're like one

(21m 6s)

> They've not even made it yet. We used to talk about it too.

(21m 8s) **Kevin :**

[laughing]

(21m 10s) **Al:**

> Like, unless they massively downgrade the quality, they're putting a lot of money into a second one.

(21m 17s)

> Three, people were asking for this. From months, they were like, "Oh, we need more. We need more. I can't believe they cut stuff out of the film. We need more of this."

(21m 18s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(21m 27s) **Al:**

> And I'm like, "You don't get both ways." It's not a cash grab. Shut up.

(21m 28s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

(21m 32s) **Al:**

> Now, the Disney directed DVD sequels that they used to do, those are cash grabs, right?

(21m 41s) **Kevin :**

> Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh

(21m 41s)

> And the, okay, you know what's crazy though, even as cash grabs a lot of those had sold to some degree. Like I, I, I have perhaps roasting to glasses, but I have fallen memories of some of those. I'll tell you what to, you know, you know what is the post to child.

(21m 58s)

> How for cash grab the live action, Moana. Hey, quote unquote live action. Oh, like.

(22m 2s) **Al:**

> I haven't seen any, I haven't seen any of the Disney live action remakes that they're

(22m 20s) **Kevin :**

> I've seen more than I probably would wish I had, but it's interesting because when they

(22m 28s)

> started out, they were decent enough, it felt like they were at least adding something.

(22m 34s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, when they started out, it wasn't remakes, it was new stories, right? So they had what was the,

(22m 35s) **Kevin :**

> One of the...

(22m 41s) **Al:**

> there was a maleficent and there was

(22m 45s) **Kevin :**

> I'll get I'll give you one beats dragon that no one knows about that one, but Pete's dragon and it got a live action quote unquote remake and you know what that was actually decent

(22m 57s)

> Um

(22m 58s)

> Like I haven't seen the original, but it's very clearly different and and in tone and direction and yeah, that was all right actually

(23m 8s)

> But but yeah, I'm a lift sent that was the right. That was I wasn't even a remake. That was just a new story

(23m 12s) **Al:**

> Well, that's what I'm saying for a long time their live action stuff that was based on animated stuff wasn't remakes

(23m 19s)

> It was new stuff in the world, right? There was Maleficent. There was the Crella one

(23m 22s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(23m 23s)

> Yeah.

(23m 24s)

> Oh, my God.

(23m 24s) **Al:**

> I can't remember the name of that was was it just Crella maybe?

(23m 27s) **Kevin :**

> I think there's just Corral out there.

(23m 28s) **Al:**

> Like those were different you can say they're bad, but they were at least trying to do something there

(23m 29s) **Kevin :**

> The one where the Dalmatians.

(23m 33s)

> Yeah.

(23m 34s)

> The one with the Dalmatians killing her parents.

(23m 35s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah, it was so stupid

(23m 38s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(23m 39s)

> Yeah.

(23m 39s) **Al:**

> I mean that is just that is the class

(23m 40s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(23m 41s)

> Yeah.

(23m 42s)

> No.

(23m 42s) **Al:**

> I think that is a basic prequel issue, right?

(23m 43s) **Kevin :**

> No.

(23m 44s)

> I haven't seen verse.

(23m 45s)

> Yeah.

(23m 46s)

> Yeah.

(23m 46s) **Al:**

> Because you have not seen wicked for good, have you?

(23m 47s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(23m 48s)

> No.

(23m 49s)

> I haven't seen verse.

(23m 50s)

> Now, I haven't seen the virtual...

(23m 52s) **Al:**

> You haven't seen the first one either.

(23m 52s) **Kevin :**

> I haven't seen any Wicked of any variety, but if I go...

(23m 54s) **Al:**

> I watched the first one, right?

(23m 57s)

> I was like, oh, I generally pretty good.

(24m)

> I thought it was a really good self-contained prequel to the Wizard of Oz.

(24m 5s)

> I really liked it.

(24m 6s)

> But it's still done a few of the things that prequels always do.

(24m 9s)

> It was like the soul, you've seen soul.

(24m 12s)

> I presume the star wars you haven't okay, so the there's one the the example I always use of stupid prequel things where they over explain everything is the one in solo a

(24m 13s) **Kevin :**

> No, I haven't. I'm not that. No. It's our row one

(24m 24s) **Al:**

> Star Wars story

(24m 25s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, talent will tell me where that works.

(24m 27s) **Al:**

> So there's a point where he's like I'm going through I can't remember the context of this because it was so stupid I wiped it from my memory

(24m 35s)

> But he was in he was traveling right and so he's going up to to travel and they ask him what is your name?

(24m 35s) **Kevin :**

[laughter]

(24m 42s) **Al:**

> He says he says he doesn't have a name. I think or something like that. There's a reason why he doesn't like

(24m 49s)

> Have a surname. He's hand, but he doesn't have a surname. And so the guy buying the desk looks at him goes

(24m 55s)

> Solo because he's traveling alone, just like stamps down and writes his name is solo and

(25m) **Kevin :**

> Oh my gosh.

(25m 2s) **Al:**

> You're like not only does that not make any sense

(25m 5s)

> That is so stupid that would mean you would have you know thousands of people in this universe called solo purely because they were

(25m 12s)

> Traveling alone

(25m 14s)

> But also it just was so unneeded right like you don't have to explain everything in your prequel

(25m 19s)

> You don't have to tell me why Han Solo is called Han Solo. He's called that because that's his name

(25m 22s) **Kevin :**

> The fantastic for the 2015 one to say that again.

(25m 30s) **Al:**

> Oh, yes, it again fantastic

(25m 33s)

> That's the thing is just it's so I hate like prequels do this a lot with her like oh here's this thing that we need to explain

(25m 40s)

> No.

(25m 42s)

> You just didn't need to explain it and then they tie themselves up and not trying to get

(25m 48s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah.

(25m 51s) **Al:**

> to specific places.

(25m 53s)

> Generally, I'm like, don't do a prequel, right?

(25m 57s)

> Because you just end up in a stupid position but whatever.

(26m)

> I don't forget what my point was.

(26m) **Kevin :**

> Yep. Live action remakes for the Disney. It's not great.

(26m 1s) **Al:**

> My point was prequels are, yeah, they're stupid stuff.

(26m 8s) **Kevin :**

> Okay. Okay. But I want to try to make earlier, they went from, you know, being different or decent

(26m 15s)

> enough. They've just been on the

(26m 18s)

> scale downwards. Do you know about the Leelon Stitch? Did you watch that or do you know anything about that? Yeah. Yeah. We've gone from, you know, soulless live action to, like, intention, intentionally antithetical to your original. We want to be offensive. Oh, I don't remember how he got here. Yeah.

(26m 22s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah, yeah. The changes they made, yeah. Oh, yeah. I haven't seen the live action. I've obviously seen the original.

(26m 28s)

> It's excellent. And I am aware of the changes that they made, yeah.

(26m 45s)

> I don't know what's worse whether they'd like change it to be different from the

(26m 49s)

> original in a works way or like the how to train your dragon which is like this

(26m 54s)

> is just a shot for shot remake like I honestly don't know which I think is worse

(26m 56s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no, yeah, okay. Scrap. That's how we got here. Yeah, and these are cash grabs and and you know what? I'd rather take the shop for shot instead of the the word. We're going to make it worse, like, Oh,

(26m 59s) **Al:**

> because it's like why are you even doing this then the answers money

(27m 15s)

> I don't know why, I just, I feel like if they're making it worse or at least trying to do something there, like they've like, and I'm not saying the reason behind it is good, but they're at least going, why is it this way, can we make it better, let's do this, and yeah, that might be an stupid idea about.

(27m 20s) **Kevin :**

> I guess. But,

(27m 31s)

> But, but it's like, it shows a, a complete lack of misunderstanding and appreciation for the original. Like, hey, you're right.

(27m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah, sure, but at least then you know that you can see that and you're like this was terrible. I'm not gonna watch that

(27m 46s) **Kevin :**

> Now, now, well, yeah. Sorry, cash grab. Oh, I don't remember how he got here, but we used me.

(27m 55s) **Al:**

> I

(28m 1s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, I'm going to have to check that out. I actually, ooh, I like the side of that.

(28m 5s) **Al:**

> We got there through Pokémon we got there through Pokémon. I did see I'm do watch any donkey videos video in donkey

(28m 15s)

> He did a carbie aerators one this week and I was watching it going it's Kevin just donkey

(28m 23s)

> It's just feels like it was written

(28m 25s)

> by Kevin. He basically says it's the best game of the year.

(28m 26s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, I'm good at the check that out actually. Ooh, I like the side of that.

(28m 31s)

> Yeah, yeah, kind of is, okay, you made a point of this earlier.

(28m 38s)

> How wild it is. We got, you know, these sequels to all these cart racers in one year of Mario Kart and Sonic and Kirby just lining planets aligning all in the same year.

(28m 46s) **Al:**

> Mario Kart, Sonic Racing and Kirby.

(28m 54s) **Kevin :**

> And Kirby air writer. It's absolutely kerbs tops all of them, by the way, as much like Mario Kart is fine. I like it, you know.

(29m 1s)

> It has the issues or whatever people dropped it, but it was fine. There's nothing inherently wrong. It's Sonic writers. I even tried, but I've heard great things and obviously I love Sonic, but.

(29m 10s)

> No, there's no comparison. Kirby air, I says, oh, it's peak. Absolutely. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it. All the all the it's the six seven. Whatever the kids say.

(29m 22s)

> Yeah, we're done. That's all we care about the show.

(29m 23s) **Al:**

> All right, well, there we are, Pokemon and Kirby.

(29m 29s)

> Rona once saw a picture of Kirby and she was like,

(29m 31s)

> "Is that Pokemon, or is that no, it's not Pokemon."

(29m 32s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, and that's food for thought.

(29m 36s) **Al:**

> I understood why she says that it looks kind of like a Pokemon.

(29m 38s)

> I'm like, "I see where you're coming from."

(29m 40s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I get it. I get it. I didn't look at chance. He'll fairy. I get it. You know what? One thing about Kirby air rights. I forgot.

(29m 49s)

> So something I'm enjoying because obviously it's it's fairly popular. I would say for a Kirby gay or like, you know, Kirby air rights niche. So it's getting a lot of attention relative to what it was before.

(30m 1s)

> And and even for a Kirby game. Kirby games are somewhat niche. It's like everyone knows it, but not everyone plays the game straight.

(30m 10s)

> What I love, though, because so many people are picking up air writers. People are getting a taste of the the eldritch cosmic core nightmares that are hidden inside Kirby games.

(30m 22s)

> Because air writers, the story and air writers, it's actually a fairly light one compared to a lot of other Kirby games, but it still still goes places.

(30m 31s)

> One of the tracks there's there's actually you're witnessing genocide as a planet is being destroyed. Oh, that's just during the race itself. Much less the story. Yeah. So, you know, you get taste, but this is still light compared to other stuff Kirby has done.

(30m 36s) **Al:**

> Oh. Oh, fun.

(30m 49s) **Kevin :**

> So that's that's been a real treat watching people sing. Oh, this is probably go this hard. No, he usually goes much much harder. Oh, good times. I love my eldritch or polio.

(30m 56s) **Al:**

> Alright, well, let's talk about some news, shall we?

## Game News

(31m 3s) **Al:**

> First up, we have Flotsam. This is the game where you are like reclaiming rubbish from the sea

(31m 12s)

> and making our village out of that. They've announced that their 1.0 is coming

(31m 18s)

> on the 4th of December, which is just one day after this episode releases.

(31m 23s) **Kevin :**

> Okay, I don't remember this title. Um, there's a lot of cool things. Okay

(31m 26s) **Al:**

> We haven't talked about it for a while, I don't think, but it's been in early access for 6 years, almost the entire time this podcast.

(31m 34s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, wow wow that that is wild. Well. Hey good for them

(31m 41s)

> I actually like what I'm seeing. First of all the concept

(31m 45s)

> I love the concept because you know, you know, there's that giant trash island down the Pacific

(31m 51s)

> Let's turn that to a real island. I'd like that.

(31m 54s)

> Um, secondly, I like the art style, you know, very, so, not so, it's, I guess, associated, I don't know these terms, but it's, it's thick outlines.

(32m 2s) **Al:**

> It looks like game other games that are called cell shading so I think that's a fair

(32m 8s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, that's correct.

(32m 9s) **Al:**

> affair statement whether it's technically true or not I don't care

(32m 14s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, that's correct.

(32m 17s)

> It looks like a wind wakery, but with thick outlines, that's how I'm going to describe it.

(32m 23s)

> It's good. I love the arts stuff. Oh, what a cool idea turning crash into a floating village. Very cool. Yeah, that looks, that's, that's, that's coming out.

(32m 33s) **Al:**

> Cool, I haven't played it. It came out before I was all buying every single kickstarter,

(32m 43s)

> and it is a city builder, so probably not one for me.

(32m 49s)

> next we have super zoos story they've announced that their alpha has

(32m 54s) **Kevin :**

> The reverse of the last set.

(32m 59s) **Al:**

> It's just they're not at the state they want it to be so they're going to delay it till next year.

(33m 2s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

(33m 4s)

> Okay, first of all, I didn't see there's dinosaurs confirmed in this, but okay.

(33m 8s)

> Um, I didn't realize we were there, but here we are.

(33m 10s) **Al:**

> Don't say I'm so disappointed.

(33m 12s) **Kevin :**

> And okay, as someone who just, look, was about to say, like I mentioned last week or week before whatever, I picked up.

(33m 21s)

> Let's, let's build the zoo again.

(33m 24s)

> There's high, I'm not going to lie.

(33m 27s)

> They have a, you know, uphill battle here.

(33m 30s)

> So good luck to that.

(33m 32s)

> I like it in theory, but, but hey, they're delaying.

(33m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, I'm I I you know what I'm excited about this is the the RPG aspects of it, right? Like you are like actually

(33m 45s)

> Being a person in this game and you are you know

(33m 47s) **Kevin :**

> A character, sure.

(33m 48s) **Al:**

> Character you're doing story through this whereas

(33m 52s)

> Part of my problem with city builders is they're so

(33m 55s)

> Amorphous and you're just like I do some stuff, you know, okay, but okay. Yeah, exactly

(33m 57s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, menus the game, you know, yeah, no, you're right.

(34m 1s)

> I get that, you're right, you're right.

(34m 4s)

> That is the difference here and arguably the selling point,

(34m 7s)

> but that's, you know, the double edge blade here.

(34m 10s)

> They're going to fall into all the trappings, but we'll see.

(34m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah. They have not delayed their beta, the not delayed their beta or their full

(34m 14s) **Kevin :**

> We'll see later because they delayed.

(34m 21s) **Al:**

> release yet, we're still expecting.

(34m 28s)

> 27, but let's let's not pretend those will probably end up being delayed as well.

(34m 34s) **Kevin :**

> you know what? Some? Leave it or not. Listeners, when you develop things, if one thing gets delayed,

(34m 34s) **Al:**

> So you can't delay the alpha and then not delay the alpha.

(34m 43s) **Kevin :**

> sometimes the other thing gets delayed later. It's just, uh,

(34m 48s) **Al:**

> and reading through the comments, I think it's important. If you are a game developer to

(34m 52s)

> remember, you get generally positive press if you delay a game. If you're open and honest about

(34m 59s)

> what's happening. And the less you say, the more likely people get annoyed. So people generally

(35m 5s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah

(35m 5s) **Al:**

> okay with this disappointed, but accepting of it. You go and look at the comments of

(35m 9s) **Kevin :**

> Understanding

(35m 11s) **Al:**

> any of the other games that delayed for like six years without telling people what was happening.

(35m 16s) **Kevin :**

> - Soaksaw.

(35m 18s) **Al:**

> Like, soaksong is a unique situation.

(35m 20s) **Kevin :**

> - The worst part is, I don't blame them, right?

(35m 24s)

> 'Cause I don't, 'cause what was the delay gonna be

(35m 27s)

> or with her message gonna be?

(35m 28s)

> Sorry, guys, we're having too much fun developing

(35m 30s) **Al:**

> I mean they also I don't think they also I don't think they ever gave a time frame for

(35m 31s) **Kevin :**

> and putting this gate stuff in his gates

(35m 33s)

> or delaying again, (laughs)

(35m 38s)

> No, no, they didn't, but like,

(35m 41s)

> and this is a small portion,

(35m 43s)

> but there was at least one group, right?

(35m 46s)

> I don't know, Kickstarter people who were actually owed this

(35m 50s)

> because via the campaign promises and all that,

(35m 53s)

> it's a degree, right?

(35m 55s)

> Like, yay, probably could have used the update

(35m 58s)

> of here and there, but you're right,

(35m 59s) **Al:**

> I understand that, I understand that, but one, they did get it in the end, which is not always the case.

(36m) **Kevin :**

> I don't think they gave any timeframe.

(36m 3s)

> Yeah.

(36m 7s)

> They did.

(36m 8s) **Al:**

> Two, they did know that there was some, they knew we'd have taken longer because they did essentially have a delay when they were said we're turning this into a game on its own.

(36m 19s)

> That was essentially the delay post, right?

(36m 20s) **Kevin :**

> Yes, yes.

(36m 21s) **Al:**

> But three, it's not like they hadn't already got anything from the Kickstarter, they had a whole game, right?

(36m 29s)

> I think it's probably different when you haven't got a game, and you've got a game, but you're still waiting on the second game that was meant to be a DLC, right?

(36m 39s)

> Like those feel like very different expectations.

(36m 42s) **Kevin :**

> fair enough people. Those poor unfortunate souls waiting for their 3DS copy of Mighty Number 9.

(36m 50s) **Al:**

> Or the Wii U version of of silk song cuz that was the the joke because they did announce that it would be on that and it didn't come to it

(36m 53s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, there you go. That's it. Yeah. Sure.

(36m 57s) **Al:**

> That those are the people that get to complain

(37m)

> but also

(37m 1s)

> Also, uh, yeah, buy a switch for goodness sake

(37m 5s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(37m 6s) **Al:**

> All right next we have

(37m 8s)

> D'oh look town. I still don't know. I had to say the name of this game. I don't get the reference

(37m 10s) **Kevin :**

> Perfect place.

(37m 13s)

> It's Shrek.

(37m 14s)

> It sounds like Dual Lock.

(37m 17s)

> Shrek 1.

(37m 18s) **Al:**

> Oh, really? Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

(37m 18s) **Kevin :**

> Lord Farquaad's place.

(37m 20s) **Al:**

> I'm not going to think of anything else.

(37m 20s) **Kevin :**

> Dual Lock is a perfect place.

(37m 21s)

> Yeah.

(37m 22s)

> Yeah.

(37m 23s)

> Yeah.

(37m 24s)

> Yeah.

(37m 25s)

> Yeah.

(37m 26s)

> That's correct.

(37m 27s)

> That's correct.

(37m 28s)

> Good.

(37m 29s)

> It's good.

(37m 30s)

> It's quite a poison for you.

(37m 33s)

> Like, I'm sure this game looks great, but it'd be even better with Lord Farquaad in it.

(37m 37s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(37m 38s) **Kevin :**

> I'm just saying.

(37m 39s)

> It's be real.

(37m 40s)

> I mean that's that's general

(37m 41s) **Al:**

> Maybe.

(37m 42s) **Kevin :**

> really true across the board, but it can know that that's for anything.

(37m 43s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(37m 47s)

> So,

(37m 49s)

> Dolek Town

(37m 51s)

> have announced that their thrive and ties update is out now.

(37m 55s)

> This adds a bunch of stuff.

(37m 59s)

[laughs]

(38m 1s)

> Just notice the Steam, I just noticed the Steam post doesn't say anything.

(38m 4s)

> Yeah, let's look in the video.

(38m 6s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, so where what it's?

(38m 7s) **Al:**

> There's a new faction, there's new events.

(38m 11s)

> Look, I don't know, if you've played this game,

(38m 12s) **Kevin :**

> Allender

(38m 13s) **Al:**

> if you've played the game, go and get the update, right?

(38m 15s)

> Like, I don't, I've not played the game, go away.

(38m 16s) **Kevin :**

> Tell us I

(38m 19s)

> Have a need it looks I'm not gonna why looks pretty good

(38m 22s)

> There's like this drone flying around shooting is that part of the update. That's cool celebrate your birthday now

(38m 32s) **Al:**

> I really should play this game post post apocalyptic farming sim

(38m 34s) **Kevin :**

> it looks it looks fun. Yeah, yeah, I'm done for that. But also I could give you. Yeah.

(38m 39s) **Al:**

> But also make it cute I

(38m 42s)

> Lot I also I love it has the like

(38m 45s)

> Housebuilding kind of like spirit fader, you know that like 2d side on I

(38m 49s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, it's a rario. Yeah, it's a rario. Yeah. Yeah. That's great

(38m 51s) **Al:**

> Like that

(38m 54s)

> Speaking of up speaking of updates we have

(38m 58s)

> Cosmic coupe have released their first major.

(39m 2s)

> Update, this has a rework of how the first seven days works, which it is.

(39m 10s) **Kevin :**

> The unboring experience that's important

(39m 14s) **Al:**

> We've talked about it before, many, many a time, your tutorial has to be good.

(39m 19s)

> Otherwise, I hate the game.

(39m 20s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(39m 21s) **Al:**

> Not that we're going to be talking about anything.

(39m 25s) **Kevin :**

> Ha ha, I thought you were just going to bring up the A again

(39m 29s) **Al:**

> Z has all too much tutorial. It is all like literally you're by the time you're finished

(39m 35s) **Kevin :**

> That, yeah, that's a complaint.

(39m 39s) **Al:**

> with that tutorial, you are halfway through the game. It's just so stupid. It's not like

(39m 43s) **Kevin :**

> Are you serious? That bad. Wow. Wow.

(39m 47s) **Al:**

> it's constant tutorial, but like there are when you get halfway through the game, you've

(39m 51s)

> just learned your final thing through a tutorial system. It just like constantly throwing

(39m 55s)

> new things at you.

(39m 56s) **Kevin :**

> Okay

(39m 56s) **Al:**

> Um, buh-buh-buh!

(39m 59s) **Kevin :**

> It's causing a coupe. They so they're doing that. It's only days one seven

(39m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(40m)

> So, cosmic poop.

(40m 1s)

> Another one I like the look of.

(40m 4s)

> Next, we have GoGoTown.

(40m 6s)

> They've released their co-op update.

(40m 8s)

> So, if you want to play co-op on GoGoTown, it's finally here.

(40m 13s)

> Um, this is always the thing that trips up game developers, uh, co-op always takes longer than

(40m 18s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, it's very hard because you just imagine you all the things about game that but do it times for and I'm working at the same time. That's hard

(40m 19s) **Al:**

> they expect.

(40m 20s)

> Um, but it's here now.

(40m 29s)

> Yeah, it brings up a whole other dimension of possible bugs

(40m 34s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, I make a dimension bug

(40m 35s) **Al:**

> They've also

(40m 41s)

> You done

(40m 43s) **Kevin :**

> Probably not let's continue

(40m 45s) **Al:**

> They've also given the ability to rotate

(40m 49s)

> Shops, so everything in the game is now rotatable

(40m 52s)

> What I think you could rotate things, but not building

(40m 57s) **Kevin :**

> That's a good one. I like that because it's so, you know, like, design your town. That's probably

(41m 6s) **Al:**

> And you can also finally move the train station.

(41m 11s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, it's a go one, too, although that does raise questions like, you know, if you slap

(41m 17s)

> in the middle of town, do you know how far she don't, but you're trying to run barrel through

(41m 22s)

> town and run everything over, probably doesn't.

(41m 24s) **Al:**

> No, so, the train goes into a tunnel.

(41m 25s) **Kevin :**

> Okay, so what if you put in the middle of town, why is this just a while E. Coyote and

(41m 29s) **Al:**

> The tunnel is in the middle of town.

(41m 33s)

> Click on the link and go down to the train station section.

(41m 35s)

> You will see exactly what I mean.

(41m 37s)

> It makes perfect sense when you see what it looks like.

(41m 39s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. That's what that's just a magic rock with the tunnel in it. Yeah, I know I get it. Just I guess it goes underground. Okay, sure.

(41m 42s) **Al:**

> It's like roller coaster style.

(41m 46s)

> That is, that is the, the epitome of suspension of disbelief.

(41m 52s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah.

(41m 54s) **Al:**

> I'm just gonna let it, let it be.

(41m 55s)

> Let it exist.

(41m 56s)

> It is what it is.

(41m 57s)

> It's fine.

(41m 57s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, like I said, it's Dwayne Coyote painting the, you know, the train hole, the tunnel and then just go, it just works. It's fine.

(42m) **Al:**

> Pretty much.

(42m 7s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, I don't like the.

(42m 9s)

> I don't like that at all.

(42m 11s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(42m 13s) **Kevin :**

> It's just the fart gun from.

(42m 15s) **Al:**

> Pretty much, yeah. I don't know why you would want to do that either because like that would just lower your town rating, but I don't know.

(42m 22s) **Kevin :**

> Well, well, I'll tell you why because it's now co-op. That's, that's why.

(42m 27s) **Al:**

> Oh no disaster.

(42m 30s) **Kevin :**

> You got to give the tools for proper co-op.

(42m 32s) **Al:**

> It does kind of fit in with the ridiculousness of the game, but...

(42m 36s) **Kevin :**

> Oh absolutely, this game is absurd, I love it, it's great.

(42m 39s) **Al:**

> Next, because apparently this is

(42m 41s)

> the update episode because there's so many updates, we have out and about, they've released their summer update, so it includes summer plants and mushrooms, new recipes, friendship tiers, paddle boarding,

(42m 56s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, okay. That's, uh, that's cool. I've never paddle boarded, but that's, that's good. That's an like a big one.

(43m 2s) **Al:**

> I have, I fell over.

(43m 6s) **Kevin :**

> Uh, okay. Yeah, I mean, that, that feels like it could happen. You know, that warning seems to fit for it.

(43m 15s)

> Yeah, I don't know, but hey, like, it's probably good fit for this game, at least I'll say that

(43m 21s)

> cuz you know this is the one we're just out foraging and stuff so

(43m 24s) **Al:**

> yeah feels chill. I do think that people who are good at paddleboarding they do

(43m 26s) **Kevin :**

> Water transport that's cool. I don't want to go Pat Blurney. They do. Yeah, no, I don't know. That sounds about right. It kind of feels like skiing.

(43m 30s) **Al:**

> make it look chill but when I've done it it's very much stressful.

(43m 40s) **Kevin :**

> You know, you're like skiing doesn't look quite far because like you know going down the mountain, but it's really hard for what I understand.

(43m 51s) **Al:**

> I am more of a kayaker, I like just sitting in my boat and chilling and moving around and not having to balance.

(43m 57s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a hard part. I couldn't pet open a camp balance. Also, I even scared to go to kayak. But we couldn't do that bad balance.

(44m 8s) **Al:**

> Kayaks are really, really hard to tip.

(44m 12s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, that's comforting to know. Okay, I'll keep that.

(44m 17s) **Al:**

> enjoy I enjoy kayaking unless you go on whitewater if you go on whitewater then

(44m 21s) **Kevin :**

> Well, yeah, yeah exactly. Let's see. That's the read. That's the whole point

(44m 21s) **Al:**

> obviously you're gonna fall over but that's kind of the point but no I'm a I'm a sea

(44m 28s) **Kevin :**

> Make it more aerodynamic

(44m 31s) **Al:**

> and lock kayaker I don't I don't I don't do whitewater I have done but it's not my

(44m 33s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(44m 37s)

> Yeah, no, yeah, they're very

(44m 41s)

> Yeah, they're they are different end goals. Absolutely

(44m 48s) **Al:**

> next we have two pixelia. They have released their order in the court update. And this

(44m 56s)

> includes the justice system and a new career of a lawyer. And I can see why this game is

(45m) **Kevin :**

> yeah it is yeah it's so I'm just I'm scrolling and there's more there's a

(45m 4s) **Al:**

> taking a while because there's so much in this. Have you clicked on the link for this? It's

(45m 13s) **Kevin :**

> JET system, holy moly! Hahaha! Hahaha!

(45m 16s) **Al:**

> Like, when you're a lawyer, you're like, because of the careers into

(45m 20s)

> Pixelia are like actual detailed careers. You actually have to do

(45m 24s)

> things for it. So you get your license to be a lawyer. And then

(45m 28s)

> you can either, you can do, you can, you can decide to either be a

(45m 33s)

> defense lawyer or prosecution. And then you like have a list of

(45m 40s)

> trials that you can be part of. And then you can go in and you

(45m 43s)

> you actually have to like, argue your case.

(45m 46s)

> And the whole system like happens. You have to do all these things and you have to like, you can, there's a, there's an objection system. If there's a cooldown for an objection, you can only object a certain number of times, it's just, it's so detailed. And there's an actual duty that you have to convince. And I don't, it's,

(45m 57s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(46m 8s)

> Yeah

(46m 10s)

> Then out

(46m 12s)

> Legal consequences for other like for everything in game apparently there's

(46m 17s) **Al:**

> Yes, 'cause of course, now that there's a legal system, you of course aren't necessarily a lawyer.

(46m 22s)

> You can still end up in court if you do specific things.

(46m 25s) **Kevin :**

> There's multiple lawsuit types, defamation, death, assault, public disturbance.

(46m 33s) **Al:**

> This game is, I am convinced they're just trying to recreate the entirety of life.

(46m 39s) **Kevin :**

> It is, they, at minimum, they have self become an MMO, maybe single, I don't know if it's

(46m 49s)

> multiplayer, but it's on MMO. But...

(46m 51s) **Al:**

> question I don't know. I think it's

(46m 55s) **Kevin :**

> Is this, can, is this in the demo currently? I'm gonna guess no, but, uh, well, it's his update,

(47m 3s)

> I don't know, but, oh.

(47m 5s) **Al:**

> The demo I wouldn't be surprised

(47m 9s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, probably not. Well, I'll get a, get a hype. We don't get the fuss about

(47m 14s)

> suing people for defamation much in these, the NR, our game, so, cloudage core games. Although

(47m 20s)

> But we probably should.

(47m 21s)

> Stardew could you do that.

(47m 23s) **Al:**

> I don't want to be sued when I, you know, insult Clint.

(47m 23s) **Kevin :**

> It's a couple of people I'd like to see.

(47m 25s)

> Yeah, but what if you win, though, yeah, exact right, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(47m 29s) **Al:**

> All right.

(47m 32s)

> Yeah, what Judy would convict me, that's the question.

(47m 39s)

> If I killed Clint, if I killed Clint, what Judy would convict me?

(47m 47s)

> I just for the legal authorities that are listening to this, I'm talking about in a game.

(47m 51s)

> Thank you

(47m 53s)

> I'm not going to kill anyone in real life. I'm not going to kill anyone who started you family either because you can't although I bet there's a mod for that

(47m 55s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, of course there isn't amount for everything, right, absolutely, who knows, there might be a legal mod out there, yeah, there you go.

(48m 3s) **Al:**

> Yeah, here you go. There's a murder there's a murder mod

(48m 6s)

> There is a murder mod

(48m 9s)

> allows for the murder of NPCs

(48m 11s) **Kevin :**

> Okay.

(48m 11s) **Al:**

> excellent

(48m 12s)

> Next we have research story the last of the updates

(48m 16s)

> 1.1 update it is coming soon. It's currently up on the their they've got like a beta

(48m 23s)

> branch that you can switch to if you want to play it. This includes the heart event tracker

(48m 30s) **Kevin :**

> good, that should be the fault in every game. Social elements, never, you know, I mean like

(48m 36s)

> relationship elements.

(48m 37s) **Al:**

> Well, so this isn't necessarily, this isn't the tracking just the heart levels, it's tracking whether you've seen specific heart events.

(48m 44s) **Kevin :**

> I'll still stand by the statement

(48m 47s) **Al:**

> I agree it's good, but like most most farming games don't have that.

(48m 50s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, but it should be

(48m 51s) **Al:**

> I'm both sure fair and big technical changes under the hood to

(48m 58s)

> What was it they said help long-term maintenance and improvement of the game

(49m 3s) **Kevin :**

> I don't know what that means. They added more RAM to the servers.

(49m 5s) **Al:**

> It's good

(49m 8s)

> It will make it easier for them to add new features based

(49m 10s) **Kevin :**

> Famously said by every developer ever, and had never been regarded once.

(49m 22s) **Al:**

> we wouldn't know compared to what exactly compared to an alternate reality where they haven't done it.

(49m 22s) **Kevin :**

> I guess so. I guess that's true. I will go ahead and go ahead and smile.

(49m 29s) **Al:**

> And they've also added, they've also added modding support in other languages,

(49m 33s) **Kevin :**

> I appreciate it. I'm just thinking, like, as someone who's never modded or done any modding,

(49m 37s) **Al:**

> useful for some people.

(49m 51s) **Kevin :**

> like, where does the support come in, like, for, you know, how does it being in Spanish?

(49m 58s)

> Where does the Spanish fit into the modding?

(50m 1s) **Al:**

> A good question. I mean the modding, so mods come in two parts either mods that are supported

(50m 8s)

> officially because the game has functions that you are meant to use when you're doing modding

(50m 17s)

> or unofficial modding where you you're literally changing the code inside the game

(50m 25s)

> and those mods break very quickly. They break on every update because obviously

(50m 31s)

> the code underlying has changed quite a lot whereas the official modding generally doesn't

(50m 38s)

> change the code it uses functions that the code provides you and therefore generally are less

(50m 45s)

> likely to break when an update happens. It's not that they never do but they still do sometimes

(50m 48s) **Kevin :**

> Okay

(50m 51s) **Al:**

> break but they're less likely to break whereas official mods basically always break because that's

(50m 56s)

> That's how it works.

(50m 59s)

> The language support

(51m 1s)

> I'm not sure how that comes into this, presumably, presumably it allows mods to say this

(51m 5s) **Kevin :**

> Okay, yeah, wouldn't you break it? Yeah.

(51m 11s) **Al:**

> is what the additional text in-game is in the different languages.

(51m 17s)

> That's the thing I'm currently assuming would be mod language support.

(51m 20s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. No. We, they actually just re-translated every single line of code into every

(51m 21s) **Al:**

> It's also possible.

(51m 22s)

> They mean they're allowing mods to add other languages into the game.

(51m 34s) **Kevin :**

> language. They support them. Either way, it's, it's a good effort. I, I, I like to say I'm not a

(51m 36s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(51m 45s) **Kevin :**

> moderate type person, but I, I tip my head towards the conference.

(51m 50s) **Al:**

> And our final piece of news is, Iconi Island have announced that they are no longer with their main publisher.

(51m 58s)

> They will be self-publishing, except in Asian countries they still have a publisher for those territories.

(52m 6s)

> So it doesn't really make much difference, but that is a thing.

(52m 10s) **Kevin :**

> probably not on a line, but it's all it yeah. Look, I know it's business stuff but it's almost

(52m 11s) **Al:**

> That is a thing.

(52m 18s) **Kevin :**

> close to the equivalent of breakup drama. That's what this amounts to.

(52m 22s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, pretty much pretty much all right, that's the news. Let's talk about

## Ashwood Valley

(52m 30s) **Al:**

> Ashwood Valley, so

(52m 33s) **Kevin :**

> Okay, it's the one I do have siblings that

(52m 34s) **Al:**

> So Kevin hasn't played this game although he does own it

(52m 39s)

> This we do siblings. Yes, so right. Let me so this is only on the switch

(52m 45s)

> We both bought it when it was like super cheap. What was it like one dollar or something insanely cheap like that?

(52m 50s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, so far. Yeah, yeah.

(52m 52s) **Al:**

> Normal prices $10. I think

(52m 55s)

> Read its blurb before I get into the

(52m 59s)

> Probably five minute discussion about this game

(53m 2s)

> Your sibling is a cat now time to fix that

(53m 6s)

> In Ashwood Valley, you'll step into the shoes of either Luna or Draco to magical siblings who spell casting mishap opens a portal to a vibrant world

(53m 15s)

> And turns one of them into a cat. Obviously because those two things are basically the same thing

(53m 20s)

> Now it's up to you to restore a ruined cottage.

(53m 22s)

> befriend quirky characters and uncover the secrets of the enchanted valley to break the curse.

(53m 27s)

> Grow magical plants, explore changing seasons, complete odd quests for chocolate-loving

(53m 32s)

> mayors or cheese-obsessed dwarfs, and pet all the wild animals you can find even the strawberry cows.

(53m 38s)

> With cozy farming, wizzicle characters and hand-animated pixel art, Ashwood Valley is a

(53m 43s)

> charming adventure about family, friendship, and a lot of fluff.

(53m 47s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, that was a lot of last one.

(53m 50s) **Al:**

> So, my intro

(53m 52s)

> to this game would be it is some of what it says it is so the story wise we'll get into

(54m 1s)

> that later on but like it does start off being like choose one so you choose one of the

(54m 6s)

> siblings and it's like okay the other ones are cat now okay it doesn't really tell you

(54m 11s)

> much and you just kind of get plopped into this random other place but you don't know it's

(54m 13s) **Kevin :**

[Music]

(54m 18s) **Al:**

> another place because it's just a place, right? You haven't seen a previous place.

(54m 23s)

> you're just in a place and you've got a building and there's a few characters and a few animals.

(54m 30s)

> You are like farming yes but like not really to do much. You're farming to get food to give to

(54m 41s)

> the animals around the village to befriend them and then this is the entire story. Once you have befriended

(54m 49s)

> every animal who's like, I don't know how many times.

(54m 52s)

> That's it, that's the story.

(55m 3s) **Kevin :**

> I think, as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong, this game has seasons and I think I've

(55m 8s) **Al:**

> does. It is a standard farming game in the aspect.

(55m 10s) **Kevin :**

> heard.

(55m 11s)

> Yep.

(55m 12s)

> And I believe I've heard a lot of people hit credits by the end of spray.

(55m 17s)

> You're one.

(55m 18s) **Al:**

> Yes, absolutely, uh

(55m 20s) **Kevin :**

> Which is wild.

(55m 22s) **Al:**

> And and the the the the the you say hit credits. There's nothing really happens like your your sibling gets turned into their sibling and now just stands there instead of standing there like a cat

(55m 22s) **Kevin :**

> Yep.

(55m 33s) **Al:**

> They're no standing there as a human

(55m 35s)

> But that's it. There's no real like oh congratulations. You did it

(55m 36s) **Kevin :**

> Okay

(55m 41s) **Al:**

> I'm

(55m 42s)

> Literally all you'd have to do is befriend all the animals by giving them carrots for like

(55m 48s)

> 10 days in a row and then you're done. That's it

(55m 51s) **Kevin :**

> - That's so wild.

(55m 52s) **Al:**

> That is the story

(55m 55s)

> There are other characters, but none of them have really done anything they kind of just exist

(56m 2s)

> The farming is you have like plant pots in your house

(56m 7s)

> I haven't figured out if you can add more plant bots, but I'm started off with three plant pots and

(56m 13s)

> So you're not farming outside you're farming in these plant pots. So it's like you start off and you're like okay

(56m 18s)

> great I can put carrot seeds in these three plant pots and then water them and then I can go and say hello to all the animals and then there's nothing really left to do today. It's it's such a weird a weird thing. I also one of the things I always gets me over the game is like how the controls feel right and sometimes it's hard to explain how how controls feel right there. But sometimes controls never don't feel great. And this is a game where the controls didn't feel great.

(56m 48s)

> So in lots of games lots of farming games you have like your toolbar right and you're like switching between items in the toolbar and in some in some farming games your tool will change automatically based on what you're doing right where you go up to a tree and you use the action item and it will use the axe right and it knows what you want to do because you're at a specific point.

(57m 8s)

> This game does neither of those. You have your D pad which by the way menus don't work with the D pad the only work in the analog stick and I hate it when games do that. Let me use the D

(57m 16s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, oh, that's the worst. I'm not a fan, not a fan.

(57m 18s) **Al:**

> pad in menus please and thank you. I hate it so much because an analog stick is for analog movement menus are not analog movement. Now obviously let me use the analog stick as well if I want to but let me use the D pad. Let me use the D pad for what it's for moving directions. So the way that the way the tools work is you have your D pad and

(57m 40s) **Kevin :**

> ha ha ha ha. No, you eat, yeah, you just sign it to them, double. Yeah, I'm watching

(57m 48s) **Al:**

> like your left is I can't remember which one it is but left is one of the tools down is one of the tools and right is one of the tools and you. Yeah yeah there you go it's the shovel. Yeah yeah yeah I could remember the watching can was right I can remember the other two where and. So say I am I'm going to.

(57m 57s) **Kevin :**

> licking images, left is like a shovel or a spade. Down is the, down is the sickle looks

(58m 4s)

> like ferracim, ferracim, ferracim, ferracim, ferracim, and right is the watering can. Don't you

(58m 10s)

> Don't you know, Z stands for the tools?

(58m 18s) **Al:**

> I've got a plant pot and I want to put a seed in it right you have to go left to select the shovel you press a to action the shovel you then have to press up. Select the carrot seed press a to. Put the carrot seed down and then press right to select the watering can and press a. To use the watering can and the thing is that like that wouldn't feel like a lot of.

(58m 39s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, no, no, no, wait.

(58m 48s) **Al:**

> stuff if you had like you know ten things to water you'd like select right and then you'd go and water them all but you have three things to water so you're doing like. Left a. Right a move to the next one left a up a right a move to the next one left a up a right a. You have successfully put three seeds in the ground and watered them.

(59m 8s) **Kevin :**

> You

(59m 14s)

> What do you mean you don't just push right on the deep and it does the action. What do you mean at the?

(59m 20s)

> It's just equipping and then pushing the button. Why?

(59m 21s) **Al:**

> It is so many button presses to do such simple actions which are fundamental to the game it's a farming game

(59m 32s) **Kevin :**

> That's that's why they decided to end it in three one season. You're free

(59m 38s)

> Oh

(59m 40s) **Al:**

> So, that is not fun and the problem is that if the farming isn't fun in your game, I'm

(59m 48s)

> going to struggle to enjoy your farming game, right?

(59m 53s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah

(59m 56s) **Al:**

> And on top of that, on top of that, the entire point of the game is to turn your sibling

(1h)

> back into not a cat and you do that incredibly quickly without barely doing anything and

(1h 7s)

> And then you have no long term goal after.

(1h 10s)

> That's a fun.

(1h 16s) **Kevin :**

> The worst part is it looks amazing. I like visually. I love the art style. It's, you know,

(1h 24s)

> top-down, Stardew pixel art, but it's really well done and charming. But, well, it's a game

(1h 30s)

> with not much to do and a lot of it sounds painful to do. Oh, big oof.

(1h 35s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's funny because like sometimes you

(1h 39s)

> Grab are really cheap game

(1h 42s)

> Because we bought this game and what was the other one called?

(1h 47s)

> What was the other one we bought the same time that we talked about a couple months ago?

(1h 50s) **Kevin :**

> Is it Starbirds? Is it Starbirds?

(1h 52s) **Al:**

> No, no, no, Sunsea Island

(1h 54s) **Kevin :**

> That's, oh, yeah, that's the one, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

(1h 55s) **Al:**

> So we bought Sunsea Island and this at the same time for like the same price basically was like a dollar each and

(1h 1m 2s)

> And, since it Island, it wasn't the most amazing.

(1h 1m 5s)

> But, like, I chucked in 10 hours into that game and I completed and I had fun.

(1h 1m 10s)

> This game I barely put in an hour and was like, this is not fun and I don't even, I like,

(1h 1m 17s)

> I know the story.

(1h 1m 18s)

> There's nothing, there's nothing there.

(1h 1m 20s)

> Like, it's, I, there was nothing to build towards with Sunsea Island.

(1h 1m 26s)

> You knew exactly what you were building towards the whole time and the whole game was built

(1h 1m 30s)

> towards this.

(1h 1m 31s)

> one you're like, I know what I'm building towards and I know how quickly I can get it.

(1h 1m 35s)

> And I'm not even having fun doing that in the first place.

(1h 1m 38s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. That's wild.

(1h 1m 39s) **Al:**

> I love the look of this game.

(1h 1m 42s)

> I think that the pixel art is really nice.

(1h 1m 45s)

> The colors are very vibrant.

(1h 1m 47s)

> It's it's a very interesting looking game.

(1h 1m 52s)

> The portraits are are fun.

(1h 1m 54s)

> It's like, why I like about how it's done is so the character models are very, you know, low, low pixel numbers of pixels, right?

(1h 2m 5s)

> And then the portrait is obviously more detailed, but still keeps the pixel art aesthetic, which I really like, a lot of games that for their portraits, they're like, here's ridiculously high quality.

(1h 2m 12s) **Kevin :**

> It it does

(1h 2m 17s)

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 2m 18s) **Al:**

> And you're like, this just feels out of character for this game.

(1h 2m 22s)

> I really think they did really nice balance here of that.

(1h 2m 22s) **Kevin :**

> It does I mean I

(1h 2m 26s)

> Agree yeah, I mean even stardew feels like that right the the difference between the you know

(1h 2m 31s)

> Overworld models and the the portrait art like night and day

(1h 2m 36s)

> But I agree looking at it here

(1h 2m 38s)

> If the aesthetic is kept the same like you see the characters like oh yeah

(1h 2m 42s)

> that's the same character in the same game yeah

(1h 2m 47s) **Al:**

> It looks like at some point you do, oh, I just realized you can farm outside.

(1h 2m 52s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah.

(1h 2m 53s) **Al:**

> It just doesn't tell you you can.

(1h 2m 56s)

> I just never tried because it because the tutorial, the tutorial gets you to do it and plant pots inside.

(1h 3m 3s)

> Why does the tutorial tell you that? That's dreadful. The tutorial teaches you to farm inside and then it lets you farm outside and never tells you that.

(1h 3m 14s)

> That's dreadful. (laughs)

(1h 3m 15s) **Kevin :**

> that's magical oh i'm so happy you discovered that on on here oh yeah no I didn't

(1h 3m 23s) **Al:**

> were you waiting for that? Had you seen the picture and you were just waiting for me to see that?

(1h 3m 27s) **Kevin :**

> find that really really funny

(1h 3m 29s) **Al:**

> So I think why I would say is if you like a farming game that is low stakes and you can just do the

(1h 3m 36s)

> same thing forever then feel free to try this game. The problem is that if you let if you want

(1h 3m 40s) **Kevin :**

> I was gonna say, buy a bit orchard.

(1h 3m 43s) **Al:**

> it's well there are there are many other games like that yeah I like that I like the the look

(1h 3m 49s)

> of this game, which is why it's above Sugar G Island.

(1h 3m 53s)

> I can't help but feel like this is just like, hey, we need a farming game game, and they've

(1h 4m 5s)

> done it without too much thought about anything.

(1h 4m 8s)

> The core gameplay is a lot of button presses, there's no real progression.

(1h 4m 16s)

> A lot of it just kind of feels like it's there for the sake of it.

(1h 4m 19s)

> You're run down.

(1h 4m 23s)

> House that you're in that it talks about.

(1h 4m 25s)

> You fix that in the first 10 seconds.

(1h 4m 28s)

> You have a bunch of broken plots of bits around the house and there's cobwebs.

(1h 4m 30s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, yeah!

(1h 4m 36s) **Al:**

> And literally the tutorial is fix the ground and clear up the cobwebs and you do that and that's your house fixed.

(1h 4m 44s)

> Like it's not even a progression thing.

(1h 4m 45s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, that's, that's amazing. Just, just skip. Just jump right to the end result.

(1h 4m 50s) **Al:**

> This is, that is the kind of epitome.

(1h 4m 53s)

> of this game is like, there's no, there's no thought about scaling, there's no thought

(1h 4m 59s)

> about like how you progress in this game, it's like progression, there you go, that's

(1h 5m 1s) **Kevin :**

> For a question

(1h 5m 4s) **Al:**

> the word I'm looking for, there's no progression really, it's, hey, do the things.

(1h 5m 8s) **Kevin :**

> It's a waste of time now, let's just get to the end

(1h 5m 13s) **Al:**

> I mean that feels a bit harsh, right?

(1h 5m 15s)

> Like some people have enjoyed this game, looking online, some people have enjoyed their

(1h 5m 15s) **Kevin :**

> No

(1h 5m 17s)

> Yeah

(1h 5m 19s) **Al:**

> time in this game. I have no

(1h 5m 19s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, yeah, yeah

(1h 5m 23s) **Al:**

> but that doesn't mean that other people won.

(1h 5m 25s) **Kevin :**

> No, okay, I'll like all joking aside like I think the fact that

(1h 5m 31s)

> We can clear this in one season before going a full year. That's indicative of a big like designed for right like you you did not calculate something right there

(1h 5m 35s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(1h 5m 42s) **Kevin :**

> And that's probably

(1h 5m 44s)

> Spills over until the other stuff that you're talking about like things were misjudged

(1h 5m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it also feels like they're setting it up to sell a bunch of DLC because in the menu

(1h 5m 58s)

> There's like a bunch of menu items that say like go to eShop and you click on it and they don't go anywhere

(1h 5m 59s) **Kevin :**

> the game

(1h 6m 3s) **Al:**

> So it kind of feels like it's like get people liking this game and then

(1h 6m 8s)

> Give them a bunch of DLC

(1h 6m 10s)

> But the DLC actually has to be there and there has to be a reason to buy it

(1h 6m 12s) **Kevin :**

> Oh, yep, it's not a great feeling.

(1h 6m 16s)

> Oh, man, that's wild.

(1h 6m 18s)

> What a shame, because it had like all the,

(1h 6m 22s)

> how a missrook thing, and nothing like the goal

(1h 6m 24s)

> of changing your sibling back, that could be a good one,

(1h 6m 27s)

> but if you just take a little to get there,

(1h 6m 31s)

> let it, let it, let it right out,

(1h 6m 34s)

> be able to enjoy that.

(1h 6m 36s)

> That would be nice, but alas,

(1h 6m 38s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's, it's also, it's also just that like nothing really matters about it as well. Like you,

(1h 6m 39s) **Kevin :**

> and the visuals are really great.

(1h 6m 44s) **Al:**

> okay, cool. You've changed your sibling into a human again. Their model has changed on the

(1h 6m 51s)

> uh, overworld. That's the only thing that changes. It doesn't matter. It doesn't make any difference.

(1h 6m 55s)

> They don't start doing things for you. You don't start doing anything together. Nothing,

(1h 7m 1s) **Kevin :**

> oh that's rough buddy. That's maybe the plot hidden in the game and it should

(1h 7m 7s)

> tell you about it. Just like farming outside.

(1h 7m 8s) **Al:**

> Possibly because I will be honest, I haven't put a huge amount of time into the game, because it failed its first hurdle, you know, how the controls work and the core gameplay loop. They are not, I did not enjoy that.

(1h 7m 21s)

> It's too many button presses to do simple things that just end up frustrating me constantly.

(1h 7m 23s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, you got it. No, I don't blame you. Yeah, I don't blame you

(1h 7m 27s) **Al:**

> And because when you search online, everyone is basically seeing the same thing about this, like, oh yeah, there's nothing past the main story and like, I just feel...

(1h 7m 38s)

> but aimless after the main stories finished, you're like, well, yeah, I'm not going to push through these issues that I'm having, because it doesn't sound like there's a great game past it, right?

(1h 7m 48s)

> But I've done that before when I'm like, oh, here's a game that I'm not a huge fan of, the start of it, let me push through the tutorial, and you get to a game that you really like, and that doesn't mean that it didn't have flaws, right?

(1h 8m 4s)

> of it was a flaw and that needed to be better, but you can push that.

(1h 8m 8s)

> through it because you know there's something better coming and that was not the case here.

(1h 8m 12s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, no, I absolutely get you dang that's rough. Yeah, I don't know what else to say. Hey, good

(1h 8m 16s) **Al:**

> Well, I don't, yeah, I don't know what else to say. I feel like that's, that's

(1h 8m 22s)

> everything I have to say, you know, so there we go. Let's end on our positive.

## Outro

(1h 8m 29s) **Kevin :**

> All right dang yeah

(1h 8m 32s) **Al:**

> I'm recording the game of the year episode very soon.

(1h 8m 38s)

> If you are interested in inputting into that, you can join the Patreon and there is

(1h 8m 42s) **Kevin :**

> inputting, giving thought.

(1h 8m 46s) **Al:**

> a currently a form up on the Patreon to get people's input. Multiple patrons have already

(1h 8m 52s)

> input into that and that will be, I'm not saying that we will definitely choose the majority

(1h 8m 57s)

> winner from that, although I don't think there is a majority winner from that just now,

(1h 9m 1s)

> I think it is exactly evenly, it's evenly split between five games from the five people that

(1h 9m 2s) **Kevin :**

> I know, at least one person in my corner. I submitted my entry and I know somebody is going to be back in me up.

(1h 9m 7s) **Al:**

> the oven piece so far.

(1h 9m 9s)

> But one of them is what I do want to be there.

(1h 9m 20s)

> I know exactly what you've done Kevin, it will not, I will not be arguing for what you have argued for, but if the other people argue for it and it seems like it's going to be a majority opinion, I will not fight against it, let's put it that way.

(1h 9m 22s) **Kevin :**

> Most people who've listened this year could guess what I've been doing.

(1h 9m 35s)

> Well, people who don't vote for Kirby AirRiders are wrong, just objectively.

(1h 9m 42s) **Al:**

> So if you want to input into that, you have to be on the slack, you have to be a patron, so you can do that at patreon.com/thsbot.

(1h 9m 50s)

> You'll also get access to just chat to us in the slack and access to bonus episodes of the podcast. Kevin, is there anything you want to tell the list?

(1h 10m) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. So I need me to press wherever, because if I'm on Twitter, I'm just retweeting primarily

(1h 10m 7s)

> curvy or writer stuff because it's a bigger, bigger content out of that game. Go check

(1h 10m 12s)

> out all the memes, the clips, the art. Oh, that's all I've been doing really. Yes.

(1h 10m 16s) **Al:**

> I have a question... the... the... the carts that I've been seeing.

(1h 10m 22s)

> Are those custom-built carts, or they just like stand there?

(1h 10m 23s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah. I had to, I'm going to, if you're seeing them on the

(1h 10m 30s)

> line, they are very likely the custom made ones, because that's one of the big like the pills. Yep. Yeah. That's why we get a

(1h 10m 32s) **Al:**

> So you can, you can custom make cards.

(1h 10m 36s) **Kevin :**

> coyote or look in part. And it's like, I jokingly said art medium last week or with Nami, but it's kind of true because you can do so

(1h 10m 47s)

> much and custom make so much and decorate them. It's really good. Yeah, it is insane. Like I see

(1h 10m 53s) **Al:**

> That's crazy that it's detailed enough that you can make some of these cards custom. That's

(1h 11m) **Kevin :**

> like genuine scenes being painted on this vehicle.

(1h 11m 1s) **Al:**

> that's what that's what they've that's what they've been doing the last 20 years since the last game

(1h 11m 6s)

> It's just making the custom card system

(1h 11m 10s) **Kevin :**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it sounds like it's with soccer. I would do. I believe it

(1h 11m 16s)

> Yeah, yeah, it's great. It's fantastic

(1h 11m 20s)

> It really is mind-boggling how much people can do like I didn't I haven't made one myself

(1h 11m 26s)

> But it really feels like you can just paint on the things and I think that's the case

(1h 11m 31s)

> I think that people are you know maneuvering decals and positioning them like oh my it's wild. It's great

(1h 11m 39s) **Al:**

> All right, have I missed anything

(1h 11m 41s)

> because I did things in a weird order.

(1h 11m 43s)

> Yes, you can find the podcast on Tumblr

(1h 11m 45s)

> on Blue Sky, THS Pod, you can send us feedback

(1h 11m 48s)

> from our website, harvestseason.club,

(1h 12m 41s)

> What?

(1h 12m 42s)

> So I'm just going through the news, and there's,

(1h 12m 44s)

> there's stuff puzzling me.

(1h 12m 45s) **Al:**

> There's always puzzling.

(1h 12m 46s) **Kevin :**

> Okay.

(1h 12m 49s)

> Yeah.

(1h 12m 50s)

> I didn't think we talked about legal mechanics.

(1h 12m 56s)

> I guess, I don't know, that's what looks like,

(1h 12m 58s)

[laughs]
