00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I'm gonna presume you know it

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I am aware of it, yes, I am aware of it from film and TV.

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : because it gets attention.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:07.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Okay.

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's, it is, it gets the most coverage out of any parade

24
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.680
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : in the U.S.

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : ever parades are, it's just a big old advertising opportunity.

28
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : So all the floats are, you know, like pop culture

29
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.480
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : and sort of the performances and yada, yada.

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Sonic, infamously popped and did not make into the parade.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.840
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: - Oh no.

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Much like in the 1993 parade, I believe it was in '93.

39
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.620
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: - Why does it sound like you've got a photographic memory

40
00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:58.140
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : At some point in the '90s.

41
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.260
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: of all of the Macy's Thanksgiving Daybreak's?

42
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.460
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : at least Sonic.

43
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:34.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But, yeah, you're right, but actually best of all, so they have musical performances, and these very wildly, some very perhaps antiquated acts and others, you know, they vary, so you got a lot of high school marching bands and so.

44
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.120
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: - I am amused at the idea of you going,

45
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.659
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: "Oh, it's just an advertising thing."

46
00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The name is an advertising thing.

47
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Never mind the rest of it.

48
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But true.

49
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:47.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Because it is 2025, you betcha they got the singing voices of huntrix and we got a live performance of gold and that was pretty good. It was pretty good.

50
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.560
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I did see that. I did see that. Although from what I can tell life might be a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's pretty good.

52
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.919
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: little bit of a stretch. We don't judge people for lip-syncing if people

53
00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yes. Got them. Yeah. Okay.

54
00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:03.680
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: have fun, that's the important thing. But I also saw many videos of what's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, I know.

57
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.879
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, Bobby, but I can't remember his Ken young that's his name. I saw many videos of him

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.919
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So why are we here? That's a good question. I just realized my headphones are on backwards

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: about cottagecore games, but specifically, I'm going to talk about Ashwood Valley, which

66
00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.800
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: is a game that I played some of. Let's put it this way. Let's put it this way. It's not

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : well um that I don't know that that's how that feels like the lowest bar you can compare to

70
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.879
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It is, but it gets over the bar.

71
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.639
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : yeah okay all right okay fine at least one

73
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.399
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I won't be putting it forward for Game of the Year.

74
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:29.360
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : less negative thing or the actual sweet

75
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Let's put it that way.

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I don't think you did. What did you think?

84
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.899
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : For Stanley, what are the things called?

<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Um, yeah, I don't know like it was, it felt very nice to have a quote-unquote light MCU film to watch, right?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.459
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : not everything is tied into the big govark.

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Right, that's what you mean by light. I was like I'm not sure what's light about it

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.620
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, Galactus was really well done.

92
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.779
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : How cool is that, huh?

93
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.459
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : So I have one of the goofiest villains.

94
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.439
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I love when they're in a ship.

95
00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.060
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Spoilers for fantastic four or first steps.

96
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.839
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Yeah.

97
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.800
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Fantastic for.

98
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.639
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Yeah.

99
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: If you want to go watch it now, it's on Disney+.

100
00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:27.379
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: This is a good film.

101
00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:28.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I enjoyed it.

102
00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:35.060
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: My joint second favorite superhero film of the year.

103
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.660
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The-- when they're on Galactus's ship,

104
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and they've been taken into the room to meet Galactus.

105
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

106
00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.839
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

107
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And you're kind of looking around going, oh, where's Galactus?

108
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.379
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and then-- because it's just like dark.

109
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

110
00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And then you just see his lies light, eyes light up.

111
00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And then he stands up, and you're like, oh, my word.

112
00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.519
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, he's a big boy

113
00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:58.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: He's really intimidating.

114
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.720
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, that's good. It's well done. Um, I like everyone's performances, you know of the four was well done

115
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Maybe a little too much info.

116
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:22.480
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It was fun.

117
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.660
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They got to get him ready for secret wars, right? Come on.

118
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.160
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : This can't be as great for this for two thumbs up.

119
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.360
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Other than that, we've got...

120
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.639
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : You know, actually, I got back into Marvel's snap.

121
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.740
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh, I haven't heard that name in a while.

122
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.199
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I just think I took mostly, October.

123
00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.199
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I'm at still play it on the regular

124
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:52.459
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : In a good place like it's I don't know how to put this like it's nothing here

125
00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:55.459
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay, I'll tell you what brought me back in the added man spider in

126
00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.180
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And any time man spiders added into something I'm in

127
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.480
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But other than that it's it's been fine

128
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.040
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : The metagame's okay, there's so there's so many cards and holy money

129
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.439
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : but overall it's fine I enjoyed what about and then of course Kirby Air

130
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:24.959
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Riders continues to exist and I play and like the game fits good oh okay

131
00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:30.360
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : there's this so I talked about city trial I don't know you're familiar

132
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : you heard it stuff I talked about it but you basically it's a mode where you

133
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : You run around, you collect buffs for a big little mini game, show it out at the end with the...

134
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : whatever you combined. Part of it is you can basically swap machines as you find them around on the map.

135
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:58.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Obviously some machines are better suited for others, but one of the funniest events that can happen, and actually happen in my first game.

136
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But if you die at... or if you don't have a vehicle at the end, because if you go hit and you die, you lose your vehicle. You're given like the worst vehicle in the game's called compact stuff.

137
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And so that happened in my first game, but it's just really funny because I've had it like where I'm dying as the countdown is going to zero to the end of the match.

138
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And I've even lost some machines because of that. But anyways, that's just the chaos. That is Kirby AirRider.

139
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's good stuff. I'm trying to think of what's saved without going too far into detail. But...

140
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I like it. Oh, okay, you know, I'll say this. Some of the bouncing, so all the previous vehicles from the first game returned.

141
00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:01.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And that was pretty young, so maybe I didn't fully grasp how to utilize all of them, but I felt like there was always some balance issues. Some stars were much better than others, some were much worse than others.

142
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Soccer, I fine tuned it. Everything feels good to use now. So, you know, thumbs up for that. When it's cyber, it's no shocker.

143
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But yeah, Kirby AirRider's good. The art is still good. The people making the machines. Plus the smiling friends coming out now. Good stuff.

144
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Alright, what about UL? What's going on?

145
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Let's see, what have I been up? Ah, yes, Pokémon.

146
00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:33.700
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Well, obviously I was playing some Ashwood Valley this week, but I have also finished everything

147
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:41.779
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: in Pokémon Legends CA except the last battles thing which you need to do to get the shiny charm,

148
00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:48.100
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: but I don't know if I'm going to, like, we've got a week and a half until the DLC comes out,

149
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And so it fuels.

150
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's about to finish everything for a week, except for, you know, in a week.

151
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah.

152
00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:00.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, well, you know, this is like when I say so I will talk about my my my youngest enjoys playing

153
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Astrobot, right?

154
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And I'll tell people oh yeah he he'd finished the entire game and creates like oh no I didn't

155
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: there's one level I haven't done and I'm like okay but that was like added in as an update

156
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: as the fifth update to the game, right?

157
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like you've finished the entire base game and then four out of five of the updates they added

158
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: like you can't you can't be like, "Oh, I didn't"

159
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I finished the game because they added something new after I stopped playing. That's not how that works.

160
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : [laughs]

161
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : The goal post moving. Good times. [laughs]

162
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:37.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So I have finished. I have done everything in Pokemon ZA that exists except the battle, the

163
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But did you, though?

164
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:45.379
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: do a thousand battles. I think I'm at like 550 or something. I just don't it's so many. It's so many battles.

165
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : That sounds like so much.

166
00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:50.419
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So, like, do I want to just like grind out those battles in the next week and a half?

167
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:58.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Just for the possibility that might do some more shiny hunting is such an unnecessary thing, a thousand bars

168
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:06.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : you know that that remind well okay first of all I will are you excited for the

170
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:16.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh, no. Yeah. No, I've already bought it. I am the problem, and I recognize this, but I also

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: like about the, you know, the most recent Pokémon games are legitimate and fair, but they're not

173
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: things that change how much I enjoy it. Like the, oh, it's such a small map and there's nowhere to

174
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: explore okay cool I don't like exploring

177

178
00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:56.820
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: bother me and yeah like the DLC is just basically Lumios again but in gray

179
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.100
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: scale and I'm like okay cool great I don't need to learn any new maps

180
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:09.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: fantastic we all like different things and that's fine so yeah I am

181
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.299
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the person that people hate because I keep buying the games and I keep buying

182
00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:18.519
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: everything because I like it I'm sorry but I like it that's just who I am

183
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.799
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, no, I, I say that I get it and also I'm probably going to still want to play in by this game. So, you know, I'm part of the problem too. So, I can't blame you.

184
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:32.919
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I just need to buy a second hand and then you'll be less of the problem, right?

185
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.919
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Um, but, uh,

186
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.600
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I guess it was fine before we used to buy all the games all the time. They were good back then.

187
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.840
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Where they are of your expectations change, that's the question.

188
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Wait, repeat. I went with it in my expectation change. Oh,

189
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.080
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Where are they, where are they good back then, or have your expectations changed?

190
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.320
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's always my question about program.

191
00:12:55.639 --> 00:13:03.080
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, um, no, no, no, no. No, I'm going to say they were better back then. My, so here's the thing,

192
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:10.440
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : my expectations for Pokemon has never been particularly high. It's like a very comfort food sort of

193
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.919
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : thing. Like, I know what I'm going to get on and I would enjoy it. Just I know there's better out

194
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:28.440
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : there, but that's fine. Um, so yeah, and because, you know, Pokemon was very formulaic for a good while. Um, so, yeah, I don't think my expectations change just

195
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.879
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I legitimately, you know what? I think,

196
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.159
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Well, I mean in so much as in so much as like we've all grown up, right?

197
00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:40.419
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And so obviously our expectations are going to be different than the where is a kid and and I'm not saying I'm not saying this to excuse things, right?

198
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:55.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. Okay.

199
00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:42.659
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like game series have to

200
00:13:43.299 --> 00:13:47.580
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Move forward right like if every game was just the same as it was 20 years ago

201
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: We would get bored of everything, right?

202
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm not saying the things shouldn't change, but like where are they better or where they just?

203
00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:56.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: We expect more and should get

204
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.240
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : There's, you know, this makes me think I think there's another element to this and that is the

205
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.919
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : things the world changing around it right like you

206
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.120
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : right yeah because when you look at Pokemon on the DS or the GBA or whatever right what are you

207
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.399
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : comparing it to other games on that console right like it stands out but now we saw on the switch

208
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:23.279
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : next to Xenoblade and Breath of the Wild I obviously you know those are completely different genres and

209
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:29.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : directions but the point is like it feels like the potential should be higher but it's not meaning it but

210
00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:35.120
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : also look at Scarlet Violet and the technical issues like there there's there's clearly at least within

211
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.919
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : in the last five years, there's absolutely been.

212
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : There are signs of their having issues and the quality.

213
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.240
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I do think that those, I think this carland violet are, are unique case, right?

214
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.639
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like, Legends Arceus didn't have those issues.

215
00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:57.200
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Legends ZA doesn't have those issues, certain shield didn't have those issues.

216
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.919
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Brilliant diamond and shining peril had some issues, but it's not on the same thing.

217
00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:06.639
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's hard to compare, even if it isn't as buggy, it's hard to compare because it's like a

218
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:12.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: couple, you know, it's traditional to the top down or sat on Pokemon.

219
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Yeah.

220
00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:10.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Yeah.

221
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:21.120
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's hard to compare anyway, but like, all the other Switch games have not really had the same issues at all.

222
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.919
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And I'm not playing Legends ZA on the Switch, but from people that are playing on it,

223
00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:30.320
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: as far as I can tell, it's fine. It's not, like, it's not amazing, but it's not anywhere new

224
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.799
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: to as bad a skyland violet were, right? Like, that is a unique, and I would love to see the

225
00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:40.320
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: behind the scenes on why they shoved out what they did when they did. I wonder if part of the

226
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.919
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: problem was.

227
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.879
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: that it got caught up in the Covid delays, right? Like we not for a fact, but like you'd be very

228
00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:54.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: surprised if, if, if, you know, legends are curious and brilliant downshowing peril had been delayed,

229
00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.799
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: right? I think we all know it is almost definite that those two games got delayed. And therefore,

230
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.799
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: that would have knock on effects for Scarlet and Violet, right? And so the question is, did they,

231
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:12.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: should, was the issue that they just didn't get the time they needed for that?

232
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.679
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And was that because of the delays? And therefore, was not going to be an issue for the next game,

233
00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:23.600
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: because they had reset their cycle by ruining Scarlet and Violet in its launch, right?

234
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.039
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Is that, is that how the, and that's why the in-legency is fine, because they had

235
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.080
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: taken all of the brunt on those games, whereas actually they should have just

236
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.240
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: continued to fix it and just gone, oh well, we're just going to have to have an extra year that doesn't

237
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and have a game that we don't want to have.

238
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

239
00:16:42.000 --> 00:17:00.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I think there's perfectly legitimate complaints to have about this game, about the story, about the limitations of what the world is, of the exploration, blah, blah, blah, that can't be solved by just doing better next time.

240
00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:44.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, it is

241
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's a fundamental change to how you think about games.

242
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah.

243
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But, I think the bogginess of Scarlet and Violet, I think it's... unless... maybe we need to wait for the...

244
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: next gen games right gen 10 and see how they are. But I think if there's not massive issues in them, like, there wasn't Scarlet and Violet, like, I think it's probably safe to say that that was a wall.

245
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:29.680
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : okay you know what that yeah okay to the like to the lows it went to from

246
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : especially the technical side that's fine that's fair you can call it the outlier

247
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:49.819
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's that is why I'm specifically talking about right like the the technical parts of that like story wise gameplay wise all these things right you can't write that off as a one off obviously because that is just what they've been doing for a long time and you know you can say there's like.

248
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.720
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah yeah right

249
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:59.539
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yep, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.

250
00:17:50.700 --> 00:18:02.299
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: One offs with in the positive direction right like I rarely see a pokemon fan who didn't love legends arcius and less you just didn't like fundamentally the changes to how the game and play worked.

251
00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:05.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But in terms of like everything else, I don't like

252
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.819
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: everyone who I see complaining about

253
00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:09.660
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: legends of the years, like I can't believe this is the

254
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.339
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: follow up to legends arceus, right? Like that's how the

255
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.799
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

256
00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:16.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: frame it, if they're disappointed in it. So I think it's

257
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: probably fair to say that that was probably an outlier

258
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: in the positive direction in terms of story. But yeah, it's

259
00:18:24.339 --> 00:18:28.140
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: it's not like every Pokemon game has been buggy, you know,

260
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and every game has technical issues, right? Literally every

261
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.720
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:35.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: game has technical issues. I think it's probably

263
00:18:35.539 --> 00:18:38.180
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: to say the two big buggy games would be the first ones

264
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:48.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: in Scarlet and Violet, right? But anyway, I, yeah, I like, I

265
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.140
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : [laughs]

266
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.940
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh man.

267
00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:51.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: very much enjoyed my time with ZA and I will be playing

268
00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:55.740
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the DLC because I would enjoy a little bit more of that. And

269
00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I get the people who say that should be base game, but I'm

270
00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:01.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: going to, I'm going to continue to be part of the problem

271
00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:04.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: by the BLC. (laughs)

272
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.019
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, sure. Yeah.

273
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I don't get the choice of it being base game, right?

274
00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:10.819
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I have the choice of do I say,

275
00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:15.819
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: oh, that should not be paid updates and not experience it myself,

276
00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: or do I go, yeah, this is a terrible situation,

277
00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:21.180
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and I'm not helping the situation by buying it,

278
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: but also one individual's not gonna change anything,

279
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.740
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and I would like to experience it,

280
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.140
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: so therefore I'm going to pay an experience it.

281
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. You'll imagine if they just let it be free.

282
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And none of those situations are, there's no ideal there, right?

283
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.720
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Wow. Like how much that would improve the image of all situation?

284
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.039
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Possibly. Yeah. Yeah, but I

285
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:54.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: When was the last time they gave us something for free? I guess maybe this garlic and violet switch to updates

286
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:14.079
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Okay. That's the, that's the line. I mean, it was

287
00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:58.319
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So they are possible it is possible for them to do that. Can you imagine if they charged for that?

288
00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:05.279
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Would I have paid for that probably that's bad

289
00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:11.759
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But it would have been absolutely terrible terrible marketing

290
00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:20.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : already bad enough. They put the real flag and he'll see. Oh, oh, oh, come on.

291
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: [laughs]

292
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.079
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : that, you know, that's, I think that's part of the whole, just the, the overall issue of like

293
00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:35.839
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : a really better back then. Like, it's the money hungry, like, ringing their hands is so

294
00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:49.640
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : transparent. These days it feels like, right. Um, well, yeah. Yeah. You're like, like, you can't

295
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:47.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yes, I also do think that sometimes people overuse the phrase cash grab though, um, like

296
00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:50.819
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's like when when they

297
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : called Scarlet Violet. Cash, grabbing you probably but...

298
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : ...or four million into the health team.

299
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, it's like I just feel like it's it's such a an overused term

300
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's like I saw people saying oh

301
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: When they announced that they were making a second kpop demon hunters people like oh such a cash grab and you're like one

302
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.339
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They've not even made it yet. We used to talk about it too.

303
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.740
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : [laughing]

304
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:17.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like, unless they massively downgrade the quality, they're putting a lot of money into a second one.

305
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:27.299
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Three, people were asking for this. From months, they were like, "Oh, we need more. We need more. I can't believe they cut stuff out of the film. We need more of this."

306
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

307
00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:32.180
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And I'm like, "You don't get both ways." It's not a cash grab. Shut up.

308
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:40.119
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

309
00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:40.339
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Now, the Disney directed DVD sequels that they used to do, those are cash grabs, right?

310
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.160
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

311
00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:58.160
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And the, okay, you know what's crazy though, even as cash grabs a lot of those had sold to some degree. Like I, I, I have perhaps roasting to glasses, but I have fallen memories of some of those. I'll tell you what to, you know, you know what is the post to child.

312
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:13.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : How for cash grab the live action, Moana. Hey, quote unquote live action. Oh, like.

313
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:19.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I haven't seen any, I haven't seen any of the Disney live action remakes that they're

314
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.200
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I've seen more than I probably would wish I had, but it's interesting because when they

315
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:35.359
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : started out, they were decent enough, it felt like they were at least adding something.

316
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:41.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Well, yeah, when they started out, it wasn't remakes, it was new stories, right? So they had what was the,

317
00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:36.359
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : One of the...

318
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: there was a maleficent and there was

319
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:57.059
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I'll get I'll give you one beats dragon that no one knows about that one, but Pete's dragon and it got a live action quote unquote remake and you know what that was actually decent

320
00:22:57.059 --> 00:22:58.059
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Um

321
00:22:58.059 --> 00:23:06.859
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Like I haven't seen the original, but it's very clearly different and and in tone and direction and yeah, that was all right actually

322
00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:12.700
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But but yeah, I'm a lift sent that was the right. That was I wasn't even a remake. That was just a new story

323
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.119
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Well, that's what I'm saying for a long time their live action stuff that was based on animated stuff wasn't remakes

324
00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:24.279
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It was new stuff in the world, right? There was Maleficent. There was the Crella one

325
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah.

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I can't remember the name of that was was it just Crella maybe?

329
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I think there's just Corral out there.

330
00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:33.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like those were different you can say they're bad, but they were at least trying to do something there

331
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : The one where the Dalmatians.

332
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah.

334
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.640
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh, yeah, it was so stupid

335
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I think that is a basic prequel issue, right?

342
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : No.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Now, I haven't seen the virtual...

351
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You haven't seen the first one either.

352
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I haven't seen any Wicked of any variety, but if I go...

353
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I watched the first one, right?

354
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I was like, oh, I generally pretty good.

355
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I thought it was a really good self-contained prequel to the Wizard of Oz.

356
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I really liked it.

357
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But it's still done a few of the things that prequels always do.

358
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It was like the soul, you've seen soul.

359
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:24.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I presume the star wars you haven't okay, so the there's one the the example I always use of stupid prequel things where they over explain everything is the one in solo a

360
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.180
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : No, I haven't. I'm not that. No. It's our row one

361
00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.759
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Star Wars story

362
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, talent will tell me where that works.

363
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:35.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So there's a point where he's like I'm going through I can't remember the context of this because it was so stupid I wiped it from my memory

364
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.740
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But he was in he was traveling right and so he's going up to to travel and they ask him what is your name?

365
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : [laughter]

366
00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:48.799
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: He says he says he doesn't have a name. I think or something like that. There's a reason why he doesn't like

367
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.160
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Have a surname. He's hand, but he doesn't have a surname. And so the guy buying the desk looks at him goes

368
00:24:55.839 --> 00:25:01.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Solo because he's traveling alone, just like stamps down and writes his name is solo and

369
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh my gosh.

370
00:25:02.359 --> 00:25:05.240
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You're like not only does that not make any sense

371
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:11.920
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That is so stupid that would mean you would have you know thousands of people in this universe called solo purely because they were

372
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Traveling alone

373
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.660
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But also it just was so unneeded right like you don't have to explain everything in your prequel

374
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:25.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You don't have to tell me why Han Solo is called Han Solo. He's called that because that's his name

375
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:34.799
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : The fantastic for the 2015 one to say that again.

376
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.920
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh, yes, it again fantastic

377
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:40.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's the thing is just it's so I hate like prequels do this a lot with her like oh here's this thing that we need to explain

378
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: No.

379
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:51.599
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You just didn't need to explain it and then they tie themselves up and not trying to get

380
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, my God. Yeah, yeah.

381
00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:53.400
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: to specific places.

382
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.160
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Generally, I'm like, don't do a prequel, right?

383
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.200
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Because you just end up in a stupid position but whatever.

384
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.440
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I don't forget what my point was.

385
00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:06.079
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yep. Live action remakes for the Disney. It's not great.

386
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.920
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: My point was prequels are, yeah, they're stupid stuff.

387
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:15.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay. Okay. But I want to try to make earlier, they went from, you know, being different or decent

388
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.440
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : enough. They've just been on the

389
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:47.960
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : scale downwards. Do you know about the Leelon Stitch? Did you watch that or do you know anything about that? Yeah. Yeah. We've gone from, you know, soulless live action to, like, intention, intentionally antithetical to your original. We want to be offensive. Oh, I don't remember how he got here. Yeah.

390
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh, yeah, yeah. The changes they made, yeah. Oh, yeah. I haven't seen the live action. I've obviously seen the original.

391
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's excellent. And I am aware of the changes that they made, yeah.

392
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.920
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I don't know what's worse whether they'd like change it to be different from the

393
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: original in a works way or like the how to train your dragon which is like this

394
00:26:54.059 --> 00:26:59.039
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: is just a shot for shot remake like I honestly don't know which I think is worse

395
00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:15.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no, yeah, okay. Scrap. That's how we got here. Yeah, and these are cash grabs and and you know what? I'd rather take the shop for shot instead of the the word. We're going to make it worse, like, Oh,

396
00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:04.079
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: because it's like why are you even doing this then the answers money

397
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:31.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I don't know why, I just, I feel like if they're making it worse or at least trying to do something there, like they've like, and I'm not saying the reason behind it is good, but they're at least going, why is it this way, can we make it better, let's do this, and yeah, that might be an stupid idea about.

398
00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:21.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I guess. But,

399
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:46.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But, but it's like, it shows a, a complete lack of misunderstanding and appreciation for the original. Like, hey, you're right.

400
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:49.400
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, sure, but at least then you know that you can see that and you're like this was terrible. I'm not gonna watch that

401
00:27:46.500 --> 00:28:01.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Now, now, well, yeah. Sorry, cash grab. Oh, I don't remember how he got here, but we used me.

402
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I

403
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:26.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, I'm going to have to check that out. I actually, ooh, I like the side of that.

404
00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:13.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: We got there through Pokémon we got there through Pokémon. I did see I'm do watch any donkey videos video in donkey

405
00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:22.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: He did a carbie aerators one this week and I was watching it going it's Kevin just donkey

406
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's just feels like it was written

407
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: by Kevin. He basically says it's the best game of the year.

408
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, I'm good at the check that out actually. Ooh, I like the side of that.

409
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:38.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, kind of is, okay, you made a point of this earlier.

410
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:54.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : How wild it is. We got, you know, these sequels to all these cart racers in one year of Mario Kart and Sonic and Kirby just lining planets aligning all in the same year.

411
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Mario Kart, Sonic Racing and Kirby.

412
00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:01.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And Kirby air writer. It's absolutely kerbs tops all of them, by the way, as much like Mario Kart is fine. I like it, you know.

413
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:10.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It has the issues or whatever people dropped it, but it was fine. There's nothing inherently wrong. It's Sonic writers. I even tried, but I've heard great things and obviously I love Sonic, but.

414
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:22.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : No, there's no comparison. Kirby air, I says, oh, it's peak. Absolutely. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it. All the all the it's the six seven. Whatever the kids say.

415
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:31.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, we're done. That's all we care about the show.

416
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.079
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: All right, well, there we are, Pokemon and Kirby.

417
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.740
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Rona once saw a picture of Kirby and she was like,

418
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: "Is that Pokemon, or is that no, it's not Pokemon."

419
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:40.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, and that's food for thought.

420
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.259
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I understood why she says that it looks kind of like a Pokemon.

421
00:29:38.259 --> 00:29:40.180
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm like, "I see where you're coming from."

422
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:49.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I get it. I get it. I didn't look at chance. He'll fairy. I get it. You know what? One thing about Kirby air rights. I forgot.

423
00:29:49.500 --> 00:30:00.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : So something I'm enjoying because obviously it's it's fairly popular. I would say for a Kirby gay or like, you know, Kirby air rights niche. So it's getting a lot of attention relative to what it was before.

424
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:10.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And and even for a Kirby game. Kirby games are somewhat niche. It's like everyone knows it, but not everyone plays the game straight.

425
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:22.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : What I love, though, because so many people are picking up air writers. People are getting a taste of the the eldritch cosmic core nightmares that are hidden inside Kirby games.

426
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:31.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Because air writers, the story and air writers, it's actually a fairly light one compared to a lot of other Kirby games, but it still still goes places.

427
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:49.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : One of the tracks there's there's actually you're witnessing genocide as a planet is being destroyed. Oh, that's just during the race itself. Much less the story. Yeah. So, you know, you get taste, but this is still light compared to other stuff Kirby has done.

428
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:42.339
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh. Oh, fun.

429
00:30:49.500 --> 00:31:01.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : So that's that's been a real treat watching people sing. Oh, this is probably go this hard. No, he usually goes much much harder. Oh, good times. I love my eldritch or polio.

430
00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:03.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Alright, well, let's talk about some news, shall we?

431
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:12.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: First up, we have Flotsam. This is the game where you are like reclaiming rubbish from the sea

432
00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:18.220
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and making our village out of that. They've announced that their 1.0 is coming

433
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: on the 4th of December, which is just one day after this episode releases.

434
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:29.380
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay, I don't remember this title. Um, there's a lot of cool things. Okay

435
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:35.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: We haven't talked about it for a while, I don't think, but it's been in early access for 6 years, almost the entire time this podcast.

436
00:31:34.299 --> 00:31:41.220
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, wow wow that that is wild. Well. Hey good for them

437
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.380
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I actually like what I'm seeing. First of all the concept

438
00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.400
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I love the concept because you know, you know, there's that giant trash island down the Pacific

439
00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.420
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Let's turn that to a real island. I'd like that.

440
00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:05.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Um, secondly, I like the art style, you know, very, so, not so, it's, I guess, associated, I don't know these terms, but it's, it's thick outlines.

441
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:09.519
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It looks like game other games that are called cell shading so I think that's a fair

442
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, that's correct.

443
00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:13.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: affair statement whether it's technically true or not I don't care

444
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, that's correct.

445
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It looks like a wind wakery, but with thick outlines, that's how I'm going to describe it.

446
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:32.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's good. I love the arts stuff. Oh, what a cool idea turning crash into a floating village. Very cool. Yeah, that looks, that's, that's, that's coming out.

447
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:43.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Cool, I haven't played it. It came out before I was all buying every single kickstarter,

448
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and it is a city builder, so probably not one for me.

449
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.440
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: next we have super zoos story they've announced that their alpha has

450
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : The reverse of the last set.

451
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's just they're not at the state they want it to be so they're going to delay it till next year.

452
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

453
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay, first of all, I didn't see there's dinosaurs confirmed in this, but okay.

454
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Um, I didn't realize we were there, but here we are.

455
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.319
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Don't say I'm so disappointed.

456
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:21.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And okay, as someone who just, look, was about to say, like I mentioned last week or week before whatever, I picked up.

457
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Let's, let's build the zoo again.

458
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : There's high, I'm not going to lie.

459
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : They have a, you know, uphill battle here.

460
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : So good luck to that.

461
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I like it in theory, but, but hey, they're delaying.

462
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:43.859
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, well, I'm I I you know what I'm excited about this is the the RPG aspects of it, right? Like you are like actually

463
00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:47.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Being a person in this game and you are you know

464
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : A character, sure.

465
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Character you're doing story through this whereas

466
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Part of my problem with city builders is they're so

467
00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:01.759
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Amorphous and you're just like I do some stuff, you know, okay, but okay. Yeah, exactly

468
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.619
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, menus the game, you know, yeah, no, you're right.

469
00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:04.700
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I get that, you're right, you're right.

470
00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.420
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : That is the difference here and arguably the selling point,

471
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.739
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : but that's, you know, the double edge blade here.

472
00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.900
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : They're going to fall into all the trappings, but we'll see.

473
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:21.599
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah. They have not delayed their beta, the not delayed their beta or their full

474
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : We'll see later because they delayed.

475
00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:22.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: release yet, we're still expecting.

476
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:34.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: 27, but let's let's not pretend those will probably end up being delayed as well.

477
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:43.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : you know what? Some? Leave it or not. Listeners, when you develop things, if one thing gets delayed,

478
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So you can't delay the alpha and then not delay the alpha.

479
00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:46.960
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : sometimes the other thing gets delayed later. It's just, uh,

480
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.820
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and reading through the comments, I think it's important. If you are a game developer to

481
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:59.139
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: remember, you get generally positive press if you delay a game. If you're open and honest about

482
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:05.780
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: what's happening. And the less you say, the more likely people get annoyed. So people generally

483
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

484
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:10.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: okay with this disappointed, but accepting of it. You go and look at the comments of

485
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.420
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Understanding

486
00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:15.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: any of the other games that delayed for like six years without telling people what was happening.

487
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.599
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - Soaksaw.

488
00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like, soaksong is a unique situation.

489
00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:24.800
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - The worst part is, I don't blame them, right?

490
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : 'Cause I don't, 'cause what was the delay gonna be

491
00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:28.559
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : or with her message gonna be?

492
00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:31.360
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Sorry, guys, we're having too much fun developing

493
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:37.519
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I mean they also I don't think they also I don't think they ever gave a time frame for

494
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.119
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : and putting this gate stuff in his gates

495
00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:36.079
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : or delaying again, (laughs)

496
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.480
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : No, no, they didn't, but like,

497
00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.079
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : and this is a small portion,

498
00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:46.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : but there was at least one group, right?

499
00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:50.659
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I don't know, Kickstarter people who were actually owed this

500
00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:53.579
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : because via the campaign promises and all that,

501
00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:55.099
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : it's a degree, right?

502
00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:58.179
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Like, yay, probably could have used the update

503
00:35:58.179 --> 00:36:00.860
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : of here and there, but you're right,

504
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:08.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I understand that, I understand that, but one, they did get it in the end, which is not always the case.

505
00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.139
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I don't think they gave any timeframe.

506
00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:03.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah.

507
00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.619
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : They did.

508
00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:19.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Two, they did know that there was some, they knew we'd have taken longer because they did essentially have a delay when they were said we're turning this into a game on its own.

509
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That was essentially the delay post, right?

510
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.579
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yes, yes.

511
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:28.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But three, it's not like they hadn't already got anything from the Kickstarter, they had a whole game, right?

512
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:39.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I think it's probably different when you haven't got a game, and you've got a game, but you're still waiting on the second game that was meant to be a DLC, right?

513
00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:41.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like those feel like very different expectations.

514
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:49.699
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : fair enough people. Those poor unfortunate souls waiting for their 3DS copy of Mighty Number 9.

515
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.280
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Or the Wii U version of of silk song cuz that was the the joke because they did announce that it would be on that and it didn't come to it

516
00:36:53.539 --> 00:37:00.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, there you go. That's it. Yeah. Sure.

517
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:59.599
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That those are the people that get to complain

518
00:37:00.039 --> 00:37:01.559

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Otherwise, I hate the game.

586
00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:55.800
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: just learned your final thing through a tutorial system. It just like constantly throwing

587
00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.800
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: new things at you.

597
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:19.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Um, this is always the thing that trips up game developers, uh, co-op always takes longer than

598
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:29.639
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, it's very hard because you just imagine you all the things about game that but do it times for and I'm working at the same time. That's hard

599
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: they expect.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.840
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, it brings up a whole other dimension of possible bugs

602
00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:39.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, I make a dimension bug

603
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They've also

604
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:43.599

605
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:45.239
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Probably not let's continue

606
00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:48.039
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They've also given the ability to rotate

607
00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:51.840
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Shops, so everything in the game is now rotatable

608
00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:56.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: What I think you could rotate things, but not building

609
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:04.300
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : That's a good one. I like that because it's so, you know, like, design your town. That's probably

610
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And you can also finally move the train station.

611
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.480
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, it's a go one, too, although that does raise questions like, you know, if you slap

612
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.559
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : in the middle of town, do you know how far she don't, but you're trying to run barrel through

613
00:41:22.559 --> 00:41:25.679
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : town and run everything over, probably doesn't.

614
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.219
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: No, so, the train goes into a tunnel.

615
00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:33.460
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay, so what if you put in the middle of town, why is this just a while E. Coyote and

616
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.179
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The tunnel is in the middle of town.

617
00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:35.559
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Click on the link and go down to the train station section.

618
00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.800
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You will see exactly what I mean.

619
00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It makes perfect sense when you see what it looks like.

620
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:49.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. That's what that's just a magic rock with the tunnel in it. Yeah, I know I get it. Just I guess it goes underground. Okay, sure.

621
00:41:42.239 --> 00:41:43.599
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's like roller coaster style.

622
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That is, that is the, the epitome of suspension of disbelief.

623
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah.

624
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.599
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm just gonna let it, let it be.

625
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.400
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Let it exist.

626
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.320
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It is what it is.

627
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.039
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's fine.

628
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:07.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, like I said, it's Dwayne Coyote painting the, you know, the train hole, the tunnel and then just go, it just works. It's fine.

629
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.639
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Pretty much.

630
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, I don't like the.

631
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I don't like that at all.

632
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: [laughs]

633
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's just the fart gun from.

634
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:22.559
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Pretty much, yeah. I don't know why you would want to do that either because like that would just lower your town rating, but I don't know.

635
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Well, well, I'll tell you why because it's now co-op. That's, that's why.

636
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.400
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Oh no disaster.

637
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : You got to give the tools for proper co-op.

638
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.199
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It does kind of fit in with the ridiculousness of the game, but...

639
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.480
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh absolutely, this game is absurd, I love it, it's great.

640
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Next, because apparently this is

641
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:54.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the update episode because there's so many updates, we have out and about, they've released their summer update, so it includes summer plants and mushrooms, new recipes, friendship tiers, paddle boarding,

642
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.199
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, okay. That's, uh, that's cool. I've never paddle boarded, but that's, that's good. That's an like a big one.

643
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.320
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I have, I fell over.

644
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:15.760
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Uh, okay. Yeah, I mean, that, that feels like it could happen. You know, that warning seems to fit for it.

645
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:21.280
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, I don't know, but hey, like, it's probably good fit for this game, at least I'll say that

646
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.159
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : cuz you know this is the one we're just out foraging and stuff so

647
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.639
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: yeah feels chill. I do think that people who are good at paddleboarding they do

648
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:40.199
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Water transport that's cool. I don't want to go Pat Blurney. They do. Yeah, no, I don't know. That sounds about right. It kind of feels like skiing.

649
00:43:30.639 --> 00:43:36.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: make it look chill but when I've done it it's very much stressful.

650
00:43:40.199 --> 00:43:50.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : You know, you're like skiing doesn't look quite far because like you know going down the mountain, but it's really hard for what I understand.

651
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.519
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I am more of a kayaker, I like just sitting in my boat and chilling and moving around and not having to balance.

652
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:08.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a hard part. I couldn't pet open a camp balance. Also, I even scared to go to kayak. But we couldn't do that bad balance.

653
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Kayaks are really, really hard to tip.

654
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, that's comforting to know. Okay, I'll keep that.

655
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.679
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: enjoy I enjoy kayaking unless you go on whitewater if you go on whitewater then

656
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.780
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Well, yeah, yeah exactly. Let's see. That's the read. That's the whole point

657
00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:31.119
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: obviously you're gonna fall over but that's kind of the point but no I'm a I'm a sea

658
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.260
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Make it more aerodynamic

659
00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:40.599
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and lock kayaker I don't I don't I don't do whitewater I have done but it's not my

660
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.780
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

661
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, no, yeah, they're very

662
00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:44.820
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, they're they are different end goals. Absolutely

663
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:56.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: next we have two pixelia. They have released their order in the court update. And this

664
00:44:56.099 --> 00:45:04.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: includes the justice system and a new career of a lawyer. And I can see why this game is

665
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:13.619
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : yeah it is yeah it's so I'm just I'm scrolling and there's more there's a

666
00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: taking a while because there's so much in this. Have you clicked on the link for this? It's

667
00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:18.019
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : JET system, holy moly! Hahaha! Hahaha!

668
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like, when you're a lawyer, you're like, because of the careers into

669
00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Pixelia are like actual detailed careers. You actually have to do

670
00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:28.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: things for it. So you get your license to be a lawyer. And then

671
00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:33.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: you can either, you can do, you can, you can decide to either be a

672
00:45:33.699 --> 00:45:39.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: defense lawyer or prosecution. And then you like have a list of

673
00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:43.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: trials that you can be part of. And then you can go in and you

674
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.360
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: you actually have to like, argue your case.

675
00:45:46.500 --> 00:46:16.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And the whole system like happens. You have to do all these things and you have to like, you can, there's a, there's an objection system. If there's a cooldown for an objection, you can only object a certain number of times, it's just, it's so detailed. And there's an actual duty that you have to convince. And I don't, it's,

676
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.340
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah.

677
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

678
00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:12.460
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Then out

679
00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:18.199
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Legal consequences for other like for everything in game apparently there's

680
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yes, 'cause of course, now that there's a legal system, you of course aren't necessarily a lawyer.

681
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You can still end up in court if you do specific things.

682
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.960
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : There's multiple lawsuit types, defamation, death, assault, public disturbance.

683
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:41.219
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: This game is, I am convinced they're just trying to recreate the entirety of life.

684
00:46:39.639 --> 00:46:49.159
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It is, they, at minimum, they have self become an MMO, maybe single, I don't know if it's

685
00:46:49.159 --> 00:46:54.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : multiplayer, but it's on MMO. But...

686
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: question I don't know. I think it's

687
00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:01.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Is this, can, is this in the demo currently? I'm gonna guess no, but, uh, well, it's his update,

688
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.320
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I don't know, but, oh.

689
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The demo I wouldn't be surprised

690
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:14.199
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, probably not. Well, I'll get a, get a hype. We don't get the fuss about

691
00:47:14.199 --> 00:47:20.119
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : suing people for defamation much in these, the NR, our game, so, cloudage core games. Although

692
00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:21.559
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But we probably should.

693
00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:23.400
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Stardew could you do that.

694
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I don't want to be sued when I, you know, insult Clint.

695
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.679
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's a couple of people I'd like to see.

696
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:53.559
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, but what if you win, though, yeah, exact right, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:47:29.539 --> 00:47:32.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: All right.

698
00:47:32.579 --> 00:47:39.320
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, what Judy would convict me, that's the question.

699
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:47.159
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: If I killed Clint, if I killed Clint, what Judy would convict me?

700
00:47:47.159 --> 00:47:51.199
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I just for the legal authorities that are listening to this, I'm talking about in a game.

701
00:47:51.199 --> 00:47:53.199
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Thank you

702
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.179
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm not going to kill anyone in real life. I'm not going to kill anyone who started you family either because you can't although I bet there's a mod for that

703
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:11.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, of course there isn't amount for everything, right, absolutely, who knows, there might be a legal mod out there, yeah, there you go.

704
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.880
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, here you go. There's a murder there's a murder mod

705
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.800
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: There is a murder mod

706
00:48:09.159 --> 00:48:11.159
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: allows for the murder of NPCs

707
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay.

708
00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:12.679
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: excellent

709
00:48:12.679 --> 00:48:16.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Next we have research story the last of the updates

710
00:48:16.639 --> 00:48:22.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: 1.1 update it is coming soon. It's currently up on the their they've got like a beta

711
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.440
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: branch that you can switch to if you want to play it. This includes the heart event tracker

712
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.400
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : good, that should be the fault in every game. Social elements, never, you know, I mean like

713
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.460
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : relationship elements.

714
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:43.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Well, so this isn't necessarily, this isn't the tracking just the heart levels, it's tracking whether you've seen specific heart events.

715
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I'll still stand by the statement

716
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I agree it's good, but like most most farming games don't have that.

717
00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:52.579
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, but it should be

718
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:57.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm both sure fair and big technical changes under the hood to

719
00:48:58.539 --> 00:49:03.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: What was it they said help long-term maintenance and improvement of the game

720
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:10.739
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I don't know what that means. They added more RAM to the servers.

721
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's good

722
00:49:08.219 --> 00:49:11.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It will make it easier for them to add new features based

723
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:22.900
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Famously said by every developer ever, and had never been regarded once.

724
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.960
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: we wouldn't know compared to what exactly compared to an alternate reality where they haven't done it.

725
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:33.099
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I guess so. I guess that's true. I will go ahead and go ahead and smile.

726
00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:36.159
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And they've also added, they've also added modding support in other languages,

727
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:51.739
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I appreciate it. I'm just thinking, like, as someone who's never modded or done any modding,

728
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: useful for some people.

729
00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:58.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : like, where does the support come in, like, for, you know, how does it being in Spanish?

730
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Where does the Spanish fit into the modding?

731
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:08.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: A good question. I mean the modding, so mods come in two parts either mods that are supported

732
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:16.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: officially because the game has functions that you are meant to use when you're doing modding

733
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:24.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: or unofficial modding where you you're literally changing the code inside the game

734
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:35.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: and those mods break very quickly. They break on every update because obviously

735
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:38.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the code underlying has changed quite a lot whereas the official modding generally doesn't

736
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:45.179
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: change the code it uses functions that the code provides you and therefore generally are less

737
00:50:45.179 --> 00:50:51.179
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: likely to break when an update happens. It's not that they never do but they still do sometimes

738
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay

739
00:50:51.179 --> 00:50:56.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: break but they're less likely to break whereas official mods basically always break because that's

740
00:50:56.619 --> 00:50:59.659
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's how it works.

741
00:50:59.659 --> 00:51:01.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The language support

742
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:11.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm not sure how that comes into this, presumably, presumably it allows mods to say this

743
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.380
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay, yeah, wouldn't you break it? Yeah.

744
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:17.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: is what the additional text in-game is in the different languages.

745
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's the thing I'm currently assuming would be mod language support.

746
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:34.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. No. We, they actually just re-translated every single line of code into every

747
00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:22.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's also possible.

748
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:27.340
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They mean they're allowing mods to add other languages into the game.

749
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:45.320
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : language. They support them. Either way, it's, it's a good effort. I, I, I like to say I'm not a

750
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.239
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: [laughing]

751
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.519
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : moderate type person, but I, I tip my head towards the conference.

752
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:58.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And our final piece of news is, Iconi Island have announced that they are no longer with their main publisher.

753
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They will be self-publishing, except in Asian countries they still have a publisher for those territories.

754
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So it doesn't really make much difference, but that is a thing.

755
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:18.639
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : probably not on a line, but it's all it yeah. Look, I know it's business stuff but it's almost

756
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That is a thing.

757
00:52:18.639 --> 00:52:24.559
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : close to the equivalent of breakup drama. That's what this amounts to.

758
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:30.179
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, yeah, pretty much pretty much all right, that's the news. Let's talk about

759
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Ashwood Valley, so

760
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:40.860
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay, it's the one I do have siblings that

761
00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So Kevin hasn't played this game although he does own it

762
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:44.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: This we do siblings. Yes, so right. Let me so this is only on the switch

763
00:52:45.539 --> 00:52:51.219
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: We both bought it when it was like super cheap. What was it like one dollar or something insanely cheap like that?

764
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.940
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, so far. Yeah, yeah.

765
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Normal prices $10. I think

766
00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:58.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Read its blurb before I get into the

767
00:52:59.539 --> 00:53:01.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Probably five minute discussion about this game

768
00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:05.219
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Your sibling is a cat now time to fix that

769
00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:14.340
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: In Ashwood Valley, you'll step into the shoes of either Luna or Draco to magical siblings who spell casting mishap opens a portal to a vibrant world

770
00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:19.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And turns one of them into a cat. Obviously because those two things are basically the same thing

771
00:53:20.179 --> 00:53:22.340
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Now it's up to you to restore a ruined cottage.

772
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:27.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: befriend quirky characters and uncover the secrets of the enchanted valley to break the curse.

773
00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:32.579
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Grow magical plants, explore changing seasons, complete odd quests for chocolate-loving

774
00:53:32.579 --> 00:53:37.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: mayors or cheese-obsessed dwarfs, and pet all the wild animals you can find even the strawberry cows.

775
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: With cozy farming, wizzicle characters and hand-animated pixel art, Ashwood Valley is a

776
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: charming adventure about family, friendship, and a lot of fluff.

777
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, that was a lot of last one.

778
00:53:50.739 --> 00:53:52.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So, my intro

779
00:53:52.500 --> 00:54:01.880
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: to this game would be it is some of what it says it is so the story wise we'll get into

780
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: that later on but like it does start off being like choose one so you choose one of the

781
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:11.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: siblings and it's like okay the other ones are cat now okay it doesn't really tell you

782
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:18.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: much and you just kind of get plopped into this random other place but you don't know it's

783
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : [Music]

784
00:54:18.539 --> 00:54:22.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: another place because it's just a place, right? You haven't seen a previous place.

785
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:28.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: you're just in a place and you've got a building and there's a few characters and a few animals.

786
00:54:30.099 --> 00:54:40.659
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You are like farming yes but like not really to do much. You're farming to get food to give to

787
00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:49.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the animals around the village to befriend them and then this is the entire story. Once you have befriended

788
00:54:49.539 --> 00:54:52.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: every animal who's like, I don't know how many times.

789
00:54:52.500 --> 00:55:02.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's it, that's the story.

790
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:10.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I think, as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong, this game has seasons and I think I've

791
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: does. It is a standard farming game in the aspect.

792
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : heard.

793
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yep.

794
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And I believe I've heard a lot of people hit credits by the end of spray.

795
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.780
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : You're one.

796
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.880
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yes, absolutely, uh

797
00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.699
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Which is wild.

798
00:55:22.139 --> 00:55:33.760
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And and the the the the the you say hit credits. There's nothing really happens like your your sibling gets turned into their sibling and now just stands there instead of standing there like a cat

799
00:55:22.699 --> 00:55:29.139
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yep.

800
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.760
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They're no standing there as a human

801
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.260
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But that's it. There's no real like oh congratulations. You did it

802
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Okay

803
00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:42.199
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm

804
00:55:42.199 --> 00:55:47.440
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Literally all you'd have to do is befriend all the animals by giving them carrots for like

805
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: 10 days in a row and then you're done. That's it

806
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.260
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : - That's so wild.

807
00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:54.079
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That is the story

808
00:55:55.119 --> 00:56:00.239
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: There are other characters, but none of them have really done anything they kind of just exist

809
00:56:02.079 --> 00:56:06.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The farming is you have like plant pots in your house

810
00:56:07.679 --> 00:56:12.480
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I haven't figured out if you can add more plant bots, but I'm started off with three plant pots and

811
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:18.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So you're not farming outside you're farming in these plant pots. So it's like you start off and you're like okay

812
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:47.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: great I can put carrot seeds in these three plant pots and then water them and then I can go and say hello to all the animals and then there's nothing really left to do today. It's it's such a weird a weird thing. I also one of the things I always gets me over the game is like how the controls feel right and sometimes it's hard to explain how how controls feel right there. But sometimes controls never don't feel great. And this is a game where the controls didn't feel great.

813
00:56:48.000 --> 00:57:08.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So in lots of games lots of farming games you have like your toolbar right and you're like switching between items in the toolbar and in some in some farming games your tool will change automatically based on what you're doing right where you go up to a tree and you use the action item and it will use the axe right and it knows what you want to do because you're at a specific point.

814
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:38.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: This game does neither of those. You have your D pad which by the way menus don't work with the D pad the only work in the analog stick and I hate it when games do that. Let me use the D

815
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:24.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, oh, that's the worst. I'm not a fan, not a fan.

816
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:48.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: pad in menus please and thank you. I hate it so much because an analog stick is for analog movement menus are not analog movement. Now obviously let me use the analog stick as well if I want to but let me use the D pad. Let me use the D pad for what it's for moving directions. So the way that the way the tools work is you have your D pad and

817
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:57.820
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : ha ha ha ha. No, you eat, yeah, you just sign it to them, double. Yeah, I'm watching

818
00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:18.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: like your left is I can't remember which one it is but left is one of the tools down is one of the tools and right is one of the tools and you. Yeah yeah there you go it's the shovel. Yeah yeah yeah I could remember the watching can was right I can remember the other two where and. So say I am I'm going to.

819
00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:04.260
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : licking images, left is like a shovel or a spade. Down is the, down is the sickle looks

820
00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:09.219
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : like ferracim, ferracim, ferracim, ferracim, ferracim, and right is the watering can. Don't you

821
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Don't you know, Z stands for the tools?

822
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:48.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I've got a plant pot and I want to put a seed in it right you have to go left to select the shovel you press a to action the shovel you then have to press up. Select the carrot seed press a to. Put the carrot seed down and then press right to select the watering can and press a. To use the watering can and the thing is that like that wouldn't feel like a lot of.

823
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, no, no, no, wait.

824
00:58:48.000 --> 00:59:18.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: stuff if you had like you know ten things to water you'd like select right and then you'd go and water them all but you have three things to water so you're doing like. Left a. Right a move to the next one left a up a right a move to the next one left a up a right a. You have successfully put three seeds in the ground and watered them.

825
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : You

826
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:20.300
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : What do you mean you don't just push right on the deep and it does the action. What do you mean at the?

827
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's just equipping and then pushing the button. Why?

828
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:32.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It is so many button presses to do such simple actions which are fundamental to the game it's a farming game

829
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:38.219
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : That's that's why they decided to end it in three one season. You're free

830
00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh

831
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:48.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So, that is not fun and the problem is that if the farming isn't fun in your game, I'm

832
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:56.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: going to struggle to enjoy your farming game, right?

833
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

834
00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:00.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And on top of that, on top of that, the entire point of the game is to turn your sibling

835
01:00:00.699 --> 01:00:07.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: back into not a cat and you do that incredibly quickly without barely doing anything and

836
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And then you have no long term goal after.

837
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's a fun.

838
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : The worst part is it looks amazing. I like visually. I love the art style. It's, you know,

839
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.079
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : top-down, Stardew pixel art, but it's really well done and charming. But, well, it's a game

840
01:00:30.079 --> 01:00:35.519
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : with not much to do and a lot of it sounds painful to do. Oh, big oof.

841
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, it's funny because like sometimes you

842
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Grab are really cheap game

843
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Because we bought this game and what was the other one called?

844
01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:51.219
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: What was the other one we bought the same time that we talked about a couple months ago?

845
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.780
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Is it Starbirds? Is it Starbirds?

846
01:00:52.059 --> 01:00:54.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: No, no, no, Sunsea Island

847
01:00:54.739 --> 01:01:02.579
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : That's, oh, yeah, that's the one, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

848
01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:01.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So we bought Sunsea Island and this at the same time for like the same price basically was like a dollar each and

849
01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And, since it Island, it wasn't the most amazing.

850
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:10.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But, like, I chucked in 10 hours into that game and I completed and I had fun.

851
01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:17.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: This game I barely put in an hour and was like, this is not fun and I don't even, I like,

852
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I know the story.

853
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: There's nothing, there's nothing there.

854
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:26.780
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like, it's, I, there was nothing to build towards with Sunsea Island.

855
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You knew exactly what you were building towards the whole time and the whole game was built

856
01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:31.780
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: towards this.

857
01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: one you're like, I know what I'm building towards and I know how quickly I can get it.

858
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And I'm not even having fun doing that in the first place.

859
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.719
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. That's wild.

860
01:01:39.539 --> 01:01:41.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I love the look of this game.

861
01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.860
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I think that the pixel art is really nice.

862
01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:47.139
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The colors are very vibrant.

863
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:51.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's it's a very interesting looking game.

864
01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The portraits are are fun.

865
01:01:54.699 --> 01:02:05.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's like, why I like about how it's done is so the character models are very, you know, low, low pixel numbers of pixels, right?

866
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:17.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And then the portrait is obviously more detailed, but still keeps the pixel art aesthetic, which I really like, a lot of games that for their portraits, they're like, here's ridiculously high quality.

867
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It it does

868
01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.460
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

869
01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:22.179
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And you're like, this just feels out of character for this game.

870
01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:26.019
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I really think they did really nice balance here of that.

871
01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:24.559
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It does I mean I

872
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.880
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Agree yeah, I mean even stardew feels like that right the the difference between the you know

873
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Overworld models and the the portrait art like night and day

874
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.019
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But I agree looking at it here

875
01:02:38.019 --> 01:02:41.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : If the aesthetic is kept the same like you see the characters like oh yeah

876
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.900
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : that's the same character in the same game yeah

877
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It looks like at some point you do, oh, I just realized you can farm outside.

878
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:52.840
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah.

879
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It just doesn't tell you you can.

880
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I just never tried because it because the tutorial, the tutorial gets you to do it and plant pots inside.

881
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:14.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Why does the tutorial tell you that? That's dreadful. The tutorial teaches you to farm inside and then it lets you farm outside and never tells you that.

882
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's dreadful. (laughs)

883
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:27.239
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : that's magical oh i'm so happy you discovered that on on here oh yeah no I didn't

884
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.039
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: were you waiting for that? Had you seen the picture and you were just waiting for me to see that?

885
01:03:27.239 --> 01:03:30.360
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : find that really really funny

886
01:03:29.719 --> 01:03:36.360
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So I think why I would say is if you like a farming game that is low stakes and you can just do the

887
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:42.360
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: same thing forever then feel free to try this game. The problem is that if you let if you want

888
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I was gonna say, buy a bit orchard.

889
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:49.559
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: it's well there are there are many other games like that yeah I like that I like the the look

890
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:52.920
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: of this game, which is why it's above Sugar G Island.

891
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:05.639
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I can't help but feel like this is just like, hey, we need a farming game game, and they've

892
01:04:05.639 --> 01:04:08.679
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: done it without too much thought about anything.

893
01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:16.519
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: The core gameplay is a lot of button presses, there's no real progression.

894
01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:19.880
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: A lot of it just kind of feels like it's there for the sake of it.

895
01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You're run down.

896
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.340
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: House that you're in that it talks about.

897
01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.659
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You fix that in the first 10 seconds.

898
01:04:28.659 --> 01:04:36.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You have a bunch of broken plots of bits around the house and there's cobwebs.

899
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, yeah!

900
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:44.460
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And literally the tutorial is fix the ground and clear up the cobwebs and you do that and that's your house fixed.

901
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like it's not even a progression thing.

902
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, that's, that's amazing. Just, just skip. Just jump right to the end result.

903
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: This is, that is the kind of epitome.

904
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.440
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: of this game is like, there's no, there's no thought about scaling, there's no thought

905
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.119
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: about like how you progress in this game, it's like progression, there you go, that's

906
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : For a question

907
01:05:04.119 --> 01:05:13.719
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the word I'm looking for, there's no progression really, it's, hey, do the things.

908
01:05:08.539 --> 01:05:13.139
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It's a waste of time now, let's just get to the end

909
01:05:13.719 --> 01:05:15.679
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I mean that feels a bit harsh, right?

910
01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:19.840
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Like some people have enjoyed this game, looking online, some people have enjoyed their

911
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.900
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : No

912
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.900
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah

913
01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.639
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: time in this game. I have no

914
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.099
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, yeah, yeah

915
01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:30.360
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: but that doesn't mean that other people won.

916
01:05:25.059 --> 01:05:31.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : No, okay, I'll like all joking aside like I think the fact that

917
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:42.059
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : We can clear this in one season before going a full year. That's indicative of a big like designed for right like you you did not calculate something right there

918
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah

919
01:05:42.059 --> 01:05:44.059
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : And that's probably

920
01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:49.420
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Spills over until the other stuff that you're talking about like things were misjudged

921
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:58.139
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, it also feels like they're setting it up to sell a bunch of DLC because in the menu

922
01:05:58.139 --> 01:06:02.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: There's like a bunch of menu items that say like go to eShop and you click on it and they don't go anywhere

923
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : the game

924
01:06:03.539 --> 01:06:08.440
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So it kind of feels like it's like get people liking this game and then

925
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.940
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Give them a bunch of DLC

926
01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.980
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But the DLC actually has to be there and there has to be a reason to buy it

927
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, yep, it's not a great feeling.

928
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.900
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Oh, man, that's wild.

929
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.440
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : What a shame, because it had like all the,

930
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.780
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : how a missrook thing, and nothing like the goal

931
01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:27.980
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : of changing your sibling back, that could be a good one,

932
01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.820
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : but if you just take a little to get there,

933
01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.780
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : let it, let it, let it right out,

934
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.059
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : be able to enjoy that.

935
01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:39.300
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : That would be nice, but alas,

936
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:44.900
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Yeah, it's, it's also, it's also just that like nothing really matters about it as well. Like you,

937
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.860
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : and the visuals are really great.

938
01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:51.059
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: okay, cool. You've changed your sibling into a human again. Their model has changed on the

939
01:06:51.059 --> 01:06:55.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: uh, overworld. That's the only thing that changes. It doesn't matter. It doesn't make any difference.

940
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.619
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: They don't start doing things for you. You don't start doing anything together. Nothing,

941
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.239
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : oh that's rough buddy. That's maybe the plot hidden in the game and it should

942
01:07:07.239 --> 01:07:11.639
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : tell you about it. Just like farming outside.

943
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:21.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Possibly because I will be honest, I haven't put a huge amount of time into the game, because it failed its first hurdle, you know, how the controls work and the core gameplay loop. They are not, I did not enjoy that.

944
01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:27.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's too many button presses to do simple things that just end up frustrating me constantly.

945
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.760
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, you got it. No, I don't blame you. Yeah, I don't blame you

946
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:38.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: And because when you search online, everyone is basically seeing the same thing about this, like, oh yeah, there's nothing past the main story and like, I just feel...

947
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:48.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: but aimless after the main stories finished, you're like, well, yeah, I'm not going to push through these issues that I'm having, because it doesn't sound like there's a great game past it, right?

948
01:07:48.500 --> 01:08:04.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But I've done that before when I'm like, oh, here's a game that I'm not a huge fan of, the start of it, let me push through the tutorial, and you get to a game that you really like, and that doesn't mean that it didn't have flaws, right?

949
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.420
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: of it was a flaw and that needed to be better, but you can push that.

950
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.099
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: through it because you know there's something better coming and that was not the case here.

951
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.119
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, no, I absolutely get you dang that's rough. Yeah, I don't know what else to say. Hey, good

952
01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:22.300
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Well, I don't, yeah, I don't know what else to say. I feel like that's, that's

953
01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:30.800
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: everything I have to say, you know, so there we go. Let's end on our positive.

954
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : All right dang yeah

<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I'm recording the game of the year episode very soon.

956
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:46.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: If you are interested in inputting into that, you can join the Patreon and there is

957
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : inputting, giving thought.

958
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:52.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: a currently a form up on the Patreon to get people's input. Multiple patrons have already

959
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: input into that and that will be, I'm not saying that we will definitely choose the majority

960
01:08:57.699 --> 01:09:01.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: winner from that, although I don't think there is a majority winner from that just now,

961
01:09:01.699 --> 01:09:07.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I think it is exactly evenly, it's evenly split between five games from the five people that

962
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:22.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I know, at least one person in my corner. I submitted my entry and I know somebody is going to be back in me up.

963
01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.539
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: the oven piece so far.

964
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: But one of them is what I do want to be there.

965
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:36.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I know exactly what you've done Kevin, it will not, I will not be arguing for what you have argued for, but if the other people argue for it and it seems like it's going to be a majority opinion, I will not fight against it, let's put it that way.

966
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:28.500
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Most people who've listened this year could guess what I've been doing.

967
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.899
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Well, people who don't vote for Kirby AirRiders are wrong, just objectively.

968
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:50.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So if you want to input into that, you have to be on the slack, you have to be a patron, so you can do that at patreon.com/thsbot.

969
01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:00.000
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: You'll also get access to just chat to us in the slack and access to bonus episodes of the podcast. Kevin, is there anything you want to tell the list?

970
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.359
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. So I need me to press wherever, because if I'm on Twitter, I'm just retweeting primarily

971
01:10:07.359 --> 01:10:12.960
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : curvy or writer stuff because it's a bigger, bigger content out of that game. Go check

972
01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.239
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : out all the memes, the clips, the art. Oh, that's all I've been doing really. Yes.

973
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.500
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: I have a question... the... the... the carts that I've been seeing.

974
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: Are those custom-built carts, or they just like stand there?

975
01:10:23.039 --> 01:10:30.159
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah. I had to, I'm going to, if you're seeing them on the

976
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.560
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : line, they are very likely the custom made ones, because that's one of the big like the pills. Yep. Yeah. That's why we get a

977
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.699
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: So you can, you can custom make cards.

978
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:47.439
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : coyote or look in part. And it's like, I jokingly said art medium last week or with Nami, but it's kind of true because you can do so

979
01:10:47.439 --> 01:10:59.920
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : much and custom make so much and decorate them. It's really good. Yeah, it is insane. Like I see

980
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.840
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: That's crazy that it's detailed enough that you can make some of these cards custom. That's

981
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.359
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : like genuine scenes being painted on this vehicle.

982
01:11:01.479 --> 01:11:06.199
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: that's what that's what they've that's what they've been doing the last 20 years since the last game

983
01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: It's just making the custom card system

984
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.039
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, it sounds like it's with soccer. I would do. I believe it

985
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.800
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, it's great. It's fantastic

986
01:11:20.479 --> 01:11:26.300
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : It really is mind-boggling how much people can do like I didn't I haven't made one myself

987
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:31.600
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : But it really feels like you can just paint on the things and I think that's the case

988
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.439
<v 9F98BBE1-F5C7-4952-9412-3F6D8C03CFBC>Kevin : I think that people are you know maneuvering decals and positioning them like oh my it's wild. It's great

989
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.939
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: All right, have I missed anything

990
01:11:41.939 --> 01:11:43.380
<v 94262779-F4D1-461C-9F0D-7F7F4BDE1C38>Al: because I did things in a weird order.

991
01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.140
