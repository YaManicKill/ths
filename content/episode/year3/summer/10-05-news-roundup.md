## Transcript

(0:00:30) Kev: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Kevin. I'm not alone today. I
(0:00:38) Codey: Oooooh though people be clamorin' for solo Kev time.
(0:00:47) Kev: Like how I push the envelope every time I'm you know, I total line but oh
(0:00:53) Codey: I'm gonna be real with you.
(0:00:55) Codey: I have not listened to the most recent episode.
(0:00:58) Codey: I think I'm still finishing up the Tiny Garden episode.
(0:01:01) Kev: That's okay, that's fine. That's fine. I
(0:01:04) Codey: So I still have a couple episodes to go,
(0:01:06) Codey: but I just know that you rock it every time.
(0:01:13) Kev: Am
(0:01:14) Kev: Getting an hour plus solo recording. I do that's mmm. I don't know if that's good or bad
(0:01:17) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:01:20) Kev: That just so that just shows I'm very well versed in talking to myself
(0:01:25) Kev: possibly too much
(0:01:27) Codey: - Nah, you got, you're good at it.
(0:01:30) Codey: It's all good.
(0:01:31) Kev: Ah, yeah, okay. Well, hi everyone again. I'm Kevin
(0:01:36) Codey: - Yeah, you are and I'm not Kevin, I'm Cody.
(0:01:37) Kev: Yeah
(0:01:39) Kev: And there you go. There we go
(0:01:41) Kev: certifiably not Kevin
(0:01:43) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:01:43) Kev: And we are here to talk today to talk about cottagecore games. Whoo
(0:01:48) Codey: - Oh woo, ow, ow, ow.
(0:01:50) Kev: Now you dear listener may be wondering why cottagecore and not more deep diving into the Lord of
(0:01:56) Codey: Yeah, we really set we set y'all up for, uh, for some, some shire stuff. But alas, we
(0:02:00) Kev: And well
(0:02:04) Kev: The month of the Shire
(0:02:08) Codey: are here, not for the shire.
(0:02:10) Kev: The fake out oh, but you know, you know what I'm gonna add something to the what I've been up to
(0:02:18) Codey: Oh, okay, cool.
(0:02:22) Kev: Okay
(0:02:24) Kev: But yeah, we're all over and we're here to talk about news because news is built up
(0:02:28) Kev: We are spoiler alert
(0:02:32) Kev: We're working on the Shire episode, whatever the tale of the Shire episode, but we needed a weak buffer
(0:02:36) Kev: And so Cody and I said alright, we'll just do some news because there's plenty of news to talk about with the build-up. So
(0:02:40) Codey: Yeah. It sure has been a hot minute.
(0:02:45) Kev: Yep
(0:02:47) Kev: Okay, so yeah news catch up and we'll get to that as we do
(0:02:50) Kev: But before that Cody tell me what has been going on over over there in Cody World
(0:02:56) Codey: to think of it. So I think, uh, during those episodes recording with Johnny, I had not yet
(0:03:03) Codey: gone to beetle school. So since that time I went to beetle school, you guys, and I had some,
(0:03:11) Codey: it was really fun. Uh, I was up in the Chiricahua's in Arizona, which is not like my first thought.
(0:03:16) Codey: I was like, Oh God, Arizona, not looking forward to this super hot. I don't do hot. Uh, the Chiricahua's
(0:03:21) Codey: were. Lovely. Um, I want to say it never got above like 70
(0:03:26) Codey: degrees. It was like around 70 degrees, but we could go down
(0:03:26) Kev: Ooh, that's lovely!
(0:03:31) Codey: into the desert. And so we went into the desert like at night a
(0:03:34) Codey: couple times and we got to see some, some tarantulas and some
(0:03:38) Codey: rattlesnakes. And so like we got to, to adventure. We also went
(0:03:43) Codey: up higher where it was almost like 11,000 feet elevation, um,
(0:03:48) Codey: in the Chiricahuas. And it was, it was actually very cold up
(0:03:50) Codey: there. I was like, I should have brought a jacket. Yeah.
(0:03:52) Kev: Yeah, yeah, it's the elevation right cuz Atlanta's similar where we're you know down South deep, Georgia
(0:03:57) Kev: But what's its mountain eats high evolution into elevation so it can still get chilly
(0:04:01) Codey: Yeah. So that was really fun. I learned a lot about Beatles and I feel a lot more confident now.
(0:04:06) Kev: So and and you did you graduate are you certified are you do you have a license to be a beetle now?
(0:04:13) Codey: You know, it's funny because when I went to fly school last summer, they gave me a little certificate.
(0:04:18) Kev: Yeah
(0:04:21) Codey: We did not get a certificate for Beatles. So I, all I have, all I have is the memories.
(0:04:23) Kev: Oh, oh no the Beatles got a step up their game
(0:04:31) Codey: Uh, the one thing that is beneficial about this is so fly school was more of an international thing.
(0:04:36) Codey: There were like maybe six or seven of us that were from the US, but most of the students were from, um, all over the world.
(0:04:43) Codey: But so it is unlikely for me to run into the people that I met from fly school at the conferences that I go to because I mostly just go to United States conferences.
(0:04:52) Codey: But all, almost all the beetle people, except for like two people, uh, there was a Canadian and a New Zealander. Um, they were all.
(0:05:01) Codey: Uh, citizens of America. And so I will be seeing most of them at the conference that I'm going to in November. Very stoked about that.
(0:05:09) Codey: Um, cause you make these connections and then, you know, I, it's like, Oh man, when am I ever going to see that?
(0:05:15) Codey: That really cool Italian from, from fly school or whatever. Um, but yeah, I will see most of these people again.
(0:05:16) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:05:18) Kev: Yeah. (laughs)
(0:05:22) Codey: And it's just great to start building those connections. Um, so I did that.
(0:05:27) Codey: that.
(0:05:31) Codey: I have also been playing, I'm still playing honey Grove.
(0:05:35) Codey: Um, I have unlocked a new explorer B so I'm now at five, but I think there's six.
(0:05:44) Codey: And I'm just like playing it a little bit at a time.
(0:05:47) Codey: I'm working on my specimens as per usual so I will graduate or I will defend in the in December now I have had to.
(0:05:54) Kev: Okay, these are real specimens. We switched to not the honeygrove specimens
(0:05:56) Codey: Correct. We've switched to real life.
(0:06:01) Codey: Yeah, into the real world.
(0:06:04) Codey: So yeah, working on that, I had almost the entire time we were
(0:06:08) Codey: kind of on our little break and we were doing the Lord of the
(0:06:11) Kev: Yeah.
(0:06:12) Codey: Rings stuff. I actually had people that helped me. So I
(0:06:13) Kev: Yeah.
(0:06:15) Kev: No.
(0:06:16) Codey: wasn't doing everything by myself, which was amazing. Yeah,
(0:06:18) Kev: You had cronies.
(0:06:20) Codey: we called him my henchmen. And so I had henchmen and they did
(0:06:21) Kev: Yeah, there you go, that's correct.
(0:06:25) Codey: an amazing job and they learned so much and I'm so proud of
(0:06:28) Codey: them. But I am like almost back to being solo now and I
(0:06:31) Codey: am stressing but I got it. I've got this but I had to push back
(0:06:36) Codey: my defense just because of how much work so I will be defending
(0:06:40) Codey: in December now fingers crossed and then actually like graduating
(0:06:45) Codey: and like walking for my doctorate in the spring, which
(0:06:46) Kev: Oh, snap.
(0:06:48) Codey: I don't super care about it being like so far out.
(0:06:52) Kev: Yeah.
(0:06:52) Codey: It's actually better for a lot of my family members that want
(0:06:55) Codey: to come and watch me walk because yeah, so they don't have
(0:06:57) Kev: To plan, yeah.
(0:06:58) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:06:59) Codey: to come when it's like.
(0:07:01) Codey: Possibly snowy.
(0:07:03) Codey: There've been times when my mom wanted to come visit or I wanted to go visit
(0:07:06) Codey: home and it like during the June, um, sorry, December, um, January timeframe.
(0:07:12) Kev: Yeah.
(0:07:13) Codey: Then it just doesn't work.
(0:07:14) Kev: Yeah.
(0:07:15) Codey: So it's better for it to be.
(0:07:16) Kev: Yeah.
(0:07:16) Kev: I mean, yeah, it's wild how people who don't live in snowy areas just absolutely get bodied
(0:07:26) Codey: Well, but even even that that I mean even just irrespective of that there is the fact that like
(0:07:26) Kev: by snow.
(0:07:32) Codey: We will have entire like planes shut down like people will try and travel like the last time I tried to go there
(0:07:36) Kev: Oh, that... mmm... that is true.
(0:07:41) Codey: I
(0:07:42) Codey: Well, what's the last time?
(0:07:43) Codey: I don't know
(0:07:44) Codey: I tried to go home and I was gonna be home for like two and a half weeks and then I ended up having to cut
(0:07:48) Codey: It short because my flight got delayed and then I finally got on the plane
(0:07:52) Codey: Like it got delayed by like two days and then I finally got
(0:07:54) Kev: No, my god, oh my goodness, oh
(0:07:56) Codey: Yeah, and then I finally got on the plane. I was on the plane and then there were they had mechanical issues
(0:08:00) Codey: And then finally when they can't mechanical issues
(0:08:01) Kev: No
(0:08:03) Codey: Cleared up there was that flight was supposed to go to Chicago O'Hare and then O'Hare was getting like three feet of snow
(0:08:10) Codey: So they were like, you know, you guys can sit tight
(0:08:13) Codey: But we are basically being told to wait and I was just like nope screw it. I just left
(0:08:16) Kev: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah
(0:08:20) Codey: like
(0:08:22) Codey: No
(0:08:23) Codey: But yeah, so that kind of stuff happens
(0:08:24) Kev: Apologies to Aislinn for triggering her
(0:08:26) Codey: especially
(0:08:30) Codey: Yeah, it's I mean, yeah, she knows all about it and
(0:08:34) Codey: Yeah going even just like going to Arizona and my stuff got canceled a million times. So
(0:08:40) Codey: It's just a hard time out there right now for sure
(0:08:44) Codey: But then my last update is I'm playing Tales of the Shire
(0:08:50) Kev: Did you- did you- did you- did- how far are you?
(0:08:53) Codey: Um, I don't...
(0:08:56) Codey: Are you playing it too?
(0:08:57) Kev: No, I'm not. I'm just curious.
(0:08:58) Codey: Oh, okay.
(0:08:59) Kev: I- did you have, you know, ballpark estimate? 50%?
(0:09:02) Codey: No, no, no, not anywhere near that.
(0:09:03) Kev: Okay.
(0:09:04) Codey: I'm still in the same...
(0:09:05) Kev: There you go.
(0:09:06) Codey: I'm still in the first, like...
(0:09:08) Codey: I think you start in summer.
(0:09:10) Kev: Okay.
(0:09:10) Codey: And I'm still in summer.
(0:09:11) Kev: Mmm, ahh.
(0:09:12) Codey: Um, but I feel like I'm getting...
(0:09:18) Codey: I'm, like, going at a good clip.
(0:09:19) Codey: I just was gone for a long time.
(0:09:22) Codey: And then now that I'm back,
(0:09:23) Codey: I've been so busy with, like, getting caught up with work.
(0:09:24) Kev: Yeah.
(0:09:26) Codey: Visiting and stuff, and so, yeah.
(0:09:27) Kev: Ahh, alright, alright.
(0:09:29) Codey: Uh, well, so that's what I've been up to.
(0:09:30) Kev: Well, uh...
(0:09:31) Codey: What have you been up to, Kev?
(0:09:32) Kev: Well, I was just gonna say, I'm waiting to hear when you finally defeat Sauron, um, Tails of the Shire, but, uh...
(0:09:38) Kev: But, hahaha, but, uh...
(0:09:40) Codey: That is, that is interesting.
(0:09:42) Codey: I'm at the point, um, I don't know if...
(0:09:44) Codey: So this is not a spoiler.
(0:09:45) Codey: I don't know if "Tales of the Shire" is before or after.
(0:09:49) Codey: So, um, yeah, I'm not entirely sure.
(0:09:53) Codey: It is unclear to me at this, at this stage.
(0:09:56) Kev: What if you invite Sauron to tea and you don't even know it?
(0:09:56) Codey: I...
(0:09:59) Kev: It could happen.
(0:10:00) Codey: You know what?
(0:10:01) Codey: It could happen.
(0:10:07) Kev: That's good stuff.
(0:10:09) Kev: Okay, well, this past week I've been slammed by work.
(0:10:13) Kev: I did the coming of the office on,
(0:10:15) Kev: I have to come into the office on Saturday yesterday
(0:10:18) Kev: 'cause it's that bad.
(0:10:20) Kev: But other than that, the week before wasn't as bad.
(0:10:26) Kev: There was actually an office party dinner thing
(0:10:30) Kev: where I tried to karaoke for the first time.
(0:10:32) Codey: Ooh, did you like, did you enjoy it?
(0:10:34) Kev: Oh yeah, so, okay.
(0:10:36) Kev: I mean, first of all, I am into music, period.
(0:10:39) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:10:41) Kev: I am the one, first one on and last one off,
(0:10:44) Kev: generally the dance floor.
(0:10:46) Kev: Now, this wasn't a dance floor,
(0:10:48) Kev: even though I was moving a bit.
(0:10:50) Kev: But, I mean, as evidenced by here, this endeavor,
(0:10:54) Kev: I have no problem scre-
(0:10:56) Kev: screaming things into a microphone so karaoke was to fit like a glove
(0:11:01) Kev: um I I did many songs I don't remember all of it I know I did um at first they
(0:11:09) Kev: did like a curated list cuz they want to stay professionally yada yada but by the

(0:11:43) Kev: cannot be stopped you do will I have a new theme song written for the heart
(0:11:48) Kev: season maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(0:11:50) Codey: I might, you know what, if ever we're going to record again, I might have to, you know, I'm sick.
(0:11:56) Kev: I mean will yeah oh my gosh I'll should do one of those patreon goals you know
(0:11:58) Codey: I want to hear the karaoke.
(0:12:04) Codey: That would, you know what, that would be fun, having a greenhouse of karaoke.
(0:12:08) Codey: I'm going to put that on there. I have green, oh my gosh, yeah, I have three greenhouses with
(0:12:16) Kev: yeah we need to get that we got it we got
(0:12:19) Codey: Kev on a sticky note on my laptop and it's the Sonic 3 movie, Bluey and now karaoke.

(0:12:36) Kev: yes karaoke so I carry okie on unabashedly and and yeah um okay game
(0:12:44) Kev: stuff though um okay oh okay DK bonanza came out I do not have a switch to my
(0:12:50) Kev: brother does I do not so I've not played it but
(0:12:56) Kev: I do play Tetris 99 and they do events every now and then they're the kind of
(0:12:58) Codey: - Okay, yep.
(0:13:03) Kev: always under the radar but I pick up on them because I'm a fiend for Tetris
(0:13:07) Kev: DK Bonanza had an event where they put you know a special skin on the Tetris
(0:13:12) Kev: screen the blocks and and they play music from the game and so on and so
(0:13:17) Kev: forth it was great it's fantastic music was stellar absolutely stellar so much
(0:13:24) Kev: So that like a day or two after.
(0:13:26) Kev: I was like, man, I want more of that DK Bonanza music in my veins.
(0:13:30) Kev: So I loaded up on the done, you know, YouTube or whatever.
(0:13:34) Kev: And then I saw spoilers.
(0:13:35) Kev: I didn't think I could ever see spoilers for a Donkey Kong game, but musical spoilers.
(0:13:42) Kev: Which is wild that one, there were spoilers in the Donkey Kong game, but there are.
(0:13:47) Kev: And two, that I was spoiled by the soundtrack.
(0:13:49) Codey: by this soundtrack done dirty
(0:13:53) Kev: so I uh you know
(0:13:56) Kev: I haven't played it but I will say that's one of the greatest games ever
(0:14:00) Kev: from what I've seen that will happen
(0:14:03) Kev: oh goodness but um so yeah the DK bonanza it's already good thumbs up from
(0:14:10) Kev: you without playing it oh okay oh you know here's another getting on game
(0:14:16) Kev: thing and hey hey here we go people I'm still keeping it in theme I have been
(0:14:21) Kev: watching Rings of Power on the Prime Video.
(0:14:23) Codey: Ooooh.
(0:14:26) Kev: Umm, that's the Lord of the Rings the prequel series question mark?
(0:14:29) Codey: Yeah, it's it's a prequel series.
(0:14:30) Kev: I g-
(0:14:32) Kev: Yeah, it is. I mean like, you know, it's big open world of Tolkien lore, whatever, but-
(0:14:38) Kev: But yes, it happens before the Lord of the Rings.
(0:14:40) Kev: Umm...
(0:14:41) Kev: I- I- Are you familiar with this at all, Cody?
(0:14:44) Codey: unfortunately. Unfortunately, I wish I could get those hours back. No, so it is beautiful.
(0:14:47) Kev: Oh, you are.
(0:14:48) Kev: Th- That's unfortunately you are.
(0:14:56) Kev: That is all right. Oh no, uh-huh
(0:15:00) Codey: It's beautiful, but they only got rights to like some of the content. And so they just had to like,
(0:15:08) Codey: make stuff up, and I hate it. Um.
(0:15:09) Kev: Yeah, that's what I've heard I
(0:15:15) Codey: So without getting too, like, too nerdy, but this is still going to be fairly nerdy. And I could be
(0:15:23) Codey: wrong, but this is kind of how I remember it. So Galadriel's brothers were like fighting. They were
(0:15:32) Codey: trying to get revenge on, I think Sauron, because he killed someone who was related to them in the
(0:15:38) Codey: war of the, like, when they were trying to fight over the Silmarils. And so they basically like, killed.
(0:15:44) Codey: They ended up, like, almost killing each other because they were just so, like, embroiled in this
(0:15:47) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:15:49) Codey: drama. And Galadriel, like, is known in the Silmarillion to have been like, I don't want to
(0:15:56) Codey: take part of my brother's war, or my brother's wars, or whatever. And then the Rings of Power
(0:15:58) Kev: Okay, yeah
(0:16:02) Codey: is all her taking part in her brother's wars. And I'm like, no! So that was right away. I was like,
(0:16:04) Kev: It is
(0:16:08) Kev: Oh
(0:16:12) Codey: Oh, I'm grumpy because she was.
(0:16:13) Kev: That's incredible
(0:16:14) Codey: She was supposed to be like, not caring.
(0:16:18) Codey: And she was just like, well, screw you guys.
(0:16:20) Codey: I'm going to go live in the woods and.
(0:16:21) Kev: I'm going to go in sight more war. Oh
(0:16:24) Codey: Yeah, exactly.
(0:16:25) Codey: And so, but I get they had to do things differently and like.
(0:16:28) Kev: That's that's amazing
(0:16:30) Kev: So I guess I have the privilege of being a normie like I have watched Florida the Rings in the Hobbit
(0:16:34) Codey: Yeah.
(0:16:35) Kev: But I'm I'm not deep in there. It's it's it's I've struggled for it just to stick with me
(0:16:40) Codey: Well, and there's just like so much like, who is so wrong?
(0:16:43) Kev: Yeah
(0:16:45) Kev: Yes
(0:16:45) Codey: Are we all Sauron?
(0:16:48) Codey: Like, there's a Sauron in all of us.
(0:16:48) Kev: Maybe that maybe if we believe it
(0:16:50) Codey: And I like the whole time and I'm just like, okay, I'm, I'm done with this.
(0:16:54) Codey: Like, I, uh,
(0:16:58) Kev: He does
(0:17:00) Kev: That is probably
(0:17:02) Kev: like one of the most
(0:17:04) Kev: entertaining but in a bad kind of way like he's very
(0:17:08) Kev: Over the top almost like I mean not not ridiculously so but compared to the the movies, right?
(0:17:13) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:17:14) Kev: Sauron is a you know more of a force. He's not a guy right?
(0:17:17) Kev: He's he is the giant eyeball in the sky and this overwhelming presence and here he's he compared to that
(0:17:23) Kev: He feels like a mustache twirling, you know, ooh spooky bit
(0:17:26) Codey: Yeah, yeah.
(0:17:29) Kev: But that's it. I mean I've been enjoying it. I don't know all the lore
(0:17:32) Kev: I point to the screen when I know a thing but then that's it
(0:17:36) Kev: It's the productions. Well done. It's good production better production than the Hobbit
(0:17:40) Codey: Yeah, it's gorgeous.
(0:17:41) Codey: It is beautiful and like, but I,
(0:17:44) Codey: so I don't think I've watched past the first season.
(0:17:46) Codey: I don't know how much there is.
(0:17:48) Kev: There's three two and they're working on
(0:17:51) Codey: Okay, I didn't watch past the first one
(0:17:53) Codey: because I just, I need to like take off my snooty hat,
(0:17:58) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:17:59) Codey: you know, and just let things be different and stuff.
(0:18:02) Codey: and I just have yet to...
(0:18:05) Codey: get the balls to do that, I guess, I don't know.
(0:18:08) Kev: Yeah, it's hmm. I will I will say again. I say this as a very
(0:18:14) Kev: novice casual Lord of the Rings enjoyer
(0:18:16) Kev: I feel like they're really trying hard to tie it to the Lord of the Rings. Yeah, you know the movies right because like
(0:18:20) Codey: Yeah, but they're like literally not supposed to.
(0:18:24) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I know because there's the the hobbits. They're not even called hobbits
(0:18:28) Kev: I forget anyways there are two hobbits and it's very clearly trying to evoke Sam and Frodo even though they're not and but no
(0:18:37) Kev: Whatever
(0:18:38) Kev: It's fine. I'm enjoying it. Whatever. There you go
(0:18:38) Codey: Yep, wasn't my favorite. It's I it is enjoyable, especially I think if you have not seen. Yeah,
(0:18:45) Kev: The less you know the less, you know with the little tuning star
(0:18:47) Codey: the last you know. But like what before it was coming up, I was like, so because I knew it was
(0:18:52) Codey: coming. So I read that I was like, I'm gonna read the Silmarillion and then I can have like a little
(0:18:53) Kev: Yeah
(0:18:56) Codey: bit of idea and I really just shouldn't have because it ruined it for me. Yep.
(0:18:59) Kev: You know too much
(0:19:01) Kev: You're you're into deep
(0:19:03) Kev: Yeah, but I mean it's it's fine like it it's it's there are worse things to watch
(0:19:08) Codey: Yeah, and I know, no, no, dude, that third one, this is me trying not to yell right now.
(0:19:09) Kev: Arguably some of the Hobbit movies. Mm-hmm. That third one's rough. I'm just sorry
(0:19:20) Codey: That third one is rough for people because they don't watch the extended edition.
(0:19:25) Kev: Yeah
(0:19:27) Codey: You got to watch all of it.
(0:19:28) Kev: Okay, you know what that's probably fair just that's oh
(0:19:31) Codey: There's so much that's like cut out that makes it seem like not then you're like,
(0:19:34) Kev: I believe it
(0:19:37) Codey: why is he why is this
(0:19:38) Codey: so
(0:19:39) Kev: You
(0:19:40) Kev: That is correct. That is my reaction to many things in that movie is someone who's not seen the extended cut
(0:19:46) Codey: You gotta see the extended come if you if you believe if you think the Hobbit movies are bad come come
(0:19:47) Kev: Okay
(0:19:51) Codey: We'll go watch if you and you haven't seen the extended and you haven't seen the extended editions
(0:19:52) Kev: Go listen to the episode
(0:19:56) Codey: Go watch them and then come back to me
(0:19:59) Kev: Okay, we have a greenhouse episode on the hobbit I have not listened to it to be fair
(0:20:02) Codey: We do
(0:20:06) Codey: We do we had fun with those for sure
(0:20:07) Kev: But I will
(0:20:08) Kev: Yeah, I bet
(0:20:10) Codey: When we were recording them, we were like, I don't know if I was gonna cut half of this or not
(0:20:14) Kev: As Al pointed out those greenhouse discussions sparked more discussion in the slack than any other episode of anything
(0:20:16) Codey: You
(0:20:19) Codey: Yeah, maybe we just need to be let loose
(0:20:29) Kev: Okay, um, but yeah, okay now they all right one more thing um for me um the big one
(0:20:36) Kev: Uh, Drumroll, please unicorn overla-
(0:20:38) Kev: Oh Lord, credits hit today baby!
(0:20:41) Codey: Ooh!
(0:20:43) Kev: Ooh, um, so I did, like, everything, to be fair, right?
(0:20:43) Codey: How many hours is that?
(0:20:48) Kev: 'Cause they're- they're very clear, like, here's the main missions, here's a bunch of side missions, and you don't- they're optional.
(0:20:54) Kev: Uh, I did it all, I clocked in at about 110 hours, I think it was.
(0:21:00) Kev: Um, and yeah-
(0:21:04) Kev: So, I mean, overall thumbs up, my comments are still-
(0:21:07) Kev: It's a--
(0:21:08) Kev: Consistent game, I'll say that.
(0:21:10) Kev: Like it's--
(0:21:12) Kev: It's the strategy gameplay. The story is nothing to write home about. It's straightforward fantasy
(0:21:21) Kev: armies and whatnot.
(0:21:23) Kev: Political royalty, yada, yada.
(0:21:26) Kev: So it's enjoyable. It's comfort food for me. So I enjoy it. Like it's quality. Don't get me wrong.
(0:21:29) Codey: Yeah.
(0:21:32) Kev: It's not bad, but it just hits the spot for me.
(0:21:36) Kev: My biggest complaint and this is gonna sound weird cuz I
(0:21:39) Kev: Just said I clocked in 110 hours
(0:21:41) Kev: it's it's not enough they're missing and and
(0:21:48) Kev: Specifically the end I think I mentioned this on a previous episode, but
(0:21:52) Kev: As it came out the developers ran out of money towards the end and you can feel it you can feel it
(0:22:00) Kev: So the like I said, there's main missions, right? And as you beat them, you know
(0:22:04) Kev: You'll not you progress towards the final mission in the
(0:22:09) Kev: ultimate main mission you unlock you get one new character a new class that you've never had before
(0:22:16) Codey: Okay.
(0:22:17) Kev: Which in you know these kind of strategy games, that's a big deal like you don't get any time to use your new toy basically
(0:22:23) Codey: Mm hmm.
(0:22:24) Codey: Yeah.
(0:22:24) Kev: Congrats, you finally got the last character go beat the game
(0:22:29) Kev: Now that's it there is a little post game epilogue that I can do and whatnot
(0:22:35) Kev: And it is still overall very big. It has a lot of
(0:22:39) Kev: Variations and and just little things. There's a couple of different endings you can do
(0:22:45) Kev: There's relationships and and and support conversations that are fun
(0:22:52) Kev: But but yeah overall it's great
(0:22:56) Kev: one of the
(0:22:58) Kev: Interesting things to get the true the best ending you have to get hitched you have to find a partner
(0:23:02) Codey: Mmm. Boo.
(0:23:04) Kev: Which is yeah
(0:23:07) Kev: Yeah, they try to play it up in the
(0:23:08) Kev: it's it's a little it's a little forced a little you know shoehorned in but but
(0:23:15) Kev: whatever I still I still have a lot of fun I'm very happy I want more I want
(0:23:21) Kev: unicorn overlord 2 now please but yeah just thumbs up overall and that game
(0:23:28) Kev: frequently goes on sale so if you have any interest in strategy you know fantasy
(0:23:33) Kev: stuff go for it it's good but okay and hey I hit credits on the game that
(0:23:38) Kev: been often for me and at least not lately so yeah all right okay so that's
(0:23:43) Kev: uh that's that's stuff we've been up to whoo all right let's get into news
(0:23:50) Kev: there's a lot of it all right we're gonna start off with the game about Cody
(0:23:56) Kev: research story in honor of her almost getting done so they came out with 1.0
(0:24:02) Kev: that is out now I don't know when it would July it's been
(0:24:09) Kev: for a while more than now yep exactly
(0:24:10) Codey: Well, yeah news catch-up episode everybody
(0:24:15) Codey: Yeah, so this uh, this adds the epilogue the conclusion some end credits, you know proposals and marriage
(0:24:22) Codey: One thing that I super enjoy about this is they have 10 marriage candidates and the proposals can either be player
(0:24:29) Codey: initiated or NPC initiated
(0:24:32) Kev: Oh, that's... Oh my gosh! Has that been done before?
(0:24:34) Codey: So I
(0:24:37) Kev: Oh...
(0:24:37) Codey: I don't know, but I kind of like that where you're.
(0:24:40) Codey: Spend in time with an NPC and then suddenly you just hit a cut scene and they're proposing to you like I think that's awesome.
(0:24:49) Kev: pretty good that's pretty like you know obviously well documented lamenting of
(0:24:54) Kev: the relationship mechanic or whatever but if you're gonna do it put in some
(0:24:57) Codey: Right.
(0:24:59) Kev: effort do something new that's good I like that that's good
(0:25:01) Codey: Yeah.
(0:25:03) Codey: Definitely like that.
(0:25:05) Codey: Give more to say about that.
(0:25:07) Kev: no just with two things one that makes you think of unicorn oh Lord at one one
(0:25:12) Kev: quick shout out just I remembered to get the true ending you have to have your
(0:25:16) Kev: Which I think this is actually kind of a thumbs
(0:25:19) Kev: up for me. You have to have whoever your selected partner is in your party for the final fight to get the true ending, which I think is kind of nice.
(0:25:28) Kev: But yeah, no, just overall, I think that's great. Having the other person initiate it, that's great.
(0:25:34) Kev: Yeah, no, I'm still kind of on the fence of it being included in the game at all, but here we are, and they did work, so I'll give them props for that.
(0:25:45) Codey: Um, yeah, so that was cool.
(0:25:47) Codey: They also had some quality of life adjustments.
(0:25:50) Codey: Um, so that brings the game to its 1.0, which is great.
(0:25:53) Codey: And the current price is 1399.
(0:25:55) Codey: They had it on sale for 60% off, I believe, um, for a hot minute.
(0:26:00) Codey: But I think by the time this comes out, it's already gone.
(0:26:03) Codey: So, um, yeah, so, but that's fine.
(0:26:04) Kev: store. Yeah, it's really not. And that's, that's fine. Yeah, the kind I almost feel bad that
(0:26:07) Codey: 1399 is nothing.
(0:26:08) Codey: Um, on August 28th, they're going to increase it to 1499.
(0:26:15) Codey: Just still feel nothing.
(0:26:17) Codey: So you guys.
(0:26:21) Kev: they said we, we are not charging, we're not making money, they, they do deserve that money.
(0:26:26) Codey: Yeah, so that was cool.
(0:26:26) Kev: So good for them.
(0:26:30) Codey: And then the final thing, they had a couple hints
(0:26:34) Codey: of what they're working on next.
(0:26:35) Codey: And they are going to do Mac ports and Linux ports.
(0:26:41) Codey: But Mac-- ooh, very excited about that.
(0:26:43) Kev: - Yeah, woo!
(0:26:48) Codey: I just never touch my PC anymore.
(0:26:50) Kev: _laughs_ I...
(0:26:52) Codey: So we're going to move it up.
(0:26:54) Codey: We're supposed to move it up here this week.
(0:26:56) Codey: Um, but I'm also like very busy right now.
(0:26:59) Codey: So there's no way I'm going to play it soon, but.
(0:27:02) Kev: Yeah, I have never owned an Apple product. No, that's not true. I had an iPad or iPod.
(0:27:08) Codey: iPod.
(0:27:08) Kev: Yeah, that's an iPod, yes. Back in the day, like the Mini, the Nano, whatever. That's it.
(0:27:14) Kev: But hey, good for you people. Man, those romancibles, they are pretty people.
(0:27:18) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:27:23) Codey: That's pretty, yeah.
(0:27:25) Codey: They, yeah.
(0:27:26) Kev: Sparkles all over. Somebody has birds in there. Good for them.
(0:27:30) Codey: Yep.
(0:27:32) Kev: All right. Yeah, good for your research story. I do think it is worth celebrating any of these games
(0:27:39) Kev: because we've seen them in the docket so long, hit 1.0. So good for you. Yeah,
(0:27:44) Kev: and it feels like a 1.0 release. Speaking of 1.0s, a little witch in the woods.
(0:27:53) Kev: September 4th, they're dropping the 1.0. And yeah, let's hear it.
(0:28:02) Kev: Okay, right now it's $16. That is comparable to the other ones. Oh man, these people,
(0:28:11) Kev: like, I feel weird saying it. I just feel bad for these devs who work so hard.
(0:28:15) Kev: They could probably go up to $19.99. I'm just saying. No one's gonna weep over the extra
(0:28:17) Codey: Yeah, like that's not going to be that's not going to break the bank.
(0:28:21) Kev: five bucks. I'm just saying. No, it's not. They deserve a 20. I'm just saying. Anyways,
(0:28:30) Kev: So yeah, it's dropped
(0:28:32) Kev: September 4th, it's you know, all sorts of new features new areas the villager the village with new villagers stories
(0:28:41) Kev: quality of life, etc, etc
(0:28:44) Kev: so yeah, that's
(0:28:46) Kev: Yeah, good for them. That'll be you know more less than a month when this drops
(0:28:54) Kev: So yeah, I'm looking forward to that. Yeah, I don't know how do we
(0:29:00) Kev: I'm just thinking, how do I feel about the-
(0:29:02) Kev: It does look very cute. I like the art style a lot. Will I play this? I don't know, maybe.
(0:29:06) Codey: Yeah, I'm, I don't know how I feel bad, but I'm, I'm, I'm done with witches, man. I've.
(0:29:12) Kev: It it has been used exhaustively in this space hasn't it?
(0:29:19) Kev: Yeah
(0:29:20) Kev: But but hey
(0:29:23) Kev: Well, let's say here wait one second. Well, you know what? Let's uh, oh gosh
(0:29:30) Kev: No, never mind. Okay. Okay. Um, alright, let's talk about
(0:29:34) Kev: another release coming out
(0:29:36) Kev: Slime Rancher 2 September 23rd that is another 1.0. It's
(0:29:42) Kev: Coming out on
(0:29:44) Kev: Everything pretty much nuts. Not true steam epic games PS. I can't believe the epic game store still running
(0:29:50) Codey: Yep. Yep.
(0:29:50) Kev: PS 5 and Xbox series x slash x s whatever that whatever the current letter is not switch not switch -
(0:29:59) Kev: but
(0:30:01) Kev: Yeah, it's coming out. It looks
(0:30:04) Kev: Chaotic and fun. It's it's weird. We don't talk about first-person shooters on this on this show much
(0:30:10) Kev: But yeah, here we go with you
(0:30:12) Kev: Vacuum up or launch the slimes
(0:30:15) Kev: Yeah, I don't know the well. I didn't play the first one. I will probably not play. There's nothing wrong with it
(0:30:21) Kev: I'm just busy
(0:30:22) Codey: Yeah, not not super for me either. But I know some people
(0:30:26) Codey: are really excited about it. So very happy for them that it is
(0:30:28) Kev: Yeah, no it
(0:30:30) Codey: coming out in a month and a half.
(0:30:32) Kev: It looks like a quality game. I will say that so good for you so I'm rancher to have people
(0:30:38) Kev: Alright, now let's keep rolling.
(0:30:43) Kev: Ok, we're backing off from the releases.
(0:30:46) Kev: Let's go now to our bread and butter on the show, Early Access and Betas.
(0:30:52) Kev: Early Access for the game called Grimshire.
(0:30:58) Kev: It is officially out now.
(0:31:02) Kev: Let's see here.
(0:31:04) Kev: Here, you wrote some notes, take it away Cody.
(0:31:06) Codey: - Yeah, so I wrote some notes
(0:31:08) Codey: because I hadn't really heard about this game
(0:31:10) Codey: and I was like, what, this is Grimshire?
(0:31:14) Codey: But this is a cozy game podcast,
(0:31:16) Codey: like Cottagecore game podcast, what?
(0:31:18) Codey: And so I went and looked at it and it is, it's cute.
(0:31:22) Codey: It reminds me, like the character models
(0:31:25) Codey: remind me a lot of Redwall.
(0:31:28) Codey: Did you ever read the Redwall books?
(0:31:30) Kev: Yeah yo, so yeah, this is Redwall is like one of my favorite fantasy variants.
(0:31:37) Kev: I don't know how to describe that, but like, because anytime you, the critter, it's like anthropomorphic critters and little animals.
(0:31:44) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:31:45) Kev: I'm, I'm down like 10, I'm not going to lie.
(0:31:50) Kev: That's kind of what got me into magic.
(0:31:52) Kev: They released a set called bloom burrow, which was Redwall s magic cards.
(0:31:52) Codey: [LAUGHS] Yeah.
(0:31:57) Kev: and it kind of caught my eye.
(0:32:00) Kev: So yes, I love Redwall very much.
(0:32:02) Codey: Yeah, so it reminds me of that and then, um, I kind of read more about it.
(0:32:07) Codey: They said, quote, we've been working on this cozy but grim little world for the past three
(0:32:11) Codey: years.
(0:32:12) Codey: And I was like, cozy but grim?
(0:32:16) Codey: Like how can something be cozy and grim at the same time?
(0:32:20) Codey: But I have also been recently watching Little House on the Prairie.
(0:32:24) Kev: Oh! Oh! That is, how should I put this? One of the Soria family staples. We've watched the series at least four times in the entirety!
(0:32:27) Codey: Did you ever watch that show?
(0:32:33) Codey: Okay.
(0:32:38) Codey: Okay cool.
(0:32:39) Codey: Yeah, so I would also describe that as cozy but grim.
(0:32:44) Kev: Every episode of Tragedy, you can't.
(0:32:46) Codey: Every single episode.
(0:32:48) Codey: And I was like texting Jeff cause I was watching them and I would just text him suddenly and
(0:32:53) Codey: be like, she got a pet raccoon and then they thought the raccoon had rabies.
(0:32:56) Kev: Oh, no, that episode!
(0:32:59) Codey: And then he was like literally about to shoot the dog.
(0:33:02) Codey: And the raccoon also bit Laura.
(0:33:04) Codey: So if the dog got rabies, she was going to have rabies and then it was.
(0:33:08) Codey: And I'm just like, I'm like sobbing, just tears streaming down my face.
(0:33:12) Kev: The raccoon ups that one's intense. Oh my gosh
(0:33:12) Codey: And he was just, that was intense.
(0:33:15) Codey: This is first season, like so many things happened in the first season.
(0:33:19) Codey: And I'm like, Oh yeah, I would have described that also as cozy, but grim.
(0:33:23) Kev: Yeah
(0:33:23) Codey: So I get it.
(0:33:26) Kev: Yeah
(0:33:27) Kev: But yeah, and I mean if you watch the trailer for Grimshire here like yeah, it's it's pretty grim like towards the end
(0:33:34) Kev: You see like the story is about
(0:33:37) Codey: plague
(0:33:37) Kev: Some survival stuff. There is a pyre. There's a funeral pyre
(0:33:39) Codey: Yeah
(0:33:41) Codey: Yeah, cuz there's plague there's plague in the area so which is also a little house of the food
(0:33:42) Kev: And people wondering if they're gonna die
(0:33:45) Kev: Yeah
(0:33:48) Kev: More than multiple
(0:33:49) Codey: More than one. Oh, no
(0:33:51) Codey: Well, yeah
(0:33:52) Codey: I guess cuz there I just they just had a typhus outbreak in this one and it didn't make I know one of them
(0:33:54) Kev: Yeah
(0:33:57) Codey: Makes the sister go blind anyway
(0:34:01) Codey: So they said quote in early access you can play throughout year one
(0:34:04) Codey: but your file will be stuck on winter 28th once you get there.
(0:34:07) Codey: The day keeps repeating after you go to bed,
(0:34:09) Codey: and we will be adding more content and story in the future.
(0:34:11) Codey: So just a heads up, if this is something
(0:34:13) Codey: that you were going to think about doing,
(0:34:16) Codey: then you're not going to be able to go further than that.
(0:34:20) Codey: And they also said that their old demo save files
(0:34:24) Codey: won't carry over into the full game.
(0:34:27) Codey: So if there are any new demo--
(0:34:32) Codey: if you restart a new demo now in the early access,
(0:34:37) Codey: that will be compatible with the full game.
(0:34:39) Codey: But if you've played the demo before,
(0:34:43) Codey: you will have to start over.
(0:34:45) Codey: Just a heads up.
(0:34:46) Kev: That's kind of a bummer
(0:34:48) Codey: I get that it happens sometimes, though.
(0:34:49) Kev: Yeah, I get it too. I'm just saying like yeah, you know
(0:34:52) Kev: I I'm interested in this game because it's got the red wall thing that the dark angle
(0:34:57) Kev: I mean, I'm intrigued but uh, but I probably will wait till I know when you know, I can keep a save or whatever
(0:35:02) Codey: Yep, and so they also say that they're going to add more stuff as they head to 1.0.
(0:35:04) Kev: Yeah
(0:35:10) Codey: This is actually a common theme of a lot of what we're talking about today.
(0:35:15) Codey: They are going to add more, and they have a little bit of a roadmap, but there are no
(0:35:19) Codey: dates on that roadmap.
(0:35:21) Codey: So just letting you know what's coming up, but they don't have any expected like, "Oh,
(0:35:28) Codey: we're expecting this to be done at this time and this to be done at this time," which is
(0:35:30) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that that's fine
(0:35:31) Codey: It's probably realistic.
(0:35:32) Codey: Uhm, just feels a little.
(0:35:36) Kev: Okay, well hey you I'm I'm definitely have my eye on Grimshire though all things said maybe not right now, but oh, but yeah
(0:35:45) Kev: Okay
(0:35:46) Kev: Let's see what else next up another early access
(0:35:50) Kev: Hotel galactic
(0:35:53) Kev: Early oh my gosh $35. That's kind of a it's premium. That's some premium pricing
(0:35:56) Codey: I know, right?
(0:36:00) Codey: Well, and there was drama associated with it.
(0:36:00) Kev: Oh
(0:36:05) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:36:06) Codey: So they released the early access on July 24.
(0:36:12) Codey: And in that initial post, they said
(0:36:14) Codey: that in the weeks following the release,
(0:36:17) Codey: they wanted feedback.
(0:36:20) Codey: Again, they had a projected roadmap,
(0:36:23) Codey: but I didn't have dates on it.
(0:36:24) Codey: Literally two days later.
(0:36:26) Codey: They posed another thing on Steam that's basically like oops.
(0:36:30) Codey: We're sorry for the state of the game.
(0:36:33) Codey: Um, and they say, quote, our rundown hotel has not yet been restored to its future.
(0:36:38) Codey: Glory.
(0:36:38) Codey: We are fully aware of that.
(0:36:40) Codey: And we sincerely apologize that our early access build did not
(0:36:44) Codey: meet all of your expectations.
(0:36:46) Codey: We made a mistake and we take full responsibility.
(0:36:49) Codey: Um, as part of like this, that's end quote, as part of this, uh, mistake,
(0:36:54) Codey: quote unquote
(0:36:56) Codey: They are adding compensation strategies so they're going to find a way to compensate people who have already paid for this early access.
(0:37:04) Codey: Kevin, how do you feel about that?
(0:37:06) Kev: Oh, okay. Um, all right. First off, I'm gonna take one step back here. First of all, what is the game cuz let's write that that's gonna I think that illustrates expectations. It's a clearly studio Ghibli specifically spirited away inspired game of how should I put this spirit favor esque of the, you know, the side view with the the rooms that you hop around that you're building up a hotel that then and so yeah, you're kind of
(0:37:10) Codey: - Mm-hmm, right, so...
(0:37:36) Kev: expanding the hotel, maintaining guests, etc, etc. We've talked about it before I just I just can't remember anyway, so that's the game. And so now, okay, before any drama $35 feels like a decent chunk of change for this game, considering spirit fair is noticeably not $35. Um, so you know, the expected prices set expectations, right? That's like the number one thing in in gaming,
(0:38:06) Kev: marketing, whatever.
(0:38:09) Kev: So, you know, dropping $35 on the city, it better be good. Now, early when I play an early access, or, you know, I hear about it, I expect things to be buggy, right? That's kind of a big part of the point, right? betas and play testing all that good stuff. So how bad was this? I can't even imagine how bad this was to demand or
(0:38:36) Kev: to elicit an apology.
(0:38:38) Codey: Yeah, I think that that's like my biggest issue and why I like pulled this question out because
(0:38:44) Codey: if I am playing something that's in early access I'm
(0:38:47) Codey: expecting bugs like even if it's game-breaking bugs like even if it is
(0:38:51) Codey: something like they put this out two days later if there was if there were
(0:38:57) Codey: bugs that made the game unplayable and it was then like two weeks later and they
(0:39:02) Codey: hadn't responded yeah compensate them like unless you had a friggin family
(0:39:08) Codey: and you didn't have any way to be working on the game at that time but
(0:39:11) Codey: literally two days after full release I think that's par for the course for a
(0:39:17) Codey: game that is as ambitious as this game so personally I'd be like like if I were
(0:39:25) Codey: one of the people who kick-started it or whatever I'd be like no no don't worry
(0:39:28) Codey: about reimbursing me just like take your time keep doing what you're doing like
(0:39:32) Codey: here's more feedback and give feedback because they literally won't need
(0:39:36) Kev: Sure, sure. Well, okay. I think there's two things one. There's a compensation. I don't think then it's gonna be necessarily monetarily
(0:39:43) Kev: That could just be you know in game item status, whatever something a bonus of some kind
(0:39:50) Kev: That's what I expect
(0:39:53) Kev: But
(0:39:54) Kev: But yeah, I like I agree with you
(0:39:58) Kev: Like I don't know maybe it's just this developer. Maybe they're just very sensitive about the
(0:40:04) Kev: the responses, it could be, I don't know, or.
(0:40:06) Kev: Maybe it was just that bad.
(0:40:09) Kev: I don't know where this lands.
(0:40:10) Codey: Okay, so they have, they do have some of the things, they explain what some of the bugs
(0:40:16) Codey: were that were coming up. And I mean, some of them are like, you know, game like breaking
(0:40:23) Codey: down or requests being blocked, cooking recipes not working, in game time, freezing stuff
(0:40:29) Codey: like that. But my favorite too, was that the workers are refusing to perform tasks. And
(0:40:33) Kev: Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, like, I mean, all right, you know what, I think that the
(0:40:37) Codey: You know what?
(0:40:38) Codey: Good for them.
(0:40:40) Codey: Let them unionize.
(0:40:40) Codey: Like that is a bug that if that was happening, I would cackle.
(0:40:46) Codey: I would be laughing so hard and I would message them and be like,
(0:40:48) Codey: Hey, this is happening.
(0:40:50) Codey: But like, I mean, what are you going to do?
(0:40:58) Kev: The only problem is, I'm going to go back to the $35 price point for early.
(0:41:01) Codey: - Okay, yeah.
(0:41:03) Kev: If that was their full release price point, sure, whatever, for early access, I don't know, $15, maybe? That's kind of high still, but, that's, I mean it's tough, you need money to keep it going, but I don't know.
(0:41:19) Kev: Ooh, that's rough though.
(0:41:20) Codey: So the other the other bug that I loved was that guests were stuck in an endless sleep loop.
(0:41:30) Kev: I like that.
(0:41:30) Codey: And you know what, same. I feel like sometimes in my life I there's just a bug happening and I'm just stuck endlessly sleeping.
(0:41:40) Kev: That's not that's that's a feature not a bug
(0:41:40) Codey: So I get it. Sometimes it just be that way.
(0:41:50) Codey: Yeah, so those are the two things that I thought were hilarious other I mean like I get if
(0:41:56) Kev: Yum
(0:41:56) Codey: there's like other things happening but that much outrage to come out in the 48 hours post
(0:41:58) Kev: Yum
(0:42:03) Kev: Well, you know here here's another thing is
(0:42:07) Kev: What if what is what about the knot game break
(0:42:10) Kev: breaking part like what if it's, you know, has just not fun, you know, like, sure.
(0:42:14) Codey: but that's again something that is going to be improved upon I mean I played lens islands
(0:42:19) Codey: first one and like it was I saw where they were going with it but it was definitely like pretty
(0:42:24) Codey: basic and they have improved it so much and it seems so fun now like oh sorry not seems it is
(0:42:30) Codey: so fun now. But yeah, I just
(0:42:30) Kev: Yeah
(0:42:35) Kev: Yeah, like I said, I think the only real issue the mistake was the $35 price point
(0:42:42) Kev: That's all that's that's something to go back to right because I how much did you pay for for the other ones?
(0:42:48) Kev: It wasn't $35
(0:42:50) Codey: - No, probably not, yeah.
(0:42:51) Kev: Yeah, right
(0:42:53) Codey: I don't even remember it was so long ago.
(0:42:55) Kev: Yeah, but but anyways
(0:42:59) Kev: Well, I'll give him this
(0:43:01) Kev: They they came out and said something right that's good
(0:43:04) Kev: So all right, that's hotel galactic. I'll keep keep an eye out to see if they fix that hotel
(0:43:14) Kev: Okay, um, all right here next up and
(0:43:20) Kev: Purred the a few sentences into Al's notes. It is early access is confirmed. Oh
(0:43:27) Kev: Oh, oh wait, no, not out yet.
(0:43:29) Kev: It will be a, sorry.
(0:43:30) Codey: No, no, no, no.
(0:43:31) Kev: Dates, they're weird.
(0:43:32) Kev: It is out, when people are listening to this, it will be out.
(0:43:35) Kev: It is already out now when we're recording, 'cause, wait, no?
(0:43:39) Kev: Oh my go- oh my go- I'm misreading that, you're right!
(0:43:40) Codey: Okay, so let me let me do this.
(0:43:41) Kev: Oh my gosh.
(0:43:42) Codey: So Al wrote early access releasing.
(0:43:43) Kev: Oh my goodness.
(0:43:46) Codey: Well, out now maybe and then there's another bullet not actually out yet, but was meant to be out 7th of August, but they clicked the wrong button on release.
(0:43:54) Kev: Oh my go-
(0:43:58) Codey: So, it's fine.
(0:44:02) Codey: This is their quote. I love this for them.
(0:44:04) Codey: I mean, it's probably very stressful for them, but I think this is hilarious.
(0:44:08) Codey: Quote, "We are heartbroken to say this, but we can't release today. We literally cannot press the button. It's gone."
(0:44:16) Codey: The game is ready to go. Everything was prepared, but since this is our first release ever, we forgot to tick the early access checkbox on the Steam backend until this morning.
(0:44:26) Codey: and once that is ticked, Steam automatically put our Steam page into
(0:44:30) Codey: review mode, which is a normal process on their end, but for us it couldn't have come at a worse
(0:44:35) Codey: time. This has caused the release button to disappear and we cannot click it.
(0:44:41) Kev: Aaaah! Hah!
(0:44:42) Codey: Oh dude, but that is like such like beer like I could see that being like bureaucracy stuff like
(0:44:47) Codey: that's not how are you supposed to know how are you supposed to know to click that check box or
(0:44:53) Codey: what if they started the game before that checkbox was there and then it just like was like well they
(0:44:57) Codey: didn't click it I don't know it
(0:45:00) Kev: But
(0:45:00) Codey: good for that like they'll figure it out it's it's only been three days there
(0:45:02) Kev: Yeah, that that's good
(0:45:06) Codey: is not an update yet let me just double-check that this is true but
(0:45:11) Kev: I've
(0:45:14) Kev: I've just got to say I love
(0:45:18) Kev: Game big news stories that come from pushing the wrong button
(0:45:25) Kev: Are you familiar with I think it's yakuza 7 I believe it was
(0:45:29) Codey: - Okay, I don't know.
(0:45:30) Kev: Yeah, I could it was the yakuza series. I believe it's seven whatever regardless whatever entry it was
(0:45:38) Kev: They released a free demo which I think was gonna be like the first chapter of the game or something like that
(0:45:45) Kev: And so, you know they released it as free demo it was the whole game
(0:45:50) Codey: Oh no dude sometimes stuff happens I get it but uh so yeah um out and about folks so sorry
(0:46:00) Kev: Oh
(0:46:02) Kev: Yeah, sorry
(0:46:03) Codey: for that but also like it's okay babies like we get it you do you like I know that they steam has
(0:46:11) Codey: to do their review process it's probably three to five business days or whatever so it's probably
(0:46:15) Codey: not going to be out for it might be out by the time this podcast episode comes out
(0:46:19) Kev: It might, yeah, yeah, it was supposed to be August 7th, which was last Thursday, so yeah, by the time this drops, it was a good trip, but by the end of the week, probably, um, oh, that's whole, oh, that's, doesn't even matter what game this was, what a story, um, oh, that's great, good, good, they'll be fine, good, good for you, you'll get there, um, that's out and about, um,
(0:46:20) Codey: um but yeah that's just
(0:46:26) Codey: it might be fixed
(0:46:34) Codey: stuff happens man
(0:46:49) Kev: okay, let's see here.
(0:46:52) Kev: All right, um, next up we have, uh, ages of Qatari, is that right? Yes, that's correct. Um, that is launching. Ah, sorry. Um, yeah, they would say coming soon to early access. What date was that? The September 16th windows only. This is, oh, is this the one with the people age? Is that the one? Yeah, I think it is. Um, I don't know.
(0:47:19) Kev: What? Oh, sorry, I'm just watching the trailer right now. There's a big purple frog here. There's a lot going on here. There's a goat girl shooting the archery. I don't know why. And house is moving. Um, yeah, that didn't.
(0:47:31) Codey: Yeah, so that's it's a the early access is releasing on September 6 while you watch that
(0:47:36) Codey: I'll just go over what it is on the early access is releasing 16th of September
(0:47:39) Codey: It is Windows only they want the switch to follow, but they're gonna do that afterwards
(0:47:44) Codey: And they have the standard roadmap for 1.0 again
(0:47:49) Codey: There's no expected dates. I think they also recently switched to self-publishing
(0:47:54) Kev: Mmm
(0:47:55) Codey: So that is probably another reason why they have not put dates on things which is totally
(0:47:59) Kev: Yeah, probably
(0:48:01) Kev: I'm like those feet and legs are too tiny for that man's build
(0:48:08) Kev: So yeah this one you're building up a village you're starting out with just like one family and building it up
(0:48:13) Kev: Which I do I do like that idea
(0:48:16) Kev: Generally speaking. I like seeing villages grow like in Minecraft. That's one of my favorite activities to do to expand villages
(0:48:25) Kev: So yeah, I do like that
(0:48:28) Kev: But yeah, I don't know. Well, I check this out. I don't know I have to see what is up with this go girl
(0:48:34) Kev: I don't know what what's up with their person. It might be a girl a goat person
(0:48:34) Codey: Well, you're gonna have to play the game of hair now.
(0:48:39) Kev: They're also made of tree, I think those are wood arms and your leave ears, okay
(0:48:45) Kev: I don't know what's going on here, but that's ages of Kataria
(0:48:49) Kev: And it looks like it time passes and people age which is I think a fun little
(0:48:54) Kev: mechanic there but yeah September 16th will I check it out I don't know maybe
(0:49:00) Kev: no I'll probably wait for switch yeah there you go but but yeah speaking of
(0:49:10) Kev: things that come to switch let's talk about gogo town Animal Crossing on some
(0:49:14) Codey: Oh, woo-hoo!
(0:49:17) Kev: on something I'm not sure if it's steroids or something else but it's
(0:49:21) Kev: Spring 2026, it was in the...
(0:49:24) Kev: Indie Direct? Or the part? It was in one of the Directs.
(0:49:27) Kev: Yeah, Gogo Town.
(0:49:30) Kev: Yeah, they're just launching with the 1.0, pretty much.
(0:49:35) Kev: On Switch, at launch, I don't know, looks...
(0:49:40) Kev: And we've talked about it, there's been episodes on it, you know.
(0:49:44) Kev: It's crazy, it's chaotic, it's chainsaws and visitors and whatnot.
(0:49:44) Codey: Yep
(0:49:49) Codey: And they've been adding changing a lot of things as people have requested improvements so
(0:49:49) Kev: Werewolves.
(0:49:55) Codey: Seems like it's getting there
(0:49:58) Kev: Yeah, that that's gonna be a solid release. I'll say that right it already looks like a you know a solid game, so
(0:50:02) Codey: Yeah
(0:50:05) Kev: That's that's good stuff
(0:50:05) Codey: So that's they don't have a
(0:50:08) Codey: 100% release date yet, but they do say that it is going to be
(0:50:12) Codey: Q1 2025 or sorry 2026
(0:50:14) Codey: so and and that the switch will come out at launch so if you didn't if you
(0:50:24) Codey: were waiting for news about switchport there you go you're not gonna have to
(0:50:26) Kev: No, yeah, there you go
(0:50:27) Codey: wait any longer than in
(0:50:29) Kev: Yeah, now to be clear they say spring 2026. So, you know, which spring could be in Australia could do it could be Australian spring
(0:50:34) Codey: Oh, it could be Q2, yeah.
(0:50:39) Kev: You know, you never know
(0:50:39) Codey: Oh, no.
(0:50:41) Codey: No, I think they specifically said Q1, so I think we're good.
(0:50:45) Kev: Okay, okay cuz their graphics is spring but okay, that's fine. All right Q1 are they lock themselves in?
(0:50:50) Codey: I thought I read Q1 somewhere.
(0:50:53) Kev: some 2026 at some point most likely probably
(0:50:56) Kev: all right let's see here all right so
(0:51:03) Kev: next up so that stuff that's coming out
(0:51:05) Kev: or dates or whatever let's talk about
(0:51:08) Kev: some updates now um oh I both sorry I
(0:51:14) Kev: just saw one of the big ones of the
(0:51:15) Kev: okay we're talking about space sprouts
(0:51:16) Kev: I reacted that way because the first
(0:51:21) Kev: thing on the list I see is both yay it's
(0:51:24) Kev: It's in, and boo, why was it not--
(0:51:26) Kev: you know already, and that's controller support.
(0:51:29) Kev: You're like, oh my gosh, every time.
(0:51:33) Kev: Well, to be fair, this is more of a clicky game
(0:51:35) Kev: because it's like a 2D, you know,
(0:51:39) Kev: going through rooms and interacting with stuff.
(0:51:42) Kev: So I can kind of get why it'd be more mouse geared.
(0:51:44) Kev: But still, controller support, I like it a lot.
(0:51:49) Kev: Yeah, man, this game is chaotic space process.
(0:51:53) Kev: You can set a lot of things on fire.
(0:51:54) Kev: I'm just saying.
(0:51:56) Codey: - Yep, but you should not, there should not be fire in space.
(0:51:56) Kev: Alright not in space but in the space station maybe okay um but yeah anyway
(0:52:07) Kev: so other stuff on the update actually um the optimizing stuff for the steam
(0:52:12) Kev: deck introduced and simplified Chinese that's always a good one that's I don't
(0:52:16) Kev: know if you people know this that's kind of a big market there's kind of a lot of
(0:52:20) Kev: people who speak Chinese is so good maybe
(0:52:22) Codey: you know, maybe like a third of the world or something.
(0:52:26) Kev: maybe half my office um new memory wait there's an update called secrets and
(0:52:36) Kev: memories what memories I don't know I'm only really
(0:52:38) Codey: yeah so they don't have this so there are they said that there are three new memories in the
(0:52:42) Codey: first update but then there is a second update will that will be coming out the next update is
(0:52:48) Codey: called secrets and memories and again they don't have a date on this um so just for y'all to know
(0:52:52) Kev: Um what is in a memory I don't know what that means in this context are you trying to figure
(0:52:54) Codey: that that's the next update
(0:53:00) Kev: out what you are maybe I don't know um but uh but yeah oh physics based nonsense anyways
(0:53:07) Kev: um okay yeah so that's space sprouts it looks it looks fun i'll give them that um uh oh my gosh
(0:53:15) Kev: I just called the next oh I didn't pay attention it just clicked it wait when when hold on
(0:53:23) Kev: terry nill the heatwave update it's out now oh my goodness what am I doing not playing
(0:53:26) Codey: It's out.
(0:53:32) Codey: So as a Kevfangirls over on that side,
(0:53:36) Codey: just letting y'all know what it is,
(0:53:38) Codey: it's the heat wave update in Terranil.
(0:53:40) Codey: In this they add deserts and savannas
(0:53:42) Codey: on the far side of the world.
(0:53:45) Codey: So this is gonna add new biomes,
(0:53:46) Codey: some new animals that go in the biomes.
(0:53:49) Codey: There are three new,
(0:53:50) Codey: several maps you can do. One is called parched Oasis. One is Canyon Peaks, and that is inspired
(0:53:56) Codey: by the Grand Canyon. And then one is called the fracked floodplain. So fracked is in fracking,
(0:54:03) Codey: which is when people release natural gas by breaking apart the earth. And that releases
(0:54:11) Codey: natural gas and oils and really messes up the environment. So you need to restore all
(0:54:19) Codey: of that.
(0:54:20) Codey: Uh, in that, yeah, it looks really cool for sure.
(0:54:21) Kev: There's...
(0:54:22) Kev: ELEPHANTS!
(0:54:24) Kev: That's all I need!
(0:54:27) Kev: I- there's a rover? I don't know what that's about, but...
(0:54:30) Kev: There's elevated, like, aqueduct-looking things. Oh my- _gasps_
(0:54:33) Codey: I might need to just get this right now.
(0:54:34) Codey: Honestly, unless I already own it.
(0:54:36) Codey: I don't remember if I own it or not because it's on Mac and let me see if I own it.
(0:54:37) Kev: Oh my goodness.
(0:54:42) Codey: It's so currently, sorry listeners, currently it's on sale 60% off.
(0:54:47) Codey: So it's only not, it's $10.
(0:54:48) Kev: Get it get it. Oh my gosh. This game's a drug for me. Oh
(0:54:51) Codey: But it is, it's going off of that sale the day after this podcast ends.
(0:54:56) Kev: No, oh, oh yeah, I'm posting this in the slack I have to alert people now
(0:55:01) Codey: Oh yeah, true, true, true, true.
(0:55:03) Codey: So yeah, I'm going to get it right now, but, um, yeah.
(0:55:08) Kev: Oh, I'm so happy it's out now.
(0:55:12) Kev: I know what I'm doing after this.
(0:55:14) Codey: I have been wanting to play this game a lot.
(0:55:17) Kev: Oh, right to fill in the unicorn overlord hole in my heart.
(0:55:21) Kev: Oh, thank goodness.
(0:55:22) Codey: Yeah you have a hole you're like oh no what do I play? There you go.
(0:55:28) Codey: So we will probably there there might be a second harvest in the future sounds like folks.
(0:55:28) Kev: All right.
(0:55:29) Kev: Let's talk about.
(0:55:34) Kev: I mean, probably, well, unless other people play it, like,
(0:55:39) Kev: it's still a puzzle type game, right?
(0:55:40) Kev: So like the new mechanics are great and all, but it's like, I
(0:55:43) Kev: don't have much to say.
(0:55:44) Kev: It's, it's more of the thing that I like.
(0:55:46) Kev: It's that's all it is.
(0:55:48) Kev: Um, but you know, if people, other people want to play it
(0:55:51) Kev: and talk to me, that's great.
(0:55:52) Codey: I mean, we always got to have someone who was on it before, that's just part of the thing.
(0:55:58) Kev: I don't think when we did Spiritfare, I don't think either of us had played it before.
(0:56:03) Codey: No, I had. I played it. I played it after Kelly. Kelly and
(0:56:05) Kev: Oh, you had? Oh, did you? Oh, I don't remember.
(0:56:09) Kev: Oh, well.
(0:56:11) Codey: Al had talked about it and they were crying. Or maybe it was you
(0:56:12) Kev: Yeah. Ah, okay, okay, okay.
(0:56:14) Codey: and Kelly. But y'all they made me cry and then just even
(0:56:15) Kev: No, it was Alan Kelly. It was definitely Alan Kelly.
(0:56:19) Codey: listening to the episodes and then I played it and then I
(0:56:23) Kev: Yeah, I meant, you know, many teasers shit, you know, or tears will hopefully not be shed snako
(0:56:28) Codey: I sure heckin' hope not. That would be devastating.
(0:56:31) Kev: That'd be wild
(0:56:35) Kev: They especially since they dropped the new update and hopefully not a catastrophic one with missing buttons or anything but uh,
(0:56:41) Kev: but yeah snako 1.1 as as uh,
(0:56:45) Kev: Wait, is it out now? Is it uh, yeah, believe it is out now. Uh, it has dropped out
(0:56:49) Kev: they are dropped they have a cooking system or
(0:56:54) Kev: which is pretty cool you can experiment making stuff or follow recipes that
(0:57:02) Kev: looks and I like cooking in real life I like cooking in games I like food I'm
(0:57:06) Kev: kind of hungry actually so you know what this is good I man I do love the like 2d
(0:57:11) Kev: pixel octopath look they're going for but they're introducing lemons let's see
(0:57:19) Kev: What else ooh?
(0:57:23) Kev: I like lemons. I like citrus generally speaking. Very cute game. Good for you, Snacko.
(0:57:42) Codey: I just love that they were like when life gives you lemons. And so they added that.
(0:57:53) Kev: Okay, let's see here. What am I passing one? I'm skipping one.
(0:57:58) Codey: Yeah, the last update is for Everdream Valley.
(0:58:02) Codey: Excuse me, the Family Time DLC is out now.
(0:58:05) Codey: It is out on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.
(0:58:11) Codey: Notably, the PlayStation versions are not out yet.
(0:58:16) Codey: They are working on it.
(0:58:18) Codey: I bet it's just PlayStation being a butt, as is tradition.
(0:58:23) Codey: So on the Steam, it released in December in 2024.
(0:58:28) Codey: Just that DLC is $10 on Steam.
(0:58:31) Codey: I haven't looked to see how much it is on the other games.
(0:58:34) Codey: I'm assuming also $10.
(0:58:37) Codey: And what this Family Time DLC adds
(0:58:39) Codey: is new NPCs, grandma's house, going to grandma's house.
(0:58:43) Kev: No, dang.
(0:58:44) Codey: I don't know if a game has ever had go visit grandma before.
(0:58:48) Kev: No.
(0:58:48) Codey: I kind of love that, because I would be there all the time.
(0:58:50) Kev: It's pretty good.
(0:58:53) Kev: Yeah, it's pretty good.
(0:58:55) Codey: and then they also add new animals and they
(0:58:58) Codey: Specify that they added insects. So
(0:59:00) Kev: You know, new animals are always hyped, but I don't know if you've seen the trailer of the art,
(0:59:06) Kev: but their animals are pretty goofy looking, like, in a very great way.
(0:59:08) Codey: Okay.
(0:59:09) Kev: Like, those rabbits are circles with ears, um...
(0:59:13) Kev: And also your character's wearing a cattasuit, so you know, this is good stuff.
(0:59:16) Codey: Yeah.
(0:59:18) Kev: This is good dumbed-down for this. Mmm, I like this.
(0:59:20) Kev: Good for you, Everdream Valley, um...
(0:59:23) Kev: Update, that's... Oh my gosh, it's...
(0:59:26) Kev: Oh my gosh, it's like 70% off on Steam right now.
(0:59:28) Codey: - Yeah, well, that doesn't last.
(0:59:29) Kev: Cool.
(0:59:30) Kev: Oh yeah, sorry people.
(0:59:31) Codey: That is only for the next 14 hours.
(0:59:34) Kev: That's your fault for not, thank you for not listening to this before, before we recorded.
(0:59:36) Codey: Not this.
(0:59:40) Kev: That's pretty good.
(0:59:40) Codey: I will say one of the dogs has the coloration
(0:59:42) Codey: of an Australian Shepherd/Bernie's Mountain Dog
(0:59:47) Kev: Um, that's great.
(0:59:49) Kev: Oh, there is a demo if you want to check it out, I might check it out.
(0:59:51) Kev: That's very, those are very cute, goofy animals, I like it.
(0:59:54) Kev: Um, okay.
(0:59:56) Kev: So yeah, that is, uh, yeah, that's the last of our updates.
(0:59:59) Kev: So now let's talk about new.
(1:00:00) Kev: New game announcement stuff, is that right?
(1:00:04) Kev: Yes, it is. Okay, let's start off with firefly village
(1:00:09) Kev: You know if we're if we're going with the village fireflies probably one of the better names you could go go with I guess
(1:00:17) Kev: Mmm, I don't know. I I'm gonna assume that art is very like
(1:00:23) Kev: early stage
(1:00:26) Kev: Some of the character portrait, sorry, I'm just going through the trailer
(1:00:30) Kev: So this one is I do like
(1:00:35) Kev: It's a stardew like let's just be really you're going around you're mining you're farming fishing all that good stuff
(1:00:42) Kev: And a roster of characters with very should I describe that art style that are you look in the trailer?
(1:00:48) Kev: Do you see the portraits I'm talking about like?
(1:00:50) Codey: I've seen it. Yeah, it does. I mean, I'm I'm down for that. That's a style. I think the one thing about this game, like from looking at the trailer from looking at everything, let me just have you. Let me just read the thing.
(1:00:52) Kev: This feels like very middle school sketchbook for lack of a better word
(1:01:08) Codey: The Firefly Village awaits a bite size streamlined farming sim that focuses on moments that matter without wasting a single second of your time. Build a homestead, raise crops, tend to livestock, make friends and enjoy.
(1:01:20) Codey: A pocket of paradise where farming is a delight and friends plentiful. I just what is it giving that's novel?
(1:01:29) Kev: Yeah, well here's the thing because they say like bite-sized days. They seem to emphasize that like they're
(1:01:35) Kev: Streamlining, but I don't I can't tell what's being streamlined here based off the trailer and description. I'm not sure
(1:01:38) Codey: Yeah.
(1:01:42) Codey: Yeah, it is unclear to me.
(1:01:44) Codey: So that would be something that maybe like a demo would determine.
(1:01:47) Codey: They don't have, I mean, so yeah, August 11th is when I think the whole thing comes out.
(1:01:55) Codey: I don't, it doesn't even say early access.
(1:01:56) Kev: yeah yeah August oh yeah no just it's dropping yeah I don't know I this feels
(1:01:57) Codey: It just says August 11th.
(1:02:05) Kev: like a weird like approach or middle ground because okay if you're gonna do a
(1:02:10) Kev: stardew like you're already you know that you're already fighting a tough
(1:02:13) Kev: battle because if you're gonna stand out you need to either I think on the
(1:02:19) Kev: contrary invest in the non like under the flavor the lore right like
(1:02:26) Kev: roots of pacha right that's a I like that one a lot the mechanics very stardew like
(1:02:31) Kev: but the the flavor the presentation yeah the setting or the story something
(1:02:31) Codey: Yeah, like change the, change the background of it, change the, the scene.
(1:02:37) Codey: Yeah, but this is very much the very similar looking.
(1:02:37) Kev: right right like yeah now maybe I don't know maybe what if a day is only like I
(1:02:46) Kev: don't know but we'll see yeah yeah well yeah or or you minimize it like so much
(1:02:48) Codey: I don't know if I like that. That's stressful.
(1:02:54) Kev: much, I think of another game called--
(1:02:56) Kev: 8-bit orchard that I played, where it's all like black and white like pixel like 8-bit.
(1:03:02) Kev: It's very minimalistic, but it's very good actually
(1:03:06) Kev: because it leans into that minimalism. So, but I don't know what they're going for here. That's kind of the problem, right?
(1:03:11) Kev: It's not super clear.
(1:03:14) Kev: But yeah, we'll see. I don't know. I just started like tough market, right?
(1:03:21) Kev: But we'll find out soon because August 11th. That's what oh my god. That is out
(1:03:26) Kev: By the time people listen to this
(1:03:26) Codey: Yep, tomorrow.
(1:03:29) Kev: Yeah, yeah, okay
(1:03:33) Codey: So take a look at it, folks, if this,
(1:03:35) Codey: I mean, yeah, if you're interested,
(1:03:37) Codey: if it's something that you've been looking at,
(1:03:40) Codey: give us some feedback,
(1:03:41) Codey: 'cause from just looking at the trailer, not sure.
(1:03:45) Kev: yeah I'm not sure either yeah I would also like to be surprised okay now for
(1:03:45) Codey: Not sure what's different.
(1:03:48) Codey: I would love to be surprised.
(1:03:56) Kev: the next game let's go to the opposite end of the spectrum something that has
(1:03:59) Kev: very much caught my eye you would be better if it were in English but you
(1:04:01) Codey: It's true.
(1:04:08) Kev: know at least I'll be keeping an eye out to see if it comes out in English
(1:04:13) Kev: Hono gura shin.
(1:04:15) Kev: Onewa?
(1:04:22) Codey: Yep.
(1:04:45) Kev: I am just going to read Al's notes outright, just to make this easier.
(1:04:51) Codey: Yep, well, I don't I think that those are just quotes from Phogu.
(1:04:55) Codey: Yep, I think
(1:05:16) Kev: The protagonist will sew and grow cops, care for livestock, go fishing, forge for wild goodies, construct decor and machines (ok now we're asking a lot)
(1:05:24) Kev: and raise relationships with the villagers by helping with their requests and participating in festivals.
(1:05:30) Kev: Sounds like a lovely farming game where players lead a peaceful life through the seasons surrounded by nature and the rural mountains.
(1:05:36) Kev: And then Al adding, I assume here, aha no not quite.
(1:05:41) Kev: Um, this is a game in the
(1:05:45) Kev: studio's Yomawari series a spooky adventure with oh my god wait I didn't
(1:05:51) Kev: finish watching this trailer. This is a game in the studio's Yomawari series a
(1:05:53) Codey: - Yeah.
(1:06:01) Kev: spooky adventure with gore mature themes evil spirits and creepy
(1:06:05) Kev: atmospheres during the day we have our coat charming and cozy farming sim but
(1:06:09) Kev: at night when the village becomes quiet things go very sideways survival is
(1:06:13) Kev: essential to discovering this.
(1:06:16) Kev: Oh wait, I didn't finish watching the trailers, is that what happened?
(1:06:18) Codey: Yeah, so in the trailer they show like partway through maybe two thirds of the way through
(1:06:26) Codey: it like it kind of goes red and then it just shows like some creepy stuff and then there's
(1:06:30) Kev: Oh, okay, there's the red. Okay. I'm watching it now. Oh, yeah
(1:06:31) Codey: like a ghost behind you super wild.
(1:06:37) Kev: Okay, but they just oh my gosh that oh that that's one that is that's not a cute ghost that is one of those
(1:06:44) Codey: No, it's supposed to be scary, I think.
(1:06:45) Kev: uncomfortable ghosts, yeah
(1:06:46) Codey: I, the thinking about,
(1:06:49) Codey: so I like a spooky adventure with gore.
(1:06:52) Kev: That that's the one right and so like
(1:06:54) Codey: That is the word that like jumps out to me.
(1:06:56) Kev: Right mature themes, right
(1:07:01) Kev: I don't know how it's wild because the day part I got so excited cuz the art style is great
(1:07:07) Kev: it is very charming and cute and like I'm I was madly in love with that, but
(1:07:07) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah.
(1:07:13) Kev: And I'm not saying I'm not in love because of this but
(1:07:16) Codey: Yeah, nope jumps out at you man I
(1:07:17) Kev: Just didn't see that coming. They got me live live on camera
(1:07:24) Kev: No, I might I still might be very much down for this I'm just mmm that that is quite the rug pull
(1:07:30) Kev: um
(1:07:31) Kev: That's next year in July of next year 2026 for switch one and two PlayStation 5 and Steam
(1:07:40) Codey: Yeah, so I really love this animation style. I'm also here kind of like, you know, recapping it at
(1:07:46) Codey: both ends of like thinking about cozy and grim at the same time. Now that I'm like starting to think
(1:07:52) Codey: more about that genre as I was listening to the or like watching the news and kind of like
(1:07:56) Codey: listening to our talking and stuff. I get it and like my fave fantasy genre is what is called
(1:08:03) Codey: grimdark. So and basically... grimshire!
(1:08:06) Kev: in heaven or Grimshire, whatever, month of the Grimshire.
(1:08:10) Codey: Yeah, so grimdark like encapsulates. It's the fantasy. It's got fantasy elements, but there's
(1:08:18) Codey: there are consequences. There's no guarantee that people are going to be fine. So if you think of
(1:08:24) Codey: something like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, like you know that the main trio or whatever are
(1:08:31) Codey: they're fine. They're going to make it. There's no way they don't. Grimdark, all bets are off.
(1:08:34) Kev: sure sure sure okay is this grim with two m's because because that feels like
(1:08:40) Codey: No, no, I think it's just called grimdark with 1M.
(1:08:44) Kev: what grim with two of em's means
(1:08:45) Codey: You're right, you're right. Game of Thrones started out as grimdark, but it kind of went
(1:08:50) Codey: in a different direction near the end where like, you know, you love Ned Stark and then he's dead.
(1:08:51) Kev: yeah
(1:08:56) Codey: If you haven't seen, sorry, if that's a spoiler, if you haven't seen Game of Thrones and you didn't
(1:09:00) Codey: know that, how? But but yeah, so I'm kind of... It did. It did. It got darker.
(1:09:02) Kev: Well, well some would say that series got darker for different reasons.
(1:09:10) Codey: For sure. But yeah, that's. Oh, yikes. That too, unfortunately.
(1:09:10) Kev: Oh no, I'm talking about the production.
(1:09:18) Codey: I just finished a rewatch of that series and it still is disappointing.
(1:09:24) Codey: But yeah, so that is something I kind of want more of that. Give me more. Give me more grimdark,
(1:09:31) Codey: grim cozy. I want to and I feel like grimdark or grim cozy kind of also encapsulates what people
(1:09:40) Codey: are calling goblin core, which is like instead of being cute, witchy, it's like moths and
(1:09:42) Kev: - I'm sure, yeah.
(1:09:49) Codey: disgusting things. Yeah, like Cult of the Lamb. And so, yeah, I don't know. I kind of,
(1:09:50) Kev: Yeah, cult of the lion
(1:09:56) Codey: I like that. You know, it's hard to be surprised these days with these genre within this genre,
(1:10:04) Codey: within, you know, everything's kind of seems like it's been done, but no, they find ways. So.
(1:10:08) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(1:10:11) Kev: And and it's it's interesting because like so I can't say participate much in grim dark
(1:10:18) Kev: but I
(1:10:20) Kev: Kind of in from the reverse side my favorite sub genre of horror is is dark comedy generally speaking, right?
(1:10:26) Codey: Mm hmm. Would that be a cabin in the woods?
(1:10:30) Kev: I have not seen Kevin in words. Can you believe it? Oh?
(1:10:34) Codey: I cannot.
(1:10:36) Codey: Oh, my gosh.
(1:10:37) Kev: Have you okay?
(1:10:38) Kev: Have you heard of Dale and Tucker vs. Evil?
(1:10:41) Codey: Yeah, I've heard of it.
(1:10:42) Codey: I haven't watched it, though, but you haven't seen you haven't.
(1:10:42) Kev: Oh, you need to watch it!
(1:10:46) Kev: I bet those guys... maybe, I don't know, but Dale and Tucker's really good, but from what I understand though, Cabin in the Woods, yes, does fall in that, um, category, right, right, yeah, um, also, uh, what is it, uh, Sean of the Dead, uh, you know, the Cornetto Trilogy, that probably, I would, uh, slot in that, in that category, um, anyways, the point I was making, um,
(1:10:53) Codey: - Yeah, such a good movie, love that movie.
(1:11:08) Kev: you know, when you have to balance the light and the dark, that, that can make for some really good stuff, so, um, going back to this game, like, oh, man, even if they didn't do that, I would've been so on board, because the production, the quality, the art style is so good, I love it, but, it is, but, yeah, that, like, that ghost is, like, a person shape, but kind of, uh, squiggly, like, you know, one of those kind of blurry, lower flip frame rate,
(1:11:24) Codey: Yeah, it's it's definitely doing something different super interested
(1:11:38) Kev: than everything else sort of goes. Oh, I'm so down for this game. This is not going to
(1:11:45) Kev: get localized. I can already tell you it's not. I'm going to just be here sad. Oh, that
(1:11:46) Codey: Just have to have a, hopefully AI will have, no, I don't even want to say that cause I
(1:11:51) Kev: is. No, monkey paw, monkey paw, help. The fanlations. Maybe. No.
(1:11:55) Codey: don't even want to joke about it.
(1:11:58) Codey: Hopefully like you will have learned Japanese by then.
(1:12:02) Codey: Oh yeah, true.
(1:12:04) Codey: Fans will have hopefully fanlated it.
(1:12:08) Kev: Oh man, go back to the, you know, early 2000s day when you, you have to pull up the, the
(1:12:13) Kev: game facts translation right next to your game. Oh, that's installment. I never did
(1:12:16) Codey: I never played any games that were like that, probably because it sounds awful.
(1:12:20) Kev: either. Oh, that is Honegura Shin-Oniwa, a game I will think about deeply and eye out
(1:12:30) Codey: We'll haunt you at the end.
(1:12:31) Kev: for localization. Oh, he helped me out. I'm not being haunted actually. All right. Let's
(1:12:39) Kev: okay. We got, we got one other thing. Let's talk about galactic getaway, a Kickstarter
(1:12:40) Codey: There's one final thing.
(1:12:46) Kev: game that has to describe it feels very, and I'm crossing at home until you get inside
(1:12:53) Kev: a tank. Yes, that is correct. Yes. Cause yeah, you watch that trailer. That is, those are
(1:12:53) Codey: The animal like animal crossing at home like we have animal crossing at home. Is that what you're saying? Okay
(1:13:02) Kev: some animal crossing legally distinct characters. And then, and then you get inside tanks because
(1:13:08) Kev: you are doing the, you know, the house decorating, cutting down trees, but eventually there's
(1:13:13) Kev: an arcade where you get inside some tanks and do fun mini games with people that actually
(1:13:18) Kev: look very entertaining. Which is a, I think a fun idea of, you know, focusing on the multiplayer
(1:13:24) Kev: connection stuff. Now that's great and all. Unfortunately, they are the sad Kickstarter
(1:13:39) Kev: game development is kind of slowing down. They ran out of money. It's tough. They tried reaching
(1:13:50) Kev: out to EA. I believe it's the publisher. Oh, early access. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Okay.
(1:13:52) Codey: Oh, no, no, no, no.
(1:13:53) Codey: Sorry, sorry, I wrote this.
(1:13:55) Codey: They released the early access to try to get revenue.
(1:13:58) Codey: So they ran out of funds in March.
(1:14:00) Codey: They were like, well, let's release it in early access.
(1:14:03) Codey: That really didn't work.
(1:14:04) Codey: And so they had to let the development team go,
(1:14:07) Codey: two of the people on the development team,
(1:14:09) Codey: like an artist and a developer.
(1:14:12) Codey: So now there's only one person, their name is Daniel,
(1:14:15) Codey: who is still working on the game,
(1:14:17) Codey: but they also have a full-time job.
(1:14:18) Kev: Yeah, that's rough
(1:14:19) Codey: So they're still, but they're, they're still wanting.
(1:14:22) Codey: You go forward. So this post is really just to like, be transparent.
(1:14:27) Codey: They've so far taken feedback from folks and made that feedback that has been received already in that early access. It's only been out for a hot minute and they are.
(1:14:38) Codey: With the highest feedback, you know, really trying to put their time into fixing the issues that the community has given, which is great. And then I really they said this blurb and I just, I wanted to blurb the whole thing.
(1:14:52) Codey: I'm going to set a realistic scope on what to finish. I know the game is fun. Now, if you can deal with all of the bugs from chatting with our community and discord, I really miss hanging out with everyone in game.
(1:15:03) Codey: I'm going through a bit of a hard time, so I hope you can be patient with me as I get back to a place where I can work on GG or galactic getaway again.
(1:15:12) Codey: You know what? Good for you. You don't take your time. It sounds like people are still having fun.
(1:15:12) Kev: Yeah.
(1:15:15) Kev: Yeah.
(1:15:17) Kev: There are some cool ideas in this trailer, I like it.
(1:15:20) Kev: Um, that's rough, Kickstarter games, I mean, it's all rough.
(1:15:24) Kev: Game Dev's rough, Kickstarter is often rough, and just, you know, no, yeah, no,
(1:15:32) Kev: obviously no blame on this guy, you know, things got rough for him.
(1:15:34) Kev: Um, but, uh, yeah, I hope I can turn around for him, but, uh, but he's,
(1:15:39) Kev: at least he was open about it.
(1:15:40) Kev: I'm like so many other Kickstarter.
(1:15:40) Codey: - Yep.
(1:15:43) Codey: - Re-legend.
(1:15:46) Codey: - I think is like the bad one, right?
(1:15:54) Codey: No! Don't mention it! No, Kevin!
(1:15:58) Codey: Every time it's mentioned, it gets pushed back more!
