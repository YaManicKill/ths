<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Welcome. Yes. Nami is here because I thought it'd be good to get another person's thoughts on the animal crossing new horizons update, you know, especially with how much Kevin hates the game.

28
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.239

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: [laughs]

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.360
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So whenever I come on a podcast and we ask this question,

42
00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.759
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Or I mean, mostly people want to hear about games.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I played Luigi's Mansion 2 on Switch for the month of October

45
00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.400
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and I beat it.

46
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.639
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I got credits a little after October.

47
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.319
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It was like November 3rd or so.

48
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and I came to enjoy that gift.

49
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:16.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: My first didn't like the, um, the format of going into the mansion, finishing your objective, coming out of the mansion, clicking through dialogue, going back in, but I kind of settled into the rhythm of just doing a level daily, and that I found that pretty motivating at the end of it.

50
00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:46.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, um, beyond that, um, I am slowly making my way through a Pokemon fire red Nuzlocke. I tried a Nuzlocke, a Pokemon

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: one game every fall, like September or so, um, hit a bit of a wall just because there's such a big level jump between Erica and Koga and Sabrina, so I have to, like, commit to some grinding. Um, but my team is really like shaping up. Like I've got a growlith, which is cool. Um, it's got to intimidate, um, what a, I mean, I've got a cadabra, right? You have to have something that can do that special damage. Um,

52
00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.139
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah. I guess the good thing as well about those games is that especially the time that

53
00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.659
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: you're talking about is there's such a large area of the map you can now go to that you're

54
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes, I think I can still go down the entire biking road, so there's going to be at least like

55
00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:17.019
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: not just like sitting in one small area of the map grinding. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

56
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:23.379
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: four or five levels from there. And when I beat Luigi's Mansion 2, I went back to my Zelda

57
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Nice.

58
00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:28.980
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Echoes of Wisdom file. I started playing that when the Switch 2 launched and then put it down

59
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.339
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: when Donkey Kong came out. So, I'm almost done with it. I think I've...

60
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I couldn't tell you how many temples there are. There's like seven or eight. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

61
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.600
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I've can't I honestly can't remember that detail. I play I played it obsessively for two weeks and then never touched it again

62
00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:51.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think I'm... Right. Yeah. It's fun. I think I'm on the last regular temple and then I'll go to

63
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: As is the case for all Zelda games

64
00:04:51.779 --> 00:05:02.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: the final, like, here's the end of the game temple. And I'm enjoying the, like, thinking around

65
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: How to go across combat.

66
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:16.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Sometimes it's frustrating and it's mostly when I'm out of that energy to become link for a minute.

67
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:39.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah. Well, see, this is, this is my thing, right? So, so the thing that really frustrations me about this game is that they're like, here's this really new cool concept here where we're taking Zelda, we're finally going to let you play as Zelda and she's got this whole new way of playing compared to Link. Oh, but also we don't really trust what we're doing. And so we're just going to let you play as Link anyway.

68
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, I totally get that point of criticism.

69
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:52.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think maybe the middle ground would be to give her some kind of...

70
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Some kind of agency beyond just the echoes.

71
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I say just the echoes.

72
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like, I don't know.

73
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Maybe like, give her a bow and arrow, like halfway through the game,

74
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: or make her, like her hair flip that she does,

75
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.339
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: does do like, I don't know.

76
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.339
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: of what a sword slash would do, you know, just something to wear if you are back into a

77
00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.860
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: corner and all of your other guys are over on the other side of the screen that you can, you know,

78
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.620
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: defend yourself. But anyway, that's getting into the weeds of it. I'm having fun with it.

79
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.220
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The last thing that I'll mention, right, the last thing that I'll mention is I got back into

80
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: the animal crossing a little bit with New Horizons, just after

81
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: the announcement came out was my annual Knook Miles day. This is a self-celebrated day that I go in and I

82
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:56.139
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: tried to just get as many Knook Miles as I can. Try not try. Yeah. Well, here's the thing. I think I started this little

83
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: The timing was incredible. I don't know how they must know.

84
00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:05.740
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: tradition of mine because they announced a big like update, not 2.0, but something I'd have to go back and look at what

85
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:13.540
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I think it must have been 2.0 because they released all the updates in the course of that

86
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: what was coming out four years ago.

88
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.579

181
00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:02.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: because I -- you know, everybody's got one, I've got one.

182
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:09.700
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm going to play my Switch 1 games on the Switch 2, because it will be -- they'll run better,

183
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:15.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: right? Just -- just naturally. But also, I am not -- I'm not at all.

184
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:22.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Everybody, I don't have seven Switch consoles. I was still playing on my Day 1 Switch.

185
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:28.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I never got an OLED. I never got a light. So it was really time for an upgrade,

186
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: just because, like, physically my console was beat up.

187
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, yeah.

188
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It was not a good spot. So I got the new console, yeah.

189
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Eight years is a long time.

190
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I got the new console and I'm very happy to play that.

191
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I was like, if these games are going to be 70 or 80 dollars,

192
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like if you're getting a switch to addition, like that's still an increased price as well.

193
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:57.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So I was like, I think I'm just going to rely on my birthday to get a game on the holidays to get a game.

194
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And then I am, you know, I work in a public library that's lucky enough to get video

195
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:26.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: games. If there's anything really new that I can wait for, then I'll get that for free. And I'll play the library copies of games. But in the meantime, I've got all these other games to play. So that's why I decided to not get Pokémon on release. I just put it on my wish list to get in December. And that is when I'll play it. I'll probably play it like maybe January 1st, you know, or something like that. I don't know.

196
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But that's that's what's behind the decision so I'm sure you've talked about it

197
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: before but how is it what do you know how do I do I do

198
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:42.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Um, so I mean, I will say that I mostly really like this game. Um, I, so I mean,

199
00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:51.299
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I've talked before many a time that like, I'm sure I would enjoy better graphics.

200
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.179
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I'm sure that, you know, I will, you know, it's, it's the sort of thing that you

201
00:14:56.179 --> 00:15:00.580
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: don't really know what you've got until you've got it, right? Like if I, if breath of the

202
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.179
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: wild had worse graphics, I don't think I would have enjoyed it less, but it's not the

203
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.179
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: thing is like opening the game, going, oh, my word, this is gorgeous, right? Like I

204
00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:13.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: don't open this game and go, this is gorgeous, but I also don't spend my time playing

205
00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:18.620
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it going, oh, I hate how this game looks, looks dreadful, right? Like I don't, I just

206
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.620
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: don't, I don't naturally do that. And that's not to say that anyone else's is worse

207
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.100
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: for having done that. Like that, that is totally fine. And I, um, I don't need people

208
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: to be going like, oh, we need to expect more for our games. I like the game. I like the

209
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: game play.

210
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:51.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't feel like I am missing out and I definitely feel like it has been worth the

211
00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:56.919
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: money that I have spent to get this game.

212
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.379
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Cool, yeah, I am, oh, good.

213
00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:01.519
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: There are a few things that I really miss that they didn't add into this game that they

214
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:05.360
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: did have in Legends Arcius. I'm very sad about that.

215
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:15.100
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But they have copied over the core gameplay from that that I really enjoyed.

216
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.299
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It is more battle focused, which obviously a lot of people were expecting.

217
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:26.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Therefore, I would not enjoy it as much. But the way that they have integrated the battles

218
00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:33.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: into the overworld is much better than Legends Arcius did, right?

219
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay

220
00:16:33.899 --> 00:16:35.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So if you were in Legends Arches.

221
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:48.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: You went into a battle. It was like, okay, now we're going to pretend like we're still in the overworld. We're going to pretend like it's smooth and seamless and now we're going to like do all these animations and you're suddenly in a battle and know it's completely different, right?

222
00:16:48.500 --> 00:17:03.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I didn't particularly like that, but I really love how it's like, oh, if you can't catch this book, I'm on literally just tell your Pokémon to attack it and now you can try and catch it again and it's lower health in the exact same way you would be, right?

223
00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:04.900
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: where it was Legend's arcius.

224
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:12.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: You go into a battle with a Pokemon, you then were into the old way of catching Pokemon, which I did not like as much, right?

225
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, really. I think I knew that. Yeah.

226
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh, yeah.

227
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So, yeah, I think they've integrated battling really well, I think it's an upgrade from...

228
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:34.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It feels like they've combined the catching in the overworld from Legend's arcius and the let's go mechanic from Scarlet and Violet into a much better...

229
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:52.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, it really does feel in more ways than in the past because they're always iterating and building off of what came before, but it feels like they are really using the legends games to build out a new experience.

230
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: experience overall for both of them.

231
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Mm-hmm

232
00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:04.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: To make you, quote, feel like a Pokemon trainer, Legends Arceus, they obviously put a lot of development and time into making catching feel really good.

233
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:18.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Because I think at the end of the day, especially with Pokemon goes influence, there really is a desire to make that core mechanic of catching Pokemon fun and addicting and satisfying.

234
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:34.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And, you know, we both played Arceus that is so, it's just a joy to just throw the balls and catch Pokemon and stuff. So then they sat down for this one and say, "Okay, for this next one, let's cross out the next thing."

235
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Mm-hmm

236
00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:28.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Mm-hmm

237
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Which is the battling and kind of work that from the ground up and make that seem like you, quote, "feeling like a Pokemon trainer."

238
00:18:43.000 --> 00:19:03.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, my mind next goes to, "Okay, so for Legends, for Legends 3, what's the next thing?" I'm like, "Oh, sure, sure, sure. For the follow-up to ZA, I think maybe you rework trading.

239
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.380
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, I'd say legends four. I would argue

240
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:28.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The social aspect of Pokemon, maybe, I don't know, I don't really know how you would re-invigorate that idea, but maybe exploring ways to tweak that or make that more fun or make that more engaging. Beyond, people trying to finish their Pokedexes in the first two weeks of release and then not doing that.

241
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, yeah. I think, I mean, the kinder did that with Sword and Shield and then Scarlet

242
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:40.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: and Violet, right, with the raids. And that has given a lot more life to the games between

243
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, that's true.

244
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:47.099
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: the releases, although really struggling to find the time to do the Scarlet and Violet

245
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.119
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, yeah, you're really right there.

246
00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:54.299
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: raids that they're still doing now for some reason. I think what's going to be really interesting

247
00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:56.299
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: is what from the...

248
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.279
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: this game goes into Gen 10, because I really struggled with the jump from

249
00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:08.799
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Legends Arceus to Scarlet and Violet with catching.

250
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.480
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But yeah, it was like putting on the breaks of your bike.

251
00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:15.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Exactly. And I felt that a few times with games, right? Like I felt it with

252
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.240
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And I'm pleased.

253
00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:20.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Sun and Moon when we didn't get soaring from Uras. I thought that was a real

254
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: - Sure, yeah.

255
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:28.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: downgrade, not getting that. And obviously like in most of the game

256
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.400
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: since then we have had something like that. I obviously not in this one, just

257
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:40.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: baffles me. So I wonder what they're going to do. Are they going to go back to

258
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.480
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: traditional catching? Are they going to do...? In counter Pokemon going to

259
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.799
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: into different state battle and catch the Pokemon? Or are they going to

260
00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:56.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Take this mechanic out of the Legends games.

261
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:19.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: If you will and put it into the next big game because obviously they're all main series, we don't need to have that discussion, it doesn't matter, but obviously new generation games with brand new Pokémon with a big decks, they're the ones that sell the most and have always been and will always be.

262
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: No, I'm not interested in that conversation.

263
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yep. Yeah.

264
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Because that's what the majority of casual Pokémon players care about. We are not casual Pokémon players, right?

265
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:36.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Those who buy every game, those who play every game for at least tens of hours, if not hundreds of hours, right? Like we were looking at the the the the new.

266
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:53.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Switch shop store, that's why I keep thinking shop because eShop, you know, it's called switch store for some reason, the new switch store app, which actually finally gives you the full playtime and breakdown of your playtime and half of my top 10 or Pokémon games.

267
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah

268
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Um, so we're not.

269
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:25.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: We're not the casuals, uh, but they are the people the Pokemon need to keep buying the game and the question is, oh, do they risk that do they risk doing something that hasn't been in one of those new generation games before and risk the possibility that upsets people and make means they don't buy the game or do they annoy the core fans who love this way of playing and.

270
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't really don't want it to not be in the next game. I don't, I mean, I'm sure that are other people who would prefer that right like I do.

271
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:47.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I remember discussions of let's go where people hated the Pokemon in the overworld and wanted random encounters back some people cared about that and but I like there were some of us who are very much pro that idea.

272
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, that's it.

273
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah.

274
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:56.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And clearly that won one out right like I don't think Sword and Shield was the last game that didn't have all the Pokemon in the overworld. They did have some, but not all.

275
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, that's what I was going to bring up

276
00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.220
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: is that there's an approach to this scenario

277
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.559
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: that you're describing that we can look

278
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.740
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: to a Sword and Shield for, which was,

279
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.900
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and it's too bad we didn't get this right away

280
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.980
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: with Scarlet and Violet.

281
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.140
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Everybody liked, well, not everybody, but as you said,

282
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.980
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: but many people liked the Pokemon in the overworld

283
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.099
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: that let's go introduced,

284
00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:20.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and we were curious if Sword and Shield

285
00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:23.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: would keep that over, and they did both.

286
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: They let you--

287
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:48.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that if-- because I don't think that the turn-based thing is going to go away. I think for the sake of competitive-- and that's a whole other conversation. I think for the sake of competitive, we're going to retain the turn-based stuff.

288
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.900
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but doesn't Pokemon champions allow them

289
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:55.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Again, that's a whole other discussion.

290
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.259
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: to keep that out of the main game?

291
00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:02.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that there will--

292
00:23:56.259 --> 00:24:00.400
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I just can't see that the coincidence

293
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.900
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: of that game coming out this year, in the next year, right?

294
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.220
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like, it's not coming out a couple of years ago,

296
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.579
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it's not coming out in a couple of years,

297
00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:11.140
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it's coming out now at the time,

298
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.980
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: just before the next generation of games,

299
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.859
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: which is almost certainly coming next year.

300
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:19.299
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, you're right. You're right, but what I'm getting at is that maybe in Gen 10

301
00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:25.700
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: There will be an option to throw the Pokeball yourself or to engage in a

302
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.059
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Turn-based traditional battle where you can just click the button to throw the ball

303
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.019
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Kind of like how legends are kissed I guess you could do where you encountered the Pokemon

304
00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:36.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes, very similar to Legends Arcius

305
00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:37.900
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, maybe I'd be okay with that

306
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.859
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I mean personally, I love what they've done with this game, and I would be sad if they they went backwards to kind of what legends are

307
00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.059
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah

308
00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:45.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Arceus had

309
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:53.259
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But I would much prefer that to house garland violet did it right like I like the let's go modern scarlet and violet. I like this more

310
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay cool

311
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.940
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Hmm so many thoughts

312
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:05.119
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, I'm sure I mean what are we at where we were half an hour into this podcast and we haven't started the podcast yet

313
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:14.099
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: You know, we're three weeks after a Pokemon game release of course we're gonna be talking with that

314
00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:09.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I have a feeling that happens a lot

315
00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:17.740
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: All right. Okay. Well, that's what we've been up to

316
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.700
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: We'll probably chapped to that Pokemon section

317
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.579
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Let's talk about some feedback. We've got two feedbacks first of all

318
00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:30.220
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: We have a comment on Spotify from ours.

319
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I'm a regular Spotify commenter, Jack. Thank you, Jack, for your comment.

320
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Jack says, "Nice podcast peeps."

321
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: This is a comment on the harvest moon.

322
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:49.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No, it was the other games of the years where Cody and Kev went back before the podcast

323
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:57.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: and chose a game of the year, a farming game of the year for every year before the podcast.

324
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Back to when the first harvest moon came out.

325
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:07.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So, Jack says, "Hody chose correctly between harvest moon 64 and back to nature.

326
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:16.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: By the way, the game in harvest moon for girl, I believe that the game ends if you get pregnant/have a baby, but the boy version doesn't if you get married."

327
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So, whoa.

328
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:29.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Just so, you know, clearly back then they decided that a woman's ultimate goal is pregnancy and then she may as well we did.

329
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:46.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughter]

330
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:37.019
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I don't even know if I want to touch this one.

331
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, that's what are you going to do, right? Like,

332
00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:50.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: that's just the way the world works out.

333
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's not 30 years any go. I'll go anymore.

334
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay, so I will say about that is that I found your speed run tactic.

335
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't know if that's it's certainly nowhere near some of the other speedruns that some of the other games had like

336
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Harvest Harvest Moon a wonderful life for example where you can just say no to going to the farm and then the credit roll

337
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Oh

338
00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:18.240
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: There was another one that was mentioned. I think in that podcast, but I can't remember what it was

339
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.559
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But yeah, there's a few games that had funny funny endings like that

340
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.200
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: The other piece of feedback is our self piece of feedback

341
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.200
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I had said in the last episode

342
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:43.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: that I saw people talking about the fact that crafting would use the house storage, but I had no evidence for that and I was no idea where people were getting from turns out

343
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: you got it from the news section on the eShop where it talks about the update. It specifically says

344
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:58.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: you can now make sure to work of crafting by crafting items in batches and pulling materials directly from your storage.

345
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Oh, man

346
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So we have confirmation that it does use your storage for crafting.

347
00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:08.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: What a dream come true. I just man that's so awesome

348
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.200
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It only took five and a half years to get this feature.

349
00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:16.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That's exactly what I was thinking and I wasn't gonna say it, but like like okay

350
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:22.259
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You said this last week. There's there's clearly a design philosophy

351
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:28.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: With making people grab it out of their storage making one at a time running out

352
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:36.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Things in your pocket going back in pulling it out from storage again like somebody or many people on the team wanted that

353
00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Very intentional action of doing it. Maybe that like

354
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah

355
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Did they quit?

356
00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:49.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Ferthers the roleplay like it. It maybe it furthers the roleplay of of being out on your own and everything cuz I don't know cuz

357
00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:47.799
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah

358
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:57.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The I feel like the the first month of you being it or maybe even the first week of you being on the island

359
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Is where people were really excited about this crafting stuff?

360
00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:08.259
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But by the time that you have it just looking like any other community in animal crossing

361
00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:13.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It's it's your your dough with it. You're like, okay. I don't need to do this anymore

362
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:23.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, so here's my theory is that this is an upgrade that you purchase because that would allow

363
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.140
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, what can I

364
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.700
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay, yeah, that makes up

365
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.640
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: them to still have that early game experience where you're still crafting things one by one and

366
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Oh, yeah, totally.

367
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.799
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: grabbing things at the storage. But this is like Tom comes to you and he's like, Oh, we've got another

368
00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:38.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: upgrade for your house. We can do we can link it to your crafting table and that allows you to

369
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: multi-craft and get stuff out your story Jotamat.

370
00:29:41.000 --> 00:30:04.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I've got so much to do to get back to a sensible star rating on my island because I found

371
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Watch them

372
00:29:47.099 --> 00:29:51.299
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Watch them lock that behind five star islands or something like that like

373
00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:55.859
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Time to throw out everything onto the lawn

374
00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:08.240
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it's the last episode I think I'd said I wasn't sure where my island was.

375
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.839
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It turns out it was on my switch too.

376
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:19.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: there you go yes would did it ask you um hey there's no profile attached to this island

377
00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:14.200
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: which is a very sensible place for it to be.

378
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: yeah and I i'd turn that on and I was like oh no

379
00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:26.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, media panic, but it was fine.

380
00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:36.220
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: yeah yeah yeah yeah yes right

381
00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:29.299
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's a thing you do whenever you transfer it between switches.

382
00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:31.700
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's just obviously presumably that was your first time doing it.

383
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.200
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: If this is your your your second switch console that you bought.

384
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.299
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But yeah, no, it's all there, it's all good,

385
00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:41.059
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but apparently.

386
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: When I last played the game, I was midway through a renovation.

387
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:58.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: What I had done was I had created a water island where everything was like, it was like an

388
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:05.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: atoll, right, where everything was around the edge and the middle was just water.

389
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And I'm like halfway through returning it to being land, which means that I've got these

390
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: like strips of...

391
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: ...and not watering between them all. So it's going to take no way to finish that up.

392
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:24.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Now we keep talking about animal crossing, when we have a whole section devoted to talking about animal crossing.

393
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.640
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, should we talk about some other game news then?

394
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes, I'm happy to do that.

395
00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:32.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So this is where we talk about all the games that Nami doesn't know

396
00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:41.160
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: First up, we have grimoire groves. They've announced that their console release is coming in Q1 next year

397
00:31:41.259 --> 00:31:45.720
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That is switch and Xbox and includes a physical switch version including

398
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.980
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: deluxe edition

399
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: that comes with as I zoom into this low quality

400
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:06.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: image. If the physical game, a pin set, stickers, an artbook, and the sound track on a CD.

401
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.240
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I love a good CD.

402
00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:16.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So I, I presume you have not played this game. I played this game and I was fine. It was not for me.

403
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yes. Yes.

404
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.799
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I like the color scheme. The the theming of it's very nice.

405
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, it's a roguelite, so that'll.

406
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.519
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Oh, well, they it seals the deal for you.

407
00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:33.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The one thing that I'll say here is that these are some nice-looking pins.

408
00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:39.799
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I did have a question. So this is a kickstarter, right? And this is the update

409
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah? Correct.

410
00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:46.839
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: talking about the physical game release. That's great. What? So you do a lot of kickstarters,

411
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.339
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Mm hmm.

412
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.440
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: at least maybe you slowed down recently. What do you think is the average timeline for

413
00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:00.599
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: these kickstarter games that come to Steam and then then finally get their console release.

414
00:33:00.599 --> 00:33:07.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Be it. I don't know. Be it PlayStation first or Nintendo first or wherever it sure.

415
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I mean, the average game doesn't come to any consoles, I would say.

416
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That's, that's, that's very valid.

417
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.160
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's years though, right?

418
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:18.799
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So let's take this one as an example.

419
00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:26.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Grimark roves it originally was with the campaign, that's what I'm looking for.

420
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Wars are widely removed the date on it.

421
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.279
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Let's say there was a date there, I need to go to, I know I can find this information

422
00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:40.839
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: somewhere without just scrolling through all the updates.

423
00:33:40.839 --> 00:33:46.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: At July 2023, so this game is actually a very quick game in doing what it's doing.

424
00:33:46.039 --> 00:33:47.119
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I'm very impressed with this.

425
00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:55.079
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So it kickstarted in July of 2023, it's estimated game release was April's 2024.

426
00:33:55.079 --> 00:34:01.480
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: The game actually came out early this year, so surprisingly quick, but obviously it's

427
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:03.839
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: - Wow, okay, that is a really fast turnaround.

428
00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:09.679
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: delayed, like every game, and now less than a year later they've got their, well, I guess

429
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.400
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it will be about a year later getting their Switch and Xbox.

430
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.519
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So that's very fast for these games.

431
00:34:15.519 --> 00:34:22.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Most of the games don't even come out in the first place.

432
00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:29.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And all of those that do, they come out on PC, like I would say maybe two to three years

433
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: late. That's pretty standard for these kickstart again.

434
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.320
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: they all undressed me how long it's going to be every single way.

435
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Almost every single one. There's maybe been two games that have kickstarted that have come out on time.

436
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, yeah, I get that.

437
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The big projects.

438
00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:52.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: The rest, I think two years, two to three years would probably be average for how late they come out.

439
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And then there's only been a handful that have ever come to consoles and it's maybe a year or two later.

440
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.320
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: because what they tend to do is like,

441
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:17.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: the game until we're finished on PC and then that means that the clock starts then and then they have to get a porting team to do it because of course they don't know how to make switch games, they don't know how to make PlayStation game. It's almost always switch right.

442
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.860
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Gotcha, okay, right the indie machine

443
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:29.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Exactly, exactly. Sometimes it's Xbox because if they've used the Microsoft development tools, it is a button press to release on Xbox.

444
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:44.099
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Great yeah, so is it pretty? Yeah, is it pretty common for games that use those tools to come out on both Xbox and Nintendo or

445
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: factory, three, who is also the director of Rinfactory four, and the person who wrote the narrative for both Rinfactory three and four.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Possibly, possibly. Yeah, I can see why somebody would prefer this, because like, when you go from Rinfactory four to Rinfactory five, it was such a big shift, right?

592
00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:34.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's, it's like, it's not, I was going to say it's like going from Sun and Moon to Sword and Shield, but it's not even that it's, I feel like it's going from

593
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:49.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: a gen five. So black and white. Yeah, no, no, no, gen five to gen eight. I feel like it's going from black and white to Sword and Shield. Like it's, it's a bigger jump.

00:46:54.699 --> 00:46:58.019

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, yeah. And the thing is that they're very fundamentally different styles of gameplay.

599
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, different design philosophies.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And not just that, but just in terms of actual gameplay as well, because it's interesting,

601
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: you chose that as an example, because I love 2D Sonic games and I hate 3D Sonic games.

602
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.639
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Mm-hmm.

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:33.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I personally, I'm not a huge fan of any of the Renfactory, so I'm probably not going to pick this one up.

607
00:47:34.639 --> 00:47:38.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But if you like your farming games, but you want them to have some swords,

608
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:45.119

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: top down farming or site not like 45 degree. I don't know. Is there a term for that? Because we've got top is not top down. It's not said on it's 45 degree

613
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. Um, there probably is. I can't think of it.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Ling between worlds wasn't 3DS, was it?

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: There's link to the past and link between worlds, which is the 3ds game. Anyway, that I'm going on a limb saying it was linked between worlds where they they put them out of an angle.

631
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So it is. Look, look, look, they keep making the puns.

00:49:19.639 --> 00:49:24.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Stop making the pun. I can't keep all these names in my head.

633
00:49:24.639 --> 00:49:26.519
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It doesn't help. I've not played this one.

00:49:26.619 --> 00:49:27.980
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right, it's on my list.

635
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh, it's on my list as well, but the problem was I was going through

636
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: the Zelda games in release order, and I got to Ocarina of time and when I hate this.

641
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh, sure. That's on my list to do at some point, but the problem is I just I stopped.

642
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So my next game is Oracle Seasons. It's there on my list to play.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's even on my switch. I have it on the, what's it called?

644
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Nintendo online subscription thing.

645
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:10.280
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: This is my call to action to people out there listening has anybody played those game world colors all the games

647
00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, people have played links are weakening all the live long day

648
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.260
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And there's like a fan base for minish cap on the Game Boy Advance

649
00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I I have not met one person who's like oh, I love Oracle of seasons and eighties

650
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:37.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's just on my list. I'll play them at some point, but I just need I still I'm still not over occurring of time. Okay, that that was I enjoyed Zelda 2 and I hated Ocarina of time.

651
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:40.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: that's too bad we do not have time to talk about this blast for me that is

652
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:53.980
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I, it's sure. Oh, sure. And would I have enjoyed it? How'd I played it at the time? Maybe, but it's like going back and playing Mario 64. They're not it's it's it's

653
00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:45.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: ocarina of time debacle because it's such a formative game for so many people

654
00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.980
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: games.

655
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:04.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And now you've made the Mario 64 people really mad.

656
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:01.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I've said this before and I will say it again Mario 64 is not a good game.

657
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:10.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It was historic and it was important and it needs to have its place and it should be celebrated for what it was.

658
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But do not go in if you've not played the game before.

659
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: You will not go into it and have a good time.

660
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's all I'm saying, right?

661
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And it's not even the controls.

662
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: or I think it's the controls.

663
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: controls are a bit finicky, right, but they're fine. It's the camera.

664
00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:26.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think it's the controls.

665
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:36.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No, it's the camera. We need it. We needed that second joystick before 3D games became actually good. That's that's all I'm

666
00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.219
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah.

667
00:51:28.519 --> 00:51:29.519
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay.

668
00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:30.360
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Anyways.

669
00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.440
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: [laughing]

670
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Oh yeah.

671
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.519
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Unless you're playing Banjo-Kazooie

672
00:51:37.519 --> 00:51:39.159
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: where they got the camera right.

673
00:51:39.159 --> 00:51:42.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That's the, if you're playing a 3D game on the N64,

674
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.599
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Banjo-Kazooie is the best use of the camera,

675
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:47.400
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like even besides Z targeting,

676
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: which I could even have timed it.

677
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:57.539
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah. No, my issue with Ocarina time was the platforming and the controls for combat.

678
00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:03.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Oh, yeah. I'll forgive you for that. You can get really good at the combat. You can't get really good at the jumping.

679
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:07.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It would like if I did you ever play Crash Bandicoot?

680
00:52:07.699 --> 00:52:08.860
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Uh, a couple times.

681
00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:12.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh my word, like I love that game when I was a kid.

682
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But I tried to go back to it and it's just horrible the platforming.

683
00:52:15.619 --> 00:52:23.139
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It's unforgiving. It is just, it's like, um, dragon's lair, where you just have to know.

684
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: and even then like you're gonna fail four times before you get it. Just dreadful.

685
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.800
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: 8-8-8-8. There are some games I can go back to and there are some games again.

686
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Again, when was the last time you went back to the first Pokemon game?

687
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:49.159
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Um, it's probably been like five years or so. I was probably like a year after they came out on 3DS

688
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: every time, every time I go back to them, I remember why I don't

689
00:52:50.119 --> 00:52:51.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: which is, yeah.

690
00:52:55.400 --> 00:53:00.760
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I, oh, okay. I remember when it was actually when I played stadium. It was five years ago. It was for the 25th

691
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:09.480
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: anniversary and I played on an OG Game Boy and I like going back to the old Pokemon games

692
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.480
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: because of...

693
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:27.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The nostalgia factor, specifically like sitting within the confines of 1998 with your Game Boy with the cables watching the anime, I like engrossing myself in that, but I mean, you can't go to the PC.

694
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yes.

695
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.880
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: just avoid that at all cost.

696
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No, it's, yeah, I hate them. So bad. I think that's the thing is I think that's

697
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.679
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: how these games still survive in public consciousness. It's because of the nostalgia.

698
00:53:39.639 --> 00:53:44.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And I do think that if I'd played them at the time, I would have enjoyed them, but it's not the same thing.

699
00:53:46.679 --> 00:53:53.159
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I mean, I had fun with Mario 64, but like it's, it's in my opinion, the worst of the three

700
00:53:53.159 --> 00:53:57.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: details. But just people

701
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:06.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: want to agree with me with the best, which is sunshine. I don't everybody marks sunshine as the worst. I think it's the best 3d Mario second best sorry Bowser's Fury's the best.

702
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:10.139
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, see, that's the thing is I have a better I have a better opinion of Sunshine now,

703
00:54:10.139 --> 00:54:15.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: but like the thing that you're talking about, which is the camera and the controls a little

704
00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:21.760
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: bit, that for me applies to Sunshine, like it really, I think because it seems like it

705
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.820
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: should control like Galaxy, it seems modern enough, but they were really still only just

706
00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:31.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: figuring out all of this stuff. Sunshine was like 2003.

707
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.659
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It was not long into all of this stuff.

708
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.679
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It doesn't, but this is the thing, it feels decades better than Mario 64 in my opinion.

709
00:54:39.179 --> 00:54:42.300
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, I mean, they made a lot of progress in that time.

710
00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:46.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like even just, even just the graphics, it feels like someone just turned on graphics between those two

711
00:54:43.659 --> 00:54:43.980
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah.

712
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Exactly. I know what you're talking about.

713
00:54:51.179 --> 00:54:55.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I don't know, especially when you were like, our first coming back to it after a while,

714
00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:59.820
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: you're like, oh man, I cannot control this. By the time you're like a couple hours into it,

715
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:05.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: but that's probably, yeah. Anyway.

716
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:09.320
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. Yes. Uh, yeah, this is not a Mario podcast. Uh,

717
00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The funny village, go play it if you like.

718
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:15.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: anyway, far near village, uh, there's a blur about, I'll, I'll quickly go through the

719
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:20.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: blurb, uh, a game shapes by the fantasy world you, you'd love to live in. You remember

720
00:55:20.039 --> 00:55:24.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: nothing but your own name and begin and have a new life in a peaceful village that is exactly

721
00:55:24.239 --> 00:55:31.320
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: how every room factory has started. Tell the soil, go fishing, cook, forge, fall in love,

722
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: explore the world and teach a mysterious girl what it means to enjoy a meal. That sounds

723
00:55:36.639 --> 00:55:47.099
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: weird. I don't know. That sounds really weird. I don't like any of that sentence. Ever

724
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.780
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Why is it in quotes?

725
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I don't know, okay.

726
00:55:47.099 --> 00:55:51.480
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: wish the world kept going after the story ends so you could live your daily life there.

727
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No worries. This is a game where you can continue your days in the world you've completed.

728
00:55:56.239 --> 00:56:02.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Um, I'm gonna say that probably, uh, this is like translated by either

729
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.519
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: people whose first language is Japanese or automatically translated and that explains kind

730
00:56:07.519 --> 00:56:12.599
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: of the some of the weirdness in the, the wording there. But basically what they've just described

731
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.440
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. Cool. Makes sense to me.

732
00:56:12.599 --> 00:56:20.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: there is rim factory. So kickstarters live if it sounds like what you want. If you want

733
00:56:20.239 --> 00:56:27.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: a new rim factory, that's not 3d. That, that's who you are. You know who you are. Next we have

734
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:32.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm going to say Delfinie.

735
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Delphinium or Delphinium, I'm undecided.

736
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:43.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yes, let's go with Delphinium, a farming sim in which cultivating connections with those around you matters just as much as growing crops sometimes even more so.

737
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I mean that sounds like stargy to me.

738
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well

739
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: One interesting choice of blurb.

740
00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:55.679
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: See the blurb sounds like stardew, but when you look at this trailer

741
00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:58.199
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I got to tell you out of all the games. We're talking about today

742
00:56:58.519 --> 00:57:01.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Maybe besides Animal Crossing. This is the most interesting to me

743
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:07.159
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I really like the art style that they're going for and the game structure of it

744
00:57:07.159 --> 00:57:10.599
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: They're really highlighting besides the farming. They're highlighting this

745
00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:17.119
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Conversation system that they've built and there's like skill trees, but there's people

746
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:24.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: on them and you know connecting concepts to relationships and goals to

747
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Concepts and it looks really interesting

748
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:34.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So I would say I agree with you and that it all looks very interesting, but it also looks like hell.

749
00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:39.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't want to play a game that does that, like I think it sounds like someone's gone,

750
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: [laughter]

751
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: here's a really interesting concept for the game, but not actually thought about whether it would be fun

752
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:50.739
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: to play or not. I don't know, I know people enjoy different things and maybe people will enjoy this,

753
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Sure. Yeah.

754
00:57:50.739 --> 00:57:55.940
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but it just feels like work to me, like we're doing this weird spreadsheet thing.

755
00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:02.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, I don't know, I think there is a fundamental like personality difference here is that

756
00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:10.639
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like I do like relationships in gaming and in real life and keeping things, I mean,

757
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:24.639
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: wow, harsh much. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I don't think it's the social aspect that I

758
00:58:10.639 --> 00:58:15.519
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm not saying that, but I don't know, I think it's fair to say that I'm a little more social than you

759
00:58:15.519 --> 00:58:20.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: are. And so making a game about social activity would be fun for me.

760
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The spreadsheet.

761
00:58:24.639 --> 00:58:31.119
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: dislike. It's the, yeah, it's, well, I mean, it's not obviously not especially as a graph,

762
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but it just feels like a fancy wheel making a spreadsheet, right? Like it's,

763
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't know, it's just maybe a part of the issue, I think, is that it feels more management game-y

764
00:58:44.239 --> 00:58:50.719
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: style-y, that aspect of it, rather than the rest of it, right? Which I've talked about never massively

765
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:57.300
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. And maybe we're talking about a fraction of what this game is. They really highlight this

766
00:58:50.719 --> 00:58:55.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: enjoying. Possibly.

767
00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:03.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: a lot in several moments in this trailer, but they're also showing your regular crops and fishing

768
00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:12.179
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: minigames and navigating the world map and all that. So there's a lot more going on, but it definitely

769
00:59:12.179 --> 00:59:15.940
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: seems like the major hook is this and they say it in the

770
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:23.699
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I'm glad you brought up the fishing game. I, fishing minigame. I, I like the look of this

771
00:59:23.699 --> 00:59:29.280
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: fishing minigame. It's very rare that we actually get a new concept for the fishing minigame.

772
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Uh-huh, it's different.

773
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.300
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: They're normally, they're normally like either it's the starchy way or it's the animal crossing

774
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.940
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: way and it's maybe slightly tweaked, but this looks very different.

775
00:59:38.500 --> 01:00:05.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, for people who haven't seen it, it looks kind of like an FPS a little bit, you've got the fish on this circle, and you've got a reticle, and you're trying to keep the fish inside of your reticle, which is a little bit like Stardew, but as opposed to that going up and down, this is kind of navigating across the disk.

776
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.900
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I feel like there's much more control over it than Stardew, which is why I like the look of it, right?

777
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:13.320
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Where it's Stardew is like you you have to press you it's one button press it's press press to raise it and if you raise it to high

778
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:19.800
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: You're probably lost fish whereas this is like you're you're constantly aiming to get to the fish

779
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:27.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And so if you make a wrong move you just like go back up and left you don't have to wait for it to come back down with gravity

780
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, yeah, lots of agency, but I mean, you know, we're talking about a fishing game

781
01:00:33.039 --> 01:00:35.900
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But it could be a lot of work. You got to be very involved with it

782
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:41.400
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You can't just wait for it your controller to rumble or for the thing to make a sound and hit the button

783
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But yeah, it does I I do see your point about it being a new take which is not common

784
01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.860
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And I do think I'm not I'm not against the animal crossing way of just wait until I'm impressed the

785
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:59.219
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: button. Um, I could think there are advantages of that because I think these mini games do get a bit

786
01:00:59.219 --> 01:01:05.059
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: boring after you've played a hundred hours of a game. Um, but, um, I think if you're going to do

787
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:09.480
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Uh-huh, right.

788
01:01:05.059 --> 01:01:10.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: something, do something, don't just be like, oh, we're going to do the starchy thing, right? Like

789
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:24.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: What I want is a way to ensure the least amount of failure is possible.

790
01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:15.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: that's been done. And it was fine, but like try something else or don't bother. I would

791
01:01:24.579 --> 01:01:29.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I really dislike when I throw my line, especially if I'm using bait,

792
01:01:29.039 --> 01:01:31.320
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: you know, a resource that I'm losing.

793
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:39.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And then I fail it and I have to like cast my line again that stuff is really discouraging to me when I'm wasting time or resources.

794
01:01:41.139 --> 01:01:51.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So if it's something that you can get good at that, you know, takes away a little bit for me, like in a good way, like I'm not as upset about it.

795
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.559
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I think I agree. If I fail because of my skill, I'm much more

796
01:01:59.039 --> 01:02:01.860
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Not happy because I'm obviously annoyed that I've mucked up

797
01:02:02.739 --> 01:02:07.780
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But I'm much much prefer that because it's like I mucked up rather than

798
01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.579
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: The game is just it feels like the game has ruined it for me sort of thing

799
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:20.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Especially when it comes down to like oh, I just hit the button too late or too early like that. It's like ah

800
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Exactly

801
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah

802
01:02:21.059 --> 01:02:23.699

816
01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.940
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but I'm not seeing here what it is also doing differently, right?

01:04:34.179 --> 01:04:35.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: as

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It's been in access for some time, but like the title peaceful days like

834
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:54.659
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Can you it's like typing in keyboard? Please tell me what to name my farming game that is cozy?

835
01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500

01:04:56.179 --> 01:05:04.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You should call it peaceful day. It's like I don't want to I'm gonna say it sounds like an AI title like what is why is it like that call it something?

837
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:12.079
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, yeah, I guess the problem then is you end up calling it like cheese farm village.

838
01:05:12.079 --> 01:05:18.139
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: You know, like you just end up with the the standard Stardew Valley style that everyone else names us.

839
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: What it's gonna be anyway

840
01:05:18.239 --> 01:05:19.940

841
01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:27.400
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Anyway, I think that's I think yeah, I think what we've said more on the game than we intended

842
01:05:21.019 --> 01:05:28.860
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Naming is hard. I get that.

843
01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.300
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, I will say one more thing. We'll do more.

844
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:40.400
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: One, it does have very positive on its reviews on steam. So there's something there. It's got steam DB rating of 78%.

845
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.699
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So it sounds like some people are at least enjoying it, which is good.

846
01:05:44.699 --> 01:05:54.800
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And I think this fell into the 2020 bucket of Stardew clones that everybody was doing, right?

847
01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:01.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like three years after Stardew came out for years after Stardew came out, but three years after we got.

848
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:13.300
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Big, right? Like it really got big in 2017 was the time when everyone was releasing their their Stardew clones, because it takes a few years to get to that point, right?

849
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:30.800
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And this is clearly one developer doing this. And so I think it's just fallen into that box of hey, Stardew clone, where does now we're generally getting games that are trying to do a bit more because they realize that you can't just do a Stardew clone.

850
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: They're doing "Start to Clone" and...

851
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:52.719
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yes, whereas this is just he's finished off his Stardew clone now, which he released five years ago on the third of February 2020, one amazing time to release that that was two weeks before Animal Crossing New Horizons and the world shut down.

852
01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:37.199
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right.

853
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

855
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:15.360
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And now me a little bit about his thoughts on the Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 update and switch to edition. So I don't know where do you want to start what your thoughts.

856
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:21.739
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Let's see, there was just so much stuff that it was 15 minutes long and it talked about the

01:07:21.739 --> 01:07:30.780
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: switch to addition and it talked about all of the things in the update. Yeah, probably.

858
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Let's start with a Switch 2 edition then. Are you gonna buy it?

859
01:07:32.059 --> 01:07:39.900
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The price makes it really easy to like the $5 was a real pleasant surprise. Normally when they're

860
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:45.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like we're not going to tell you the price because we're a little worried about it.

861
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.539
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughs]

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But they didn't and you look it up and you're like, Oh, it's only $5. It makes sense because you're

863
01:07:51.820 --> 01:08:00.780
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: not getting a frame rate boost. You're not getting a ton of stuff that 3.0 is providing. The biggest

864
01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:08.059
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: question that this podcast has asked that other people in the community have asked is why didn't

865
01:08:08.059 --> 01:08:17.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: they just put all of this stuff into a switch to addition and then, you know, make it

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: $15 or $10 or whatever. I guess some people included myself have just concluded that this is

867
01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:31.260
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: for the sake of the community because it is a community driven game, people play it. If they're not

868
01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:36.939
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: playing it at the same time, like, you know, 12 players would want, they are playing it at

869
01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:45.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: conjunction with each other, like side by side. Um, so yeah,

870
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:51.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm probably going to just pick it up. I'll put a fiber down for it. Um, the, you're getting the

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: resolution, which is nice. What I'm most excited with the switch to addition specifically is the mouse

872
01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: mode. I think.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: interesting. Tell me, tell me why, because I'm never going to use it. I'm paying for the resolution

874
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:09.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: because I'm always going to, if you give me an update for a game that costs five dollars and

875
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:15.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: increases the resolution, I'm buying it any day. Right. So I won't use the other features, but I want

876
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, yeah

880
01:09:33.239 --> 01:09:38.159
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: but going through the motions of putting all that stuff on the walls or on the floor I find

881
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: what's the word tedious

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So I see mouse mode. I see that you can highlight a bunch of stuff. You can move everything around you can pull things out of the storage pretty easily

883
01:09:53.199 --> 01:10:02.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That seems to take away the tedium that is tied to go over here on the grid click the button pick it up go over here on the grid

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Taking a lot of the button presses away which is taking a lot of the time away

01:10:20.039 --> 01:10:23.439
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Swish around and go boom, boom, boom, boom, and here's my nice room

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Interior design myself, but at least putting my thought into the screen will will be faster

892
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: end and

893
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: more convenient than going through a bunch of menus by button press

894
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.560
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Okay, interesting, fair enough.

895
01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:57.520
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, I mean it also applies to the overworld and there's a lot with the overworld that would be really nice to

896
01:10:58.439 --> 01:11:00.439
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Not have to go up with

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like I don't know to the extent of what the mouse mode will help with because like for instance

898
01:11:07.319 --> 01:11:12.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm sure they'll want you to manually shovel everything still like if I'm picking up a flower or or or things

899
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.880
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like that, but anything that can take away these tedious

900
01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Do it over and over and over again stuff is

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Motivating to me because I mean we talked about that with the crafting we'll talk about that again probably

902
01:11:27.479 --> 01:11:34.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like the bulk crafting and all that is like such a game-changer in terms of respecting the player's time and

903
01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.560
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm hoping that the mouse mode will also contribute to that idea of respecting the players to

904
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, okay, fair enough. I guess my thing about most mode is I

905
01:11:46.479 --> 01:11:48.479
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: The switch to me is

906
01:11:49.319 --> 01:11:56.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Handheld or TV device. I don't really think of it as being anything other than that and in those situations the last

907
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:06.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I suppose, I have, you know, a coffee table in front of my couch, so when I have done mouse stuff,

908
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:14.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like I got welcome tour and I had fun with those mouse mini games. It was not difficult for me to

909
01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:23.600
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: just slap my Joy-Con 2 down and do the mouse stuff. It is a bit of a commitment, right?

910
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: If you're playing at handheld and I do play handheld, 50% of the time.

911
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:41.239
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It's not very easy to just like, "Okay, now I've got to go to a table. I've got to put my tablet down for me to look at. I've got to put the controller on the table."

912
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But when I'm playing Animal Crossing, I don't know, I'm not opening it up for 15 minutes.

913
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:58.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like, ideally I am sitting down or lying down or whatever. Like, locked in for 30 minutes.

914
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:08.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, I don't know. Certainly, I'm not going to be starting a big interior design project when I'm on the bus.

915
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, okay

917
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:18.819
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's not what I'm doing at all. It's, yeah, it's more just like trying to understand,

918
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, certainly, yeah. We're just bouncing.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: because like I, I still haven't played Drag X Drive, which is like the wheelchair basketball game,

920
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.760

01:13:32.899 --> 01:13:38.340
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: no, I'm going into mouse mode. You know, like it just, I feel like I need to be at my desk in front of

923
01:13:33.359 --> 01:13:41.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right.

924
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:43.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: my monitor doing that. I don't want to do it on a coffee table on the sofa. I don't want to do it on the arms of

925
01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: my sofa. I don't like, I want to be doing it on a on my desk at my monitor. And I don't game like that.

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, that's fine.

927
01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, Dragon Drive, I was gonna get that

01:14:00.199 --> 01:14:03.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I heard like I, the reviews actually kept me away from it

931
01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.600
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: 'cause people were like, it's just this.

932
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:14.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I mean that's kind of reflected in the price though, right? Like I it's kind of why I expected I

933
01:14:08.039 --> 01:14:13.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: There's no like, purse, yeah.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Is really bad. I've actually bought the game. I've just not played it because I was like

936
01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.300
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I want to support this

937
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:27.220
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: In principle even if I've not played it. Yeah, I want to be like, yes, please do more stuff like this

938
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.199
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: right yeah well that's kind of it for switch to addition but I mean the bulk of

939

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, go for it. So I guess the the big thing is the resort hotel, right? Like that's what they're they're the content update. I guess most of the stuff is other than this most of the stuff is either, you know, quality of life improvements or new furniture.

942
01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:59.439
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So, um, what do you think about the resort hotel? You're going to be going in there and designing all the, the rooms.

943
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:04.659
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I honestly know I'm probably going to do the tutorial and then never go in there again.

944
01:15:04.659 --> 01:15:08.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Which I know is funny because I just talked about how I'm excited to use the mouse to decorate

945
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: stuff.

946
01:15:09.819 --> 01:15:19.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I'm just so confused why they did this when that was the entire, like DLC was making

947
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: rooms according to the missions that people give you.

948
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.260
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: They just did that twice.

949
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's happy. Happy hotel designer

950
01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:28.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And yeah, but we already had it.

951
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:33.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: We have island designer. I just, it's so weird to me that they did the same thing twice.

952
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:38.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So they're like, do you like happy home designer? Great. Do you like happy home designer? Again?

953
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I guess, are you going to make me pay for it? No.

954
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:49.460
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: to be fair to be totally fair animal crossing people do like happy home designer, and yes,

955
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You already paid for the other one.

956
01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:54.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: they would like happy home designer again, please and thank you.

957
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:19.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But the weird thing to me is, I mean, okay, there's some holes in my animal crossing as there is for a few people that came back with new horizons, but happy home designer is a standalone 3DS game. Is that right? Okay, and then is there any aspect of happy home designer in new leaf? I don't know, I don't think so, but, yeah.

958
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: We need Kevin for that I think!

959
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, I'm just going to

960
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:30.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: to go to the Google really something really fast. But happy home designer is not a best-selling animal crossing game. It is not a multi-million-million-dollar game.

961
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No. No, okay, so I don't think they're doing it because happy home designer. I think they're

962
01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:40.840
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: doing it because Animal Crossing people like designing things, right? And this is a way

963
01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:49.479
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: much like with the the new slumber island, it's a way for Animal Crossing people to design more

964
01:16:49.479 --> 01:16:56.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: stuff without getting rid of their existing stuff. And so I don't know, maybe it's too simple to just

965
01:16:57.239 --> 01:17:05.079
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: again, but like if we know Animal Crossing people like designing things and here's a bunch of

966
01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:08.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: stuff for you to design stuff. How about more stuff to design stuff?

967
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.720
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: it's so weird to me that they just did the same thing twice. I just don't, I don't get it.

968
01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:23.239
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I don't know, maybe this is, you know, weird and it's against the idea of making it free,

969
01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:30.119
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: because if the thing is like, okay, we made the DLC free and I don't know, the weird thing for me

970
01:17:30.119 --> 01:17:34.840
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: is that the DLC has always kind of been shuffled under the rug. Like if you're a

971
01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.840
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Nintendo Switch online subscriber, you just get it for free, so you don't have to pay for it.

972
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:46.680
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Um, which can make it for subscribers easy to forget about. Um, and then here you are with this,

973
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: which is I, maybe there's differences, but it seems to me effectively the same thing

974
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.439
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and it's free now and it's on the island. You don't need to fly anywhere. You don't need to like

975
01:17:56.439 --> 01:18:00.680
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: wait for that loading screen. I don't know. It's just, it's just strange.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it almost feels like the hotel should have been what the DLC was and then the DLC should have been

977
01:18:07.399 --> 01:18:14.199
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: other islands to design on like what they ended up making a slumber island like just

978
01:18:15.079 --> 01:18:19.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: here are islands that you have to design for people rather than just houses at a

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:29.739
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, whatever, but by the way, new leaf on 3DS sold 13 million copies and happy home designer sold three million copies. So

01:18:39.859 --> 01:18:44.699
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It is 23% of the audience from new leaf picked up. Yeah

984
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I know and also like yes happy home designer wasn't a DLC for new leaf, but it may as well have been

990
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.680
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: - Yeah, really.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like I just feel like Nintendo wasn't really in the DLC mood at that point, right?

992
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.720
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: like that wasn't a thing that they had really done. They didn't really do DLC

993
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.279
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: until I guess they did it on the Wii U with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe but like handheld they didn't really do it till this switch.

<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: In their younger days, remember to recetti as like one of the more iconic animal crossing characters

1008
01:20:16.619 --> 01:20:18.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So getting him back in this nice

1010
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:23.840
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But dream world dream world. I like dream world is really exciting to me

1011
01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.140
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yep, I agree.

1012
01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:31.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The thing about it is I have all like many times considered

1013
01:20:31.899 --> 01:20:33.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Let's just make a new

1014
01:20:33.899 --> 01:20:38.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Island a new starting point. Let's just start the game over. We'll craft from scratch

1015
01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:41.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I've never done it because I put so much work

1016
01:20:42.579 --> 01:20:46.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Into my original island, so I don't want to I don't want to like that slate

1017
01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.479
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, being able to just.

1018
01:20:49.500 --> 01:21:04.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: kind of relive. Those early days and being excited about what you're going to do with the space and being able to use all your items, but if you want to, you can just, you know, pretend like it's a brand new save file. I that's that's cool.

1019
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:17.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: One thing that I wish you could do is I wish you could the game would track your villagers that have lived on your island from day one to now. And then.

1020
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:20.979
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And then you could invite them to your your dream islands. Yeah, that'd be cool. That'd be cool

1021
01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes.

1022
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:47.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right. Like the, you still have the max of like seven or however many it is, but like you could have completely different villagers on your cannon island. And then a different batch on your first island and then a different batch on your second. You still have to collect them all naturally through the campground and stuff. But if you, if it could remember everybody, then that would be, that would be fun for me.

1023
01:21:23.939 --> 01:21:25.939
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah

1024
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.840
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, that would also be nice for when like because this is this is it would work

1025
01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:58.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Thematically right because it's like this is a dream. This isn't real and so you're essentially dreaming up

1026
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah.

1027
01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.380
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh, I remember this person

1028
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.939
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Let me bring them to my dream island

1029
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Mm-hmm.

1030
01:22:01.939 --> 01:22:07.699
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It would also mean that like because we are going to come there's gonna be a lot of heartbroken people very soon when they log into their games

1031
01:22:07.699 --> 01:22:13.699
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And realize they've lost a villager because that happens right if you've not played the game for a certain amount of time

1032
01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:17.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: There is a chance that one of your relatives moves out without talking to you.

1033
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:26.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And that is heartbreaking for some people, and so giving you the ability to be like, "Oh yeah, well you can get the memory of that villager onto one of your dream islands."

1034
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:33.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, I so I don't think that there's really anything to suggest that you can do that, but it would be cool if you could

1035
01:22:35.979 --> 01:22:42.680
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Before I talk about the Nintendo consoles will just touch on the Lego collaboration the Zelda the Splatoon

1036
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that's all cool. Um, I think it's a

1037
01:22:49.399 --> 01:22:56.060
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Little worrying to me that this Zelda and Splatoon stuff are tied behind a mebo just because I

1038
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Some Zelda amiibo

1039
01:22:59.819 --> 01:23:01.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Am I gonna get

1040
01:23:01.819 --> 01:23:12.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Everybody that I want with with the fu Zelda amiibo that I have or is one piece of an outfit lost to me forever because I don't have the

1041
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The moblin amiibo, you know what I mean? Like

1042
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.600
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, that's fair. I would say I would never recommend that people pirate amiibo's, right?

1043
01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That would obviously be not something that I would ever recommend that that would obviously be very, very wrong,

1044
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:33.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: No, that's frankly anti corporation now. I'm surprised that you didn't even say something like

1045
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.399
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but it's something that people can and probably will do.

1046
01:23:34.399 --> 01:23:40.720
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I'm not saying I'm saying, I'm saying I would never tell people to do that. I would never

1047
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah.

1048
01:23:40.579 --> 01:23:41.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah.

1049
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:46.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: reveal people to Google how to create fake amiibo that would be bad. Like, uh,

1050
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.720
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I wouldn't tell them that there are very easy tutorials to find how to do that on the internet.

1051
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:56.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And if you don't want to be able to do that, if you don't have a device that would let you

1052
01:23:56.319 --> 01:24:04.720
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: write NFC tags, then I would not tell them that it on Etsy, you can buy batches of loads of them

1053
01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.560
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: for 10 quid. I would not tell people that.

1054
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:11.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, be that as it may.

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No, I think your point is still totally valid because that is tech.

1057
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:28.640
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So it's a totally fair point like locking the stuff behind me will not amazing having said that it is just cosmetic stuff

1058
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:25.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right, nobody.

1059
01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:33.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm like, unless you want the bird, you know, unless you want tooling,

1060
01:24:32.319 --> 01:24:34.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Sure, yeah

01:24:36.899 --> 01:24:45.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Again, you've you've talked about other strategies, but am I gonna have to go out and spend $35 on a tool in amoebo to get the bird in my game?

1063
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:54.479
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Will yeah, that is silly will you be able to treat will you be able to treat these villages like the others where if they're leaving someone's island you can go and steal them

1064
01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like that's that's what's silly.

1065
01:24:48.699 --> 01:24:50.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That's really silly.

1066
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.399
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: maybe, probably, probably. It's a little bit of, you know, again, a little bit of work,

1067
01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.600
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's another way then

1068
01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It is a little bit work, but it does mean it yeah

1069
01:25:03.279 --> 01:25:08.640
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: but it's a way to do it for free, because then you can just scan them again and then get them,

1070
01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Exactly, you just need one friend who has it and they can they can they can

1071
01:25:11.199 --> 01:25:18.239
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: yeah, coordinate. So sure, yeah, that's fine. I'm also curious if there are going to be other

1072
01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:25.439
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: villagers. They only confirmed Tulin, and I'm sorry. I want to say pneumonia, but that's not even

1073
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:35.199
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: minura. So they've confirmed those two, but Kevin is right that there have been other

1074
01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:40.640
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: characters from New Leaf based on animals that you could do. I wonder if they just haven't

1075
01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like confirmed them and they are coming.

1076
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.939
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't know. It seems weird because it's like the way they talked about it didn't like if there had been more. I would have expected that

1077
01:25:50.819 --> 01:25:56.939
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And more or a dot dot dot or something like that. It didn't hint at there being more than just the two

1078
01:25:52.500 --> 01:26:04.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: right? Sure. Yeah. Okay. So they've done wolf link, right? Uh, because like, okay,

1079
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Okay, I'll take your word for it

1080
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:12.840
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: link was a wolf, we can go. Okay. They have that he was a new leaf. Um, where, if you

1081
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Okay, it sounded like a question, but that's fine

1082
01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:18.520
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: haven't like played any tears with the kingdom, then skip ahead, like two minutes or whatever.

1083
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:26.100
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Are we spiraling tears of the kingdom here yeah yeah yeah okay so what wait what

1084
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.439
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Zelda's, yes, yeah, we are. We are. Zelda's a drag.

1085
01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:32.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And in tears of the kingdom. That's what I'm wondering. That's my question to you. Is there, yeah,

1086
01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:32.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: animal would that map turn animal crossing let me get a list up of all the

1087
01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:41.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: because we could get Zelda in this, in this game, if we are just a little creative.

1088
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.060
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Okay, so this alligator, it's my first thought.

1089
01:26:45.399 --> 01:26:49.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Although I don't think the alligators are in New Horizons.

1090
01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Are they?

1091
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: mmm I feel like they might be because I haven't seen anything

1092
01:26:55.239 --> 01:26:59.439
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Alligator, alligator definitely looks like the default

1093
01:26:59.439 --> 01:27:04.079
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: that it would be because there apparently is one villager

1094
01:27:04.079 --> 01:27:07.539
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: called Drago, who is an alligator,

1095
01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.140
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Uh-huh.

1096
01:27:07.539 --> 01:27:10.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but is obviously clearly a dragon.

1097
01:27:10.039 --> 01:27:13.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: A drag? Okay, let me look up with what draggo looks like.

1098
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:26.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And I is in New Horizons, my bad. Both. Yeah, both the alligators and dragon himself.

1099
01:27:13.979 --> 01:27:15.260
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That's a good idea.

1100
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:21.659
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay, see, I feel like they have everybody in New Horizons.

1101
01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.939
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes, oh, he totally looks like a dragon.

1102
01:27:29.819 --> 01:27:32.140
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: He looks like a Chinese dragon, but still.

1103
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I don't need to go any further, because the fact that they have a dragon as an alligator,

1104
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And...

1105
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yep.

1106
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.399
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: that would be the one they would do. They wouldn't do a different way.

1107
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, so I'm wondering...

1108
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: We have the technology. We can put Zelda in here.

1109
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.340
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughing]

1110
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That'd be cool.

1111
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:50.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yep.

1112
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So anyway, that's my thoughts about that. Splatoon, who cares?

1113
01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You either Splatoon is your life, or you don't care about Splatoon.

1114
01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:06.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I played Splatoon 1 on the Wii U because there was nothing else to play on the Wii U. I never

1115
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, it's a fun game.

1116
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:19.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But, like, there are people, there are people who, like, Splatoon, it's like Pokemon for them, like, they wake up, and they think about Splatoon, and then they play it, and then they go to bed.

1117
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:32.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, for everybody who wants that on their island, that's great. But, this Splatoon stuff would be like if there was just a bunch of Pokemon stuff for us to collect. So, I'm happy for the Splatoon people.

1118
01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay, so Nintendo consoles, I don't want to spend life.

1119
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:43.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I don't like a long, long time on this, but I am very interested in the consoles you can collect and the games that you can play on the consoles.

1120
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:55.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: One thing that is true, but you guys didn't mention last week, is that you can only play these games if you have an Nintendo subscription.

1121
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:54.840
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: - How?

1122
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:55.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: - What?

1123
01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:06.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yep, so that's my feedback for you.

1124
01:28:58.079 --> 01:28:59.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: - What?

1125
01:28:59.319 --> 01:29:00.159
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: - What?

1126
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Why?

1127
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Unless you're paying.

1128
01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.079
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: - Oh, my word.

1129
01:29:08.079 --> 01:29:09.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: This is like, oh, my word.

1130
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:11.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I bet, I bet.

1131
01:29:11.359 --> 01:29:13.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: My assumption is like,

1132
01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: this is one of those things where

1133
01:29:16.039 --> 01:29:19.199
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: some lawyer in Nintendo has said.

1134
01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:21.880
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: If we actually, if we included this game for free

1135
01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: inside the other game, then it means that.

1136
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:40.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And then there's like some precedent that was done in one thing because like this old game was released for free or something and like they don't want to say any precedent or something and so technically you're not getting it for free you're getting it as part. I hate that so much.

1137
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, um, it is a very unfortunate detail.

1138
01:29:44.159 --> 01:29:53.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's so so stupid. Is this the first time we've had something locked in a game behind the subscription other than online?

1139
01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:48.880
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, um,

1140
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:11.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Because obviously we've had as you've explained the DLCs that you can either buy or get for free, but like there's never been anything inside a game that you can't get if you're not a subscription except online.

1141
01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.479
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: um, I think so.

1142
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:19.140
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, you have to have a subscription. Yeah. Um, so the, there is a precedent for the NES games

1143
01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:28.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: being on Animal Crossing. Um, as I think Kevin explained last week, they were about 20 NES games

1144
01:30:28.899 --> 01:30:35.300
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: on the GameCube Animal Crossing. And you got access to them. I think there was a way to get them

1145
01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: through the just regular gameplay.

1146
01:30:38.899 --> 01:30:44.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes, you could find them buried in the ground on certain days or get them from the lottery.

1147
01:30:46.819 --> 01:30:52.260
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But I think you were designed like the game was designed to do them with e-reader cards,

1148
01:30:52.260 --> 01:31:01.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: that old GBA nugget, because there were some e-reader cards where you could swipe into your GBA

1149
01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:07.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and just play a full NES game. So putting that into your Animal Crossing game, you could just have that

1150
01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:15.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: you it up in your NES console whenever you wanted to. So you could play the ones that were like

1151
01:31:15.619 --> 01:31:23.699
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: just in the game where like blue fights, Donkey Kong, Excite Bike, these arcade games really.

1152
01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:35.939
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The thing with this game is in a new horizon, there is one game tied to each console.

1153
01:31:36.739 --> 01:31:38.739
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, you've-

1154
01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:51.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But there's multiple versions of the same console, right? You've got the NES, the Nintendo Entertainment System, which is the American one, and then you've got Famicom, and then you've got the Famicom Disk System, which are all three independent machines.

1155
01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:56.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, there's going to be three NES games that we can play, again, with an active subscription.

1156
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:08.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The ones that are confirmed are Ice Climbers in Cluco Land, but I would assume with three different original consoles, like there's going to be a game for like the Famicom Disk System.

1157
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:30.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That you can play. I'm curious what these games are going to be. They have also come out and said that you can play Dr. Mario on Gameboy, but there are some confirmed consoles that are going to be in there like Super Famicom, not the Super Nintendo, but the Super Famicom was confirmed.

1158
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:38.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And presumably, all of, you know, this is me assuming, but I think that all of the consoles that have NSO support.

1159
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:55.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: would potentially have a game in Animal Crossing, right? So, I'm wondering what are the Super Famicom and the SNES games going to be? What would the Gameboy Advance game be? What would the N64 game be?

1160
01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:07.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And I wonder if there's GameCube support, are you going to be able to play a GameCube game inside of your Switch 2 Animal Crossing New Horizons game?

1161
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And I don't know, what are you thinking of all of this thoughts in mind?

1162
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I mean, I think I'd be surprised if they didn't have something for.

1163
01:33:20.199 --> 01:33:26.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Sorry. Well, no, let me before I go to the, are they really doing the Nez and the Famicom as separate ones?

1164
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:33.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yes, because they're different machines so if you wanted to collect them if you wanted to collect them

1165
01:33:29.039 --> 01:33:39.640
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, well, well, okay, they are, they are different in terms of their shell, but inwards, they're the same thing.

1166
01:33:41.279 --> 01:33:44.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I see on your list they've got Super Famicom.

1167
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But not the SNES? Or is that just not confirmed?

1168
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:51.560
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, those are the ones that work. Yeah, those are the ones that we saw in the list in the trailer

1169
01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:56.479
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: There's gonna be several more, you know, I'm assuming there's gonna be every game boy

1170
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yes, okay

1171
01:33:56.479 --> 01:34:02.060
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: There's gonna be a 3ds gate that console there's gonna be a DS console. I'm just that's me inferring

1172
01:34:00.239 --> 01:34:07.180
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So yeah, yeah, so there's an as and pharmacarm are gonna have the same ones. I don't think they would do anything different there

1173
01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:14.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Is that why we only have two NES games confirmed because Nas and Famicom are both ice climber and then Famicom

1174
01:34:14.539 --> 01:34:16.539
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: disk system would be something like clue cooling.

1175
01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:25.380
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that because I think that language is in the trailer that each console will have one

1176
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.199
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Also, you're thinking one game, I don't know.

1177
01:34:26.399 --> 01:34:29.479
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

1178
01:34:29.479 --> 01:34:32.840
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's a very good question.

1179
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah

1180
01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I think I'd be surprised if there wasn't anything

1181
01:34:37.359 --> 01:34:41.720
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: for the SNES or Super Cap Famicom.

1182
01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:44.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And obviously, we know there's something for the game by,

1183
01:34:44.319 --> 01:34:46.560
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I would hope there would be something

1184
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: for the GBA, if there's something for that.

1185
01:34:49.239 --> 01:34:54.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I can't really see them going any further than that.

1186
01:34:55.159 --> 01:34:58.920
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Maybe a game cube, but that feels like a lot.

1187
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:04.399
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, so GameCube and then N64 are the two bigger questions. Like do they do games for those?

1188
01:35:03.039 --> 01:35:05.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh, N64, I forgot about N64.

1189
01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:08.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, it's like how far does it go? I don't know

1190
01:35:08.479 --> 01:35:12.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, 'cause I mean, they could do both of them,

1191
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:19.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Mm-hmm, and then the other questions like where are these games stored if it's through your NSO subscription?

1192
01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.680
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but would they?

1193
01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:22.300
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Does it just like open up a new tab in your

1194
01:35:22.859 --> 01:35:27.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: in your NSO app and you're playing this game stored?

1195
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:35.399
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: My no, so my assumption is that it's going to be like our downloadable DLC type of thing that you can only get if you have the subscription.

1196
01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:41.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, that's even more messed up. If it's tied behind a paywall, but you've got it downloaded

1197
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:46.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: to your console, like you tell me I got to have all of F0 GX downloaded to my console,

1198
01:35:46.619 --> 01:35:49.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: but I can't play it unless I'm subscribed to NSO.

1199
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, you can't download it unless you're subscribed.

1200
01:35:52.539 --> 01:35:58.060
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right, so there's going to be in theory, another pack on the eShop page where it's saying,

1201
01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:01.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: "Hey, if you've downloaded NSO, here's your Animal Crossing Pack."

1202
01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:13.659
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: things. I mean, just like how you'd be downloading DLC, right? It's not that unusual.

1203
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:11.479
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, but but in that case wouldn't the page be up now

1204
01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:14.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Because the page for this is up now the

1205
01:36:13.659 --> 01:36:16.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Not if they don't want to pay it.

1206
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:24.359
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, it's weird this whole like I'm happy that they did it because it honors what they did back in the GameCube one like

1207
01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:29.680
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: People still talk about that. They like hey, you remember when you could play a bunch of NES games on your animal crossing game

1208
01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.060
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughs]

1209
01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:37.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So they people like Nintendo has like recognized that people remember that fondly and so

1210
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:43.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: They put it in here, but the fact that it's one per console. It's not just like here's some NES games, you know

1211
01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:48.659
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And the fact that it's tied behind the subscription. I just wonder what

1212
01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:57.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Do they highlight and how far does it go and I like I think we've taken this conversation as far as we can because we just we'll find out eventually

1213
01:36:57.579 --> 01:36:59.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You know, we'll find out in two months

1214
01:36:59.979 --> 01:37:07.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But you know choosing which games to highlight do you go for the obvious ones so that people can like oh, here's Mario

1215
01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Or is it like oh, I've never heard of

1216
01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: ZVS before that's cool

1217
01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: - Yeah, I don't know.

1218
01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:20.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So there you are this might be animal crossing thoughts is just thoughts about other Nintendo games

1219
01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:27.640
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I mean, it's I guess it's the biggest question we have right because like there's there's obviously

1220
01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: There's gonna be stuff that they've not told us about right there's always small small things that they haven't told us

1221
01:37:33.159 --> 01:37:35.600
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: They barely told us about the crafting stuff

1222
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.760
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So there's probably gonna be a few other things like that

1223
01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.800
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But other than that like this is the biggest question that we still have is what exactly does this mean?

1224
01:37:43.199 --> 01:37:50.600
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And how many are there and yeah, it will be we interest and see I think the thing is it will be weird because we know they're not all gonna have games

1225
01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.319
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: they can't have the Switch 2 having a game.

1226
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.500
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: No, no

1227
01:37:52.500 --> 01:38:12.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Just not possible unless they have like a not Switch 2 game and they have something else instead which is always possible like oh here's a GBA version of Mario Wonder or something stupid like that right but that's going to be then weird if you've got all your consoles lined up and you can play something on the game boy and you can't play something on the the 3DS.

1228
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:23.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think what I would do is I would have the switch to going on, and you would click it,

1229
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and the little voice would say, "Oh, I'm playing my switch to right now."

1230
01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And it's like, "It's Animal Crossing."

1231
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:36.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So like, so like what they did with the with every Pokemon game where you you you see the console and you do it and you're like, oh, I'm playing a game on this.

1232
01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, but like, it's a little meta

1233
01:38:38.979 --> 01:38:41.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: because you're holding it, you know?

1234
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, yeah, maybe

1235
01:38:43.699 --> 01:38:45.260
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The last question is,

1236
01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: if this is tied to your NSO subscription,

1237
01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: is there gonna be a Sega Genesis in here?

1238
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.279
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughter]

1239
01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:54.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: [laughing]

1240
01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:56.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like, am I gonna?

1241
01:38:55.279 --> 01:38:58.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Well, it's-- I mean, OK, to ruin your fun,

1242
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.119
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: it's not the consoles that are on NSO, right?

1243
01:39:01.119 --> 01:39:02.560
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Because they have the switch to, right?

1244
01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's not on NSO.

1245
01:39:02.619 --> 01:39:04.619
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, right.

1246
01:39:04.359 --> 01:39:06.399
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So it's not all the consoles that are in NSO,

1247
01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:07.239
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: we have a version of.

1248
01:39:07.239 --> 01:39:10.439
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But yeah, that is a funny concept of adding in this.

1249
01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Right.

1250
01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.699
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Playing, playing, playing, yeah?

1251
01:39:10.439 --> 01:39:12.279
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I mean, it wouldn't be weird because they

1252
01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:13.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: have the Lego stuff, right?

1253
01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.039
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: They've done crossovers with non-nandendo stuff.

1254
01:39:16.039 --> 01:39:17.079
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So they could do that.

1255
01:39:17.079 --> 01:39:20.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But I don't know, could I see Sega agreeing to that?

1256
01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.979
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And do they want their console?

1257
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And in an Nintendo game.

1258
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:29.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, they you can already buy an official Nintendo controller that is a Sega Genesis controller and

1259
01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:37.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You can already on your console if you've got in a so play Sonic 2 for free right now

1260
01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:46.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So could you open up Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 go to your Sega Genesis console click it on and play Sonic 2 within

1261
01:39:47.739 --> 01:39:50.479
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Animal Crossing. I don't know that that's a fun hypothetical

1262
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.840
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That would certainly be a fun one to have if you could do Sonic.

1263
01:39:55.359 --> 01:39:59.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: All right. Any other thoughts on these updates before we close out?

1264
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.779
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: We said at the very top of the show, but the fact that you can craft from your storage,

1265
01:40:05.779 --> 01:40:10.600
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: man, that's really going to give a lot of motivation to crafting back, because then I could

1266
01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:19.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: just look at, like just thinking alone about the craftable sign, and then it's not going

1267
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: to be three items.

1268
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It's going to be hundreds and hundreds of items.

1269
01:40:23.079 --> 01:40:25.720
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You're like, "Oh, what am I going to make?"

1270
01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:27.399
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: And it'll be like, "Oh, you've never made this before."

1271
01:40:27.399 --> 01:40:29.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I'm like, oh, let me make it right now.

1272
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.479
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I just cannot wait to go in.

1273
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:48.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Uh, yeah, absolutely read. I think the thing that was the thing that most annoyed me about crafting is you're like, oh, I can't craft this thing, right. What do I need? Oh, do I have that stuff? I don't know. Let's go find out and just being able to know immediately. Do I have this stuff or not is going to be great.

1274
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:54.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and then yeah so yeah I'm glad they're doing it um for free is great and looking forward to January

1275
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.439
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: 15th to Buddha.

1276
01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Just before we finish. I lied. There was one other big question we have, which is why? Why now? Why?

1277
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:11.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Four years after the last update that was going to be the final update. Why are they doing this now so weird?

1278
01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:15.180
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I don't know um yeah I think okay so obviously they work on this the next

1279
01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:19.100
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: console when the when the previous consoles finished you know they started

1280
01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:23.979
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, probably before that.

1281
01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:27.739
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: switch to development on March 4th 2017 yeah so they're probably like hmm

1282
01:41:27.739 --> 01:41:32.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: we're doing these switch to editions what makes the most sense let's do Mario

1283
01:41:32.819 --> 01:41:34.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I wonder, let's do...

1284
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:49.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You know, let's do friggin', I don't know, what's a curvy, and then let's do animal crossing, right? Animal crossing, new fence post is not even close to being done yet, so we'll just put out new horizons and that makes sense.

1285
01:41:49.979 --> 01:41:50.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So, sure.

1286
01:41:50.979 --> 01:41:58.819
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that this opens up the floodgates even more to what else is going to get a switch to addition, really.

1287
01:41:58.819 --> 01:42:04.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Like, now that they said new horizons, switch to addition, okay.

1288
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:14.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Sure. That's great. But, you know, it's the 3.0.

1289
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:14.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But this is the thing. It's not a just a switch to addition. The switch to addition is basically nothing, right?

1290
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Okay, so yeah. I

1291
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:21.300
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like if they released this switch to addition and had those four things, fine. Great. I'm not buying that. I'm not playing the game.

1292
01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:28.340
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Maybe that's it. Maybe this is why maybe I just answered my question. They knew the switch to addition wouldn't get people playing the game again.

1293
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.579
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that is the answer.

1294
01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:30.340
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So they needed to give you other stuff to do that.

1295
01:42:30.399 --> 01:42:32.640
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, because all of these other switch to additions

1296
01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.520
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: have had stuff to dip back into,

1297
01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:37.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: like the Mario Party, Jamboree had an addition,

1298
01:42:37.039 --> 01:42:38.319
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Kirby had an addition.

1299
01:42:39.279 --> 01:42:42.399
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So if they're doing a switch to then yes,

1300
01:42:42.399 --> 01:42:45.640
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: they're gonna have some new content for you to enjoy.

1301
01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.520
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: The interesting decision, the strange one,

1302
01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:53.760
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: is that they made that new content free to everybody else.

1303
01:42:53.500 --> 01:43:05.420
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I so not Nintendo. This is the thing. It's not like it's a weird concept for games, right? Like look at starchy where we've had like five whole new games for free, right?

1304
01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.840
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: That's what makes this different.

1305
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:13.960
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. It is strange. I think that there's just something down to the design philosophy.

1306
01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.300
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But Nintendo don't do this.

1307
01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Again, as we said at the top of the show, that made them say, "Well, it really would

1308
01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:29.039
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: be in our best interest if everybody could do these things," which is, yeah. Yeah. Well,

1309
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.960
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but they didn't do that with the happy home paradise DLC that was a paid deals like if they

1310
01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.199
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: didn't do that I would absolutely review it's a hundred percent the animal crossing team just

1311
01:43:29.039 --> 01:43:30.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: So that's the thing is, it was...

1312
01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:33.439
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: wants to give you as much as possible for what they have.

1313
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.159
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: But it was both a paid DLC and it wasn't.

1314
01:43:37.159 --> 01:43:42.520
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: It's in this weird zone because if you're going to enjoy Animal Crossing to its fullest,

1315
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.720
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: you're already going to be paying for an online subscription.

1316
01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:59.579
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But then that that argument could be made for all the other expansion packs that were free on there as well, and the split into was DLC was free the the the new Mario Kart

1317
01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:07.739
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, notice that all of these free DLCs are the social ones, the ones that are in the online

1318
01:44:00.699 --> 01:44:02.699
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: eight Deluxe DLC was free

1319
01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:12.460
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: players, you know, Mario Kart, you're playing online, Splatoon, you're playing online,

1320
01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.340
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Animal Crossing, you're playing online.

1321
01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:17.859
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: They didn't put, yeah.

1322
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Pokemon.

1323
01:44:18.779 --> 01:44:20.579
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: That's, I mean, I know that's different,

1324
01:44:20.579 --> 01:44:23.140
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: but it's also not in the same way.

1325
01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:24.699
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like, I, I don't know.

1326
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.600
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. We're just, we're just throwing darts at the board.

1327
01:44:24.699 --> 01:44:26.380
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I'm not sure whether I buy that.

1328
01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:29.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughing]

1329
01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:38.319
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: You can't, you can't explain this strange choice they made. But yeah. Yeah.

1330
01:44:32.859 --> 01:44:34.819
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No, you're right, we can't, we can't.

1331
01:44:34.819 --> 01:44:35.659
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: We're just guessing.

1332
01:44:35.659 --> 01:44:38.140
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I just, it's, it's fascinating because, yeah,

1333
01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:41.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I think if the DLC didn't exist and it was all three updates,

1334
01:44:41.779 --> 01:44:44.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I would 100% agree this is weird for Nintendo,

1335
01:44:44.539 --> 01:44:47.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: does seem that Animal Crossing team wants to do this,

1336
01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:49.060
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: and they seem to get their way.

1337
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: I think that there is a logic to it.

1338
01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:49.899
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: But.

1339
01:44:51.279 --> 01:44:54.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: There's just like some guesswork and what that logic is.

1340
01:44:53.699 --> 01:44:56.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: [laughing]

1341
01:44:56.260 --> 01:45:01.260
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I guess it could be as simple as the team had a fight

1342
01:45:02.739 --> 01:45:06.859
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: four years ago and the people that were on the side of,

1343
01:45:06.859 --> 01:45:10.619
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: we should be releasing DLC, they're no longer

1344
01:45:10.619 --> 01:45:11.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: with the company.

1345
01:45:11.779 --> 01:45:14.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And so the people who'd want its stuff to be free win.

1346
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.399
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. Yeah.

1347

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: No, that is a possibility and that is something we will never truly know because it's internal politics.

1348
01:45:22.579 --> 01:45:25.779
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Anyway, are you still there? Okay, cool. Just checking.

1349
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: - Yeah, I'm still there.

1352
01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:42.979
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: This feels like the longest between an announcement for animal crossing update and it coming out.

1353
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, I wonder I maybe they were just

1354
01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.560
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Positioning this ahead of the holidays

1355
01:45:51.239 --> 01:45:57.880
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Just like before holiday shopping begins and earnest. They're like hey also if you're a fan of

1356
01:45:59.479 --> 01:46:04.600
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Didn't like a animal crossing you can get a switch to yeah, you can get us

1357
01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:06.939
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: put aside $5. Oh, right. Oh, it's for it's switch to sales.

1358
01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.279
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, you can get a switch to for the holidays and then still have something

1359
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.220
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: I think what's interesting is that it's coming out in January.

1360
01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:18.380
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like, is it really not ready now?

1361
01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:20.859
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Could you not have it out for now?

1362
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.420
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: [laughing]

1363
01:46:20.859 --> 01:46:25.539
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Like, because my argument for game releases is,

1364
01:46:25.539 --> 01:46:27.359
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: you never announced the date of a release

1365
01:46:27.359 --> 01:46:29.020
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: unless you could release it now.

1366
01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:45.979
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: sure. Especially now it is, I'll tell you, here's the thing.

1367
01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.340
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: And I feel like Nintendo generally does that,

1368
01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:35.659
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: if we ignore Pokemon.

1369
01:46:37.659 --> 01:46:41.859
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So I just like, do they actually need these next two months

1370
01:46:41.859 --> 01:46:43.500
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: to see if Pollock.

1371
01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:54.659
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, I doubt it. It just seems like a weird time for it because like this is our, tell me if I'm wrong, but animal crossing very much feels like a autumn winter game.

1372
01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Um, me, I don't know, I think what it is, is that they have a game coming out in December

1373
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.319
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: and they have a game coming out in February. So like, okay, well, we'll give us some,

1374
01:47:05.319 --> 01:47:13.079
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: we'll put in them across in January. Like, I think that, well, I don't know.

1375
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:11.619
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It's not, but it's not, it's not any, what's February?

1376
01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.380
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Oh, you're, oh, you mean they, they will have one,

1377
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.140
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: not that they've announced one, okay?

1378
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.720
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah, yeah, there might be a February game.

1379
01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.939
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: 'Cause what's the crossover between met tried

1380
01:47:20.939 --> 01:47:22.340
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: and animal crossing players?

1381
01:47:22.359 --> 01:47:24.880
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Well, nothing. I think Nintendo likes to have

1382
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.880
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: something come out every month. And I think like, okay, we're having a new Nintendo

1383
01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:35.020
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: published game come out on the shelf in December, and we had an Nintendo

1384
01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:38.859
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: public game come out in November. What's our Nintendo public game coming out in

1385
01:47:38.859 --> 01:47:43.899
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: January? I think that they really, since it's a new box on the shelf, I think

1386
01:47:43.899 --> 01:47:48.000
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: that like they count Animal Crossing Switch to Edition as their game for the

1387
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.800
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: month. Even if it's a $5 upgrade to people who already opened it, it is a new, yeah,

1388
01:47:51.000 --> 01:48:03.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, no, that's fair. I've seen that argument as well from people is that they clearly certainly sense the switch to to come have come out. They've released something every month.

1389
01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:10.840
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Yeah. Like Mario Party, Jamboree, H, like Switch to Edition, that was their, that was their August game.

1390
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: So.

1391
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah.

1392
01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:11.920
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: Now, here it is.

1393
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: Yeah, yeah, and I guess that's the thing is if you're going to release something in January.

1394
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: It needs to be something small or it needs to be something that you don't

1395
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:34.520
<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: want a humongous number of sales for, that will forever amuse me. You cannot convince me that

1396
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:26.659
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: - Yeah, like something like Pokemon Legends arc is,

<v 686E3FE5-B70A-4F3B-8FCF-AAB2FB161559>Al: that game wasn't delayed. You just cannot convince me that there is no way the original plan was

1399
01:48:36.479 --> 01:48:38.739
<v A63FAFBB-AB85-4ED1-8879-894B60D0801F>Nama: [laughing]
