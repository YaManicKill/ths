## Intro

(30s) **Al:**

> Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al.

(35s) **Nama:**

> My name is Naame.

(36s) **Al:**

> And we're here today to talk about cottagecore games.

(40s) **Nama:**

> Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

(42s) **Al:**

> Welcome, Nami. It's been a while.

(44s) **Nama:**

> Hi, I think this is my first time on second mic.

(48s)

> I think before I was like, you called me in.

(49s) **Al:**

> No.

(52s)

> Oh, you were a third.

(53s) **Nama:**

> I was a third.

(55s)

> So this is my first time firmly in the co-pilot seat.

(58s) **Al:**

> Let's have a look. Yes.

(1m)

> Oh, yes, you were on for the the culture discussion. That was that was the super fun. Like this feels not great.

(1m 3s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(1m 6s)

> Yeah.

(1m 8s)

> Yeah.

(1m 9s)

> I feel like I was on a second time, but I guess this is only my second time.

(1m 12s) **Al:**

> The only other you were on the greenhouse as well, looks like it was that that was the same

(1m 18s) **Nama:**

> Okay.

(1m 21s) **Al:**

> like recording session that we did. We did a Pokemon day presents predictions for 2023.

(1m 22s) **Nama:**

> Cool.

(1m 23s)

> I guess that's what I'm thinking of.

(1m 24s)

> Anyway, hello.

(1m 25s)

> I'm happy to be here.

(1m 27s)

> Mm-hmm.

(1m 30s) **Al:**

> Welcome. Yes. Nami is here because I thought it'd be good to get another person's thoughts on the animal crossing new horizons update, you know, especially with how much Kevin hates the game.

(1m 44s) **Nama:**

> Well, I enjoy it, you know. We'll get into some stuff. There's good things and there's

(1m 46s) **Al:**

> No pressure. You have to love the game though. That's all I'm saying.

(1m 56s) **Nama:**

> other comments, but mostly I was very excited about the news, so I'm pretty happy to contribute

(2m 2s)

> more to the discussion.

(2m 3s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so we'll get into that. Before that, we have

(2m 7s)

> I just know many news there was a point this week where I was like, there's almost no news

(2m 11s)

> This episode is gonna be really short because we don't have like a proper main topic, but thankfully

(2m 14s) **Nama:**

[laughs]

(2m 17s) **Al:**

> We have quite a few news, so we will get into them

(2m 19s)

> But we also have feedback which I'll come to next, but first of all now may what have you been up to you?

## What Have We Been Up To

(2m 27s) **Nama:**

> So whenever I come on a podcast and we ask this question,

(2m 30s)

> it's always like so many avenues I could talk about.

(2m 33s)

> I was like, oh, should I talk about like, you know,

(2m 36s)

> weird things that happened to me this week?

(2m 38s)

> Or I mean, mostly people want to hear about games.

(2m 40s)

> So I'll do that.

(2m 43s)

> I played Luigi's Mansion 2 on Switch for the month of October

(2m 48s)

> and I beat it.

(2m 49s)

> I got credits a little after October.

(2m 51s)

> It was like November 3rd or so.

(2m 54s)

> and I came to enjoy that gift.

(2m 57s)

> My first didn't like the, um, the format of going into the mansion, finishing your objective, coming out of the mansion, clicking through dialogue, going back in, but I kind of settled into the rhythm of just doing a level daily, and that I found that pretty motivating at the end of it.

(3m 16s)

> So, um, beyond that, um, I am slowly making my way through a Pokemon fire red Nuzlocke. I tried a Nuzlocke, a Pokemon

(3m 27s)

> one game every fall, like September or so, um, hit a bit of a wall just because there's such a big level jump between Erica and Koga and Sabrina, so I have to, like, commit to some grinding. Um, but my team is really like shaping up. Like I've got a growlith, which is cool. Um, it's got to intimidate, um, what a, I mean, I've got a cadabra, right? You have to have something that can do that special damage. Um,

(3m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I guess the good thing as well about those games is that especially the time that

(4m)

> you're talking about is there's such a large area of the map you can now go to that you're

(4m 4s) **Nama:**

> Yes, I think I can still go down the entire biking road, so there's going to be at least like

(4m 4s) **Al:**

> not just like sitting in one small area of the map grinding. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

(4m 14s) **Nama:**

> four or five levels from there. And when I beat Luigi's Mansion 2, I went back to my Zelda

(4m 17s) **Al:**

> Nice.

(4m 23s) **Nama:**

> Echoes of Wisdom file. I started playing that when the Switch 2 launched and then put it down

(4m 28s)

> when Donkey Kong came out. So, I'm almost done with it. I think I've...

(4m 34s)

> I couldn't tell you how many temples there are. There's like seven or eight. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(4m 38s) **Al:**

> I've can't I honestly can't remember that detail. I play I played it obsessively for two weeks and then never touched it again

(4m 40s) **Nama:**

> I think I'm... Right. Yeah. It's fun. I think I'm on the last regular temple and then I'll go to

(4m 44s) **Al:**

> As is the case for all Zelda games

(4m 51s) **Nama:**

> the final, like, here's the end of the game temple. And I'm enjoying the, like, thinking around

(5m 2s)

> How to go across combat.

(5m 4s)

> Sometimes it's frustrating and it's mostly when I'm out of that energy to become link for a minute.

(5m 15s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Well, see, this is, this is my thing, right? So, so the thing that really frustrations me about this game is that they're like, here's this really new cool concept here where we're taking Zelda, we're finally going to let you play as Zelda and she's got this whole new way of playing compared to Link. Oh, but also we don't really trust what we're doing. And so we're just going to let you play as Link anyway.

(5m 39s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I totally get that point of criticism.

(5m 43s)

> I think maybe the middle ground would be to give her some kind of...

(5m 52s)

> Some kind of agency beyond just the echoes.

(5m 55s)

> I say just the echoes.

(5m 58s)

> Like, I don't know.

(6m)

> Maybe like, give her a bow and arrow, like halfway through the game,

(6m 3s)

> or make her, like her hair flip that she does,

(6m 7s)

> does do like, I don't know.

(6m 10s)

> of what a sword slash would do, you know, just something to wear if you are back into a

(6m 15s)

> corner and all of your other guys are over on the other side of the screen that you can, you know,

(6m 20s)

> defend yourself. But anyway, that's getting into the weeds of it. I'm having fun with it.

(6m 26s)

> The last thing that I'll mention, right, the last thing that I'll mention is I got back into

(6m 34s)

> the animal crossing a little bit with New Horizons, just after

(6m 39s)

> the announcement came out was my annual Knook Miles day. This is a self-celebrated day that I go in and I

(6m 47s)

> tried to just get as many Knook Miles as I can. Try not try. Yeah. Well, here's the thing. I think I started this little

(6m 49s) **Al:**

> The timing was incredible. I don't know how they must know.

(6m 56s) **Nama:**

> tradition of mine because they announced a big like update, not 2.0, but something I'd have to go back and look at what

(7m 5s) **Al:**

> I think it must have been 2.0 because they released all the updates in the course of that

(7m 5s) **Nama:**

> what was coming out four years ago.

(7m 9s)

> Yeah, maybe it was.

(7m 13s) **Al:**

> one year.

(7m 14s)

> I don't think they went into a second year, so I'm pretty sure it must have been 2.0.

(7m 19s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, so we'll just say that they announced 2.0 and I hadn't played in some months.

(7m 24s)

> And I was like, well, I'll just like do one day where I just do a lot of stuff.

(7m 30s)

> And I define that by getting as many nook miles as I could.

(7m 34s)

> So I try to avoid like the top bonus, like plus miles,

(7m 39s)

> hit a rock, dig a hole, play a lot of your flowers.

(7m 43s)

> I try to like really focus on the achievements, you know.

(7m 46s)

> So I think I finally got some more fish because every time I get back into this

(7m 53s)

> game, it's spring.

(7m 54s)

> So I have never seen my island in the winter.

(7m 57s)

> I barely see my island in the fall.

(8m)

> So I got some fall fish and put those in the museum.

(8m 4s)

> Did a couple of other things.

(8m 5s)

> I've, man, I got the 50 achievement for like successful fishes

(8m 9s)

> in a row and I didn't realize I didn't remember that I was doing it until it awarded

(8m 12s) **Al:**

> That was such a hard one.

(8m 16s) **Nama:**

> it to me and then I was like, oh my gosh, now I have to lock in for the hundred and I tried

(8m 23s)

> not to think about it because I was doing well not thinking about it, but I made it to

(8m 29s)

> 57, I did seven more and then I choked so sad.

(8m 34s)

> So I guess in a year I'll forget about it again and then we'll see how far I climb.

(8m 39s)

> Yeah, okay, a lot to say in a little bit of time, but that's what I've been playing.

(8m 45s) **Al:**

> Just some real-time feedback just before someone messaged me and tells me I'm wrong.

(8m 50s)

> I am both right and wrong, so I am wrong in that they didn't all release the same year.

(8m 56s)

> They did cover 2020 on 2021, but I am right in that it was 2.0 because that was on the 4th of November 2021.

(9m 6s) **Nama:**

> So that's why it's that day to anybody asking me, "Why is it on November 4th?"

(9m 11s) **Al:**

> there you go no you know that's all right I got to make sure that i'm right or wrong before

(9m 12s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, we got that solved. Thank you for looking that up.

(9m 20s) **Al:**

> I forgot they released the happy home paradise a day after the update came out they didn't

(9m 26s)

> release them on the same day that is really why did they do that

(9m 28s) **Nama:**

> that's weird. Yeah. Well, is that also tied to win Nintendo Switch online like made the expansion

(9m 40s)

> pack? Because I think like my expansion pack route, I think so because my expansion pack

(9m 41s) **Al:**

> Was that the first was that the first one that came free with the with?

(9m 46s) **Nama:**

> renews this time of year because that's when it came out. Go ahead, yeah.

(9m 48s) **Al:**

> So okay, so so so so right just just I'm gonna double check whether that's the case, but but I will say that's non-excuse

(9m 57s)

> They also control that

(9m 58s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Right.

(10m) **Al:**

> So it's not like they're waiting for someone else

(10m 3s)

> To do this thing they

(10m 6s)

> own it all

(10m 8s)

> Oh goodness me, so no it was not

(10m 11s)

> I was released in October of 2021.

(10m 14s)

> I feel weak.

(10m 15s) **Nama:**

> hmm a week before so everybody gets their Nintendo 64 games and then seven days later they get their free

(10m 23s) **Al:**

> I've not counted if it's exactly seven days. Don't do this to me.

(10m 23s) **Nama:**

> Animal Crossing DLC or you know whatever

(10m 27s)

[Laughter]

(10m 31s)

> Guys this is the difference between Al and I. I am very comfortable in the in the hypothetical and the figurative

(10m 39s)

[Laughter]

(10m 40s) **Al:**

> So the 25th of October was expansion packed release.

(10m 43s)

> That was on Monday.

(10m 45s) **Nama:**

> okay

(10m 45s) **Al:**

> The next Thursday was the 2.0 update for Animal Crossing.

(10m 49s)

> And then the Friday, the day after that was happy home

(10m 49s) **Nama:**

> okay

(10m 53s)

> wow so weird that is very weird that they either do them all at the same time or space them out regularly

(10m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Well, that's, that's what they're doing here, right? The 3.01, the switch to release both

(11m 1s) **Nama:**

> yeah

(11m 4s) **Al:**

> come out in the same day. It would definitely be, I guess it's less weird when it's a DLC specifically

(11m 9s)

> because it's like, that's just like one, especially as it was like, you know, a set for island,

(11m 15s)

> like, it was essentially like a separate game in the game, right? I guess it's less weird in that

(11m 21s)

> way, whereas to like limit the switch to version, you know, you'd be like, oh, you've got the update,

(11m 26s) **Nama:**

> Right

(11m 27s) **Al:**

> but not the higher resolution.

(11m 29s)

> >> Good point. I think you know exactly what I've been up to is Pokemon, I've just been playing Pokemon.

(11m 29s) **Nama:**

> Well, we have plenty of time to talk about this. Let's first ask what you've been up to out

(11m 38s)

> Hey

## Pokémon Legends Z-A

(11m 39s) **Nama:**

> This is the first time since

(11m 43s)

> Heartgold and soul silver, which is a long time. It's like it's like 15 years

(11m 48s)

> The first time that I have not gotten the game within let's say a month of release

(11m 54s)

> possibly even a week of release.

(11m 56s) **Al:**

> So tell me why. Also, you've got a week until it's a month, but anyway. Tell me why.

(12m 2s) **Nama:**

> - Cool, yeah, thank you.

(12m 5s)

> The reason why is basically the cost of all the software

(12m 10s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm

(12m 10s) **Nama:**

> has just been catching up with me.

(12m 12s)

> It's not a, what's the word?

(12m 16s)

> A, I'm not boycotting.

(12m 17s) **Al:**

> You're not boycotting

(12m 20s)

> You just need you just literally need to save up

(12m 22s) **Nama:**

> I'm happy for it to look like I'm boycotting, right?

(12m 25s)

[laughing]

(12m 26s)

> But it is not an active choice to boycott

(12m 30s)

> because I got the Switch 2 Dave released.

(12m 32s)

> I got -- so my idea was when they were coming out with all these prices,

(12m 33s) **Al:**

> - Yeah.

(12m 36s)

> - Well, that's why you kind of forward it.

(12m 37s)

> You spent all your money on the switch too.

(12m 39s)

[laughing]

(12m 43s) **Nama:**

> Mario Kart $80, et cetera, et cetera, $70, you don't come.

(12m 47s)

> I was like, "Okay, let's look at this."

(12m 49s)

> I'm going to invest into the new hardware, and I'm going to play my backlog of Switch games,

(12m 58s) **Al:**

> How dare you have played every game?

(12m 58s) **Nama:**

> because I -- you know, everybody's got one, I've got one.

(13m 3s)

> I'm going to play my Switch 1 games on the Switch 2, because it will be -- they'll run better,

(13m 9s)

> right? Just -- just naturally. But also, I am not -- I'm not at all.

(13m 15s)

> Everybody, I don't have seven Switch consoles. I was still playing on my Day 1 Switch.

(13m 22s)

> I never got an OLED. I never got a light. So it was really time for an upgrade,

(13m 28s)

> just because, like, physically my console was beat up.

(13m 32s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(13m 32s) **Nama:**

> It was not a good spot. So I got the new console, yeah.

(13m 34s) **Al:**

> Eight years is a long time.

(13m 36s) **Nama:**

> I got the new console and I'm very happy to play that.

(13m 39s)

> But I was like, if these games are going to be 70 or 80 dollars,

(13m 44s)

> like if you're getting a switch to addition, like that's still an increased price as well.

(13m 49s)

> So I was like, I think I'm just going to rely on my birthday to get a game on the holidays to get a game.

(13m 57s)

> And then I am, you know, I work in a public library that's lucky enough to get video

(14m 2s)

> games. If there's anything really new that I can wait for, then I'll get that for free. And I'll play the library copies of games. But in the meantime, I've got all these other games to play. So that's why I decided to not get Pokémon on release. I just put it on my wish list to get in December. And that is when I'll play it. I'll probably play it like maybe January 1st, you know, or something like that. I don't know.

(14m 27s)

> But that's that's what's behind the decision so I'm sure you've talked about it

(14m 32s)

> before but how is it what do you know how do I do I do

(14m 35s) **Al:**

> Um, so I mean, I will say that I mostly really like this game. Um, I, so I mean,

(14m 42s)

> I've talked before many a time that like, I'm sure I would enjoy better graphics.

(14m 51s)

> I'm sure that, you know, I will, you know, it's, it's the sort of thing that you

(14m 56s)

> don't really know what you've got until you've got it, right? Like if I, if breath of the

(15m)

> wild had worse graphics, I don't think I would have enjoyed it less, but it's not the

(15m 5s)

> thing is like opening the game, going, oh, my word, this is gorgeous, right? Like I

(15m 9s)

> don't open this game and go, this is gorgeous, but I also don't spend my time playing

(15m 13s)

> it going, oh, I hate how this game looks, looks dreadful, right? Like I don't, I just

(15m 18s)

> don't, I don't naturally do that. And that's not to say that anyone else's is worse

(15m 23s)

> for having done that. Like that, that is totally fine. And I, um, I don't need people

(15m 29s)

> to be going like, oh, we need to expect more for our games. I like the game. I like the

(15m 34s)

> game play.

(15m 35s)

> I don't feel like I am missing out and I definitely feel like it has been worth the

(15m 51s)

> money that I have spent to get this game.

(15m 53s) **Nama:**

> Cool, yeah, I am, oh, good.

(15m 56s) **Al:**

> There are a few things that I really miss that they didn't add into this game that they

(16m 1s)

> did have in Legends Arcius. I'm very sad about that.

(16m 5s)

> But they have copied over the core gameplay from that that I really enjoyed.

(16m 15s)

> It is more battle focused, which obviously a lot of people were expecting.

(16m 20s)

> Therefore, I would not enjoy it as much. But the way that they have integrated the battles

(16m 26s)

> into the overworld is much better than Legends Arcius did, right?

(16m 31s) **Nama:**

> Okay

(16m 33s) **Al:**

> So if you were in Legends Arches.

(16m 35s)

> You went into a battle. It was like, okay, now we're going to pretend like we're still in the overworld. We're going to pretend like it's smooth and seamless and now we're going to like do all these animations and you're suddenly in a battle and know it's completely different, right?

(16m 48s)

> I didn't particularly like that, but I really love how it's like, oh, if you can't catch this book, I'm on literally just tell your Pokémon to attack it and now you can try and catch it again and it's lower health in the exact same way you would be, right?

(17m 3s)

> where it was Legend's arcius.

(17m 5s)

> You go into a battle with a Pokemon, you then were into the old way of catching Pokemon, which I did not like as much, right?

(17m 10s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, really. I think I knew that. Yeah.

(17m 12s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah.

(17m 14s)

> So, yeah, I think they've integrated battling really well, I think it's an upgrade from...

(17m 21s)

> It feels like they've combined the catching in the overworld from Legend's arcius and the let's go mechanic from Scarlet and Violet into a much better...

(17m 34s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, it really does feel in more ways than in the past because they're always iterating and building off of what came before, but it feels like they are really using the legends games to build out a new experience.

(17m 35s) **Al:**

> experience overall for both of them.

(17m 51s)

> Mm-hmm

(17m 52s) **Nama:**

> To make you, quote, feel like a Pokemon trainer, Legends Arceus, they obviously put a lot of development and time into making catching feel really good.

(18m 4s)

> Because I think at the end of the day, especially with Pokemon goes influence, there really is a desire to make that core mechanic of catching Pokemon fun and addicting and satisfying.

(18m 18s)

> And, you know, we both played Arceus that is so, it's just a joy to just throw the balls and catch Pokemon and stuff. So then they sat down for this one and say, "Okay, for this next one, let's cross out the next thing."

(18m 24s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm

(18m 26s)

> Mm-hmm

(18m 34s) **Nama:**

> Which is the battling and kind of work that from the ground up and make that seem like you, quote, "feeling like a Pokemon trainer."

(18m 43s)

> So, my mind next goes to, "Okay, so for Legends, for Legends 3, what's the next thing?" I'm like, "Oh, sure, sure, sure. For the follow-up to ZA, I think maybe you rework trading.

(18m 51s) **Al:**

> Well, I'd say legends four. I would argue

(19m 5s) **Nama:**

> The social aspect of Pokemon, maybe, I don't know, I don't really know how you would re-invigorate that idea, but maybe exploring ways to tweak that or make that more fun or make that more engaging. Beyond, people trying to finish their Pokedexes in the first two weeks of release and then not doing that.

(19m 26s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. I think, I mean, the kinder did that with Sword and Shield and then Scarlet

(19m 33s)

> and Violet, right, with the raids. And that has given a lot more life to the games between

(19m 36s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, that's true.

(19m 40s) **Al:**

> the releases, although really struggling to find the time to do the Scarlet and Violet

(19m 42s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah, you're really right there.

(19m 47s) **Al:**

> raids that they're still doing now for some reason. I think what's going to be really interesting

(19m 54s)

> is what from the...

(19m 56s)

> this game goes into Gen 10, because I really struggled with the jump from

(20m 3s)

> Legends Arceus to Scarlet and Violet with catching.

(20m 5s) **Nama:**

> But yeah, it was like putting on the breaks of your bike.

(20m 8s) **Al:**

> Exactly. And I felt that a few times with games, right? Like I felt it with

(20m 9s) **Nama:**

> And I'm pleased.

(20m 15s) **Al:**

> Sun and Moon when we didn't get soaring from Uras. I thought that was a real

(20m 19s) **Nama:**

> - Sure, yeah.

(20m 20s) **Al:**

> downgrade, not getting that. And obviously like in most of the game

(20m 26s)

> since then we have had something like that. I obviously not in this one, just

(20m 32s)

> baffles me. So I wonder what they're going to do. Are they going to go back to

(20m 40s)

> traditional catching? Are they going to do...? In counter Pokemon going to

(20m 46s)

> into different state battle and catch the Pokemon? Or are they going to

(20m 52s)

> Take this mechanic out of the Legends games.

(20m 56s)

> If you will and put it into the next big game because obviously they're all main series, we don't need to have that discussion, it doesn't matter, but obviously new generation games with brand new Pokémon with a big decks, they're the ones that sell the most and have always been and will always be.

(21m 4s) **Nama:**

> No, I'm not interested in that conversation.

(21m 15s)

> Yep. Yeah.

(21m 19s) **Al:**

> Because that's what the majority of casual Pokémon players care about. We are not casual Pokémon players, right?

(21m 27s)

> Those who buy every game, those who play every game for at least tens of hours, if not hundreds of hours, right? Like we were looking at the the the the new.

(21m 36s)

> Switch shop store, that's why I keep thinking shop because eShop, you know, it's called switch store for some reason, the new switch store app, which actually finally gives you the full playtime and breakdown of your playtime and half of my top 10 or Pokémon games.

(21m 49s) **Nama:**

> Yeah

(21m 53s) **Al:**

> Um, so we're not.

(21m 56s)

> We're not the casuals, uh, but they are the people the Pokemon need to keep buying the game and the question is, oh, do they risk that do they risk doing something that hasn't been in one of those new generation games before and risk the possibility that upsets people and make means they don't buy the game or do they annoy the core fans who love this way of playing and.

(22m 26s)

> I don't really don't want it to not be in the next game. I don't, I mean, I'm sure that are other people who would prefer that right like I do.

(22m 33s)

> I remember discussions of let's go where people hated the Pokemon in the overworld and wanted random encounters back some people cared about that and but I like there were some of us who are very much pro that idea.

(22m 40s) **Nama:**

> Well, that's it.

(22m 45s)

> Yeah.

(22m 47s) **Al:**

> And clearly that won one out right like I don't think Sword and Shield was the last game that didn't have all the Pokemon in the overworld. They did have some, but not all.

(22m 54s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, that's what I was going to bring up

(22m 57s)

> is that there's an approach to this scenario

(23m)

> that you're describing that we can look

(23m 2s)

> to a Sword and Shield for, which was,

(23m 4s)

> and it's too bad we didn't get this right away

(23m 6s)

> with Scarlet and Violet.

(23m 10s)

> Everybody liked, well, not everybody, but as you said,

(23m 13s)

> but many people liked the Pokemon in the overworld

(23m 16s)

> that let's go introduced,

(23m 19s)

> and we were curious if Sword and Shield

(23m 20s)

> would keep that over, and they did both.

(23m 23s)

> They let you--

(23m 24s)

> I think that if-- because I don't think that the turn-based thing is going to go away. I think for the sake of competitive-- and that's a whole other conversation. I think for the sake of competitive, we're going to retain the turn-based stuff.

(23m 48s) **Al:**

> but doesn't Pokemon champions allow them

(23m 48s) **Nama:**

> Again, that's a whole other discussion.

(23m 51s) **Al:**

> to keep that out of the main game?

(23m 54s) **Nama:**

> I think that there will--

(23m 56s) **Al:**

> I just can't see that the coincidence

(24m)

> of that game coming out this year, in the next year, right?

(24m 2s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(24m 4s) **Al:**

> Like, it's not coming out a couple of years ago,

(24m 7s)

> it's not coming out in a couple of years,

(24m 8s)

> it's coming out now at the time,

(24m 11s)

> just before the next generation of games,

(24m 12s)

> which is almost certainly coming next year.

(24m 13s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, you're right. You're right, but what I'm getting at is that maybe in Gen 10

(24m 19s)

> There will be an option to throw the Pokeball yourself or to engage in a

(24m 26s)

> Turn-based traditional battle where you can just click the button to throw the ball

(24m 30s) **Al:**

> Kind of like how legends are kissed I guess you could do where you encountered the Pokemon

(24m 33s) **Nama:**

> Yes, very similar to Legends Arcius

(24m 35s) **Al:**

> Yeah, maybe I'd be okay with that

(24m 37s)

> I mean personally, I love what they've done with this game, and I would be sad if they they went backwards to kind of what legends are

(24m 38s) **Nama:**

> Yeah

(24m 44s) **Al:**

> Arceus had

(24m 45s)

> But I would much prefer that to house garland violet did it right like I like the let's go modern scarlet and violet. I like this more

(24m 54s) **Nama:**

> Okay cool

(24m 55s) **Al:**

> Hmm so many thoughts

(24m 58s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I'm sure I mean what are we at where we were half an hour into this podcast and we haven't started the podcast yet

(25m) **Al:**

> You know, we're three weeks after a Pokemon game release of course we're gonna be talking with that

(25m 6s) **Nama:**

> But I have a feeling that happens a lot

(25m 15s) **Al:**

> All right. Okay. Well, that's what we've been up to

## Feedback

(25m 19s) **Al:**

> We'll probably chapped to that Pokemon section

(25m 23s)

> Let's talk about some feedback. We've got two feedbacks first of all

(25m 27s)

> We have a comment on Spotify from ours.

(25m 30s)

> I'm a regular Spotify commenter, Jack. Thank you, Jack, for your comment.

(25m 34s)

> Jack says, "Nice podcast peeps."

(25m 37s)

> This is a comment on the harvest moon.

(25m 41s)

> No, it was the other games of the years where Cody and Kev went back before the podcast

(25m 49s)

> and chose a game of the year, a farming game of the year for every year before the podcast.

(25m 57s)

> Back to when the first harvest moon came out.

(26m)

> So, Jack says, "Hody chose correctly between harvest moon 64 and back to nature.

(26m 7s)

> By the way, the game in harvest moon for girl, I believe that the game ends if you get pregnant/have a baby, but the boy version doesn't if you get married."

(26m 16s)

> So, whoa.

(26m 19s)

> Just so, you know, clearly back then they decided that a woman's ultimate goal is pregnancy and then she may as well we did.

(26m 30s)

[laughter]

(26m 31s) **Nama:**

> I don't even know if I want to touch this one.

(26m 39s)

> Yeah, that's what are you going to do, right? Like,

(26m 45s)

> that's just the way the world works out.

(26m 46s) **Al:**

> It's not 30 years any go. I'll go anymore.

(26m 54s) **Nama:**

> Okay, so I will say about that is that I found your speed run tactic.

(26m 59s) **Al:**

> I don't know if that's it's certainly nowhere near some of the other speedruns that some of the other games had like

(27m 6s)

> Harvest Harvest Moon a wonderful life for example where you can just say no to going to the farm and then the credit roll

(27m 12s) **Nama:**

> Oh

(27m 14s) **Al:**

> There was another one that was mentioned. I think in that podcast, but I can't remember what it was

(27m 18s)

> But yeah, there's a few games that had funny funny endings like that

(27m 23s)

> The other piece of feedback is our self piece of feedback

(27m 26s)

> I had said in the last episode

(27m 29s)

> that I saw people talking about the fact that crafting would use the house storage, but I had no evidence for that and I was no idea where people were getting from turns out

(27m 43s)

> you got it from the news section on the eShop where it talks about the update. It specifically says

(27m 49s)

> you can now make sure to work of crafting by crafting items in batches and pulling materials directly from your storage.

(27m 58s) **Nama:**

> Oh, man

(27m 59s) **Al:**

> So we have confirmation that it does use your storage for crafting.

(28m 3s) **Nama:**

> What a dream come true. I just man that's so awesome

(28m 9s) **Al:**

> It only took five and a half years to get this feature.

(28m 11s) **Nama:**

> That's exactly what I was thinking and I wasn't gonna say it, but like like okay

(28m 17s)

> You said this last week. There's there's clearly a design philosophy

(28m 22s)

> With making people grab it out of their storage making one at a time running out

(28m 28s)

> Things in your pocket going back in pulling it out from storage again like somebody or many people on the team wanted that

(28m 36s)

> Very intentional action of doing it. Maybe that like

(28m 39s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(28m 41s)

> Did they quit?

(28m 41s) **Nama:**

> Ferthers the roleplay like it. It maybe it furthers the roleplay of of being out on your own and everything cuz I don't know cuz

(28m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(28m 50s) **Nama:**

> The I feel like the the first month of you being it or maybe even the first week of you being on the island

(28m 58s)

> Is where people were really excited about this crafting stuff?

(29m 3s)

> But by the time that you have it just looking like any other community in animal crossing

(29m 8s)

> It's it's your your dough with it. You're like, okay. I don't need to do this anymore

(29m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so here's my theory is that this is an upgrade that you purchase because that would allow

(29m 15s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, what can I

(29m 20s)

> Okay, yeah, that makes up

(29m 23s) **Al:**

> them to still have that early game experience where you're still crafting things one by one and

(29m 27s) **Nama:**

> Oh, yeah, totally.

(29m 27s) **Al:**

> grabbing things at the storage. But this is like Tom comes to you and he's like, Oh, we've got another

(29m 33s)

> upgrade for your house. We can do we can link it to your crafting table and that allows you to

(29m 38s)

> multi-craft and get stuff out your story Jotamat.

(29m 41s)

> I've got so much to do to get back to a sensible star rating on my island because I found

(29m 41s) **Nama:**

> Watch them

(29m 47s)

> Watch them lock that behind five star islands or something like that like

(29m 53s)

> Time to throw out everything onto the lawn

(30m 4s) **Al:**

> it's the last episode I think I'd said I wasn't sure where my island was.

(30m 8s)

> It turns out it was on my switch too.

(30m 11s) **Nama:**

> there you go yes would did it ask you um hey there's no profile attached to this island

(30m 11s) **Al:**

> which is a very sensible place for it to be.

(30m 20s) **Nama:**

> yeah and I i'd turn that on and I was like oh no

(30m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah, media panic, but it was fine.

(30m 26s) **Nama:**

> yeah yeah yeah yeah yes right

(30m 26s) **Al:**

> It's a thing you do whenever you transfer it between switches.

(30m 29s)

> It's just obviously presumably that was your first time doing it.

(30m 31s)

> If this is your your your second switch console that you bought.

(30m 37s)

> But yeah, no, it's all there, it's all good,

(30m 39s)

> but apparently.

(30m 41s)

> When I last played the game, I was midway through a renovation.

(30m 46s)

> What I had done was I had created a water island where everything was like, it was like an

(30m 58s)

> atoll, right, where everything was around the edge and the middle was just water.

(31m 5s)

> And I'm like halfway through returning it to being land, which means that I've got these

(31m 9s)

> like strips of...

(31m 11s)

> ...and not watering between them all. So it's going to take no way to finish that up.

(31m 13s) **Nama:**

> Now we keep talking about animal crossing, when we have a whole section devoted to talking about animal crossing.

## Game News

(31m 24s) **Al:**

> Well, should we talk about some other game news then?

(31m 27s) **Nama:**

> Yes, I'm happy to do that.

(31m 29s) **Al:**

> So this is where we talk about all the games that Nami doesn't know

(31m 34s)

> First up, we have grimoire groves. They've announced that their console release is coming in Q1 next year

(31m 41s)

> That is switch and Xbox and includes a physical switch version including

(31m 46s)

> deluxe edition

(31m 49s)

> that comes with as I zoom into this low quality

(31m 54s)

> image. If the physical game, a pin set, stickers, an artbook, and the sound track on a CD.

(32m 5s) **Nama:**

> I love a good CD.

(32m 6s) **Al:**

> So I, I presume you have not played this game. I played this game and I was fine. It was not for me.

(32m 16s)

> Yes. Yes.

(32m 17s) **Nama:**

> I like the color scheme. The the theming of it's very nice.

(32m 24s) **Al:**

> Well, it's a roguelite, so that'll.

(32m 26s) **Nama:**

> Oh, well, they it seals the deal for you.

(32m 29s)

> The one thing that I'll say here is that these are some nice-looking pins.

(32m 34s)

> But I did have a question. So this is a kickstarter, right? And this is the update

(32m 35s) **Al:**

> Yeah? Correct.

(32m 39s) **Nama:**

> talking about the physical game release. That's great. What? So you do a lot of kickstarters,

(32m 43s) **Al:**

> Mm hmm.

(32m 47s) **Nama:**

> at least maybe you slowed down recently. What do you think is the average timeline for

(32m 54s)

> these kickstarter games that come to Steam and then then finally get their console release.

(33m)

> Be it. I don't know. Be it PlayStation first or Nintendo first or wherever it sure.

(33m 2s) **Al:**

> I mean, the average game doesn't come to any consoles, I would say.

(33m 7s) **Nama:**

> That's, that's, that's very valid.

(33m 8s) **Al:**

> It's years though, right?

(33m 13s)

> So let's take this one as an example.

(33m 18s)

> Grimark roves it originally was with the campaign, that's what I'm looking for.

(33m 26s)

> Wars are widely removed the date on it.

(33m 32s)

> Let's say there was a date there, I need to go to, I know I can find this information

(33m 37s)

> somewhere without just scrolling through all the updates.

(33m 40s)

> At July 2023, so this game is actually a very quick game in doing what it's doing.

(33m 46s)

> I'm very impressed with this.

(33m 47s)

> So it kickstarted in July of 2023, it's estimated game release was April's 2024.

(33m 55s)

> The game actually came out early this year, so surprisingly quick, but obviously it's

(33m 58s) **Nama:**

> - Wow, okay, that is a really fast turnaround.

(34m 2s) **Al:**

> delayed, like every game, and now less than a year later they've got their, well, I guess

(34m 9s)

> it will be about a year later getting their Switch and Xbox.

(34m 12s)

> So that's very fast for these games.

(34m 15s)

> Most of the games don't even come out in the first place.

(34m 22s)

> And all of those that do, they come out on PC, like I would say maybe two to three years

(34m 29s)

> late. That's pretty standard for these kickstart again.

(34m 32s)

> they all undressed me how long it's going to be every single way.

(34m 37s)

> Almost every single one. There's maybe been two games that have kickstarted that have come out on time.

(34m 42s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah, I get that.

(34m 45s)

> The big projects.

(34m 45s) **Al:**

> The rest, I think two years, two to three years would probably be average for how late they come out.

(34m 53s)

> And then there's only been a handful that have ever come to consoles and it's maybe a year or two later.

(34m 59s)

> because what they tend to do is like,

(35m 2s)

> the game until we're finished on PC and then that means that the clock starts then and then they have to get a porting team to do it because of course they don't know how to make switch games, they don't know how to make PlayStation game. It's almost always switch right.

(35m 13s) **Nama:**

> Gotcha, okay, right the indie machine

(35m 17s) **Al:**

> Exactly, exactly. Sometimes it's Xbox because if they've used the Microsoft development tools, it is a button press to release on Xbox.

(35m 27s) **Nama:**

> Great yeah, so is it pretty? Yeah, is it pretty common for games that use those tools to come out on both Xbox and Nintendo or

(35m 29s) **Al:**

> assuming obviously there's always bugs in that sort.

(35m 32s)

> But they don't have to start from scratch there, but that's assuming that they've used those tools.

(35m 44s)

> Yeah, I would say that they tend to come out on Xbox at the same time as PC if they're using

(35m 44s) **Nama:**

> They pretty much satisfied with coming up

(35m 52s) **Al:**

> those tools because they will like be able to do that at the same time and Xbox even has an

(35m 53s) **Nama:**

> Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

(35m 57s) **Al:**

> early access program as well. But they almost all still want to come on Switch because that's where

(36m 4s)

> ever like more than I saw multiple games show the percentages of people asking for content.

(36m 14s)

> And it was something like 70% asking for Switch. So that just gives you the indication of how

(36m 22s)

> high popular this Switch is for people who, you know, play these indie games.

(36m 27s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, cool.

(36m 29s) **Al:**

> The others are still there, but they're splitting the 30%.

(36m 37s)

> All right, next we have an update for Moonlight in Garland. They have released their Let's

(36m 41s)

> get cooking update, but you can guess what kind.

(36m 44s)

> with this update. Well, yes. Gicking in general. The list of a bunch of other stuff relating to

(36m 46s) **Nama:**

> Deserts. Yeah.

(36m 56s) **Al:**

> the food, right? Obviously, the other characters in the game have favorite foods, and you can give

(37m 1s)

> them to them, or buff them, etc, etc. There's kind of pretty standard cottage core stuff. But if

(37m 8s)

> But if you've been enjoying Finland and Garland, there is another update.

(37m 12s) **Nama:**

> the

(37m 13s)

> Overworld art style of this game kind of looks like it would be on like a Windows PC game circa 2002

(37m 21s) **Al:**

> Hmm. Yeah. I'm thinking Facebook flash game.

(37m 21s) **Nama:**

> That's what I have to say

(37m 29s)

> Yeah, okay, so you're picking up a similar thing. It's like, hm, but the I don't know the

(37m 37s)

> The character and the writing seems pretty good. So I can understand people getting

(37m 42s) **Al:**

> Do you know the portraits, the conversation portraits feel uncanny valley to me?

(37m 49s) **Nama:**

> I could see that with some of these characters, like half of them seem pretty standard and then the other half, they're something like weird going on with the eyes.

(37m 59s) **Al:**

> they want to murder me, like Ryan is horrifying. But yeah, you're right, it's not all of them.

(38m 2s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, they're like looking right out of the TV.

(38m 10s)

> Yeah.

(38m 10s) **Al:**

> Like April looks pretty chill, kind of casual. He's going postal soon.

(38m 14s) **Nama:**

> Oh yeah, I'm looking at Ryan right now. He knows something.

(38m 20s)

> Yeah, this is really good for audio, but I'm telling you guys.

(38m 24s)

> He is one bad haircut away from popping out of your screen and coming

(38m 28s) **Al:**

> All right, next we have an update for Hello Kitty Island adventure.

(38m 36s)

> This is, well, sorry, not an update, an event because they love their events.

(38m 41s)

> This is the days of plenty event. Celebrate the changing seasons with new

(38m 45s)

> adorable outfits and cozy woodland furniture. Have you played Hello Kitty Island adventure?

(38m 51s) **Nama:**

> No, I checked it out from the library and I never turned it on.

(38m 55s)

> It seemed like, well, I mean, everybody was talking about it, but the thing for me being

(38m 58s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm.

(39m 2s) **Nama:**

> outside of this bubble just, but next to the bubble is I thought it had come out much sooner

(39m 8s)

> that it did.

(39m 11s)

> People were like talking about it for a really long time and then people stopped talking

(39m 14s)

> about it and then it came out and I was like, oh, I thought that was already out.

(39m 18s) **Al:**

> So that'll be because first came out on Apple Arcade two years ago, I want to say.

(39m 21s) **Nama:**

> Oh, okay, all right, this, you've, you've unlocked something for me.

(39m 28s) **Al:**

> And then this year is when he came out on Switch and PC.

(39m 34s)

> Yeah, I feel like it was the, it was 2023. I feel like, yeah, July 2023 for Apple Arcade.

(39m 40s) **Nama:**

> You want to know why I had this disconnect so pronounced the sound?

(39m 45s) **Al:**

> Is it my fault?

(39m 46s) **Nama:**

> No, no, no, no. It could be. But no, the sound from South Park where he's like,

(39m 48s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah, yeah.

(39m 51s) **Nama:**

> "I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure," and that was everywhere for a long like on TikTok and

(39m 57s)

> places. And so it was in my head that people were playing this game, but it wasn't out.

(40m 3s)

> And I was like, "How does this happen?" So yeah, it being a mobile game first

(40m 10s)

> me. Okay, like I'm fully on board with everything now.

(40m 13s) **Al:**

> but also that episode came out in 2016.

(40m 17s) **Nama:**

> Oh my gosh, yeah. Okay, so I'm back to me and confused. What?

(40m 23s) **Al:**

> That the game didn't exist when that episode came out.

(40m 26s) **Nama:**

> Oh my gosh. I'm totally being played right now. That is so funny. Okay, so they just like

(40m 34s)

> encouraged the Hello Kitty brand to make it. I'm sorry.

(40m 37s) **Al:**

> Well, so well, okay.

(40m 39s)

> Here we go.

(40m 40s)

> We're diving deep.

(40m 40s) **Nama:**

> I'm so sorry.

(40m 41s) **Al:**

> No, no, do not apologize.

(40m 43s)

> There is an interview or there's an article on the verge.

(40m 47s)

> Let me throw this in the show notes so you can look at it

(40m 49s) **Nama:**

> You go. All right.

(40m 50s) **Al:**

> and I will put it in the show notes for the podcast

(40m 54s)

> when I release.

(40m 56s)

> Apparently the makers of the game have said

(41m)

> that they didn't know about this

(41m 2s)

> when they announced it, the name is a coincidence.

(41m 6s) **Nama:**

> Wow

(41m 7s) **Al:**

> Not 2016, 2006.

(41m 9s) **Nama:**

> No

(41m 13s) **Al:**

> So 2006, I've parked an episode

(41m 16s)

> with what was it butters was the character.

(41m 20s)

> I've never seen South Park,

(41m 21s) **Nama:**

> Uh-huh, no. I've only ever seen clips. Yeah.

(41m 21s) **Al:**

> so I am totally in the blind.

(41m 23s)

> Apparently the character is called butters.

(41m 25s)

> And he refuses to play World of Warcraft

(41m 29s)

> because he is playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure

(41m 31s)

> and that clip from the game went wild on TikTok.

(41m 37s)

> And six, and apparently this is, yeah,

(41m 39s)

> I think that the coincidentally came up with.

(41m 44s) **Nama:**

> I'm speechless. I cannot believe this. What a rollercoaster I've been on in the past two minutes.

(41m 49s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(41m 50s) **Nama:**

> This is crazy. Okay, so it's one of those Simpsons predicted at moments. It's just that's just where we're at.

(41m 59s) **Al:**

> I also believe that South Park did and I'd follow up on the joke in 2023 after the release I haven't seen it.

(42m 5s) **Nama:**

> Well, they had to they were obligated to

(42m 10s)

> Wow, okay, well that is my fun fact for the day

(42m 16s) **Al:**

> All righty. So that is the days of plenty event for Hello Kitty Island adventure.

(42m 21s)

> It is live now until the 18th of November. So if you're listening to this on release day,

(42m 28s)

> you have six days left. Next, we have our final update for the game, which is light

(42m 36s)

> your frontier. Have released their country roads or not have not released are going to release

(42m 41s)

> their country roads update that's out on the 17th of November.

(42m 46s)

> And this includes a bunch of stuff that I think only really makes sense if you've played the game.

(42m 56s)

> You can all objects with your mix. I didn't realize that you had mix that couldn't actually haul anything. That feels like a pretty fundamental part of it.

(43m 4s) **Nama:**

> Seems like, yeah, like an oversight.

(43m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah, and a bunch of other things, roads and bridges, new progression, advanced oils to make your neck last.

(43m 17s) **Nama:**

> You know, I'm sure I'm sure the light your frontier people are rejoicing that they are going to last longer like

(43m 23s) **Al:**

> If finally some advanced oils, I consider playing this game once a month, but I still haven't.

(43m 32s) **Nama:**

> Sure, I so they're it satisfies a very

(43m 37s)

> specific niche of

(43m 39s)

> People that like farming games, but are also really into trucks

(43m 43s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(43m 45s)

> Yeah, yeah.

(43m 45s) **Nama:**

> Like I can imagine

(43m 47s)

> Like a very specific kind of 12-year-old kid who enjoys Minecraft and is like stepping into more games like it and then finding this and we're like, "Oh my gosh! This is awesome!"

(44m 5s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, this is way, you're totally right.

(44m 8s)

> It's a way for young guys to be able to play farming games

(44m 12s)

> without feeling like they're playing a girly game.

(44m 15s) **Nama:**

> Uh-huh. That's like, that's what I'm picking up.

(44m 15s) **Al:**

> That's exactly what it is.

(44m 18s)

> It's Eurotruck Simulator Cross, farming simulator.

(44m 22s) **Nama:**

> Mm-hmm. Like you get sick paint jobs and your machines are rusting and it's all very, very cool,

(44m 22s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(44m 29s) **Nama:**

> but you're also planting seeds for your pumpkins.

(44m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(44m 32s)

> Yes. But we.

(44m 35s)

> You know, put on a lot of that stuff in school, right when you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, I, I watch robot wars, I'm cool.

(44m 36s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. One day that masculine urge will take you over out.

(44m 54s)

[laughing]

(44m 58s)

> Yep.

(45m)

> You guys ever heard of Mega's XLR?

(45m 5s) **Al:**

> We, that's the game update news. We also have some new games to talk about.

## New Games

(45m 9s) **Nama:**

> - Oh boy.

(45m 10s) **Al:**

> So, all your excitement, Nami, calm down.

(45m 14s) **Nama:**

[laughing]

(45m 15s) **Al:**

> I can't handle the amount of excitement there.

(45m 18s) **Nama:**

> Oh, I'm happy.

(45m 19s)

> These people were working on these games for a long time.

(45m 21s)

> We got to highlight them,

(45m 22s)

> and we got to give them their flowers.

(45m 24s) **Al:**

> Well, first up, this is quite, quite the game. We have Farney our village, and this is a game that's made by the lead programmer of

(45m 35s)

> factory, three, who is also the director of Rinfactory four, and the person who wrote the narrative for both Rinfactory three and four.

(45m 44s)

> So this is like, you know, we've got farming game royalty here.

(45m 52s)

> And let me tell you, I can tell that they worked on Rinfactory three and Rinfactory four.

(45m 58s) **Nama:**

[laughing]

(45m 59s) **Al:**

> This is basically what if Rinfactory five didn't go through 3D?

(46m 5s) **Nama:**

> I see. Okay. I got you. There's going to be a little divorce here in the fan

(46m 6s) **Al:**

> That's that's what this feels like to me.

(46m 12s)

> Possibly, possibly. Yeah, I can see why somebody would prefer this, because like, when you go from Rinfactory four to Rinfactory five, it was such a big shift, right?

(46m 23s)

> It's, it's like, it's not, I was going to say it's like going from Sun and Moon to Sword and Shield, but it's not even that it's, I feel like it's going from

(46m 35s)

> a gen five. So black and white. Yeah, no, no, no, gen five to gen eight. I feel like it's going from black and white to Sword and Shield. Like it's, it's a bigger jump.

(46m 38s) **Nama:**

> 10, five to six.

(46m 42s)

> Oh, yeah, that is a big jump.

(46m 49s)

> Yeah, what about, I mean, I don't even know,

(46m 54s)

> but like the Sonics, like 2D Sonic or 3D Sonic?

(46m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. And the thing is that they're very fundamentally different styles of gameplay.

(47m 4s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, different design philosophies.

(47m 6s) **Al:**

> And not just that, but just in terms of actual gameplay as well, because it's interesting,

(47m 11s)

> you chose that as an example, because I love 2D Sonic games and I hate 3D Sonic games.

(47m 15s) **Nama:**

> Mm-hmm.

(47m 18s) **Al:**

> So yeah, yeah, I totally get why somebody,

(47m 19s) **Nama:**

> Get in line.

(47m 21s) **Al:**

> I totally get why somebody would like a new Renfactory that is in the style of three or four.

(47m 28s)

> I personally, I'm not a huge fan of any of the Renfactory, so I'm probably not going to pick this one up.

(47m 34s)

> But if you like your farming games, but you want them to have some swords,

(47m 40s)

> this is where you're looking at. And if you like your farming games that also have some swords to

(47m 45s)

> also be, you know, top down 2D-ish, obviously it's 3D, 3D graphics, it's not sprites,

(47m 53s)

> But you get in what I'm saying like the that style of grid

(47m 56s) **Nama:**

> Yeah

(47m 58s) **Al:**

> top down farming or site not like 45 degree. I don't know. Is there a term for that? Because we've got top is not top down. It's not said on it's 45 degree

(48m 9s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Um, there probably is. I can't think of it.

(48m 13s) **Al:**

> Diagonally diagonal camera

(48m 14s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(48m 16s)

> What is which game was it that where all of the sprites are like position weird?

(48m 21s)

> Is that animal crossing? Is that something else? Like the game cube animal crossing?

(48m 25s)

> There's there's a game where, uh, to get the angle right? All of the sprites are like tilted at an angle.

(48m 32s) **Al:**

> Oh, right. Okay. It was like a technical limitation sort of thing.

(48m 32s) **Nama:**

> Um, I'm trying to remember what that is.

(48m 36s)

> Yeah, they had in order to get the perspective.

(48m 39s)

> Right. Maybe it was seldom. Yeah. Anyway, we'll put it somewhere, you can correct yourself next week.

(48m 42s) **Al:**

> It's ringing bells. It's ringing bells what you're saying.

(48m 47s)

> Maybe or we'll or we'll forget and never mention

(48m 50s) **Nama:**

> I'm going to go out on a limb and say it was the 3DS Zelda game, the, the, um, you know, the one with the low world and all that link between world.

(49m) **Al:**

[laughs]

(49m 4s)

> Ling between worlds wasn't 3DS, was it?

(49m 7s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, it was.

(49m 8s) **Al:**

> Was it now game by advance?

(49m 9s) **Nama:**

> There's link to the past and link between worlds, which is the 3ds game. Anyway, that I'm going on a limb saying it was linked between worlds where they they put them out of an angle.

(49m 15s) **Al:**

> So it is. Look, look, look, they keep making the puns.

(49m 19s)

> Stop making the pun. I can't keep all these names in my head.

(49m 24s)

> It doesn't help. I've not played this one.

(49m 26s) **Nama:**

> Right, it's on my list.

(49m 28s) **Al:**

> Oh, it's on my list as well, but the problem was I was going through

(49m 31s)

> the Zelda games in release order, and I got to Ocarina of time and when I hate this.

(49m 33s) **Nama:**

> That's right, that's right.

(49m 36s)

> I told you to do that. That was my mission free.

(49m 39s)

> When you failed me well do pivot go to the just play the rest of the 2D ones. Oh sure of course yeah

(49m 40s) **Al:**

> I hate it, Ocarina of time. It's not a fun game.

(49m 46s)

> Oh, sure. That's on my list to do at some point, but the problem is I just I stopped.

(49m 52s)

> So my next game is Oracle Seasons. It's there on my list to play.

(49m 57s)

> It's even on my switch. I have it on the, what's it called?

(50m 2s)

> Nintendo online subscription thing.

(50m 4s) **Nama:**

> This is my call to action to people out there listening has anybody played those game world colors all the games

(50m 10s)

> I feel like nobody has played those games people have played links are awakening

(50m 14s)

> Yeah, people have played links are weakening all the live long day

(50m 17s)

> And there's like a fan base for minish cap on the Game Boy Advance

(50m 20s)

> But I I have not met one person who's like oh, I love Oracle of seasons and eighties

(50m 25s) **Al:**

> It's just on my list. I'll play them at some point, but I just need I still I'm still not over occurring of time. Okay, that that was I enjoyed Zelda 2 and I hated Ocarina of time.

(50m 33s) **Nama:**

> that's too bad we do not have time to talk about this blast for me that is

(50m 37s) **Al:**

> I, it's sure. Oh, sure. And would I have enjoyed it? How'd I played it at the time? Maybe, but it's like going back and playing Mario 64. They're not it's it's it's

(50m 40s) **Nama:**

> ocarina of time debacle because it's such a formative game for so many people

(50m 53s) **Al:**

> games.

(50m 54s) **Nama:**

> And now you've made the Mario 64 people really mad.

(50m 56s) **Al:**

> I've said this before and I will say it again Mario 64 is not a good game.

(51m 1s)

> It was historic and it was important and it needs to have its place and it should be celebrated for what it was.

(51m 10s)

> But do not go in if you've not played the game before.

(51m 13s)

> You will not go into it and have a good time.

(51m 16s)

> That's all I'm saying, right?

(51m 19s)

> And it's not even the controls.

(51m 20s) **Nama:**

> or I think it's the controls.

(51m 21s) **Al:**

> controls are a bit finicky, right, but they're fine. It's the camera.

(51m 25s) **Nama:**

> I think it's the controls.

(51m 25s) **Al:**

> No, it's the camera. We need it. We needed that second joystick before 3D games became actually good. That's that's all I'm

(51m 26s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(51m 28s)

> Okay.

(51m 29s)

> Anyways.

(51m 30s)

[laughing]

(51m 34s)

> Oh yeah.

(51m 35s)

> Unless you're playing Banjo-Kazooie

(51m 37s)

> where they got the camera right.

(51m 39s)

> That's the, if you're playing a 3D game on the N64,

(51m 42s)

> Banjo-Kazooie is the best use of the camera,

(51m 45s)

> like even besides Z targeting,

(51m 47s)

> which I could even have timed it.

(51m 50s) **Al:**

> Yeah. No, my issue with Ocarina time was the platforming and the controls for combat.

(51m 56s) **Nama:**

> Oh, yeah. I'll forgive you for that. You can get really good at the combat. You can't get really good at the jumping.

(52m 3s) **Al:**

> It would like if I did you ever play Crash Bandicoot?

(52m 7s) **Nama:**

> Uh, a couple times.

(52m 8s) **Al:**

> Oh my word, like I love that game when I was a kid.

(52m 12s)

> But I tried to go back to it and it's just horrible the platforming.

(52m 15s) **Nama:**

> It's unforgiving. It is just, it's like, um, dragon's lair, where you just have to know.

(52m 24s) **Al:**

> and even then like you're gonna fail four times before you get it. Just dreadful.

(52m 30s)

> 8-8-8-8. There are some games I can go back to and there are some games again.

(52m 34s)

> Again, when was the last time you went back to the first Pokemon game?

(52m 41s) **Nama:**

> Um, it's probably been like five years or so. I was probably like a year after they came out on 3DS

(52m 50s) **Al:**

> every time, every time I go back to them, I remember why I don't

(52m 50s) **Nama:**

> which is, yeah.

(52m 55s)

> I, oh, okay. I remember when it was actually when I played stadium. It was five years ago. It was for the 25th

(53m)

> anniversary and I played on an OG Game Boy and I like going back to the old Pokemon games

(53m 9s)

> because of...

(53m 11s)

> The nostalgia factor, specifically like sitting within the confines of 1998 with your Game Boy with the cables watching the anime, I like engrossing myself in that, but I mean, you can't go to the PC.

(53m 12s) **Al:**

> Yes.

(53m 27s) **Nama:**

> just avoid that at all cost.

(53m 27s) **Al:**

> No, it's, yeah, I hate them. So bad. I think that's the thing is I think that's

(53m 33s)

> how these games still survive in public consciousness. It's because of the nostalgia.

(53m 39s)

> And I do think that if I'd played them at the time, I would have enjoyed them, but it's not the same thing.

(53m 46s)

> I mean, I had fun with Mario 64, but like it's, it's in my opinion, the worst of the three

(53m 53s)

> details. But just people

(53m 57s)

> want to agree with me with the best, which is sunshine. I don't everybody marks sunshine as the worst. I think it's the best 3d Mario second best sorry Bowser's Fury's the best.

(54m 1s) **Nama:**

> Well, see, that's the thing is I have a better I have a better opinion of Sunshine now,

(54m 10s)

> but like the thing that you're talking about, which is the camera and the controls a little

(54m 15s)

> bit, that for me applies to Sunshine, like it really, I think because it seems like it

(54m 21s)

> should control like Galaxy, it seems modern enough, but they were really still only just

(54m 27s)

> figuring out all of this stuff. Sunshine was like 2003.

(54m 31s)

> It was not long into all of this stuff.

(54m 34s) **Al:**

> It doesn't, but this is the thing, it feels decades better than Mario 64 in my opinion.

(54m 39s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I mean, they made a lot of progress in that time.

(54m 40s) **Al:**

> Like even just, even just the graphics, it feels like someone just turned on graphics between those two

(54m 43s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(54m 47s)

> Exactly. I know what you're talking about.

(54m 51s)

> I don't know, especially when you were like, our first coming back to it after a while,

(54m 55s)

> you're like, oh man, I cannot control this. By the time you're like a couple hours into it,

(55m 1s)

> but that's probably, yeah. Anyway.

(55m 2s) **Al:**

> That's that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. Yes. Uh, yeah, this is not a Mario podcast. Uh,

(55m 8s) **Nama:**

> The funny village, go play it if you like.

(55m 9s) **Al:**

> anyway, far near village, uh, there's a blur about, I'll, I'll quickly go through the

(55m 15s)

> blurb, uh, a game shapes by the fantasy world you, you'd love to live in. You remember

(55m 20s)

> nothing but your own name and begin and have a new life in a peaceful village that is exactly

(55m 24s)

> how every room factory has started. Tell the soil, go fishing, cook, forge, fall in love,

(55m 32s)

> explore the world and teach a mysterious girl what it means to enjoy a meal. That sounds

(55m 36s)

> weird. I don't know. That sounds really weird. I don't like any of that sentence. Ever

(55m 37s) **Nama:**

> Why is it in quotes?

(55m 42s)

> I don't know, okay.

(55m 47s) **Al:**

> wish the world kept going after the story ends so you could live your daily life there.

(55m 51s)

> No worries. This is a game where you can continue your days in the world you've completed.

(55m 56s)

> Um, I'm gonna say that probably, uh, this is like translated by either

(56m 2s)

> people whose first language is Japanese or automatically translated and that explains kind

(56m 7s)

> of the some of the weirdness in the, the wording there. But basically what they've just described

(56m 9s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Cool. Makes sense to me.

(56m 12s) **Al:**

> there is rim factory. So kickstarters live if it sounds like what you want. If you want

(56m 20s)

> a new rim factory, that's not 3d. That, that's who you are. You know who you are. Next we have

(56m 25s) **Nama:**

> I'm going to say Delfinie.

(56m 27s) **Al:**

> Delphinium or Delphinium, I'm undecided.

(56m 33s)

> Yes, let's go with Delphinium, a farming sim in which cultivating connections with those around you matters just as much as growing crops sometimes even more so.

(56m 43s)

> I mean that sounds like stargy to me.

(56m 47s) **Nama:**

> Well

(56m 47s) **Al:**

> One interesting choice of blurb.

(56m 52s) **Nama:**

> See the blurb sounds like stardew, but when you look at this trailer

(56m 55s)

> I got to tell you out of all the games. We're talking about today

(56m 58s)

> Maybe besides Animal Crossing. This is the most interesting to me

(57m 1s)

> I really like the art style that they're going for and the game structure of it

(57m 7s)

> They're really highlighting besides the farming. They're highlighting this

(57m 11s)

> Conversation system that they've built and there's like skill trees, but there's people

(57m 17s)

> on them and you know connecting concepts to relationships and goals to

(57m 25s)

> Concepts and it looks really interesting

(57m 28s) **Al:**

> So I would say I agree with you and that it all looks very interesting, but it also looks like hell.

(57m 34s)

> I don't want to play a game that does that, like I think it sounds like someone's gone,

(57m 34s) **Nama:**

[laughter]

(57m 39s) **Al:**

> here's a really interesting concept for the game, but not actually thought about whether it would be fun

(57m 44s)

> to play or not. I don't know, I know people enjoy different things and maybe people will enjoy this,

(57m 45s) **Nama:**

> Sure. Yeah.

(57m 50s) **Al:**

> but it just feels like work to me, like we're doing this weird spreadsheet thing.

(57m 54s) **Nama:**

> Well, I don't know, I think there is a fundamental like personality difference here is that

(58m 2s)

> like I do like relationships in gaming and in real life and keeping things, I mean,

(58m 8s) **Al:**

> wow, harsh much. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I don't think it's the social aspect that I

(58m 10s) **Nama:**

> I'm not saying that, but I don't know, I think it's fair to say that I'm a little more social than you

(58m 15s)

> are. And so making a game about social activity would be fun for me.

(58m 24s)

> The spreadsheet.

(58m 24s) **Al:**

> dislike. It's the, yeah, it's, well, I mean, it's not obviously not especially as a graph,

(58m 31s)

> but it just feels like a fancy wheel making a spreadsheet, right? Like it's,

(58m 38s)

> I don't know, it's just maybe a part of the issue, I think, is that it feels more management game-y

(58m 44s)

> style-y, that aspect of it, rather than the rest of it, right? Which I've talked about never massively

(58m 46s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. And maybe we're talking about a fraction of what this game is. They really highlight this

(58m 50s) **Al:**

> enjoying. Possibly.

(58m 57s) **Nama:**

> a lot in several moments in this trailer, but they're also showing your regular crops and fishing

(59m 3s)

> minigames and navigating the world map and all that. So there's a lot more going on, but it definitely

(59m 12s)

> seems like the major hook is this and they say it in the

(59m 18s) **Al:**

> I'm glad you brought up the fishing game. I, fishing minigame. I, I like the look of this

> fishing minigame. It's very rare that we actually get a new concept for the fishing minigame.

(59m 28s) **Nama:**

> Uh-huh, it's different.

(59m 29s) **Al:**

> They're normally, they're normally like either it's the starchy way or it's the animal crossing

(59m 34s)

> way and it's maybe slightly tweaked, but this looks very different.

(59m 38s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, for people who haven't seen it, it looks kind of like an FPS a little bit, you've got the fish on this circle, and you've got a reticle, and you're trying to keep the fish inside of your reticle, which is a little bit like Stardew, but as opposed to that going up and down, this is kind of navigating across the disk.

(59m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I feel like there's much more control over it than Stardew, which is why I like the look of it, right?

(1h 5s)

> Where it's Stardew is like you you have to press you it's one button press it's press press to raise it and if you raise it to high

(1h 13s)

> You're probably lost fish whereas this is like you're you're constantly aiming to get to the fish

(1h 19s)

> And so if you make a wrong move you just like go back up and left you don't have to wait for it to come back down with gravity

(1h 27s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah, lots of agency, but I mean, you know, we're talking about a fishing game

(1h 33s)

> But it could be a lot of work. You got to be very involved with it

(1h 35s)

> You can't just wait for it your controller to rumble or for the thing to make a sound and hit the button

(1h 42s)

> But yeah, it does I I do see your point about it being a new take which is not common

(1h 48s) **Al:**

> And I do think I'm not I'm not against the animal crossing way of just wait until I'm impressed the

(1h 53s)

> button. Um, I could think there are advantages of that because I think these mini games do get a bit

(1h 59s)

> boring after you've played a hundred hours of a game. Um, but, um, I think if you're going to do

(1h 1m 1s) **Nama:**

> Uh-huh, right.

(1h 1m 5s) **Al:**

> something, do something, don't just be like, oh, we're going to do the starchy thing, right? Like

(1h 1m 9s) **Nama:**

> What I want is a way to ensure the least amount of failure is possible.

(1h 1m 10s) **Al:**

> that's been done. And it was fine, but like try something else or don't bother. I would

(1h 1m 24s) **Nama:**

> I really dislike when I throw my line, especially if I'm using bait,

(1h 1m 29s)

> you know, a resource that I'm losing.

(1h 1m 32s)

> And then I fail it and I have to like cast my line again that stuff is really discouraging to me when I'm wasting time or resources.

(1h 1m 41s)

> So if it's something that you can get good at that, you know, takes away a little bit for me, like in a good way, like I'm not as upset about it.

(1h 1m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think I agree. If I fail because of my skill, I'm much more

(1h 1m 59s)

> Not happy because I'm obviously annoyed that I've mucked up

(1h 2m 2s)

> But I'm much much prefer that because it's like I mucked up rather than

(1h 2m 8s)

> The game is just it feels like the game has ruined it for me sort of thing

(1h 2m 13s) **Nama:**

> Especially when it comes down to like oh, I just hit the button too late or too early like that. It's like ah

(1h 2m 19s) **Al:**

> Exactly

(1h 2m 21s)

> Yeah

(1h 2m 21s) **Nama:**

> No, don't don't do that to me, please

(1h 2m 26s)

> Anyway, that looks great. I'm gonna keep my eye out

(1h 2m 29s) **Al:**

> Yes, so that is also live on Kickstarter just now. I don't think I'm gonna kickstart either of these games

(1h 2m 35s)

> I'm trying to keep going with my not kickstarting and neither of these are saying I must play this as soon as it comes out

(1h 2m 41s)

> so

(1h 2m 43s)

> Our final new game is called peaceful days and this has been out on an early access for the while

(1h 2m 50s)

> But apparently I didn't I didn't learn about it until now because it is just released its

(1h 2m 56s)

> 1.0

(1h 2m 59s)

> So this is the blurb for this one is take over a cozy local farm in the charming seaside town of Aurora

(1h 3m 6s)

> Meet friendly locals reveal the secrets and enjoy your new peaceful life. Hey look, it's starchy valley

(1h 3m 12s) **Nama:**

> Hey, look, it's Stardew Valley, like in the most painful way that we can say that, like this is just

(1h 3m 21s)

> Stardew, like they they have the caverns and stuff that you're mining and going down and down and down like that is just blatant

(1h 3m 29s)

> blatant stardews

(1h 3m 33s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, and I'm not against that,

(1h 3m 36s)

> but I'm not seeing here what it is also doing differently, right?

(1h 3m 40s)

> Like, Stardew wouldn't have become Stardew

(1h 3m 43s)

> if it was just Harvest Moon, right?

(1h 3m 45s)

> Like, the whole point was,

(1h 3m 46s)

> I wanna make a better Harvest Moon.

(1h 3m 48s)

> And so if this is trying to make a better Stardew,

(1h 3m 51s)

> what exactly is it doing that's different?

(1h 3m 54s)

> And I'm not really seeing that.

(1h 3m 55s) **Nama:**

> It's racing ostriches. That's got my $5 right there

(1h 4m 4s)

> Yeah, there's there's a couple of moments in this trailer. I'm like, oh, I haven't seen that before

(1h 4m 9s)

> Like there's a big old monster that comes out of the ground and

(1h 4m 12s) **Al:**

> Ah, it's been done before.

(1h 4m 14s) **Nama:**

> Oh sure sure sure there's like this big concert that you can go to

(1h 4m 18s)

> What also has been done before but yeah in terms of like the set pieces and the art style

(1h 4m 25s)

> and all of that. It's really just looking like hey, we could do this too. So we're going to and I'm not

(1h 4m 34s)

> as

(1h 4m 35s)

> Jazzed about that. I mean I don't want to come too hard on on this because people worked I I you know people worked on this

(1h 4m 43s)

> It's been in access for some time, but like the title peaceful days like

(1h 4m 48s)

> Can you it's like typing in keyboard? Please tell me what to name my farming game that is cozy?

(1h 4m 53s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 4m 56s) **Nama:**

> You should call it peaceful day. It's like I don't want to I'm gonna say it sounds like an AI title like what is why is it like that call it something?

(1h 5m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, I guess the problem then is you end up calling it like cheese farm village.

(1h 5m 12s)

> You know, like you just end up with the the standard Stardew Valley style that everyone else names us.

(1h 5m 16s) **Nama:**

> What it's gonna be anyway

(1h 5m 18s)

> Yeah

(1h 5m 19s)

> Anyway, I think that's I think yeah, I think what we've said more on the game than we intended

(1h 5m 21s) **Al:**

> Naming is hard. I get that.

(1h 5m 28s)

> Well, I will say one more thing. We'll do more.

(1h 5m 31s)

> One, it does have very positive on its reviews on steam. So there's something there. It's got steam DB rating of 78%.

(1h 5m 40s)

> So it sounds like some people are at least enjoying it, which is good.

(1h 5m 44s)

> And I think this fell into the 2020 bucket of Stardew clones that everybody was doing, right?

(1h 5m 54s)

> Like three years after Stardew came out for years after Stardew came out, but three years after we got.

(1h 6m 1s)

> Big, right? Like it really got big in 2017 was the time when everyone was releasing their their Stardew clones, because it takes a few years to get to that point, right?

(1h 6m 13s)

> And this is clearly one developer doing this. And so I think it's just fallen into that box of hey, Stardew clone, where does now we're generally getting games that are trying to do a bit more because they realize that you can't just do a Stardew clone.

(1h 6m 30s) **Nama:**

> They're doing "Start to Clone" and...

(1h 6m 31s) **Al:**

> Yes, whereas this is just he's finished off his Stardew clone now, which he released five years ago on the third of February 2020, one amazing time to release that that was two weeks before Animal Crossing New Horizons and the world shut down.

(1h 6m 36s) **Nama:**

> Right.

(1h 6m 50s)

> Uh-huh, uh-huh.

(1h 6m 52s) **Al:**

> All right, that's all of our news game news and our new games. So now we're going to talk to.

## ACNH

(1h 7m 1s) **Al:**

> And now me a little bit about his thoughts on the Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 update and switch to edition. So I don't know where do you want to start what your thoughts.

(1h 7m 15s) **Nama:**

> Let's see, there was just so much stuff that it was 15 minutes long and it talked about the

(1h 7m 21s)

> switch to addition and it talked about all of the things in the update. Yeah, probably.

(1h 7m 26s) **Al:**

> Let's start with a Switch 2 edition then. Are you gonna buy it?

(1h 7m 32s) **Nama:**

> The price makes it really easy to like the $5 was a real pleasant surprise. Normally when they're

(1h 7m 39s)

> like we're not going to tell you the price because we're a little worried about it.

(1h 7m 42s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(1h 7m 45s) **Nama:**

> But they didn't and you look it up and you're like, Oh, it's only $5. It makes sense because you're

(1h 7m 51s)

> not getting a frame rate boost. You're not getting a ton of stuff that 3.0 is providing. The biggest

(1h 8m)

> question that this podcast has asked that other people in the community have asked is why didn't

(1h 8m 8s)

> they just put all of this stuff into a switch to addition and then, you know, make it

(1h 8m 15s)

> $15 or $10 or whatever. I guess some people included myself have just concluded that this is

(1h 8m 24s)

> for the sake of the community because it is a community driven game, people play it. If they're not

(1h 8m 31s)

> playing it at the same time, like, you know, 12 players would want, they are playing it at

(1h 8m 38s)

> conjunction with each other, like side by side. Um, so yeah,

(1h 8m 45s)

> I'm probably going to just pick it up. I'll put a fiber down for it. Um, the, you're getting the

(1h 8m 51s)

> resolution, which is nice. What I'm most excited with the switch to addition specifically is the mouse

(1h 8m 56s)

> mode. I think.

(1h 8m 57s) **Al:**

> interesting. Tell me, tell me why, because I'm never going to use it. I'm paying for the resolution

(1h 9m 3s)

> because I'm always going to, if you give me an update for a game that costs five dollars and

(1h 9m 9s)

> increases the resolution, I'm buying it any day. Right. So I won't use the other features, but I want

(1h 9m 13s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 9m 15s) **Al:**

> that one that high resolution but tell me what you're going to use the most

(1h 9m 19s) **Nama:**

> Well, the I find I'm I'm like you in that I'm not very motivated to decorate

(1h 9m 28s)

> Internally I like what people do I like how many items there are and I like collecting the items

(1h 9m 33s)

> but going through the motions of putting all that stuff on the walls or on the floor I find

(1h 9m 40s)

> what's the word tedious

(1h 9m 44s)

> So I see mouse mode. I see that you can highlight a bunch of stuff. You can move everything around you can pull things out of the storage pretty easily

(1h 9m 53s)

> That seems to take away the tedium that is tied to go over here on the grid click the button pick it up go over here on the grid

(1h 10m 3s) **Al:**

> So you're almost hoping it'll make you want to decorate.

(1h 10m 3s) **Nama:**

> Taking a lot of the button presses away which is taking a lot of the time away

(1h 10m 8s)

> Just swooping over

(1h 10m 13s)

> Yeah, I think it's gonna I'm hoping that it will motivate me to put in the time to

(1h 10m 20s)

> Swish around and go boom, boom, boom, boom, and here's my nice room

(1h 10m 24s)

> Now I still have to go through all of the items that I have in my inventory and decide you know

(1h 10m 31s)

> I have to actually

(1h 10m 33s)

> Interior design myself, but at least putting my thought into the screen will will be faster

(1h 10m 43s)

> end and

(1h 10m 45s)

> more convenient than going through a bunch of menus by button press

(1h 10m 49s) **Al:**

> Okay, interesting, fair enough.

(1h 10m 50s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I mean it also applies to the overworld and there's a lot with the overworld that would be really nice to

(1h 10m 58s)

> Not have to go up with

(1h 11m 1s)

> Like I don't know to the extent of what the mouse mode will help with because like for instance

(1h 11m 7s)

> I'm sure they'll want you to manually shovel everything still like if I'm picking up a flower or or or things

(1h 11m 13s)

> Like that, but anything that can take away these tedious

(1h 11m 17s)

> Do it over and over and over again stuff is

(1h 11m 21s)

> Motivating to me because I mean we talked about that with the crafting we'll talk about that again probably

(1h 11m 27s)

> Like the bulk crafting and all that is like such a game-changer in terms of respecting the player's time and

(1h 11m 34s)

> I'm hoping that the mouse mode will also contribute to that idea of respecting the players to

(1h 11m 41s) **Al:**

> Yeah, okay, fair enough. I guess my thing about most mode is I

(1h 11m 46s)

> The switch to me is

(1h 11m 49s)

> Handheld or TV device. I don't really think of it as being anything other than that and in those situations the last

(1h 11m 58s) **Nama:**

> I suppose, I have, you know, a coffee table in front of my couch, so when I have done mouse stuff,

(1h 12m 6s)

> like I got welcome tour and I had fun with those mouse mini games. It was not difficult for me to

(1h 12m 14s)

> just slap my Joy-Con 2 down and do the mouse stuff. It is a bit of a commitment, right?

(1h 12m 23s)

> If you're playing at handheld and I do play handheld, 50% of the time.

(1h 12m 29s)

> It's not very easy to just like, "Okay, now I've got to go to a table. I've got to put my tablet down for me to look at. I've got to put the controller on the table."

(1h 12m 43s)

> But when I'm playing Animal Crossing, I don't know, I'm not opening it up for 15 minutes.

(1h 12m 50s)

> Like, ideally I am sitting down or lying down or whatever. Like, locked in for 30 minutes.

(1h 12m 58s)

> So, I don't know. Certainly, I'm not going to be starting a big interior design project when I'm on the bus.

(1h 12m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah, okay

(1h 13m 8s)

> Yeah, no, that's fair. That's fair. I get that. And I'm not here to say that you're wrong.

(1h 13m 14s)

> That's not what I'm doing at all. It's, yeah, it's more just like trying to understand,

(1h 13m 14s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, certainly, yeah. We're just bouncing.

(1h 13m 18s) **Al:**

> because like I, I still haven't played Drag X Drive, which is like the wheelchair basketball game,

(1h 13m 26s) **Nama:**

> Oh yeah. I was going to...

(1h 13m 27s) **Al:**

> which I really want to play. But I just can't, I just can't find the time or place to be like,

(1h 13m 32s)

> no, I'm going into mouse mode. You know, like it just, I feel like I need to be at my desk in front of

(1h 13m 33s) **Nama:**

> Right.

(1h 13m 38s) **Al:**

> my monitor doing that. I don't want to do it on a coffee table on the sofa. I don't want to do it on the arms of

(1h 13m 43s)

> my sofa. I don't like, I want to be doing it on a on my desk at my monitor. And I don't game like that.

(1h 13m 51s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, that's fine.

(1h 13m 52s)

> Yeah, Dragon Drive, I was gonna get that

(1h 13m 56s)

> 'cause I'm interested in like new ideas for games

(1h 13m 58s)

> and new ways to play games.

(1h 14m)

> But I heard like I, the reviews actually kept me away from it

(1h 14m 3s)

> 'cause people were like, it's just this.

(1h 14m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean that's kind of reflected in the price though, right? Like I it's kind of why I expected I

(1h 14m 8s) **Nama:**

> There's no like, purse, yeah.

(1h 14m 14s)

> Yeah.

(1h 14m 15s) **Al:**

> Is really bad. I've actually bought the game. I've just not played it because I was like

(1h 14m 19s)

> I want to support this

(1h 14m 21s)

> In principle even if I've not played it. Yeah, I want to be like, yes, please do more stuff like this

(1h 14m 28s) **Nama:**

> right yeah well that's kind of it for switch to addition but I mean the bulk of

(1h 14m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know

(1h 14m 36s) **Nama:**

> this is the 3.0 yeah

(1h 14m 38s) **Al:**

> Yeah, go for it. So I guess the the big thing is the resort hotel, right? Like that's what they're they're the content update. I guess most of the stuff is other than this most of the stuff is either, you know, quality of life improvements or new furniture.

(1h 14m 52s)

> So, um, what do you think about the resort hotel? You're going to be going in there and designing all the, the rooms.

(1h 14m 58s) **Nama:**

> I honestly know I'm probably going to do the tutorial and then never go in there again.

(1h 15m 4s)

> Which I know is funny because I just talked about how I'm excited to use the mouse to decorate

(1h 15m 8s)

> stuff.

(1h 15m 9s)

> But I'm just so confused why they did this when that was the entire, like DLC was making

(1h 15m 19s)

> rooms according to the missions that people give you.

(1h 15m 22s)

> They just did that twice.

(1h 15m 23s) **Al:**

> It's happy. Happy hotel designer

(1h 15m 24s) **Nama:**

> And yeah, but we already had it.

(1h 15m 28s)

> We have island designer. I just, it's so weird to me that they did the same thing twice.

(1h 15m 33s)

> So they're like, do you like happy home designer? Great. Do you like happy home designer? Again?

(1h 15m 38s)

> I guess, are you going to make me pay for it? No.

(1h 15m 38s) **Al:**

> to be fair to be totally fair animal crossing people do like happy home designer, and yes,

(1h 15m 42s) **Nama:**

> You already paid for the other one.

(1h 15m 49s) **Al:**

> they would like happy home designer again, please and thank you.

(1h 15m 51s) **Nama:**

> But the weird thing to me is, I mean, okay, there's some holes in my animal crossing as there is for a few people that came back with new horizons, but happy home designer is a standalone 3DS game. Is that right? Okay, and then is there any aspect of happy home designer in new leaf? I don't know, I don't think so, but, yeah.

(1h 16m 16s) **Al:**

> We need Kevin for that I think!

(1h 16m 19s) **Nama:**

> So, I'm just going to

(1h 16m 21s)

> to go to the Google really something really fast. But happy home designer is not a best-selling animal crossing game. It is not a multi-million-million-dollar game.

(1h 16m 27s) **Al:**

> No. No, okay, so I don't think they're doing it because happy home designer. I think they're

(1h 16m 34s)

> doing it because Animal Crossing people like designing things, right? And this is a way

(1h 16m 41s)

> much like with the the new slumber island, it's a way for Animal Crossing people to design more

(1h 16m 49s)

> stuff without getting rid of their existing stuff. And so I don't know, maybe it's too simple to just

(1h 16m 57s)

> again, but like if we know Animal Crossing people like designing things and here's a bunch of

(1h 17m 5s)

> stuff for you to design stuff. How about more stuff to design stuff?

(1h 17m 9s) **Nama:**

> it's so weird to me that they just did the same thing twice. I just don't, I don't get it.

(1h 17m 15s)

> I don't know, maybe this is, you know, weird and it's against the idea of making it free,

(1h 17m 23s)

> because if the thing is like, okay, we made the DLC free and I don't know, the weird thing for me

(1h 17m 30s)

> is that the DLC has always kind of been shuffled under the rug. Like if you're a

(1h 17m 34s)

> Nintendo Switch online subscriber, you just get it for free, so you don't have to pay for it.

(1h 17m 39s)

> Um, which can make it for subscribers easy to forget about. Um, and then here you are with this,

(1h 17m 46s)

> which is I, maybe there's differences, but it seems to me effectively the same thing

(1h 17m 51s)

> and it's free now and it's on the island. You don't need to fly anywhere. You don't need to like

(1h 17m 56s)

> wait for that loading screen. I don't know. It's just, it's just strange.

(1h 18m 1s) **Al:**

> it almost feels like the hotel should have been what the DLC was and then the DLC should have been

(1h 18m 7s)

> other islands to design on like what they ended up making a slumber island like just

(1h 18m 15s)

> here are islands that you have to design for people rather than just houses at a

(1h 18m 19s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, whatever, but by the way, new leaf on 3DS sold 13 million copies and happy home designer sold three million copies. So

(1h 18m 30s) **Al:**

> Okay, I mean 3 million is not nothing.

(1h 18m 30s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, whatever

(1h 18m 33s)

> It's not nothing. It's more than I would have expected. I was thinking it was gonna be like one million copies

(1h 18m 39s)

> It is 23% of the audience from new leaf picked up. Yeah

(1h 18m 40s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(1h 18m 42s)

> That's not nothing

(1h 18m 44s)

> That's I actually feel that's quite high

(1h 18m 47s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm I'm

(1h 18m 49s)

> you know walking it back a little I thought I was gonna be like one million

(1h 18m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I know and also like yes happy home designer wasn't a DLC for new leaf, but it may as well have been

(1h 18m 59s) **Nama:**

> - Yeah, really.

(1h 19m) **Al:**

> Like I just feel like Nintendo wasn't really in the DLC mood at that point, right?

(1h 19m 5s)

> like that wasn't a thing that they had really done. They didn't really do DLC

(1h 19m 10s)

> until I guess they did it on the Wii U with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe but like handheld they didn't really do it till this switch.

(1h 19m 19s) **Nama:**

> So beyond that I'm you know touching on the other stuff. There's nine case storage. That's great

(1h 19m 24s)

> I love that I would I really lost my steam

(1h 19m 28s)

> for

(1h 19m 29s)

> Playing the game daily when I discovered that I was gonna run out of space trying to collect everything I

(1h 19m 36s)

> Don't know if I can still collect everything with nine k. Just because there's I wanted to get like

(1h 19m 42s)

> Each color of each clothing, you know, I I wanted to really really commit and I couldn't so I was like, oh, okay forget it

(1h 19m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Fair.

(1h 19m 50s) **Nama:**

> But nine k is great. I like that

(1h 19m 54s)

> You know recetti getting back in his in into the game is fun

(1h 19m 59s)

> The dream world a

(1h 20m) **Al:**

> I'm giving you a positive thing to do this time rather than just shouting at you.

(1h 20m 2s) **Nama:**

> Pause he's he's yeah

(1h 20m 5s)

> It's just fun to see him, right because so many people

(1h 20m 8s)

> In their younger days, remember to recetti as like one of the more iconic animal crossing characters

(1h 20m 16s)

> So getting him back in this nice

(1h 20m 19s) **Al:**

> I'm with likes this time.

(1h 20m 19s) **Nama:**

> But dream world dream world. I like dream world is really exciting to me

(1h 20m 24s) **Al:**

> Yep, I agree.

(1h 20m 25s) **Nama:**

> The thing about it is I have all like many times considered

(1h 20m 31s)

> Let's just make a new

(1h 20m 33s)

> Island a new starting point. Let's just start the game over. We'll craft from scratch

(1h 20m 38s)

> I've never done it because I put so much work

(1h 20m 42s)

> Into my original island, so I don't want to I don't want to like that slate

(1h 20m 48s)

> So, being able to just.

(1h 20m 49s)

> kind of relive. Those early days and being excited about what you're going to do with the space and being able to use all your items, but if you want to, you can just, you know, pretend like it's a brand new save file. I that's that's cool.

(1h 21m 4s)

> One thing that I wish you could do is I wish you could the game would track your villagers that have lived on your island from day one to now. And then.

(1h 21m 16s) **Al:**

> And then you could invite them to your your dream islands. Yeah, that'd be cool. That'd be cool

(1h 21m 17s) **Nama:**

> Yes.

(1h 21m 19s)

> Right. Like the, you still have the max of like seven or however many it is, but like you could have completely different villagers on your cannon island. And then a different batch on your first island and then a different batch on your second. You still have to collect them all naturally through the campground and stuff. But if you, if it could remember everybody, then that would be, that would be fun for me.

(1h 21m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(1h 21m 47s)

> Yeah, that would also be nice for when like because this is this is it would work

(1h 21m 53s)

> Thematically right because it's like this is a dream. This isn't real and so you're essentially dreaming up

(1h 21m 57s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(1h 21m 58s) **Al:**

> Oh, I remember this person

(1h 22m)

> Let me bring them to my dream island

(1h 22m 1s) **Nama:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 22m 1s) **Al:**

> It would also mean that like because we are going to come there's gonna be a lot of heartbroken people very soon when they log into their games

(1h 22m 7s)

> And realize they've lost a villager because that happens right if you've not played the game for a certain amount of time

(1h 22m 14s)

> There is a chance that one of your relatives moves out without talking to you.

(1h 22m 17s)

> And that is heartbreaking for some people, and so giving you the ability to be like, "Oh yeah, well you can get the memory of that villager onto one of your dream islands."

(1h 22m 27s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I so I don't think that there's really anything to suggest that you can do that, but it would be cool if you could

(1h 22m 35s)

> Before I talk about the Nintendo consoles will just touch on the Lego collaboration the Zelda the Splatoon

(1h 22m 43s)

> I think that's all cool. Um, I think it's a

(1h 22m 49s)

> Little worrying to me that this Zelda and Splatoon stuff are tied behind a mebo just because I

(1h 22m 57s)

> Some Zelda amiibo

(1h 22m 59s)

> Am I gonna get

(1h 23m 1s)

> Everybody that I want with with the fu Zelda amiibo that I have or is one piece of an outfit lost to me forever because I don't have the

(1h 23m 13s)

> The moblin amiibo, you know what I mean? Like

(1h 23m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's fair. I would say I would never recommend that people pirate amiibo's, right?

(1h 23m 21s)

> That would obviously be not something that I would ever recommend that that would obviously be very, very wrong,

(1h 23m 24s) **Nama:**

> No, that's frankly anti corporation now. I'm surprised that you didn't even say something like

(1h 23m 27s) **Al:**

> but it's something that people can and probably will do.

(1h 23m 34s)

> I'm not saying I'm saying, I'm saying I would never tell people to do that. I would never

(1h 23m 39s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(1h 23m 40s)

> Yeah.

(1h 23m 40s) **Al:**

> reveal people to Google how to create fake amiibo that would be bad. Like, uh,

(1h 23m 46s)

> I wouldn't tell them that there are very easy tutorials to find how to do that on the internet.

(1h 23m 50s)

> And if you don't want to be able to do that, if you don't have a device that would let you

(1h 23m 56s)

> write NFC tags, then I would not tell them that it on Etsy, you can buy batches of loads of them

(1h 24m 4s)

> for 10 quid. I would not tell people that.

(1h 24m 6s) **Nama:**

> Well, be that as it may.

(1h 24m 11s)

> I, yeah.

(1h 24m 12s) **Al:**

> No, I think your point is still totally valid because that is tech.

(1h 24m 16s)

> So it's a totally fair point like locking the stuff behind me will not amazing having said that it is just cosmetic stuff

(1h 24m 18s) **Nama:**

> Right, nobody.

(1h 24m 25s)

> I'm like, unless you want the bird, you know, unless you want tooling,

(1h 24m 32s) **Al:**

> Sure, yeah

(1h 24m 33s) **Nama:**

> I am I gonna have to go out and spend, you know.

(1h 24m 36s)

> Again, you've you've talked about other strategies, but am I gonna have to go out and spend $35 on a tool in amoebo to get the bird in my game?

(1h 24m 44s) **Al:**

> Will yeah, that is silly will you be able to treat will you be able to treat these villages like the others where if they're leaving someone's island you can go and steal them

(1h 24m 45s) **Nama:**

> Like that's that's what's silly.

(1h 24m 48s)

> That's really silly.

(1h 24m 56s)

> maybe, probably, probably. It's a little bit of, you know, again, a little bit of work,

(1h 24m 58s) **Al:**

> That's another way then

(1h 25m 2s)

> It is a little bit work, but it does mean it yeah

(1h 25m 3s) **Nama:**

> but it's a way to do it for free, because then you can just scan them again and then get them,

(1h 25m 8s) **Al:**

> Exactly, you just need one friend who has it and they can they can they can

(1h 25m 11s) **Nama:**

> yeah, coordinate. So sure, yeah, that's fine. I'm also curious if there are going to be other

(1h 25m 18s)

> villagers. They only confirmed Tulin, and I'm sorry. I want to say pneumonia, but that's not even

(1h 25m 26s)

> minura. So they've confirmed those two, but Kevin is right that there have been other

(1h 25m 35s)

> characters from New Leaf based on animals that you could do. I wonder if they just haven't

(1h 25m 40s)

> like confirmed them and they are coming.

(1h 25m 43s) **Al:**

> I don't know. It seems weird because it's like the way they talked about it didn't like if there had been more. I would have expected that

(1h 25m 50s)

> And more or a dot dot dot or something like that. It didn't hint at there being more than just the two

(1h 25m 52s) **Nama:**

> right? Sure. Yeah. Okay. So they've done wolf link, right? Uh, because like, okay,

(1h 26m 4s) **Al:**

> Okay, I'll take your word for it

(1h 26m 4s) **Nama:**

> link was a wolf, we can go. Okay. They have that he was a new leaf. Um, where, if you

(1h 26m 8s) **Al:**

> Okay, it sounded like a question, but that's fine

(1h 26m 12s) **Nama:**

> haven't like played any tears with the kingdom, then skip ahead, like two minutes or whatever.

(1h 26m 17s) **Al:**

> Are we spiraling tears of the kingdom here yeah yeah yeah okay so what wait what

(1h 26m 18s) **Nama:**

> Zelda's, yes, yeah, we are. We are. Zelda's a drag.

(1h 26m 22s)

> And in tears of the kingdom. That's what I'm wondering. That's my question to you. Is there, yeah,

(1h 26m 26s) **Al:**

> animal would that map turn animal crossing let me get a list up of all the

(1h 26m 34s) **Nama:**

> because we could get Zelda in this, in this game, if we are just a little creative.

(1h 26m 41s) **Al:**

> Okay, so this alligator, it's my first thought.

(1h 26m 45s)

> Although I don't think the alligators are in New Horizons.

(1h 26m 49s)

> Are they?

(1h 26m 50s) **Nama:**

> mmm I feel like they might be because I haven't seen anything

(1h 26m 55s) **Al:**

> Alligator, alligator definitely looks like the default

(1h 26m 59s)

> that it would be because there apparently is one villager

(1h 27m 4s)

> called Drago, who is an alligator,

(1h 27m 5s) **Nama:**

> Uh-huh.

(1h 27m 7s) **Al:**

> but is obviously clearly a dragon.

(1h 27m 10s) **Nama:**

> A drag? Okay, let me look up with what draggo looks like.

(1h 27m 11s) **Al:**

> And I is in New Horizons, my bad. Both. Yeah, both the alligators and dragon himself.

(1h 27m 13s) **Nama:**

> That's a good idea.

(1h 27m 17s)

> Okay, see, I feel like they have everybody in New Horizons.

(1h 27m 26s)

> Yes, oh, he totally looks like a dragon.

(1h 27m 29s)

> He looks like a Chinese dragon, but still.

(1h 27m 33s) **Al:**

> I don't need to go any further, because the fact that they have a dragon as an alligator,

(1h 27m 33s) **Nama:**

> And...

(1h 27m 36s)

> Yep.

(1h 27m 36s) **Al:**

> that would be the one they would do. They wouldn't do a different way.

(1h 27m 39s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, so I'm wondering...

(1h 27m 42s)

> We have the technology. We can put Zelda in here.

(1h 27m 46s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 27m 46s) **Nama:**

> That'd be cool.

(1h 27m 49s)

> Yep.

(1h 27m 50s)

> So anyway, that's my thoughts about that. Splatoon, who cares?

(1h 27m 53s)

> You either Splatoon is your life, or you don't care about Splatoon.

(1h 27m 54s) **Al:**

> I played Splatoon 1 on the Wii U because there was nothing else to play on the Wii U. I never

(1h 28m 3s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, it's a fun game.

(1h 28m 5s)

> But, like, there are people, there are people who, like, Splatoon, it's like Pokemon for them, like, they wake up, and they think about Splatoon, and then they play it, and then they go to bed.

(1h 28m 19s)

> So, for everybody who wants that on their island, that's great. But, this Splatoon stuff would be like if there was just a bunch of Pokemon stuff for us to collect. So, I'm happy for the Splatoon people.

(1h 28m 32s)

> Okay, so Nintendo consoles, I don't want to spend life.

(1h 28m 35s)

> I don't like a long, long time on this, but I am very interested in the consoles you can collect and the games that you can play on the consoles.

(1h 28m 43s)

> One thing that is true, but you guys didn't mention last week, is that you can only play these games if you have an Nintendo subscription.

(1h 28m 54s) **Al:**

> - How?

(1h 28m 54s)

> - What?

(1h 28m 55s) **Nama:**

> Yep, so that's my feedback for you.

(1h 28m 58s) **Al:**

> - What?

(1h 28m 59s)

> - What?

(1h 29m 1s)

> Why?

(1h 29m 5s) **Nama:**

> Unless you're paying.

(1h 29m 5s) **Al:**

> - Oh, my word.

(1h 29m 8s)

> This is like, oh, my word.

(1h 29m 9s)

> I bet, I bet.

(1h 29m 11s)

> My assumption is like,

(1h 29m 13s)

> this is one of those things where

(1h 29m 16s)

> some lawyer in Nintendo has said.

(1h 29m 19s)

> If we actually, if we included this game for free

(1h 29m 21s)

> inside the other game, then it means that.

(1h 29m 24s)

> And then there's like some precedent that was done in one thing because like this old game was released for free or something and like they don't want to say any precedent or something and so technically you're not getting it for free you're getting it as part. I hate that so much.

(1h 29m 40s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, um, it is a very unfortunate detail.

(1h 29m 44s) **Al:**

> That's so so stupid. Is this the first time we've had something locked in a game behind the subscription other than online?

(1h 29m 47s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, um,

(1h 29m 54s) **Al:**

> Because obviously we've had as you've explained the DLCs that you can either buy or get for free, but like there's never been anything inside a game that you can't get if you're not a subscription except online.

(1h 29m 54s) **Nama:**

> um, I think so.

(1h 30m 8s)

> Yeah, you have to have a subscription. Yeah. Um, so the, there is a precedent for the NES games

(1h 30m 19s)

> being on Animal Crossing. Um, as I think Kevin explained last week, they were about 20 NES games

(1h 30m 28s)

> on the GameCube Animal Crossing. And you got access to them. I think there was a way to get them

(1h 30m 35s)

> through the just regular gameplay.

(1h 30m 38s)

> Yes, you could find them buried in the ground on certain days or get them from the lottery.

(1h 30m 46s)

> But I think you were designed like the game was designed to do them with e-reader cards,

(1h 30m 52s)

> that old GBA nugget, because there were some e-reader cards where you could swipe into your GBA

(1h 31m 1s)

> and just play a full NES game. So putting that into your Animal Crossing game, you could just have that

(1h 31m 8s)

> you it up in your NES console whenever you wanted to. So you could play the ones that were like

(1h 31m 15s)

> just in the game where like blue fights, Donkey Kong, Excite Bike, these arcade games really.

(1h 31m 27s)

> The thing with this game is in a new horizon, there is one game tied to each console.

(1h 31m 36s)

> So, you've-

(1h 31m 38s)

> But there's multiple versions of the same console, right? You've got the NES, the Nintendo Entertainment System, which is the American one, and then you've got Famicom, and then you've got the Famicom Disk System, which are all three independent machines.

(1h 31m 51s)

> So, there's going to be three NES games that we can play, again, with an active subscription.

(1h 31m 56s)

> The ones that are confirmed are Ice Climbers in Cluco Land, but I would assume with three different original consoles, like there's going to be a game for like the Famicom Disk System.

(1h 32m 8s)

> That you can play. I'm curious what these games are going to be. They have also come out and said that you can play Dr. Mario on Gameboy, but there are some confirmed consoles that are going to be in there like Super Famicom, not the Super Nintendo, but the Super Famicom was confirmed.

(1h 32m 30s)

> And presumably, all of, you know, this is me assuming, but I think that all of the consoles that have NSO support.

(1h 32m 39s)

> would potentially have a game in Animal Crossing, right? So, I'm wondering what are the Super Famicom and the SNES games going to be? What would the Gameboy Advance game be? What would the N64 game be?

(1h 32m 55s)

> And I wonder if there's GameCube support, are you going to be able to play a GameCube game inside of your Switch 2 Animal Crossing New Horizons game?

(1h 33m 8s)

> And I don't know, what are you thinking of all of this thoughts in mind?

(1h 33m 14s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, I think I'd be surprised if they didn't have something for.

(1h 33m 20s)

> Sorry. Well, no, let me before I go to the, are they really doing the Nez and the Famicom as separate ones?

(1h 33m 26s) **Nama:**

> Yes, because they're different machines so if you wanted to collect them if you wanted to collect them

(1h 33m 29s) **Al:**

> Well, well, well, okay, they are, they are different in terms of their shell, but inwards, they're the same thing.

(1h 33m 41s)

> I see on your list they've got Super Famicom.

(1h 33m 44s)

> But not the SNES? Or is that just not confirmed?

(1h 33m 46s) **Nama:**

> Well, those are the ones that work. Yeah, those are the ones that we saw in the list in the trailer

(1h 33m 52s)

> There's gonna be several more, you know, I'm assuming there's gonna be every game boy

(1h 33m 55s) **Al:**

> Yes, okay

(1h 33m 56s) **Nama:**

> There's gonna be a 3ds gate that console there's gonna be a DS console. I'm just that's me inferring

(1h 34m) **Al:**

> So yeah, yeah, so there's an as and pharmacarm are gonna have the same ones. I don't think they would do anything different there

(1h 34m 7s) **Nama:**

> Is that why we only have two NES games confirmed because Nas and Famicom are both ice climber and then Famicom

(1h 34m 14s)

> disk system would be something like clue cooling.

(1h 34m 16s)

> I think that because I think that language is in the trailer that each console will have one

(1h 34m 17s) **Al:**

> Also, you're thinking one game, I don't know.

(1h 34m 26s)

> Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

(1h 34m 29s)

> That's a very good question.

(1h 34m 32s) **Nama:**

> Yeah

(1h 34m 32s) **Al:**

> I think I'd be surprised if there wasn't anything

(1h 34m 37s)

> for the SNES or Super Cap Famicom.

(1h 34m 41s)

> And obviously, we know there's something for the game by,

(1h 34m 44s)

> I would hope there would be something

(1h 34m 47s)

> for the GBA, if there's something for that.

(1h 34m 49s)

> I can't really see them going any further than that.

(1h 34m 55s)

> Maybe a game cube, but that feels like a lot.

(1h 34m 58s) **Nama:**

> Well, so GameCube and then N64 are the two bigger questions. Like do they do games for those?

(1h 35m 3s) **Al:**

> Oh, N64, I forgot about N64.

(1h 35m 5s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, it's like how far does it go? I don't know

(1h 35m 8s) **Al:**

> Yeah, 'cause I mean, they could do both of them,

(1h 35m 12s) **Nama:**

> Mm-hmm, and then the other questions like where are these games stored if it's through your NSO subscription?

(1h 35m 12s) **Al:**

> but would they?

(1h 35m 19s) **Nama:**

> Does it just like open up a new tab in your

(1h 35m 22s)

> in your NSO app and you're playing this game stored?

(1h 35m 26s) **Al:**

> My no, so my assumption is that it's going to be like our downloadable DLC type of thing that you can only get if you have the subscription.

(1h 35m 35s) **Nama:**

> Well, that's even more messed up. If it's tied behind a paywall, but you've got it downloaded

(1h 35m 41s)

> to your console, like you tell me I got to have all of F0 GX downloaded to my console,

(1h 35m 46s)

> but I can't play it unless I'm subscribed to NSO.

(1h 35m 50s) **Al:**

> Well, you can't download it unless you're subscribed.

(1h 35m 52s) **Nama:**

> Right, so there's going to be in theory, another pack on the eShop page where it's saying,

(1h 35m 58s)

> "Hey, if you've downloaded NSO, here's your Animal Crossing Pack."

(1h 36m 1s) **Al:**

> things. I mean, just like how you'd be downloading DLC, right? It's not that unusual.

(1h 36m 7s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, but but in that case wouldn't the page be up now

(1h 36m 12s)

> Because the page for this is up now the

(1h 36m 13s) **Al:**

> Not if they don't want to pay it.

(1h 36m 16s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, it's weird this whole like I'm happy that they did it because it honors what they did back in the GameCube one like

(1h 36m 24s)

> People still talk about that. They like hey, you remember when you could play a bunch of NES games on your animal crossing game

(1h 36m 30s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(1h 36m 31s) **Nama:**

> So they people like Nintendo has like recognized that people remember that fondly and so

(1h 36m 37s)

> They put it in here, but the fact that it's one per console. It's not just like here's some NES games, you know

(1h 36m 43s)

> And the fact that it's tied behind the subscription. I just wonder what

(1h 36m 49s)

> Do they highlight and how far does it go and I like I think we've taken this conversation as far as we can because we just we'll find out eventually

(1h 36m 57s)

> You know, we'll find out in two months

(1h 36m 59s)

> But you know choosing which games to highlight do you go for the obvious ones so that people can like oh, here's Mario

(1h 37m 8s)

> Or is it like oh, I've never heard of

(1h 37m 12s)

> ZVS before that's cool

(1h 37m 14s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, I don't know.

(1h 37m 16s) **Nama:**

> So there you are this might be animal crossing thoughts is just thoughts about other Nintendo games

(1h 37m 22s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, it's I guess it's the biggest question we have right because like there's there's obviously

(1h 37m 28s)

> There's gonna be stuff that they've not told us about right there's always small small things that they haven't told us

(1h 37m 33s)

> They barely told us about the crafting stuff

(1h 37m 35s)

> So there's probably gonna be a few other things like that

(1h 37m 37s)

> But other than that like this is the biggest question that we still have is what exactly does this mean?

(1h 37m 43s)

> And how many are there and yeah, it will be we interest and see I think the thing is it will be weird because we know they're not all gonna have games

(1h 37m 50s)

> they can't have the Switch 2 having a game.

(1h 37m 52s) **Nama:**

> No, no

(1h 37m 52s) **Al:**

> Just not possible unless they have like a not Switch 2 game and they have something else instead which is always possible like oh here's a GBA version of Mario Wonder or something stupid like that right but that's going to be then weird if you've got all your consoles lined up and you can play something on the game boy and you can't play something on the the 3DS.

(1h 38m 13s) **Nama:**

> I think what I would do is I would have the switch to going on, and you would click it,

(1h 38m 23s)

> and the little voice would say, "Oh, I'm playing my switch to right now."

(1h 38m 26s)

> And it's like, "It's Animal Crossing."

(1h 38m 28s) **Al:**

> So like, so like what they did with the with every Pokemon game where you you you see the console and you do it and you're like, oh, I'm playing a game on this.

(1h 38m 36s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, but like, it's a little meta

(1h 38m 38s)

> because you're holding it, you know?

(1h 38m 41s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, maybe

(1h 38m 43s) **Nama:**

> The last question is,

(1h 38m 45s)

> if this is tied to your NSO subscription,

(1h 38m 48s)

> is there gonna be a Sega Genesis in here?

(1h 38m 52s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 38m 52s) **Nama:**

[laughing]

(1h 38m 54s)

> Like, am I gonna?

(1h 38m 55s) **Al:**

> Well, it's-- I mean, OK, to ruin your fun,

(1h 38m 58s)

> it's not the consoles that are on NSO, right?

(1h 39m 1s)

> Because they have the switch to, right?

(1h 39m 2s)

> That's not on NSO.

(1h 39m 2s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, right.

(1h 39m 4s) **Al:**

> So it's not all the consoles that are in NSO,

(1h 39m 6s)

> we have a version of.

(1h 39m 7s)

> But yeah, that is a funny concept of adding in this.

(1h 39m 7s) **Nama:**

> Right.

(1h 39m 10s)

> Playing, playing, playing, yeah?

(1h 39m 10s) **Al:**

> I mean, it wouldn't be weird because they

(1h 39m 12s)

> have the Lego stuff, right?

(1h 39m 13s)

> They've done crossovers with non-nandendo stuff.

(1h 39m 16s)

> So they could do that.

(1h 39m 17s)

> But I don't know, could I see Sega agreeing to that?

(1h 39m 20s)

> And do they want their console?

(1h 39m 22s)

> And in an Nintendo game.

(1h 39m 23s) **Nama:**

> Well, they you can already buy an official Nintendo controller that is a Sega Genesis controller and

(1h 39m 32s)

> You can already on your console if you've got in a so play Sonic 2 for free right now

(1h 39m 38s)

> So could you open up Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 go to your Sega Genesis console click it on and play Sonic 2 within

(1h 39m 47s)

> Animal Crossing. I don't know that that's a fun hypothetical

(1h 39m 51s) **Al:**

> That would certainly be a fun one to have if you could do Sonic.

(1h 39m 55s)

> All right. Any other thoughts on these updates before we close out?

(1h 39m 59s) **Nama:**

> We said at the very top of the show, but the fact that you can craft from your storage,

(1h 40m 5s)

> man, that's really going to give a lot of motivation to crafting back, because then I could

(1h 40m 10s)

> just look at, like just thinking alone about the craftable sign, and then it's not going

(1h 40m 19s)

> to be three items.

(1h 40m 20s)

> It's going to be hundreds and hundreds of items.

(1h 40m 23s)

> You're like, "Oh, what am I going to make?"

(1h 40m 25s)

> And it'll be like, "Oh, you've never made this before."

(1h 40m 27s)

> I'm like, oh, let me make it right now.

(1h 40m 29s)

> I just cannot wait to go in.

(1h 40m 33s) **Al:**

> Uh, yeah, absolutely read. I think the thing that was the thing that most annoyed me about crafting is you're like, oh, I can't craft this thing, right. What do I need? Oh, do I have that stuff? I don't know. Let's go find out and just being able to know immediately. Do I have this stuff or not is going to be great.

(1h 40m 44s) **Nama:**

> and then yeah so yeah I'm glad they're doing it um for free is great and looking forward to January

(1h 40m 54s)

> 15th to Buddha.

(1h 40m 56s) **Al:**

> Just before we finish. I lied. There was one other big question we have, which is why? Why now? Why?

(1h 41m 4s)

> Four years after the last update that was going to be the final update. Why are they doing this now so weird?

(1h 41m 4s) **Nama:**

> I don't know um yeah I think okay so obviously they work on this the next

(1h 41m 15s)

> console when the when the previous consoles finished you know they started

(1h 41m 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah, probably before that.

(1h 41m 19s) **Nama:**

> switch to development on March 4th 2017 yeah so they're probably like hmm

(1h 41m 27s)

> we're doing these switch to editions what makes the most sense let's do Mario

(1h 41m 32s)

> I wonder, let's do...

(1h 41m 34s)

> You know, let's do friggin', I don't know, what's a curvy, and then let's do animal crossing, right? Animal crossing, new fence post is not even close to being done yet, so we'll just put out new horizons and that makes sense.

(1h 41m 49s)

> So, sure.

(1h 41m 50s)

> I think that this opens up the floodgates even more to what else is going to get a switch to addition, really.

(1h 41m 58s)

> Like, now that they said new horizons, switch to addition, okay.

(1h 42m 4s)

> Sure. That's great. But, you know, it's the 3.0.

(1h 42m 8s) **Al:**

> But this is the thing. It's not a just a switch to addition. The switch to addition is basically nothing, right?

(1h 42m 14s) **Nama:**

> Okay, so yeah. I

(1h 42m 14s) **Al:**

> Like if they released this switch to addition and had those four things, fine. Great. I'm not buying that. I'm not playing the game.

(1h 42m 22s)

> Maybe that's it. Maybe this is why maybe I just answered my question. They knew the switch to addition wouldn't get people playing the game again.

(1h 42m 26s) **Nama:**

> I think that is the answer.

(1h 42m 28s) **Al:**

> So they needed to give you other stuff to do that.

(1h 42m 30s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, because all of these other switch to additions

(1h 42m 32s)

> have had stuff to dip back into,

(1h 42m 34s)

> like the Mario Party, Jamboree had an addition,

(1h 42m 37s)

> Kirby had an addition.

(1h 42m 39s)

> So if they're doing a switch to then yes,

(1h 42m 42s)

> they're gonna have some new content for you to enjoy.

(1h 42m 45s)

> The interesting decision, the strange one,

(1h 42m 49s)

> is that they made that new content free to everybody else.

(1h 42m 53s) **Al:**

> I so not Nintendo. This is the thing. It's not like it's a weird concept for games, right? Like look at starchy where we've had like five whole new games for free, right?

(1h 42m 53s) **Nama:**

> That's what makes this different.

(1h 43m 3s)

> Yeah. It is strange. I think that there's just something down to the design philosophy.

(1h 43m 6s) **Al:**

> But Nintendo don't do this.

(1h 43m 13s) **Nama:**

> Again, as we said at the top of the show, that made them say, "Well, it really would

(1h 43m 18s)

> be in our best interest if everybody could do these things," which is, yeah. Yeah. Well,

(1h 43m 22s) **Al:**

> but they didn't do that with the happy home paradise DLC that was a paid deals like if they

(1h 43m 26s)

> didn't do that I would absolutely review it's a hundred percent the animal crossing team just

(1h 43m 29s) **Nama:**

> So that's the thing is, it was...

(1h 43m 31s) **Al:**

> wants to give you as much as possible for what they have.

(1h 43m 34s) **Nama:**

> But it was both a paid DLC and it wasn't.

(1h 43m 37s)

> It's in this weird zone because if you're going to enjoy Animal Crossing to its fullest,

(1h 43m 42s)

> you're already going to be paying for an online subscription.

(1h 43m 46s) **Al:**

> But then that that argument could be made for all the other expansion packs that were free on there as well, and the split into was DLC was free the the the new Mario Kart

(1h 43m 56s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, notice that all of these free DLCs are the social ones, the ones that are in the online

(1h 44m) **Al:**

> eight Deluxe DLC was free

(1h 44m 7s) **Nama:**

> players, you know, Mario Kart, you're playing online, Splatoon, you're playing online,

(1h 44m 12s)

> Animal Crossing, you're playing online.

(1h 44m 14s)

> They didn't put, yeah.

(1h 44m 14s) **Al:**

> Pokemon.

(1h 44m 18s)

> That's, I mean, I know that's different,

(1h 44m 20s)

> but it's also not in the same way.

(1h 44m 23s)

> Like, I, I don't know.

(1h 44m 24s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. We're just, we're just throwing darts at the board.

(1h 44m 24s) **Al:**

> I'm not sure whether I buy that.

(1h 44m 27s)

[laughing]

(1h 44m 31s) **Nama:**

> You can't, you can't explain this strange choice they made. But yeah. Yeah.

(1h 44m 32s) **Al:**

> No, you're right, we can't, we can't.

(1h 44m 34s)

> We're just guessing.

(1h 44m 35s)

> I just, it's, it's fascinating because, yeah,

(1h 44m 38s)

> I think if the DLC didn't exist and it was all three updates,

(1h 44m 41s)

> I would 100% agree this is weird for Nintendo,

(1h 44m 44s)

> does seem that Animal Crossing team wants to do this,

(1h 44m 47s)

> and they seem to get their way.

(1h 44m 49s) **Nama:**

> I think that there is a logic to it.

(1h 44m 49s) **Al:**

> But.

(1h 44m 51s) **Nama:**

> There's just like some guesswork and what that logic is.

(1h 44m 53s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 44m 56s)

> Yeah, I guess it could be as simple as the team had a fight

(1h 45m 2s)

> four years ago and the people that were on the side of,

(1h 45m 6s)

> we should be releasing DLC, they're no longer

(1h 45m 10s)

> with the company.

(1h 45m 11s)

> And so the people who'd want its stuff to be free win.

(1h 45m 12s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 45m 14s) **Al:**

> No, that is a possibility and that is something we will never truly know because it's internal politics.

(1h 45m 22s)

> Anyway, are you still there? Okay, cool. Just checking.

(1h 45m 24s) **Nama:**

> - Yeah, I'm still there.

(1h 45m 26s)

> - Yeah. (laughs)

(1h 45m 28s) **Al:**

> All right. Well, thank you now me for joining me. I guess we'll we'll we'll see how it is when it actually comes out next year.

(1h 45m 37s)

> This feels like the longest between an announcement for animal crossing update and it coming out.

(1h 45m 43s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I wonder I maybe they were just

(1h 45m 47s)

> Positioning this ahead of the holidays

(1h 45m 51s)

> Just like before holiday shopping begins and earnest. They're like hey also if you're a fan of

(1h 45m 59s)

> Didn't like a animal crossing you can get a switch to yeah, you can get us

(1h 46m 1s) **Al:**

> put aside $5. Oh, right. Oh, it's for it's switch to sales.

(1h 46m 6s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, you can get a switch to for the holidays and then still have something

(1h 46m 13s) **Al:**

> I think what's interesting is that it's coming out in January.

(1h 46m 16s)

> Like, is it really not ready now?

(1h 46m 18s)

> Could you not have it out for now?

(1h 46m 19s) **Nama:**

[laughing]

(1h 46m 20s) **Al:**

> Like, because my argument for game releases is,

(1h 46m 25s)

> you never announced the date of a release

(1h 46m 27s)

> unless you could release it now.

(1h 46m 29s) **Nama:**

> sure. Especially now it is, I'll tell you, here's the thing.

(1h 46m 30s) **Al:**

> And I feel like Nintendo generally does that,

(1h 46m 34s)

> if we ignore Pokemon.

(1h 46m 37s)

> So I just like, do they actually need these next two months

(1h 46m 41s)

> to see if Pollock.

(1h 46m 43s)

> Yeah, I doubt it. It just seems like a weird time for it because like this is our, tell me if I'm wrong, but animal crossing very much feels like a autumn winter game.

(1h 46m 55s) **Nama:**

> Um, me, I don't know, I think what it is, is that they have a game coming out in December

(1h 47m 1s)

> and they have a game coming out in February. So like, okay, well, we'll give us some,

(1h 47m 5s)

> we'll put in them across in January. Like, I think that, well, I don't know.

(1h 47m 7s) **Al:**

> It's not, but it's not, it's not any, what's February?

(1h 47m 14s)

> Oh, you're, oh, you mean they, they will have one,

(1h 47m 16s)

> not that they've announced one, okay?

(1h 47m 16s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah, there might be a February game.

(1h 47m 18s) **Al:**

> 'Cause what's the crossover between met tried

(1h 47m 20s)

> and animal crossing players?

(1h 47m 22s) **Nama:**

> Well, nothing. I think Nintendo likes to have

(1h 47m 25s)

> something come out every month. And I think like, okay, we're having a new Nintendo

(1h 47m 29s)

> published game come out on the shelf in December, and we had an Nintendo

(1h 47m 35s)

> public game come out in November. What's our Nintendo public game coming out in

(1h 47m 38s)

> January? I think that they really, since it's a new box on the shelf, I think

(1h 47m 43s)

> that like they count Animal Crossing Switch to Edition as their game for the

(1h 47m 48s)

> month. Even if it's a $5 upgrade to people who already opened it, it is a new, yeah,

(1h 47m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah, no, that's fair. I've seen that argument as well from people is that they clearly certainly sense the switch to to come have come out. They've released something every month.

(1h 48m 2s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Like Mario Party, Jamboree, H, like Switch to Edition, that was their, that was their August game.

(1h 48m 3s) **Al:**

> So.

(1h 48m 6s)

> Yeah.

(1h 48m 10s) **Nama:**

> Now, here it is.

(1h 48m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, and I guess that's the thing is if you're going to release something in January.

(1h 48m 17s)

> It needs to be something small or it needs to be something that you don't

(1h 48m 21s)

> want a humongous number of sales for, that will forever amuse me. You cannot convince me that

(1h 48m 22s) **Nama:**

> - Yeah, like something like Pokemon Legends arc is,

(1h 48m 29s)

[laughing]

(1h 48m 34s) **Al:**

> that game wasn't delayed. You just cannot convince me that there is no way the original plan was

(1h 48m 36s) **Nama:**

[laughing]

(1h 48m 40s) **Al:**

> releasing those two games two months apart.

(1h 48m 46s) **Nama:**

> - Oh, okay, cool, there we are.

## Outro

(1h 48m 49s) **Al:**

> All right, thank you very much. Is there anything you would like to share with the audience?

(1h 48m 55s) **Nama:**

> Not really. I may or may not be cooking at my own projects down the line, but you can just say hello to me,

(1h 49m 5s)

> not me the nerd on pretty much anything. If you're on X, if you're on Blue Sky, I'll see it eventually.

[laughing]

> The email me monthly saying how many comments I've had, which for me is either zero or
