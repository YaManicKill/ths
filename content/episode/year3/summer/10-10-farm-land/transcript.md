## Intro

(30s) **Al:**

> Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season. My name is Al,

(36s) **Codey:**

> And my name is Cody.

(38s) **Al:**

> and we are here to talk about one thing and one thing only, and that is pokopia.

(44s) **Codey:**

> Sucksong, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, Sucksong.

(51s) **Al:**

> Now, our actual main topic, for some reason, is a YouTube playable called Farmland. Now,

(58s)

> if you're thinking what is a youtube player

(1m)

> that is a great question. YouTube apparently have games now and they're called youtube

(1m 6s)

> playables and I found out about that like last week and there I had a look through and I was

(1m 7s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1m 9s)

> Mm-hmm.

(1m 14s) **Al:**

> like are any of these farming games and one of them was a farming game so I went let's talk about

(1m 19s)

> that then and we'll maybe get 10 minutes discussion out of it I don't know we'll see I suspect the main

(1m 26s)

> topic will not actually be that, but that's what we're listing.

(1m 29s) **Codey:**

> Wow

(1m 30s) **Al:**

> As the main topic, I said, I said maybe, maybe.

(1m 31s) **Codey:**

> You think we're gonna get

(1m 36s)

> Okay, well I am playing it right now, so I'm gonna see how far I can get that's true I

(1m 39s) **Al:**

> I have played it for at least 10 minutes, so surely I can talk about it for at least 10 minutes.

(1m 44s) **Codey:**

> Also have played it for at least 10 minutes. I'm currently

(1m 49s)

> Doing stuff so yeah very cool

(1m 51s) **Al:**

> It's going to be quite the jump from two hours talking about Grand Bazaar last week too.

(2m)

> We're going to talk about that. We have a bunch of news because the Nintendo Direct was yesterday,

(2m 2s) **Codey:**

> I'm sure we can find a way to talk about it for...

(2m 10s) **Al:**

> and all I want to do is talk about Paul Coppier, so we will talk about that.

(2m 11s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

## What Have We Been Up To

(2m 14s) **Codey:**

> But first Al what have you been up to uh-huh, uh-huh

(2m 17s) **Al:**

> Well, Cody, thank you for asking, so kind of you. This week I've basically just been continuing

(2m 23s)

> playing Grand Bazaar, which is unusual. I'm continuing to play a game after I covered it

(2m 28s)

> it on the podcast. And I think

(2m 30s)

> I think I've doubled my playtime on it now. So, yeah, that's something. I'm very much enjoying

(2m 37s)

> it. I've unlocked a bunch of stuff that I knew about in theory, and a bunch of stuff that I

(2m 42s)

> didn't know about. So it's, yeah, continuing to be good, continuing to be fun. I am half a million

(2m 50s)

> and one stall away from finishing to become the... Interestingly, not. So, you haven't listened.

(3m)

> the last podcast, Cody. So you won't know about this, but your bazaar ranks up. So you start off

(3m 1s) **Codey:**

> Nope, yep.

(3m 5s) **Al:**

> as a local bazaar, and then you become a regional bazaar, and then a national bazaar, and it gets

(3m 11s)

> bigger, bigger, bigger. And I was like, "Oh, OK, cool. So the last rank is going to be grand bazaar,

(3m 16s)

> right? Because it's grand bazaar." No, it's not. It's called a world bazaar.

(3m 18s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but that, but it's supposed to be grand.

(3m 24s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know why they're calling it...

(3m 24s) **Codey:**

> So that means there's not, you're not at the, it hasn't achieved its final form yet.

(3m 30s)

> There's going to be more.

(3m 30s) **Al:**

> Maybe. I doubt it. But yeah, so I've got half a million of sales to make and one more stall to

(3m 40s)

> put up, which this stall is taking a while because I need to have three-star honey, three-star

(3m 46s)

> mushrooms, and three-star fish. And I haven't been doing the honey and the mushrooms, and I've not

(3m 52s)

> really been doing the fish. I've been doing a bit of the fish, but not really. So I've been kind of

(3m 56s)

> of just grinding away at those three to try and level them up while doing other

(4m)

> things. And I think I'm pretty close to getting married. I've got like, is it 8 out of 10 hearts with

(4m 9s)

> Kagetsu? I think that's her name. So yeah, that's probably about it.

(4m 10s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. I'm gonna nod like I know

(4m 16s) **Al:**

> I also found, oh no, one last thing. I found out there is a teleporter in the game. You can get,

(4m 22s)

> once you get three stones, there's like a wind stone, a something else stone,

(4m 26s)

> and something else. It might be water and fire. I don't know.

(4m 30s)

> Am I playing Avatar? No Earth, though. Or maybe there was an Earth one. There are three,

(4m 30s) **Codey:**

> That would make sense.

(4m 36s) **Al:**

> not four, so there's three of them. And once you combine them, you can then warp to anywhere

(4m 41s)

> on the map. So I want to do that. So I guess we'll see how long it takes to get to that as well.

(4m 50s)

> If I finish everything else I want to do before that, then I'm probably not going to continue

(4m 54s)

> playing the game just to do that. But anyway. Yeah, that's...

(5m)

> That's me, Cody. What have you been up to?

(5m 2s) **Codey:**

> Uh, well right now I'm playing farmland and I need to set it down, um, to see what I'm

(5m 8s)

> talking about.

(5m 9s)

> Uh, what I have been up to is, uh, y'all won't believe it still my PhD though I, we have

(5m 19s)

> started trying to set a date.

(5m 21s)

> I was going to try and defend in December, but then we were like, there's a lot of holidays

(5m 25s)

> around there.

(5m 26s)

> It's also kind of hit or miss some of the people on my committee, um, are from other

(5m 30s)

> countries and usually travel back to the U.S.

(5m 32s)

> internationally during that time.

(5m 34s)

> Um, and so we were like, let's just do January after the holidays and everything.

(5m 39s)

> So it'll be the last two weeks of January.

(5m 41s)

> We are narrowing it down.

(5m 43s)

> So I have a lot to do until then.

(5m 46s)

> Um, I have a lot of writing and I really hate writing.

(5m 50s)

> Like, I mean, I, so I enjoy writing.

(5m 52s)

> I enjoy reading the things that people do, but because of my ADHD, I have really

(5m 58s)

> ridiculous executive dysfunction when it comes to writing.

(6m 3s)

> And because I'm like, Oh, what do I start with? Like, where do

(6m 6s)

> what do I do? Where do I whatever? And so luckily, right

(6m 11s)

> now for one of my chapters, I'm in the massaging stage of it.

(6m 14s)

> So like, it's there, I just need to like, add some more stuff

(6m 16s)

> and read some more papers. But yep. Also, on top of that, we

(6m 18s) **Al:**

> Fair enough.

(6m 21s) **Codey:**

> are gonna get a puppy.

(6m 24s)

> Oh, whoo, literally. Oh, whoo.

(6m 28s)

> Yeah, I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on the pod, but

(6m 31s)

> but my geriatric.

(6m 32s)

> Beagle is now on the across the Rainbow Bridge.

(6m 37s)

> He was very old, very crotchety, and he went on his own terms.

(6m 42s)

> But it was his time.

(6m 42s)

> So I'm like, I'm pretty I'm pretty sure with it.

(6m 44s)

> But Stella does seem to want another furry creature.

(6m 49s)

> And we also have been wanting to possibly get another Aussie puppy.

(6m 53s)

> So we've put them down the deposit.

(6m 56s)

> We have four possible ones.

(6m 58s)

> I'll put these in the spoiler thread.

(7m 2s)

> I got four options. They're all blue murals, and they're voo-ver-cute.

(7m 6s) **Al:**

> people to click into before the podcast is even out as they always do. They're really, really

(7m 23s) **Codey:**

> There you go. You can look at them now.

(7m 25s) **Al:**

> I'm, I'm looking, no, so fluffy.

(7m 26s) **Codey:**

> Okay, so I have this...

(7m 32s)

> I'm going to pretend that this is the same moment I'm getting a puppy, I put it in a thread on slack to be looked at after Wednesday the 17th.

(7m 42s)

> I'm getting one of these. I don't know which one.

(7m 44s) **Al:**

> Yo, does one of them have heterochromia?

(7m 44s) **Codey:**

> It might be. They might. The blue murals?

(7m 46s) **Al:**

> Heterochromia.

(7m 49s)

> Looks like one blue in one brain, eh?

(7m 50s) **Codey:**

> So it's possible that their eyes are just still changing colors.

(7m 56s)

> We'll know more when they're older.

(8m 2s)

> But I don't think we have any more updates of them, but it's the same breeder that we got Stella from.

(8m 9s)

> We love her dogs. She takes really good care of her dogs. She really cares about all of them. There's not updates.

(8m 17s)

> So yeah, we just we're getting another one. That's very exciting.

(8m 21s)

> We're trying to figure out names. So if it's the female, there's one of those that's female.

(8m 25s)

> And if it's a female, we want to name her Peppercorn. If it's a male, we don't know what to name him.

(8m 32s)

> We're not soliciting names at this time. So I named Stella after that game that broke my heart, Spiritfarer.

(8m 41s) **Al:**

> Oh, yes.

(8m 42s) **Codey:**

> So I am soliciting game. Peppercorn, it's a lady.

(8m 43s) **Al:**

> So, Hornet then, obviously.

(8m 49s)

> So the one from Hollow Knight, he doesn't have a name, does he?

(8m 50s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but also I'm an entomologist.

(8m 55s)

> The one from Hollow Knight. What one from Hollow Knight?

(8m 58s) **Al:**

> The main character, the playable character.

(8m 59s) **Codey:**

> He's just the knight, I think.

(9m) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(9m 1s)

> So, yeah, that's not a name, that's my point.

(9m 2s) **Codey:**

> But yeah, he doesn't have his own name.

(9m 5s)

> Yeah, I know.

(9m 7s)

> So if I'm going to go with Hornet, I would have to go with, like, Dolico.

(9m 11s)

> Or Dolico Vespi.

(9m 12s)

> Like, I have to go, like, the scientific name.

(9m 14s)

> And I did start, their names are...

(9m 19s)

> Their names are, right now, they are the baby sharks.

(9m 22s)

> And so there's, like, Tiger, and Whale, and Great White, and Mako.

(9m 28s)

> So that's, like, their names right now.

(9m 31s)

> the theme of--

(9m 32s)

> this litter, and so I was looking up shark stuff last night, and I came up

(9m 38s)

> like sharks-- the entire clade of sharks is called like solachia, but I

(9m 44s)

> don't want to do that, but it looks like it's slouchy. I don't really love that

(9m 49s)

> either, so we're workshopping it. I would love advice, suggestions, give me some

(9m 53s)

> suggestions y'all, but most importantly the biggest thing I've been up to--

(9m 57s)

> actually it's not the biggest thing, biggest thing is my PhD, but the thing

(10m 2s)

> Y'all, no. No, because it's free on Game Pass.

## Silksong

(10m 4s) **Al:**

> So song. So did you buy it on releasing?

(10m 9s) **Codey:**

> Yes.

(10m 11s) **Al:**

> Did you download it on release day?

(10m 14s)

> Could this be? This is like this is this was like when when

(10m 20s)

> my six year old Craig, he's very like single minded on things.

(10m 24s) **Codey:**

> Uh-huh.

(10m 24s) **Al:**

> Right. And I'll go right.

(10m 26s)

> Can you put your plate in the kitchen, please?

(10m 28s)

> And he was like, it's not a plate, it's a bowl.

(10m 30s)

> I'm like, OK, can you put your bowl in the kitchen, please?

(10m 34s)

> And that felt like that interaction there.

(10m 36s)

> It's like, did you buy it on the release day?

(10m 38s)

> And like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because it's free.

(10m 39s) **Codey:**

> I got it for free.

(10m 40s) **Al:**

> And it's like, OK, but did you get it on release day?

(10m 43s)

> Oh, my word, I'm sorry for choosing the wrong words.

(10m 45s) **Codey:**

> What I'm hearing is Craig and I would get along.

(10m 49s)

> If you ever have any questions about bugs,

(10m 52s)

> I would answer any and all questions.

(10m 54s)

> I am going to play it at first, because I thought I was going to get sucked in and not be able to get sucked in and only play and not work.

(11m 8s)

> Which has happened for like a day, like one day, but I also needed a day off because right now I'm just not taking days off, I'm just working like a little less on the weekends and quote unquote weekends.

(11m 24s)

> Like I don't have certain days that I'm supposed to week, so sorry work, so anyway, slow song, love it, 10 out of 10, I have it.

(11m 34s) **Al:**

> Yes, so you got some song you did not purchase it and and yeah, tell me about it cuz I so you played Hollow Knight, right? I

(11m 43s)

> Did I played it up to?

(11m 46s)

> What was the one there's like one where you've got like like three big rolling bugs and they're like, yeah

(11m 53s) **Codey:**

> Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

(11m 53s) **Al:**

> I hate those ones

(11m 54s)

> I couldn't get past them in the time that I had and then I went moved on to a different game

(11m 59s)

> can't remember what it was and

(12m 2s)

> Every time I went back, I went, "Oh!"

(12m 4s)

> I'm right at it, like I paused it right at the point where I was having the most difficulty

(12m 8s)

> and struggling, and it's like, you can't get back into a game at that point, so I never got back into it.

(12m 14s)

> And yeah, so I love the combat, and I love the exploration, and I hate the backtracking,

(12m 21s)

> and Silksong seems bigger and more annoying, and therefore I'm glad that people are enjoying it,

(12m 27s)

> but I don't think I'm going to get it. So now tell me how you're enjoying it.

(12m 31s) **Codey:**

> I'm enjoying it. I do agree. We think that my husband and I talk about it a lot and we think

(12m 36s)

> that like Team Cherry has knocked it out of the park. They basically took Hollow Knight and just

(12m 41s)

> increased the difficulty level a little bit. Some people might say a lot of it, but I think a lot

(12m 47s)

> of us have like become disillusioned with how difficult Hollow Knight is because people have

(12m 53s)

> been playing it for years. And so they're like, oh, this isn't hard. And I'm like, you don't remember

(12m 54s) **Al:**

> Mm hmm. Oh, hey, no, it is. Yeah.

(12m 57s) **Codey:**

> when you first started playing this game and you

(13m 1s)

> were dying to like tiny little mobs like they people just like have forgotten that and they're

(13m 6s)

> like this is so hard it's like no you just you just forgot because you've been playing hollow

(13m 12s)

> night for seven years um but I really like it um I haven't been putting as much time as my husband

(13m 19s)

> has and uh he says i'm more efficient at bosses so not to brag but um I also like that there are

(13m 27s)

> multiple things you can do and multiple ways you can go so it's not just like one

(13m 31s)

> path um and I think hall and I did this as well but like it there are things that my husband or

(13m 38s)

> one of my friends who's been playing have like found and they're like oh have you gotten to this

(13m 44s)

> part yet and i'm like oh I completely when I went through that area that didn't happen

(13m 49s)

> so like there's just completely different storylines based on what you do um and yeah

(13m 54s) **Al:**

> Yeah, they definitely did that in Hollow Knight, where especially at the end there were like

(13m 58s)

> a million different endings, depending on exactly what you did during the game.

(14m) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(14m 1s)

> Yup, so they have that.

(14m 4s)

> You don't want to play a million times.

(14m 4s) **Al:**

> Which is murder. Which is murder for me. Like, because you're like,

(14m 8s) **Codey:**

> Yup.

(14m 9s)

> Well, but Al, the current speed run is only an hour.

(14m 10s) **Al:**

> "Which ending do I want? How many times do I want to play? How many endings do I want? I don't know."

(14m 15s) **Codey:**

> So you can beat it.

(14m 19s) **Al:**

> oh for goodness sake that's just

(14m 21s) **Codey:**

> Yup.

(14m 22s)

> Yup.

(14m 23s)

> You beat it.

(14m 24s) **Al:**

> so stupid how it's been it has been just over a week just over a week and and someone has

(14m 31s) **Codey:**

> Yup.

(14m 32s) **Al:**

> managed to get to the point where they can complete it in an hour that is madness

(14m 36s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(14m 38s)

> Mm-hmm.

(14m 39s)

> Yeah, I don't know how people are doing this.

(14m 42s)

> People are weird.

(14m 43s)

> People are wild.

(14m 46s)

> But yeah, so I'm really enjoying it.

(14m 48s)

> I think it deserves a lot more time to talk about it

(14m 53s)

> than just this little what have I been up to.

(14m 56s)

> So I have prepared some notes about why we should have silks.

(15m 1s)

> So first of all, we have had other podcast episodes that were about games that were not cottage core, and actually if I remember correctly, we started out as a farming podcast, but then we did Animal Crossing, so then we opened it up to a cottage core.

(15m 17s) **Al:**

> Excuse me, Animal Crossing has farming in it, thank you very much.

(15m 21s) **Codey:**

> It didn't at the beginning when we played it.

(15m 25s)

> But we played it. Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

(15m 30s) **Al:**

> I said it has, not had, it has farming in it.

(15m 32s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, but when we when it did not at the time, so.

(15m 37s) **Al:**

> OK, so you're trying to suggest that instead Silksong is Cottagecore, is that what you're

(15m 43s)

> trying to say?

(15m 43s) **Codey:**

> No, no, I would not say this song is cottage core. What I would say is that it is a game that is well loved by people who play this, who are who host sometimes co host this podcast.

(15m 45s) **Al:**

> Okay.

(15m 59s) **Codey:**

> Um, and I

(16m 1s)

> I believe that people would enjoy hearing it hearing us talk about it hearing me rant about it for like an hour

(16m 12s)

> So I'm just saying like if we're sticking with the oh but it's not cottagecore like we played Animal Crossing when we were just farming

(16m 18s)

> podcast we also have played Balatro

(16m 21s)

> which before Balatro got

(16m 23s) **Al:**

> Was that not a greenhouse episode?

(16m 26s) **Codey:**

> Nope that was a regular episode

(16m 28s) **Al:**

> We did a regular episode in Balatro?

(16m 30s)

> Why on earth did we do that?

(16m 31s) **Codey:**

> It's yeah, I don't know. I I was scrolling back through the previous episodes and I found that so

(16m 33s) **Al:**

> What?

(16m 38s)

> Oh my word, so it's last November?

(16m 40s)

> What on earth was that about?

(16m 41s)

> Who did that?

(16m 42s)

> Me and Kevin?

(16m 43s)

> Why did we do that?

(16m 45s)

> Oh, I tell you exactly what it was.

(16m 48s)

> It was because that was when they released the "Dave the Diver" crossover.

(16m 49s) **Codey:**

> Following

(16m 52s)

> Okay, but but

(16m 56s)

> Also, there is farming in Silksong I've been farming to get rosaries

(17m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, OK, so there's two, I'm sorry, you literally grow something at the very start of the first

(17m 1s) **Codey:**

> You just do the same area. Oh also turnip boy

(17m 5s)

> The fact that he is a turnip does not mean that it's a farming game or a cottagecore game. I'm sorry you rob a bank

(17m 15s) **Al:**

> Turn and Buy game. Thank you. Yeah, I know, I'm pretty sure you still grow stuff in that

(17m 16s) **Codey:**

> The first one but the second one you rob a bank

(17m 21s) **Al:**

> one as well. Plus, we all know this is not just a Cottagecore podcast, this is a Cottagecore

(17m 22s) **Codey:**

> I'm pretty sure

(17m 29s)

> Okay. Well, so that's the thing is that you, when I suggested it, you said that's not a cottage

(17m 34s)

> core game. So I was like, okay, so I came prepared, uh, some other things. Um, it has sold so many,

(17m 40s)

> so many copies. It sold over 50, no, over 5 million. No, sorry. It made over $50 million

(17m 46s)

> in the first three days. Um, it has over 5 million players right now. And that's not including people

(17m 53s)

> like my husband who bought it on multiple. So he bought it, he bought it on multiple platforms.

(17m 59s)

> Um, uh, team cherry is arguably another concern concerned ape human where this is a very limited

(18m 7s)

> studio. They only have three people and they just develop this behemoth that basically spawns its

(18m 14s)

> own little like genre and like love of things and like little creature stuff, like love it. Um,

(18m 23s)

> and they sold it. It is only $20. They could have made this game.

(18m 29s)

> Like the full 60, $70 and people would have bought it on multiple platforms again,

(18m 34s)

> but they didn't. And you know what? That is anti-capitalist and arguably that is cottage core.

(18m 41s)

> Uh, and finally they do have cozy vibes. So I don't know if you've seen the videos of Sherma.

(18m 47s)

> She's this little character that like is playing music. Um, and she's trying to open gates and

(18m 53s)

> stuff based on, uh, these music that she plays. And she thinks that her music is getting her through

(19m)

> it. Um, but she's so sweet and people have made entire remixes of her song. Um,

(19m 7s)

> yeah, there's a lot of singing in this. Like you come upon multiple characters that are singing.

(19m 12s)

> Uh, I also really love chakra. So listeners, if you are, uh, if this hasn't been cut out

(19m 19s)

> and if you would have liked to see to hear a song song episode.

(19m 20s) **Al:**

> I like how I'm going to cut stuff out of this short episode, come on.

(19m 30s) **Codey:**

> Uh, if you would like to hear a silk song, a silk song episode with me and another human,

(19m 36s)

> uh, just say, uh, pachanko in the, in the Slack and tweet it to us, uh, Instagram it at us, whatever.

(19m 44s) **Al:**

> I don't have an Instagram, do we?

(19m 47s) **Codey:**

> I do. And I usually say, uh, whatever. I don't know. I think it'd be fun.

(19m 50s) **Al:**

> OK, so.

(19m 54s) **Codey:**

> Think of all the new listeners we'll get when we have a silk song episode.

(19m 56s) **Al:**

> Are you going to listen to me, Cody?

(19m 57s)

> Are you going to listen to me?

(19m 59s) **Codey:**

> I'm trying to think if I have anything else to say. No.

(20m) **Al:**

> You...

(20m 1s)

> Yeah, exactly.

(20m 2s)

> So listen.

(20m 5s)

> You missed out two arguments that you really should make.

(20m 9s) **Codey:**

> Okay. In the game, he's in. Oh, and you don't think the team cherry devs are.

(20m 9s) **Al:**

> One, concerned ape is in the game.

(20m 12s)

> So, that's the thing.

(20m 14s)

> Yeah, he's credited as a voice in the game.

(20m 20s)

> Wait, what?

(20m 21s)

> Concerned Ape is in Silksong.

(20m 22s) **Codey:**

> Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. Nevermind. Okay. There you go. So you came more prepared than

(20m 28s) **Al:**

> Like, they don't know who he is, but he is a voice.

(20m 29s) **Codey:**

> I did. I didn't know that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bugs. Bugs. Okay.

(20m 32s) **Al:**

> He is one of the voices in game, in Silksong.

(20m 35s)

> And two, and this is really the biggest argument, right, that you should use.

(20m 41s)

> And it's probably the reason that I'm going to say fine, let's do it.

(20m 44s)

> No, no, no, definitely not.

(20m 47s)

> I hate thinking of episode topics.

(20m 52s) **Codey:**

> Oh my God. You're so right. Well, let's.

(20m 54s) **Al:**

> You know this, because you see me almost every week going, "Oh, right, what's the next topic?

(20m 59s)

> We need more topics."

(21m) **Codey:**

> You've really only been doing that like once a month. Now you're like, uh, what are we going

(21m 4s)

> to do for the next month? And then we just like throw stuff out and you're like, yeah,

(21m 8s)

> cool. Let's run with it. Uh, so you've had to, you've had to do that less and less. I will admit,

(21m 14s)

> but yeah, we got you. I did. I already, I already added it y'all.

(21m 15s) **Al:**

> Oh, thank you.

(21m 15s)

> That's so kind.

(21m 19s)

> You actually put it in the Notion.

(21m 23s)

> You put it in as an episode.

(21m 27s)

> Wow.

(21m 29s)

> So, for the listeners, we use Notion for tracking the episodes.

(21m 33s)

> And like, I have a planning board that I put on episodes, and there's different stages of planning for them.

(21m 40s)

> and Cody has literally put it on the board under the sedan.

(21m 43s) **Codey:**

> I've already made one.

(21m 44s) **Al:**

> I will I will approve that you didn't put it in suggestion.

(21m 48s)

> You didn't put it in planned.

(21m 48s) **Codey:**

> Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

(21m 50s)

> I put it in suggestion.

(21m 50s) **Al:**

> So I will give you that.

(21m 52s) **Codey:**

> I added me as one of the hosts.

(21m 56s)

> I don't know who else, which of the other hosts,

(21m 59s)

> or if there's someone...

(22m) **Al:**

> Well, I think you do know who it's going to be.

(22m 2s)

> I'm not going to say it on the podcast, but you go.

(22m 4s) **Codey:**

> Okay.

(22m 5s) **Al:**

> I've added it into notion.

(22m 7s) **Codey:**

> Okay. Who?

(22m 8s)

> I don't know who else is playing it.

(22m 10s) **Al:**

> Are you not looking at the

(22m 11s) **Codey:**

> Oh, no.

(22m 13s)

> H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h

(22m 26s) **Al:**

> All right. So, look, I'm not promising this will happen, listeners. I never promise episodes.

(22m 32s)

> Never promise episodes. But we'll see. We'll see. Is that all you want to talk about with

(22m 36s)

> Silksong today, then? All right. Is that meant to mean something? Is there something in Silksong?

(22m 43s) **Codey:**

> Yes. No. A-woo!

(22m 44s) **Al:**

> Is it a character in Silksong? Okay. Let's talk about some news. All righty. As I desperately

## Game News

(22m 56s) **Al:**

> find where my news document is, here it is. First up, Dingkum, the Australian cosy survival

(23m 2s)

> sim has a release date for Switch. So I'm pretty sure we knew this was coming. It's

(23m 8s)

> out on Steam and they had originally been like, oh yeah, we'll come to Switch as well.

(23m 12s)

> But as with so many games, who knew when it was actually going to happen? And the answer

(23m 16s)

> is we knew. We knew. We now knew. So, it is. Oh, did I say that?

(23m 18s) **Codey:**

> We knew it. We were aware.

(23m 26s) **Al:**

> Did I say the date? I don't know. 6th of November. That is the day after Craig's birthday.

(23m 28s) **Codey:**

> Yep, ooh nice happy birthday to him. Is he gonna play this?

(23m 36s) **Al:**

> No, probably not, no. He's still playing Astro Bot because he's obsessed with it.

(23m 39s) **Codey:**

> Okay, oh

(23m 41s) **Al:**

> He's done everything in the game, but he still continues to play it.

(23m 41s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, fair

(23m 44s) **Al:**

> I'm trying to get him to start playing.

(23m 44s) **Codey:**

> There I

(23m 48s)

> Haven't I don't know if I've ever actually looked at this game and

(23m 53s)

> I just saw that there are planes and jousting and

(23m 58s)

> I'm just like, I don't know what this game is.

(24m 1s) **Al:**

> This is one of the games, and I'll talk about this later in the podcast as well, that really

(24m 7s)

> tell you when someone doesn't play many games of this art style, because they go, "Oh, it's

(24m 14s)

> a Minecraft rip-off," and you're like, you can't call anything that uses like, you know,

(24m 20s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(24m 21s) **Al:**

> poly, what's it poly, low poly, low poly, there we go, low poly art styles as a Minecraft

(24m 24s) **Codey:**

> The blocks, yeah.

(24m 28s) **Al:**

> rip-off.

(24m 29s)

> of Minecraft has now been out for--

(24m 31s)

> or was it 14 years, 2011, 14 years.

(24m 33s) **Codey:**

> Oh my gosh don't say that. Nope. Nope. I'm not that old.

(24m 36s) **Al:**

> Minecraft is a teenager now.

(24m 39s)

> There are teenagers alive that were born after Minecraft came out.

(24m 40s) **Codey:**

> It's on its it's on its way to vote. It can almost vote. If we still can vote and by the time it's 18.

(24m 48s) **Al:**

> Well, you can vote 16 in Scotland, so it's not far away from that.

(24m 50s) **Codey:**

> Well in America voting is gonna about to become not a thing.

(25m 1s) **Al:**

> Yes, so there are so many games that do low-poly art.

(25m 6s)

> Stop comparing everything to Minecraft.

(25m 8s)

> It just shows that you don't know what you're talking about.

(25m 11s)

> It's boring, right?

(25m 12s)

> It is a low-poly survival sim,

(25m 16s)

> and so I understand why people would compare this one to Minecraft,

(25m 19s)

> because it's obviously, you know, Minecraft is a survival game as well.

(25m 23s)

> But this is, I think, very much focused on, like, kind of actually living a life,

(25m 29s)

> whereas like the minecraft was

(25m 31s)

> you know much more about the creative aspects of things. And this is about exploration and

(25m 36s)

> survival and you can catch like massive sharks. So that's interesting. I've not played this game.

(25m 39s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm I saw that

(25m 45s) **Al:**

> It might be something that I would play at some point, but yeah it's cool that it's coming to

(25m 51s)

> Switch finally in November. Next we have Linked Banner of the Spark. This is another game that

(25m 53s) **Codey:**

> Yep, yep, looks cool

(25m 59s) **Al:**

> that was already out on Steve.

(26m 1s)

> I'm just going to read the blurb on Steam. I feel like that's the easiest way to try

(26m 5s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(26m 6s)

> I'm excited for you to explain this.

(26m 10s)

> OK.

(26m 12s) **Al:**

> and explain, because this game is unexplainable I think.

(26m 16s)

> Build a bright new world alongside a band of rescued robot buddies. In this colourful

(26m 21s)

> action RPG battle waves of enemies in solo or co-op, then return home and use their part

(26m 31s)

> to craft a thriving town. Assemble your crew and grow stronger with each new adventure.

(26m 38s)

> It feels a lot like, obviously not in tone at all, but in terms of gameplay, it feels

(26m 46s)

> a lot like Cult of the Lamb, where you're out. I think the roguelite aspect is, although

(26m 48s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm, yeah.

(26m 54s) **Al:**

> they never said that in that description, but it is roguelite, the roguelite aspect

(26m 59s)

> I think is you go out and do right.

(27m 1s)

> It was I'm going out to do a run and get stuff, and if I die on the run, sure, I lose some of the stuff that I got on the run, but then I come back to my base and my base is the same. It's consistent and you build it up, and you don't lose it if you die in a run. That's what I liked about cult of the lamb, and so I'm interested in this game. I mean, we vaguely talked about it in June because I think it was in the wholesome direct.

(27m 31s)

> Interesting version of wholesome when there's such a big combat element, but that building is a poke center.

(27m 41s)

> Are you looking at this on Steam?

(27m 43s) **Codey:**

> at the banner of the Spark game.

(27m 47s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(27m 47s) **Codey:**

> I mean, I already looked at it earlier.

(27m 49s)

> What-- oh, yeah.

(27m 49s) **Al:**

> Go look at the third image in the image reel. That is, tell me that's not just a poke center.

(27m 57s)

> That is a pokebond center, if I've ever seen one.

(28m) **Codey:**

> And a Pokemart-- it's a Pokemart and a PokeCenter.

(28m 1s) **Al:**

> It's like it's a yeah, it's a Pokemon center just with like a random thing stuck on the top and the pokeball logo taken away.

(28m 6s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(28m 8s)

> Yeah.

(28m 10s) **Al:**

> I like the style of this game, the art style of the game, like the kind of the thick lines around all the character models is quite, you know, eye catching. The colors are quite poppy, vibrant. There's the word, yeah.

(28m 19s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(28m 24s)

> Vibrant they're so vibrant. Yeah, I was just thinking that

(28m 31s) **Al:**

> Maybe I'll try this at some point. Okay, it's on my wish list. We'll see how things go.

(28m 32s) **Codey:**

> It looks it looks really cool

(28m 36s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(28m 37s) **Codey:**

> It's really loud

(28m 38s) **Al:**

> Oh, they called it rogue life.

(28m 40s) **Codey:**

> They call it a rogue life RPG

(28m 41s) **Al:**

> You know what? I don't hate that term, right? If this term comes to mean like games like

(28m 50s)

> Cult of the Lamb, where you have a base that is the consistent thing, and you go out and do stuff and bring stuff back to your base.

(28m 56s)

> I quite like that term because it's showing how it's got the

(29m 1s)

> aspects to it in your runs where you can die and lose stuff, but it's life sim, but it also

(29m 3s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(29m 5s)

> But it's a life sim

(29m 8s) **Al:**

> like, I think makes that, like that would then tell me which games I like, right? Like it's

(29m 13s)

> rogue life. I like rogue life games. I don't like rogue likes or road lights. I like rogue lives.

(29m 14s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(29m 18s) **Al:**

> There we go. I'm going to make it a thing. Rogue life. Let's go for it. That's the name of the

(29m 21s)

> episode. Rogue life. No, no, no, they have written it, but that doesn't make it a thing, right? We're

(29m 22s) **Codey:**

> Well, you didn't make it a thing. They made it a thing.

(29m 29s) **Al:**

> We're gonna make a thing.

(29m 30s) **Codey:**

> Okay. Okay. Cool. Was one of the first rogue lives.

(29m 31s) **Al:**

> We're gonna make everybody use it.

(29m 33s)

> OK, so Cult of the Alarm is a rogue life.

(29m 38s)

> Yes, there are probably others as well.

(29m 39s) **Codey:**

> Okay, like Minecraft?

(29m 41s) **Al:**

> Well, no, because there's no rogue aspect there.

(29m 44s) **Codey:**

> Well, you go out and go in dungeons and collect stuff and then you come back to your base

(29m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but like, yeah, but that's not the rogue part.

(29m 53s)

> Like, if you like.

(29m 55s) **Codey:**

> If you die, then you're all your stuff drops where you died you have to go get it again

(29m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but you can just go and get it again, because it's

(30m 1s)

> like a survival RPG, right?

(30m 3s)

> Whereas with, yeah, well, surprise, surprise.

(30m 3s) **Codey:**

> Sorry, I'm just trying to I'm trying to pick I'm trying to be a but

(30m 9s) **Al:**

> The point is you lose stuff, right?

(30m 9s) **Codey:**

> It's a day that

(30m 10s) **Al:**

> If you just drop stuff and you can go pick it up, it's not a rogue like.

(30m 14s) **Codey:**

> It's a day that ends in y being a but yeah, no, I get it

(30m 17s) **Al:**

> All right, I've added it to my wish list.

(30m 20s)

> No promises I'll play it, but.

(30m 22s) **Codey:**

> I will not promise that

(30m 24s) **Al:**

> Oh yeah, so it says linked banner of the spark, by the way, bad name, fuses

(30m 29s)

> the action-packed fun of a rogue

(30m 31s)

> light with the rich progression and charm of a life sim.

(30m 34s)

> That definitely makes it sound like your your bass is consistent and stays between runs.

(30m 42s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, you build it up, and you get stronger with each run.

(30m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(30m 45s)

> OK. OK. OK.

(30m 45s) **Codey:**

> That's what they say.

(30m 46s) **Al:**

> Let's let's let's do this.

(30m 49s)

> All right. Next, we have.

(30m 50s) **Codey:**

> Do this like you're going to cover that episode, that game.

(30m 52s) **Al:**

> No promises, I don't promise episodes.

(30m 54s) **Codey:**

> But you said, let's do this.

(30m 55s) **Al:**

> Let's do this as in let's consider playing the game next.

(31m) **Codey:**

> OK.

(31m 1s) **Al:**

> We have Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar, that game.

(31m 4s)

> They've released an update.

(31m 5s)

> There's not a lot in it.

(31m 6s)

> It's mostly bug fixes.

(31m 8s)

> But there was one thing that I was very excited about.

(31m 9s)

> And that's that if you fall in the water, you lose less stamina than before the update.

(31m 13s)

> And I am.

(31m 14s) **Codey:**

> - Why did you lose stemma?

(31m 15s) **Al:**

> Well, because you're draining, you drain in the water and you have to get out of the water.

(31m 17s) **Codey:**

> - Oh, oh.

(31m 19s) **Al:**

> So you lose stamina.

(31m 19s)

> But it was like it was like a third of your health you lost.

(31m 24s)

> So much. Whereas now it's it's like, you know, a heavy usage on.

(31m 31s)

> The rocks like it's it's annoying, but it's not like you could die if you were

(31m 35s)

> if you only had a third of your health left is not.

(31m 39s) **Codey:**

> Yep, well, I still haven't played this game so good. I'm happy for you though though. Swimming is tiring. I get it.

(31m 46s) **Al:**

> It is, it is, it is.

(31m 49s)

> Next we have Traveller's Rest.

(31m 51s)

> They have released their 0.7.3.0 update, The Pledge Banquet, and continuing the fun with

(31m 59s)

> Traveller's Rest where every time they have an update they go, "Oh, right, OK, they didn't

(32m 2s)

> have that."

(32m 3s)

> They've added the first chapter of the storyline.

(32m 6s) **Codey:**

> Now, well it's free, I get it.

(32m 7s) **Al:**

> So this game had no story before, and now it has some story.

(32m 13s)

> I would love to go back and play the f-

(32m 16s)

> The first version of this game back in 2020, and be like "What is in this game? This is such a fascinating- like, was it just a proof of concept? Like, what was it back then?"

(32m 20s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(32m 24s)

> I mean lens island lens island was like that as well

(32m 27s)

> I remember when I first played it it was very bare-bones and now it's way more of a thing

(32m 28s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's fair.

(32m 31s)

> That's fair.

(32m 33s)

> Yeah.

(32m 33s) **Codey:**

> So it's showing promise

(32m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah, no, this is not to market in a mean way. This is just like, it's funny because every time they've updated, we're like, "Oh, they didn't have that either."

(32m 46s)

> And it just, it's very funny because I would just love to see what the game actually was back then, five years ago.

(32m 47s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(32m 51s)

> Yeah, well more important than that

(32m 55s)

> No, sorry before that they also changed bug fixes

(32m 58s)

> And I loved that one of the bug fixes says fixed a bug that caused the housekeeper to get stuck while cleaning

(33m 4s) **Al:**

> infinite cleaning. Oh, no, it's it's my way.

(33m 8s)

> I was going to say it's my home and realize, no, it's just life with children.

(33m 12s) **Codey:**

> Um

(33m 14s) **Al:**

> Oh, wait, no, it definitely here.

(33m 16s)

> No, here's a funny joke, right?

(33m 17s) **Codey:**

> Okay, okay

(33m 18s) **Al:**

> That's just they just described ADHD.

(33m 21s)

> Right, where you end up in like your

(33m 23s)

> infinite recursion of tidying different things and never finishing anything

(33m 27s)

> because you go down in a little loop, you know, like, oh, no, what about this thing?

(33m 30s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah, rip. But in their, like, post, did you see that they mention a new game called Cozy

(33m 38s) **Al:**

> I did not notice this, and I only just looked at your notes right now, so I'm going to have

(33m 38s) **Codey:**

> Sanctuary? Yeah. Yeah. So, on the pod. So Cozy Sanctuary is a new game, and it is made by,

(33m 45s) **Al:**

> to look at this live on the pod.

(33m 51s) **Codey:**

> I want to say, the same people that make, or, like, their friends of the people. Yeah,

(33m 55s) **Al:**

> Oh, this is never Rusty Lake, it's another Rusty Lake.

(33m 58s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, so it's another rusty, like, so, quote,

(34m)

> it's coming soon, they don't have anything out about it quite yet, but yeah, it's another little rusty-like, so it sits at the bottom of your screen, looks like there's decorations, like a windmill,

(34m 28s)

> You can unlock new.

(34m 30s)

> You can unlock new species.

(34m 32s)

> There's some really cute little things.

(34m 34s)

> I think the icon is a fox.

(34m 36s)

> But I'm not seeing a fox.

(34m 38s)

> I see a peacock.

(34m 40s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(34m 40s) **Codey:**

> I see a duck and a horse that's bouncing really weird.

(34m 46s)

> And a llama.

(34m 48s)

> I guess that's a deer.

(34m 50s)

> There is a demo available now.

(34m 52s)

> So you can go out and play the demo.

(34m 54s)

> Oh, I see the fox.

(34m 56s)

> No, that's a red panda.

(34m 58s)

> and squirrels I'm seeing

(35m)

> more more of the pictures it's dark it's dark they're dark it's like a

(35m 3s) **Al:**

> The koala looks not healthy.

(35m 6s)

> What are those legs?

(35m 9s) **Codey:**

> two-tone Rhea

(35m 12s) **Al:**

> It's more the length of them.

(35m 13s)

> They are very long legs, like.

(35m 14s) **Codey:**

> oh oh let me go back yes

(35m 18s) **Al:**

> Do you know what I mean?

(35m 19s)

> Like, it's legs are the same length as the horse's legs.

(35m 22s)

> A koala should not have legs that long.

(35m 24s) **Codey:**

> I mean what

(35m 25s) **Al:**

> I think it was on, you know, one of those like racks they used in medieval

(35m 28s)

> times to try and make people taller.

(35m 29s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(35m 31s)

> Oh no.

(35m 33s) **Al:**

> The giraffe, I think I see a sloth.

(35m 33s) **Codey:**

> Oh no.

(35m 35s)

> Mm-hmm.

(35m 36s) **Al:**

> So many, oh, a duck-billed platypus.

(35m 38s)

> There are so many animals, sheep, goat, very interesting.

(35m 39s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(35m 42s)

> It looks really cute. There's porcupine.

(35m 45s)

> So just demo out now. Go play it.

(35m 47s)

> It is unfortunately Windows only.

(35m 50s)

> Maybe they'll make it not Windows at some point in the future,

(35m 54s)

> and I can play it along with Cat Cafe, but alas, not yet.

(35m 59s)

> So, that was it.

(36m)

> That was the last thing in the Traveler's Rest post, they just mentioned that.

(36m 4s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, no, no, good. That's all good.

(36m 8s)

> Next we have Tomodachi Life, Living the Dream. This is the new Tomodachi Life game. We got

(36m 13s)

> a new trailer in the Nintendo Direct, including not a release date, but a release season.

(36m 21s)

> So it's coming out. We knew it was coming out in 2026. We now know it's coming out in

(36m 25s)

> spring 2026.

(36m 28s) **Codey:**

> Ooh, so I think I made the comment of will this make it worth it, but I think that what I was thinking was that this was the Plaza game, but it's not the Plaza game.

(36m 37s) **Al:**

> Oh, no, no, this is not Tamagotchi Plaza, this is Tomodachi life.

(36m 43s)

> Yeah, I'm sure I made that joke again at some point.

(36m 45s)

> Yeah, it's funny because they were both announced in the same

(36m 50s)

> in the same Nintendo Direct and whenever it was March or whenever.

(36m 54s)

> And that was very amusing to me,

(36m 57s)

> the fact that they were such similar in titles, Tomogachi and Tomodachi.

(37m 3s) **Codey:**

> Yeah okay well I was very confused so never mind redact my will this make it worth a comment.

(37m 8s) **Al:**

> You've redacted the thing you never needed

(37m 10s)

> to say because it was just written on the document.

(37m 10s) **Codey:**

> Correct it was not.

(37m 13s) **Al:**

> I know that some people absolutely love this game.

(37m 16s)

> I am fascinated by this game.

(37m 18s)

> I obviously have to buy it and play it.

(37m 21s)

> I honestly don't know if it's going to be my kind of thing or not.

(37m 25s)

> It's very weird.

(37m 27s) **Codey:**

> It's giving sims.

(37m 28s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but it's giving Sims if everything was just weird.

(37m 33s)

> You know, it's, it's, it's, it's literally like someone took Sims and went.

(37m 37s)

> What about, what about we do The Sims, but everything's weird.

(37m 41s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(37m 42s) **Al:**

> That is literally what it just like, and it's,

(37m 44s)

> it's hard to even describe how weird everything seems, but it is all weird.

(37m 48s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I think the thing that got me was there's a me character that eats lettuce and the lettuce is photorealistic, but it's like the me.

(37m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah, all the characters are me style, but yeah, it's funny to me that they've not upgraded

(38m 11s)

> the me characters, they're all still the same as they were back in the Wii times, except

(38m 16s)

> they're all seem a bit shinier in this game, but like yeah, the facial expressions and

(38m 22s)

> all these things are all exactly the same as they were, just like higher res, but.

(38m 29s)

> No more detail, just more pixels of the same.

(38m 33s)

> Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I don't know how to feel about this game, but it's interesting.

(38m 34s) **Codey:**

> As is tradition.

(38m 41s)

> That's okay.

(38m 43s)

> Yeah, I mean, I thought it was it looks interesting.

(38m 45s)

> Yeah, I think that's the best way to describe it.

(38m 49s)

> It sure is interesting.

(38m 50s)

> I don't think I'll play it.

(38m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah, fair, but some of that lettuce is terrifying.

(38m 57s) **Codey:**

> That should be the podcast title.

(38m 58s)

> The lettuce is terrible.

(39m) **Al:**

> No, it's rogue life.

(39m 2s)

> All right, Stardew Valley, again,

(39m 5s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

(39m 7s) **Al:**

> they also announced in the Nintendo Direct

(39m 10s)

> that there is a Switch 2 version coming.

(39m 13s)

> It will be a free update to everyone

(39m 15s)

> who owns it on Switch already.

(39m 16s)

> And it includes mouse mode and game share.

(39m 22s)

> You can play multiplayer with game share.

(39m 24s)

> So if one of you owns the game,

(39m 25s)

> up to four of you can play multiplayer together.

(39m 29s) **Codey:**

> which is just awesome. Yeah, um, like

(39m 29s) **Al:**

> So that's cool.

(39m 33s)

> The mouse mode is funny because it's like,

(39m 35s)

> obviously it was a mouse-based game originally,

(39m 38s)

> and then it added controller support to go to consoles,

(39m 40s)

> and now it's mouse is back again.

(39m 41s) **Codey:**

[laughing]

(39m 42s)

> Nature is healing.

(39m 43s) **Al:**

> I really don't understand who's using mouse mode

(39m 47s)

> on the Switch too, except for gimmicks and stuff like that.

(39m 52s)

> Like if you're playing Stardew Valley, are you gonna set up your thing to play it in mouse mode?

(39m 56s)

> I guess maybe if it's like your one game playing thing and you set it up on a desk like a gaming

(40m 4s)

> PC, then I could maybe see doing it that way. But that feels like a very niche mark.

(40m 8s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(40m 12s)

> Yeah, I, I don't know.

(40m 15s)

> I don't when people get like all of these other consoles and like,

(40m 19s)

> or other like ways to do it, like even controller support.

(40m 22s)

> Sometimes I don't understand it because I just my peanut brain

(40m 26s)

> can't handle too much stimulation.

(40m 30s)

> So, but good that they're giving it and they're offering it.

(40m 35s)

> I think it's really cool that he is continuing to...

(40m 38s)

> You know just make it easier for people to play his game

(40m 41s)

> And enjoying it. I feel like I saw maybe you guys mentioned this last episode

(40m 46s)

> I feel like I heard something about like Stardew Valley 2 like he might make a second one

(40m 53s)

> Okay, cool

(40m 53s) **Al:**

> I haven't heard anything about that. He's got a new 1.7 update coming, and obviously there's

(40m 55s) **Codey:**

> It was a fever dream

(41m 2s) **Al:**

> haunted chocolate here, but I've not heard anything about Stardew Valley 2. I don't think

(41m 7s)

> he would, like I feel like if he's going to add more stuff about Stardew Valley 2, he would just

(41m 12s)

> add stuff into the game. Here we go, there is a quote from four months ago where he says,

(41m 23s)

> quote, I hate when they just like take a quote and like split it up over a whole article. It's

(41m 30s)

> like, let me just read the quote.

(41m 31s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(41m 33s)

> No, they want you to do the whole thing.

(41m 36s)

> Like, they want you to read the whole article because it gives more screen time

(41m 40s)

> and they get more ad revenue from that.

(41m 43s)

> The more screen time you are on the...

(41m 45s)

> Capitalism, Elle.

(41m 46s)

> Capitalism.

(41m 48s)

> No, I thought it was something recent and I feel like he was streaming with someone.

(41m 52s)

> It also could have been a dream.

(41m 54s)

> I have literally...

(41m 54s) **Al:**

> OK, here we go. I've got the actual quote finally.

(41m 56s)

> It only took me four different articles to find it.

(42m)

> This was on a podcast

(42m 2s)

> and he said, I might eventually make a Stardew Valley too, to be honest.

(42m 6s)

> It's just so much easier to add more stuff

(42m 8s)

> to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch.

(42m 11s)

> The major systems are already done.

(42m 13s)

> That's the stuff that's not fun to do.

(42m 15s)

> When I make an update, it's like, you know, oh, throw this in, throw in that.

(42m 19s)

> Let's add green rain.

(42m 21s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(42m 22s) **Al:**

> I do love the green rain.

(42m 23s)

> and your name's great.

(42m 25s)

> Yeah, I don't think he will.

(42m 27s)

> I don't think he'll make a Stardew Valley, too.

(42m 29s)

> I think we'll be lucky if Hunter Chocolatier ever comes out.

(42m 32s)

> I don't see why he would, realistically, right,

(42m 36s)

> when he can just keep adding more to Stardew Valley.

(42m 39s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(42m 39s) **Al:**

> I think the only reason you would want to make another version of that

(42m 42s)

> is if you have a whole different cast of characters do you do?

(42m 45s)

> In which case it's not really Stardew Valley, too,

(42m 45s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(42m 47s) **Al:**

> unless it's like, you know, far in the future or far in the past,

(42m 50s)

> where nobody is around anymore.

(42m 50s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(42m 52s)

> It would be cute I think it'd be cute to do like a prequel where you build the valley

(42m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but then you also know that the problem with all prequels is you know that it ends with the farm being run down. Sad.

(43m 5s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah stuff happens

(43m 9s)

> Can't make me sad

(43m 9s) **Al:**

> Well done. Not swearing.

(43m 11s) **Codey:**

> Can't make me see you're welcome. I can't make me sad. I'm an American

(43m 18s)

> Sadness is in my blood

(43m 19s) **Al:**

> So Bruce Banner in "The Avengers" when he goes, that's my secret. I'm always angry.

(43m 24s) **Codey:**

> I'm always angry. Yeah

(43m 26s) **Al:**

> That's my secret. I'm always sad.

(43m 28s)

> All right, we have one more piece of news before we get on to our main topic of farmland.

## Pokopia

(43m 37s) **Al:**

> Sorry, it's the fact that I got like the main topic.

(43m 41s)

> And that is the new Pokémon game has just been announced. This is for After Legends ZA.

(43m 46s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

(43m 50s) **Al:**

> This is coming out in 2026, and this is Pokopia, which if you don't immediately catch it,

(43m 58s)

> Pokémon Utopia. And this is a Pokémon farming game. And let me tell you, Cody,

(44m) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(44m 6s) **Al:**

> did you watch the director? Did you just like what?

(44m 9s) **Codey:**

> I didn't watch the direct, but you put a video in.

(44m 12s)

> I mean, I skipped through the direct,

(44m 14s)

> but you put a video in.

(44m 16s) **Al:**

> Let me run you through how my brain goes when we do this, right?

(44m 17s) **Codey:**

> And so I just watched the video on two times speed.

(44m 25s) **Al:**

> So it pops up, you get the Switch 2 logo, fantastic.

(44m 28s)

> And then it goes, it's black, and it opens up with this like, little kind of snowy scene,

(44m 33s)

> and then a Pokeball drops in, and you're like, "Oh, Pokemon, that's interesting.

(44m 36s)

> I wasn't expecting Pokemon in this, okay."

(44m 38s) **Codey:**

> in the Nintendo Direct.

(44m 39s) **Al:**

> And then it hatches, and there's a ditto, and you're like, "Oh, interesting, ditto."

(44m 42s)

> And then you're like, "Oh, but wait a minute.

(44m 44s)

> That doesn't look like our model.

(44m 46s)

> I literally said this in the Discord, I'm like, "That does not look like it's a Legend ZA thing.

(44m 50s)

> What is this? Is this a different game?" And then Ditto looks at this...

(44m 57s) **Codey:**

> >> Okay.

(44m 59s) **Al:**

> Pokedex, that's it. I was like, "Poked-cyclopedia? I can't remember what the word is, yeah, Pokedex."

(45m 5s)

> And you're like, "Okay, interesting." And then Ditto transforms into a human, and you're like,

(45m 9s)

> "Oh my word! This is horrifying! I love it!" And then you see the blocks of the world,

(45m 14s)

> and then it zooms out and you just.

(45m 16s)

> Like, oh my word, this is, this is, this is, I'm just swear Cody.

(45m 18s) **Codey:**

> Minecraft.

(45m 22s) **Al:**

> And I'm like, oh my word, is this what I think it is?

(45m 25s)

> Is this a Pokemon farming game?

(45m 26s)

> And you're like, I don't know, I don't want to get too excited yet

(45m 29s)

> because it could be anything.

(45m 30s)

> It could be an RPG or something like that, maybe.

(45m 31s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, because you're a Pokemon.

(45m 33s) **Al:**

> And then Bulbasaur is talking to you and you're like, oh, interesting.

(45m 36s)

> OK.

(45m 36s)

> And Ditto's thinking, Ditto's thinking and going, oh, I've learned vine whip

(45m 42s)

> and I can now make grass.

(45m 44s)

> Okay.

(45m 46s)

> I'm now thinking maybe this is a Pokemon farming game, because that's not a thing you

(45m 49s)

> just normally do in a Pokemon game. And then you learn Squirtle's Water Gun, and you squirtle

(45m 51s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(45m 56s) **Al:**

> on the grass to make it happy again. And then I'm like, I'm going to fill in something. And then

(46m 2s)

> Charmander pops out, you learn some fiery thing from Charmander, and you can set a fire, and great,

(46m 9s)

> fantastic. And then it very much is very clear that this is a Pokemon farming game, because you

(46m 16s)

> and you cut down trees. And not only that, but you then start being Hitmonchan and punching

(46m 22s)

> away the land, you're terraforming, and then you're building tables, and you've got a crafting table,

(46m 28s)

> and you're, you are properly farming at this point. You've got tomatoes, you've got carrots,

(46m 31s)

> you've got potatoes, you've got, you've made fences, you've made a little hut,

(46m 36s)

> you're doing more terraforming, there's water, there's a waterfall. And I'm like,

(46m 40s)

> guys, this is a Pokemon farming game, and all my dreams are coming true, and I can't believe.

(46m 42s) **Codey:**

> Pokemon farming. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

(46m 46s) **Al:**

> We finally, nearly seven years after starting this podcast, finally got a Pokemon farming game,

(46m 54s)

> Pokeopia. I'm so, so excited about this. It's also funny because it's actually Game Freak that's

(47m 3s)

> making this, which is interesting, because obviously they did, what was the other block-based

(47m 4s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(47m 9s) **Al:**

> Pokemon game? Can you remember the one? Quest, yeah, yeah, so they did Quest. It looks very much

(47m 13s)

> kind of similar sort of art stage.

(47m 16s)

> The blocks and stuff, obviously the Pokemon are like normal Pokemon, they're not horrifying abominations of nature, except obviously the digital human.

(47m 22s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(47m 26s) **Al:**

> I don't know what to say, except that I'm super excited and I can't believe I have to wait till next year for this.

(47m 33s)

> Oh yes, let me look at my bullet points then, if I don't know what to say. It looks like Dragon Quest Builders.

(47m 39s)

> It looked basically like Pokemon version of Dragon Quest Builders, which we do have an episode on Dragon Quest Builders too.

(47m 46s)

> I enjoyed that, but I would enjoy it a lot more if I have Pokemon.

(47m 52s)

> It's like a Pokemon game with no humans, you just have Pokemon, which is excellent. I enjoy that.

(47m 57s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm though you I think you can do multiplayer because there was a second person running around. Yeah, okay

(48m 1s) **Al:**

> Yes, but it's just another ditto.

(48m 5s)

> I love that Pokemon have said that our version of a Utopia has no people. I mean, same, right?

(48m 9s) **Codey:**

> Same

(48m 13s) **Al:**

> It's a Pokemon farming game.

(48m 14s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, well I they were gonna have to do it eventually I mean farming games have just exploded

(48m 21s)

> And it's clearly a moneymaker, which is why I think game freak would would get on it

(48m 27s)

> Because why would they let all of that sweet sweet cash cow go to someone else?

(48m 32s)

> Literally cow look we're probably gonna milk milk tanks. Are we gonna get milk from milk tanks and sell it?

(48m 37s) **Al:**

> This is interesting, they didn't show any of that, they just showed like crops, they didn't show.

(48m 43s)

> I think it would both be weird and also make a lot of sense, so I don't know which way.

(48m 49s)

> I think you could make an argument either way as to why.

(48m 56s) **Codey:**

> It makes I mean there's it's it's clearly like I think you can buy that in a lot of games of the game, so it's

(49m 2s) **Al:**

> Yes, but we are also a Pokemon, so we're not a human, we're a Pokemon talking to Pokemon,

(49m 3s) **Codey:**

> Well known that it's a thing

(49m 10s) **Al:**

> and I think it would be a little bit weird if we were milking a Miltank as a human.

(49m 15s) **Codey:**

> they're allowed to use Pokemon as Pokemon too it is weird you're right yeah

(49m 24s)

> I I really like it I think it's one of those things that as I get older I

(49m 31s)

> suspend my excitement for the later times because I just have so much going

(49m 38s)

> on in the present but like when it comes out I'm 100% playing it does it was it

(49m 45s)

> for the switch - did they say that Jeff just yeah Jeff just asked he was like

(49m 46s) **Al:**

> I believe it is switched to, yeah, not switch.

(49m 52s)

> Look, it was gonna, it was gonna happen at some point, right?

(49m 58s) **Codey:**

> do you would you rather have a switch to her a steam deck I was like a steam

(50m 1s) **Al:**

> Oh no.

(50m 2s) **Codey:**

> deck so but I have time I have time to get this game I mean I didn't get the

(50m 3s) **Al:**

> Oh no, Cody.

(50m 9s) **Codey:**

> switch for for like the first year or two that it was out either I didn't I

(50m 13s)

> waited until Animal Crossing was coming out.

(50m 15s)

> so yeah I think yeah go for it okay uh well they also have the thing I was

(50m 18s) **Al:**

> You know what interesting, so see the last, sorry, nope.

(50m 27s) **Codey:**

> gonna say is that they also have combi in it and so they might have like honey

(50m 34s) **Al:**

> Honey, honey I could definitely see that makes a lot that's a lot less weird right because it's

(50m 38s)

> just like Combee is making the honey and saying like "hey here's some honey" right whereas like

(50m 44s)

> I guess could miltank milk itself? Would that make it less weird?

(50m 51s)

> You don't think it's weird a ditto be pretending to be a human milking a miltank?

(50m 57s) **Codey:**

> I don't think you know what happens in, in the world.

(51m 1s) **Al:**

> I mean, ditto aren't milking cows.

(51m 4s) **Codey:**

> I mean, puppy, like a dog will raise kittens a lot of the time.

(51m 9s)

> Like if she has extra milk.

(51m 10s) **Al:**

> Okay, sure, but it's the digital going up and actually doing the milking that is the

(51m 12s) **Codey:**

> So other animals benefit from the milk provided by other animals all the time.

(51m 21s) **Al:**

> weird thing to me.

(51m 23s) **Codey:**

> Oh, so, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna suck.

(51m 24s) **Al:**

> I think if the milk tank provides the milk and just goes here's milk, that I think solves

(51m 28s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, milks, milks itself.

(51m 30s) **Al:**

> the problem.

(51m 31s)

> That's not weird.

(51m 32s)

> Yes, I think that's not weird.

(51m 37s)

> I don't know.

(51m 40s)

> And see the end of the trailer, right, it zooms out onto this clearly like mid-game

(51m 45s)

> area or like version of the game where you've got a bunch of crops.

(51m 50s)

> I think the crop management is really bad.

(51m 52s)

> Why have you got those massive empty spaces?

(51m 53s) **Codey:**

[laughter]

(51m 55s) **Al:**

> Go deal with that.

(51m 56s) **Codey:**

> Yeah.

(51m 57s) **Al:**

> But that aside, a couple of interesting things I'd like to hyper focus on here.

(52m 2s) **Codey:**

> OK.

(52m 2s) **Al:**

> One, they have a Pokemon center at the top of the center.

(52m 8s)

> Is that actually a focus center or is it

(52m 10s)

> a building in the shape of a focus center?

(52m 11s)

> Like what is it there for?

(52m 14s)

> That leads me to believe that there are lots of other buildings that we're going

(52m 22s)

> to be building, right, because obviously at the beginning you just see like this

(52m 23s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(52m 25s) **Al:**

> little shack, essentially, right?

(52m 28s)

> And then we're now at this point, we've got our Pokemon Center.

(52m 28s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(52m 32s) **Al:**

> Interesting.

(52m 33s) **Codey:**

> There's also a Snorlax that's blocking the way.

(52m 36s) **Al:**

> That was another thing that I thought was interesting.

(52m 38s)

> Uh, it's.

(52m 40s)

> Is that just as Norlax has decided to fall asleep or is that a story based thing or is that just for the trailer?

(52m 45s)

> This whole thing makes makes me feel like this specific bit, you know, this specific scene looks like something out of Pokemon Let's Go.

(52m 57s)

> And I wonder if they're trying to make that connection, the Kanto connection.

(53m 3s)

> There are non Kanto Pokemon in this scene, but not many.

(53m 7s)

> Most of them are Kanto Pokemon in this scene.

(53m 10s)

> Lots of non Kanto Pokemon throughout the whole thing, but I'm only seeing three in this that aren't Kanto, whereas all the rest are Kanto here, I think.

(53m 19s) **Codey:**

> - Mm-hmm, well, that's something that can be added in DLCs, so.

(53m 23s) **Al:**

> Yes. Yeah, no, I'm not saying that I'm worried that there aren't going to be lots of non Kanto Pokemon.

(53m 27s)

> I just think, are they trying to make us think about Let's Go in this scene and is that leading to some hints of what could be to come?

(53m 40s)

> I'm just spitballing ideas is what I'm thinking.

(53m 43s)

> There's a bike.

(53m 43s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm I mean it this straight up by the end this just looks like a root

(53m 45s) **Al:**

> Are we going to ride the bike?

(53m 49s)

> Well, that's the thing.

(53m 50s)

> They also have the root sign at the beginning as well.

(53m 53s) **Codey:**

> Yeah

(53m 54s) **Al:**

> Like, are we going to be able to believe, is this a Pokemon maker, right?

(54m) **Codey:**

> a Pokemon game maker.

(54m) **Al:**

> Like, are we going to make our own Pokemon region?

(54m 3s)

> Like, that's essentially what we're building here, right?

(54m 5s) **Codey:**

> That's what it looks like you're building.

(54m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it really does.

(54m 9s) **Codey:**

> I like the idea of that.

(54m 10s) **Al:**

> I'm absolutely fascinated as to what this is going to be like to play.

(54m 12s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I don't know.

(54m 17s)

> I would like the idea of you making your own little route

(54m 21s)

> and then being a gatekeeper about your route.

(54m 25s) **Al:**

> I mean, the top comment on this YouTube is, how long after launch will we see a recreation

(54m 34s)

> of the whole Kanto region in this game? Yeah, I mean, it's not going to take long.

(54m 35s) **Codey:**

[laughs]

(54m 36s)

> Yeah.

(54m 39s)

> Yeah, it just depends on how much space they give us.

(54m 42s)

> If they give us other areas other than just this basic route

(54m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(54m 49s) **Codey:**

> style, or is there a forest?

(54m 52s)

> Is there water other than the little stream?

(54m 55s) **Al:**

> Is there going to be a story or is it completely sandboxy?

(54m 57s) **Codey:**

> I don't know.

(55m)

> It's-- uh-huh.

(55m) **Al:**

> So this is OK, let's go back to the Minecraft thing, right?

(55m 3s)

> Because the thing that all the big games websites are doing is,

(55m 9s)

> "Oh, they've made Minecraft Pokémon!"

(55m 12s)

> And you're like, I get annoyed by that, because again, like with Dinkum,

(55m 16s)

> But even more so on this.

(55m 18s)

> This is clearly not like a survival game, right?

(55m 26s)

> It's town building, it's you know, but it's not survival.

(55m 30s) **Codey:**

> The existence of a POKI Center

(55m 34s)

> Infers to me that are not infers but like suggests

(55m 37s) **Al:**

> Our main Pokémon games, are they survival games?

(55m 40s)

> No, exactly.

(55m 41s) **Codey:**

> No, they're adventure

(55m 44s) **Al:**

> It's a base building game, clearly, but it's not.

(55m 48s)

> Like, I don't think it's going to be like a survival like Dinkum and Minecraft are,

(55m 52s)

> but my point is just like, again, people just jump to "there are blocks, therefore Minecraft",

(55m 57s)

> and it gets me so annoyed because no, I know exactly what you were doing, but I'm annoyed

(55m 58s) **Codey:**

> - Yeah, that's why I made the comment.

(56m 4s) **Al:**

> because it's like big games news publications are doing this, and I just like "you should know better,

(56m 11s)

> no more games". There are other games that have blocks, and there are other games you can compare

(56m 16s)

> compare this to.

(56m 18s)

> I understand why people are comparing this to Animal Crossing, but it's also not, right?

(56m 23s)

> Because it's a huge part of Animal Crossing is the villagers.

(56m 27s)

> And yes, there are Pokemon here, but I don't think that are.

(56m 30s)

> I don't think this is going to be like building relationships with the Pokemon.

(56m 34s)

> I think the Pokemon are really just there as one, obviously, to learn their skills and use them.

(56m 40s)

> Right. Because you have to meet a Bulbasaur to be able to grow the grass.

(56m 43s)

> You have to meet a Squirtle to water the plants, which I really like.

(56m 45s)

> It's a fun way of doing farming.

(56m 48s)

> I'm excited to try that out, but I don't think we're going to be learning about Charmander's

(56m 53s)

> story, right? They're going to have things to say, but they're not going to have huge backstories,

(56m 59s)

> I don't think. And I just feel like people, they jump to these three things, right? "Oh,

(57m 7s)

> it's like Minecraft because block, it's like Animal Crossing because you're making a town,

(57m 12s)

> or it's like Stardew because farming." And you're like, "No, there are other games,

(57m 15s)

> And if you're going to compare it to something.

(57m 18s)

> Which you don't need to, but if you're going to compare it to something.

(57m 20s)

> It is Dragon Quest Builders 2, right?

(57m 22s)

> That is what it is.

(57m 25s)

> And it's unknown exactly whether there will be story elements.

(57m 29s)

> And that was the case with Dragon Quest Builders 2.

(57m 32s)

> It had a story.

(57m 34s)

> Is this just going to be sandbox-y?

(57m 35s)

> Or is there going to be a progression through that story?

(57m 39s)

> I don't know.

(57m 40s)

> Is there just one island?

(57m 42s)

> Are there multiple islands?

(57m 43s)

> Because another thing with Dragon Quest Builders

(57m 45s)

> is you have different islands that you travel to throughout the story.

(57m 48s)

> Build up bases there on different islands.

(57m 50s)

> That's an interesting question to me.

(57m 52s)

> Is this just going to be one island or multiple?

(57m 54s)

> How big is it?

(57m 55s)

> What exactly will the terraforming be?

(58m 1s)

> Are you just able to do it to a certain point like with Animal Crossing.

(58m 4s)

> Where you can't expand the island.

(58m 6s)

> You can only go up or down.

(58m 8s)

> And only like up three levels or whatever.

(58m 10s)

> Is it going to be that restrictive?

(58m 11s)

> Or is it going to be less restrictive like Dragon Quest Builders 2.

(58m 14s)

> Where you can go up really high.

(58m 16s)

> I still don't think you can expand the a--

(58m 18s)

> or is it going to be Minecrafty where it's like, you can do whatever you want, you can get rid of any block, you can add any block.

(58m 26s)

> Are you going to have to get resources to build blocks or are you going to be able to just make them out of nowhere?

(58m 35s)

> So many questions. I'm really fascinated. But yeah, get better games to compare this to, right?

(58m 42s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I agree.

(58m 43s)

> I think that also there's just like, there's a lot of possibilities, like a

(58m 48s)

> lot of different directions this could go in.

(58m 51s)

> Um, so like saying, Oh, it's a Minecraft.

(58m 55s)

> Oh, it's a whatever.

(58m 55s)

> Like we don't know yet.

(58m 58s)

> We know very little right now.

(59m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, agreed, agreed, I saw Vulpix at one point, where was I saw Vulpix?

(59m 1s) **Codey:**

> So, but I am excited.

(59m 4s)

> I was mostly looking for Vulpix and I did not see it.

(59m 9s)

> Oh, okay.

(59m 12s)

> That was the most important thing to me.

(59m 14s) **Al:**

> So the section after, so two, two minutes 18 sleeping on a bench.

(59m 15s) **Codey:**

> What's the timestamp timestamp timestamp?

(59m 21s)

> Oh, look at him seeping.

(59m 26s)

> It was barely there.

(59m 27s)

> I think I was distracted by the Ludicolo in the next one.

(59m 30s)

> Look at him.

(59m 30s)

> He's so, oh, you could see his.

(59m 33s)

> Bings screenshot.

(59m 39s) **Al:**

> there's a water wheel, there's definitely more like you're building beds inside a building.

(59m 45s)

> So it's definitely some decoration aspects to it inside. I need I have a feeling that

(59m 51s)

> the POCA Center is just a building with that design. That is my theory because it is smaller

(59m 57s)

> than normal and it just looks like it's the same sort of physical size as the original hut. It's

(1h 4s)

> just it's you know the outside looks fancier and I think it's

(1h 10s) **Codey:**

> how do I edit this? I don't think I can. We're good.

(1h 15s) **Al:**

> Okay, look, we're going to have a lot more to talk about this in the future, but that's

(1h 21s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

(1h 21s) **Al:**

> probably enough for just now. So that is the news.

(1h 26s)

> POCOPIA.

## Farm Land

(1h 27s) **Al:**

> All right, on to our main topic. Let's see how long we get out of this. This is farmland,

(1h 33s)

> a YouTube playable, as I mentioned earlier in the episode. It is a thing that YouTube

(1h 39s)

> does now where you can get games and, oh boy, are they things that exist.

(1h 44s) **Codey:**

> Yes.

(1h 46s) **Al:**

> Okay, so a quick explanation of this game. You start out on this teeny tiny little piece

(1h 51s)

> of land you are farming. You click a button to start sowing seeds. I think you start with

(1h 59s)

> corn. You walk around the place of land, automatically sowing seeds after you press the button. And

(1h 1m 5s)

> then once you finish sowing, it then shows another button to water. You see water everything

(1h 1m 11s)

> and they grow almost immediately and then once you've grown them all you then get a

(1h 1m 15s)

> little button to harvest them, you harvest them all, and then you go and sell them,

(1h 1m 22s)

> and then that's pretty much it. With the money you can do a few things but it's all basically

(1h 1m 29s)

> just to do more of the same. There's different crops, so they start off with one tiny little

(1h 1m 36s)

> island and with the money you can buy other bits of land and you can also buy workers who do things

(1h 1m 42s)

> automatically and the different pieces of

(1h 1m 45s)

> land give you like different, different crops to grow. So there's three on the first section

(1h 1m 50s) **Codey:**

> um and plus animal they have there's animals um and you don't know what's going to be on the next

(1h 1m 52s) **Al:**

> and then there's three others on the next section.

(1h 2m 3s) **Codey:**

> area so it just shows like later on it just shows how much it costs to get to the next section

(1h 2m 11s) **Al:**

> And sometimes it's literally just like half a bridge or it is a corner to get to another

(1h 2m 13s) **Codey:**

> but it doesn't tell you what's on that section so you just kind of like are randomly dispensing

(1h 2m 18s)

> money.

(1h 2m 20s)

> Yep.

(1h 2m 27s) **Al:**

> piece of land. There are multiple where I've gone and it's literally just been a piece

(1h 2m 27s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(1h 2m 30s) **Al:**

> of land. There's nothing on it at all. You don't get to. You don't get. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

(1h 2m 32s) **Codey:**

> I do really like there's a cat and a dog.

(1h 2m 35s)

> We got into them yet.

(1h 2m 38s) **Al:**

> Um, you don't-

(1h 2m 41s)

> you don't choose what is where, uh, you- you go and there is what is on the land, so like,

(1h 2m 47s)

> you might find a single chicken on the piece of land, um, or you might find a farm, or you

(1h 2m 53s)

> might find a tree with apples, um, or as you say you might find a cat or a dog or nothing,

(1h 2m 58s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(1h 3m) **Al:**

> just some- just the path. Um, it's very much like, I think the idea behind it is

(1h 3m 8s)

> automating things quickly and then just

(1h 3m 11s)

> like building that up with the money that you have because like you can you can unlock workers

(1h 3m 15s)

> and then like upgrade them with more money.

(1h 3m 17s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 3m 20s)

> Yep, they get faster.

(1h 3m 23s) **Al:**

> Trying to think if there's anything else to say.

(1h 3m 27s) **Codey:**

> There's also-- you can upgrade your barn capacity.

(1h 3m 31s)

> I think-- yep, I've got fishing.

(1h 3m 34s)

> I got some boats.

(1h 3m 35s)

> So I'm assuming as the game gets more and more ridiculously

(1h 3m 39s)

> huge, you can--

(1h 3m 42s) **Al:**

> I can't figure out how to do the fishing.

(1h 3m 43s) **Codey:**

> you have to just find, you find fish that spawn around your

(1h 3m 47s)

> islands. He's just buying the fish and he has lines, but yeah.

(1h 3m 48s) **Al:**

> Oh right, okay, so I thought that he's just buying the fish, right, okay.

(1h 3m 53s)

> Of course.

(1h 3m 56s)

> Oh, I found the fish, there we go, I see.

(1h 4m) **Codey:**

> But yeah, so it's, it's very, very simple. It's like those

(1h 4m 2s)

> games that are like additive where, you know, you, you have

(1h 4m 8s)

> a small amount of something in the beginning and you get like,

(1h 4m 12s)

> they have them in like zombie survival games where in order to

(1h 4m 17s)

> area to escape zombies, you have to have like a certain amount

(1h 4m 21s)

> of energy or something. And then as you just gets bigger and

(1h 4m 25s)

> bigger number go big is what this this game is. I do like

(1h 4m 31s)

> the every so often, I want to say like every four minutes or

(1h 4m 36s)

> something. It just randomly rains.

(1h 4m 39s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so that's an interesting mechanic. It seems to be whatever island you're on at that

(1h 4m 45s)

> time, whatever section of the map you're on, it will rain on. And so if you're on the first

(1h 4m 51s)

> section, then you have like four fields that it uses up. But if I'm on, because it just

(1h 4m 57s)

> literally just rained for me there, but I was on the second island where I only have

(1h 4m 59s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm, mhmm, womp womp.

(1h 5m 1s) **Al:**

> one plot of stuff. The interesting thing about the rain is it makes things grow even if you

(1h 5m 5s)

> haven't sewn any seeds, which I'm not sure.

(1h 5m 7s) **Codey:**

> Yep.

(1h 5m 10s)

> Uh, pharmacy legacy crops, they're seeds.

(1h 5m 14s)

> You've, you spilled some seeds and they go up.

(1h 5m 17s)

> I don't know.

(1h 5m 18s)

> I'm not going to complain.

(1h 5m 19s) **Al:**

> It's a thing.

(1h 5m 19s) **Codey:**

> Um, it's a thing, but yeah, just number go big, um, and try and

(1h 5m 29s)

> like upgrade your people and they automate and get crops for you.

(1h 5m 32s)

> And then the one thing I don't have, I don't see automation for

(1h 5m 35s)

> you is taking stuff from your barn to the celly guy.

(1h 5m 40s) **Al:**

> Yes, I've not encountered that either. I suspect there won't be one for that, because they still

(1h 5m 46s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 5m 49s) **Al:**

> want you to actually do something in the game, right? Because otherwise you would just sit with

(1h 5m 54s)

> it doing nothing and it would literally be like cookie clicker or, you know, paperclip maker,

(1h 5m 59s)

> where at some point you just stop playing the game. Which is a thing you can do,

(1h 6m 6s)

> but the question is, do you want to encourage people to stop playing your game eventually?

(1h 6m 10s) **Codey:**

> I don't know. This is mind-numbing. I kind of like it. I don't I don't there's not there's no incentive to

(1h 6m 17s)

> keep going other than

(1h 6m 20s)

> unlock all

(1h 6m 22s)

> locked areas

(1h 6m 24s)

> I

(1h 6m 25s)

> Also love so it says rain will grow your fields while you watch this video, but you can X out of that

(1h 6m 31s) **Al:**

> I haven't experienced that, and I presume you're not YouTube Premium. I am YouTube Premium,

(1h 6m 31s) **Codey:**

> So it's like please watch this video, which I'm sure they would get content from

(1h 6m 40s)

> You

(1h 6m 42s) **Al:**

> so I wonder if I don't get that because I'm YouTube Premium, which is interesting. Look,

(1h 6m 46s) **Codey:**

> That would make sense

(1h 6m 50s)

> Yeah, I'm not

(1h 6m 51s) **Al:**

> I'm not going to pretend this is a good game. This is not a good game. You know what this

(1h 6m 53s) **Codey:**

> It's it's just a very basic

(1h 6m 58s) **Al:**

> feels like so you know how you get the

(1h 7m 1s)

> phone game ads which is like "oh here's an exciting like zombie game" or whatever

(1h 7m 2s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 7m 5s)

> Mm-hmm

(1h 7m 6s) **Al:**

> and then you actually play it and it's something completely different.

(1h 7m 9s) **Codey:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 7m 9s) **Al:**

> This is the something completely different that you would get. This is not the one that they would

(1h 7m 14s)

> make an advert for because nobody would look at an advert for this and go "oh yeah that looks

(1h 7m 18s)

> like a good game" but it is definitely a game that exists that you could put in as that game.

(1h 7m 25s)

> Well, we have to have our game, so this is the game.

(1h 7m 26s) **Codey:**

> Yeah, I think that this is a very simple game.

(1h 7m 31s)

> I think that people will play it and they'll get ad revenue for it.

(1h 7m 36s)

> Um, for sure.

(1h 7m 38s)

> For the videos, if you can't, for people who might not be able

(1h 7m 40s)

> to X out of them, I don't know when it rains.

(1h 7m 44s)

> Um, but yeah, I mean, it's very, very simple and I am able to play on my phone.

(1h 7m 52s)

> Like I'm playing on my phone right now.

(1h 7m 54s) **Al:**

> Oh, cool. I yeah, I was playing on my on my computer with the mason keyboard. So interesting.

(1h 7m 54s) **Codey:**

> Um.

(1h 7m 57s)
