<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Now, our actual main topic, for some reason, is a YouTube playable called Farmland. Now,

7
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>if you're thinking what is a youtube player

8
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>that is a great question. YouTube apparently have games now and they're called youtube

9
00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:14.159
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>playables and I found out about that like last week and there I had a look through and I was

10
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.879
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

11
00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:11.439
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.120
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>like are any of these farming games and one of them was a farming game so I went let's talk about

13
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>that then and we'll maybe get 10 minutes discussion out of it I don't know we'll see I suspect the main

14
00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>topic will not actually be that, but that's what we're listing.

15
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Wow

16
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>As the main topic, I said, I said maybe, maybe.

17
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You think we're gonna get

18
00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:43.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, well I am playing it right now, so I'm gonna see how far I can get that's true I

19
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I have played it for at least 10 minutes, so surely I can talk about it for at least 10 minutes.

20
00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.680
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Also have played it for at least 10 minutes. I'm currently

21
00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Doing stuff so yeah very cool

22
00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:59.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's going to be quite the jump from two hours talking about Grand Bazaar last week too.

23
00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:10.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We're going to talk about that. We have a bunch of news because the Nintendo Direct was yesterday,

24
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm sure we can find a way to talk about it for...

25
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.560
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and all I want to do is talk about Paul Coppier, so we will talk about that.

26
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

27
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.379
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But first Al what have you been up to uh-huh, uh-huh

28
00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:23.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, Cody, thank you for asking, so kind of you. This week I've basically just been continuing

29
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>playing Grand Bazaar, which is unusual. I'm continuing to play a game after I covered it

30
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>it on the podcast. And I think

31
00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:37.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think I've doubled my playtime on it now. So, yeah, that's something. I'm very much enjoying

32
00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:42.319
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>it. I've unlocked a bunch of stuff that I knew about in theory, and a bunch of stuff that I

33
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:50.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>didn't know about. So it's, yeah, continuing to be good, continuing to be fun. I am half a million

34
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:59.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and one stall away from finishing to become the... Interestingly, not. So, you haven't listened.

35
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>the last podcast, Cody. So you won't know about this, but your bazaar ranks up. So you start off

36
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Nope, yep.

37
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>as a local bazaar, and then you become a regional bazaar, and then a national bazaar, and it gets

38
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.560
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>bigger, bigger, bigger. And I was like, "Oh, OK, cool. So the last rank is going to be grand bazaar,

39
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>right? Because it's grand bazaar." No, it's not. It's called a world bazaar.

40
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.620
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, but that, but it's supposed to be grand.

41
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, I don't know why they're calling it...

42
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.580
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So that means there's not, you're not at the, it hasn't achieved its final form yet.

43
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There's going to be more.

44
00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:40.319
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Maybe. I doubt it. But yeah, so I've got half a million of sales to make and one more stall to

45
00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>put up, which this stall is taking a while because I need to have three-star honey, three-star

46
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>mushrooms, and three-star fish. And I haven't been doing the honey and the mushrooms, and I've not

47
00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>really been doing the fish. I've been doing a bit of the fish, but not really. So I've been kind of

48
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>of just grinding away at those three to try and level them up while doing other

49
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>things. And I think I'm pretty close to getting married. I've got like, is it 8 out of 10 hearts with

50
00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:16.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Kagetsu? I think that's her name. So yeah, that's probably about it.

51
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm. I'm gonna nod like I know

52
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I also found, oh no, one last thing. I found out there is a teleporter in the game. You can get,

53
00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>once you get three stones, there's like a wind stone, a something else stone,

54
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and something else. It might be water and fire. I don't know.

55
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.319
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Am I playing Avatar? No Earth, though. Or maybe there was an Earth one. There are three,

56
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That would make sense.

57
00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>not four, so there's three of them. And once you combine them, you can then warp to anywhere

58
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:50.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>on the map. So I want to do that. So I guess we'll see how long it takes to get to that as well.

59
00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>If I finish everything else I want to do before that, then I'm probably not going to continue

60
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.839
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>playing the game just to do that. But anyway. Yeah, that's...

61
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's me, Cody. What have you been up to?

62
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.899
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh, well right now I'm playing farmland and I need to set it down, um, to see what I'm

63
00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:09.899
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>talking about.

64
00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:19.540
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh, what I have been up to is, uh, y'all won't believe it still my PhD though I, we have

65
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.459
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>started trying to set a date.

66
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:25.399
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I was going to try and defend in December, but then we were like, there's a lot of holidays

67
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.399
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>around there.

68
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:30.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's also kind of hit or miss some of the people on my committee, um, are from other

69
00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.540
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>countries and usually travel back to the U.S.

70
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>internationally during that time.

71
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.439
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, and so we were like, let's just do January after the holidays and everything.

72
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.519
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So it'll be the last two weeks of January.

73
00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:43.120
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We are narrowing it down.

74
00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So I have a lot to do until then.

75
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, I have a lot of writing and I really hate writing.

76
00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like, I mean, I, so I enjoy writing.

77
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I enjoy reading the things that people do, but because of my ADHD, I have really

78
00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:04.480
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>ridiculous executive dysfunction when it comes to writing.

79
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And because I'm like, Oh, what do I start with? Like, where do

80
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>what do I do? Where do I whatever? And so luckily, right

81
00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.100
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>now for one of my chapters, I'm in the massaging stage of it.

82
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.699
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So like, it's there, I just need to like, add some more stuff

83
00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>and read some more papers. But yep. Also, on top of that, we

84
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:27.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Fair enough.

85
00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>are gonna get a puppy.

86
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:26.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, whoo, literally. Oh, whoo.

87
00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I'm not sure if I've mentioned this on the pod, but

88
00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>but my geriatric.

89
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Beagle is now on the across the Rainbow Bridge.

90
00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.899
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>He was very old, very crotchety, and he went on his own terms.

91
00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But it was his time.

92
00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:44.939
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So I'm like, I'm pretty I'm pretty sure with it.

93
00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:49.579
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But Stella does seem to want another furry creature.

94
00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:53.920
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And we also have been wanting to possibly get another Aussie puppy.

95
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.540
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So we've put them down the deposit.

96
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We have four possible ones.

97
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.459
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'll put these in the spoiler thread.

98
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:23.360
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I got four options. They're all blue murals, and they're voo-ver-cute.

99
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.620
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>people to click into before the podcast is even out as they always do. They're really, really

100
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.759
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There you go. You can look at them now.

101
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.600
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm, I'm looking, no, so fluffy.

102
00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.480
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, so I have this...

103
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:42.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm going to pretend that this is the same moment I'm getting a puppy, I put it in a thread on slack to be looked at after Wednesday the 17th.

104
00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:44.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm getting one of these. I don't know which one.

105
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yo, does one of them have heterochromia?

106
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It might be. They might. The blue murals?

107
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.879
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Heterochromia.

108
00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:51.879
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Looks like one blue in one brain, eh?

109
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So it's possible that their eyes are just still changing colors.

110
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We'll know more when they're older.

111
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But I don't think we have any more updates of them, but it's the same breeder that we got Stella from.

112
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:17.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We love her dogs. She takes really good care of her dogs. She really cares about all of them. There's not updates.

113
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So yeah, we just we're getting another one. That's very exciting.

114
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We're trying to figure out names. So if it's the female, there's one of those that's female.

115
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:31.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And if it's a female, we want to name her Peppercorn. If it's a male, we don't know what to name him.

116
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:42.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We're not soliciting names at this time. So I named Stella after that game that broke my heart, Spiritfarer.

117
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.100
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, yes.

118
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:50.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So I am soliciting game. Peppercorn, it's a lady.

119
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:49.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So, Hornet then, obviously.

120
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:58.139
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So the one from Hollow Knight, he doesn't have a name, does he?

121
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, but also I'm an entomologist.

122
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>The one from Hollow Knight. What one from Hollow Knight?

123
00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:00.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The main character, the playable character.

124
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.200
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>He's just the knight, I think.

125
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah.

126
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So, yeah, that's not a name, that's my point.

127
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But yeah, he doesn't have his own name.

128
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I know.

129
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.799
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So if I'm going to go with Hornet, I would have to go with, like, Dolico.

130
00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.200
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Or Dolico Vespi.

131
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like, I have to go, like, the scientific name.

132
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.100
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And I did start, their names are...

133
00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:22.200
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Their names are, right now, they are the baby sharks.

134
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.600
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And so there's, like, Tiger, and Whale, and Great White, and Mako.

135
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So that's, like, their names right now.

136
00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:32.299
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>the theme of--

137
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>this litter, and so I was looking up shark stuff last night, and I came up

138
00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:44.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>like sharks-- the entire clade of sharks is called like solachia, but I

139
00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:49.340
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>don't want to do that, but it looks like it's slouchy. I don't really love that

140
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.580
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>either, so we're workshopping it. I would love advice, suggestions, give me some

141
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.179
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>suggestions y'all, but most importantly the biggest thing I've been up to--

142
00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:01.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>actually it's not the biggest thing, biggest thing is my PhD, but the thing

143
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:09.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Y'all, no. No, because it's free on Game Pass.

144
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.379
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So song. So did you buy it on releasing?

145
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yes.

146
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.740
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Did you download it on release day?

147
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.259
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Could this be? This is like this is this was like when when

148
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.299
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>my six year old Craig, he's very like single minded on things.

149
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh-huh.

150
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.539
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Right. And I'll go right.

151
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.779
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Can you put your plate in the kitchen, please?

152
00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.700
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And he was like, it's not a plate, it's a bowl.

153
00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:34.100
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm like, OK, can you put your bowl in the kitchen, please?

154
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.419
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And that felt like that interaction there.

155
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.100
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's like, did you buy it on the release day?

156
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.379
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because it's free.

157
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I got it for free.

158
00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:42.860
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And it's like, OK, but did you get it on release day?

159
00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:46.299
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, my word, I'm sorry for choosing the wrong words.

160
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.620
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>What I'm hearing is Craig and I would get along.

161
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.419
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>If you ever have any questions about bugs,

162
00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.440
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I would answer any and all questions.

163
00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:08.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I am going to play it at first, because I thought I was going to get sucked in and not be able to get sucked in and only play and not work.

164
00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:24.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Which has happened for like a day, like one day, but I also needed a day off because right now I'm just not taking days off, I'm just working like a little less on the weekends and quote unquote weekends.

165
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:36.820
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like I don't have certain days that I'm supposed to week, so sorry work, so anyway, slow song, love it, 10 out of 10, I have it.

166
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.399
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, so you got some song you did not purchase it and and yeah, tell me about it cuz I so you played Hollow Knight, right? I

167
00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:45.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Did I played it up to?

168
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:53.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>What was the one there's like one where you've got like like three big rolling bugs and they're like, yeah

169
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.240
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

170
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.600
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I hate those ones

171
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.399
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I couldn't get past them in the time that I had and then I went moved on to a different game

172
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>can't remember what it was and

173
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Every time I went back, I went, "Oh!"

174
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm right at it, like I paused it right at the point where I was having the most difficulty

175
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.399
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and struggling, and it's like, you can't get back into a game at that point, so I never got back into it.

176
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:21.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And yeah, so I love the combat, and I love the exploration, and I hate the backtracking,

177
00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:27.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and Silksong seems bigger and more annoying, and therefore I'm glad that people are enjoying it,

178
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.799
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>but I don't think I'm going to get it. So now tell me how you're enjoying it.

179
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.860
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm enjoying it. I do agree. We think that my husband and I talk about it a lot and we think

180
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.580
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>that like Team Cherry has knocked it out of the park. They basically took Hollow Knight and just

181
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:47.259
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>increased the difficulty level a little bit. Some people might say a lot of it, but I think a lot

182
00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:53.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>of us have like become disillusioned with how difficult Hollow Knight is because people have

183
00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:57.820
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>been playing it for years. And so they're like, oh, this isn't hard. And I'm like, you don't remember

184
00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Mm hmm. Oh, hey, no, it is. Yeah.

185
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.259
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>when you first started playing this game and you

186
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>were dying to like tiny little mobs like they people just like have forgotten that and they're

187
00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:12.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>like this is so hard it's like no you just you just forgot because you've been playing hollow

188
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:19.580
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>night for seven years um but I really like it um I haven't been putting as much time as my husband

189
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:27.580
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>has and uh he says i'm more efficient at bosses so not to brag but um I also like that there are

190
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.340
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>multiple things you can do and multiple ways you can go so it's not just like one

191
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:38.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>path um and I think hall and I did this as well but like it there are things that my husband or

192
00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:44.460
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>one of my friends who's been playing have like found and they're like oh have you gotten to this

193
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.299
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>part yet and i'm like oh I completely when I went through that area that didn't happen

194
00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:56.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>so like there's just completely different storylines based on what you do um and yeah

195
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, they definitely did that in Hollow Knight, where especially at the end there were like

196
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.080
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>a million different endings, depending on exactly what you did during the game.

197
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:00.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

198
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yup, so they have that.

199
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You don't want to play a million times.

200
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:10.080
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Which is murder. Which is murder for me. Like, because you're like,

201
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yup.

202
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:15.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Well, but Al, the current speed run is only an hour.

203
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>"Which ending do I want? How many times do I want to play? How many endings do I want? I don't know."

204
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So you can beat it.

205
00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:23.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>oh for goodness sake that's just

206
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yup.

207
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yup.

208
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:31.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You beat it.

209
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>so stupid how it's been it has been just over a week just over a week and and someone has

210
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yup.

211
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>managed to get to the point where they can complete it in an hour that is madness

212
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

213
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

214
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I don't know how people are doing this.

215
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>People are weird.

216
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>People are wild.

217
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But yeah, so I'm really enjoying it.

218
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think it deserves a lot more time to talk about it

219
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>than just this little what have I been up to.

220
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.379
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So I have prepared some notes about why we should have silks.

221
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:21.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So first of all, we have had other podcast episodes that were about games that were not cottage core, and actually if I remember correctly, we started out as a farming podcast, but then we did Animal Crossing, so then we opened it up to a cottage core.

222
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:30.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Excuse me, Animal Crossing has farming in it, thank you very much.

223
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It didn't at the beginning when we played it.

224
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:31.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But we played it. Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.

225
00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:37.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I said it has, not had, it has farming in it.

226
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:43.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, but when we when it did not at the time, so.

227
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>OK, so you're trying to suggest that instead Silksong is Cottagecore, is that what you're

228
00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:45.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>trying to say?

229
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:59.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>No, no, I would not say this song is cottage core. What I would say is that it is a game that is well loved by people who play this, who are who host sometimes co host this podcast.

230
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Okay.

231
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, and I

232
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:10.620
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I believe that people would enjoy hearing it hearing us talk about it hearing me rant about it for like an hour

233
00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:18.899
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So I'm just saying like if we're sticking with the oh but it's not cottagecore like we played Animal Crossing when we were just farming

234
00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>podcast we also have played Balatro

235
00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:24.100
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>which before Balatro got

236
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.600
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Was that not a greenhouse episode?

237
00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:28.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Nope that was a regular episode

238
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We did a regular episode in Balatro?

239
00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:32.120
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Why on earth did we do that?

240
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:38.379
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's yeah, I don't know. I I was scrolling back through the previous episodes and I found that so

241
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.279
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>What?

242
00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh my word, so it's last November?

243
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>What on earth was that about?

244
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Who did that?

245
00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:43.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Me and Kevin?

246
00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:44.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Why did we do that?

247
00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:48.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, I tell you exactly what it was.

248
00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:52.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It was because that was when they released the "Dave the Diver" crossover.

249
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.100
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Following

250
00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:54.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, but but

251
00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Also, there is farming in Silksong I've been farming to get rosaries

252
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:15.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, OK, so there's two, I'm sorry, you literally grow something at the very start of the first

253
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You just do the same area. Oh also turnip boy

254
00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:11.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>The fact that he is a turnip does not mean that it's a farming game or a cottagecore game. I'm sorry you rob a bank

255
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:21.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Turn and Buy game. Thank you. Yeah, I know, I'm pretty sure you still grow stuff in that

256
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>The first one but the second one you rob a bank

257
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>one as well. Plus, we all know this is not just a Cottagecore podcast, this is a Cottagecore

258
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm pretty sure

259
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.140
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay. Well, so that's the thing is that you, when I suggested it, you said that's not a cottage

260
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:40.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>core game. So I was like, okay, so I came prepared, uh, some other things. Um, it has sold so many,

261
00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.859
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>so many copies. It sold over 50, no, over 5 million. No, sorry. It made over $50 million

262
00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:53.660
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>in the first three days. Um, it has over 5 million players right now. And that's not including people

263
00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.140
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>like my husband who bought it on multiple. So he bought it, he bought it on multiple platforms.

264
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:07.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, uh, team cherry is arguably another concern concerned ape human where this is a very limited

265
00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:14.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>studio. They only have three people and they just develop this behemoth that basically spawns its

266
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:22.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>own little like genre and like love of things and like little creature stuff, like love it. Um,

267
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:29.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>and they sold it. It is only $20. They could have made this game.

268
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like the full 60, $70 and people would have bought it on multiple platforms again,

269
00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:40.140
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>but they didn't. And you know what? That is anti-capitalist and arguably that is cottage core.

270
00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:47.660
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh, and finally they do have cozy vibes. So I don't know if you've seen the videos of Sherma.

271
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:53.579
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>She's this little character that like is playing music. Um, and she's trying to open gates and

272
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:58.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>stuff based on, uh, these music that she plays. And she thinks that her music is getting her through

273
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:07.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>it. Um, but she's so sweet and people have made entire remixes of her song. Um,

274
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>yeah, there's a lot of singing in this. Like you come upon multiple characters that are singing.

275
00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:19.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh, I also really love chakra. So listeners, if you are, uh, if this hasn't been cut out

276
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:29.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>and if you would have liked to see to hear a song song episode.

277
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:29.380
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I like how I'm going to cut stuff out of this short episode, come on.

278
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:36.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh, if you would like to hear a silk song, a silk song episode with me and another human,

279
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:43.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>uh, just say, uh, pachanko in the, in the Slack and tweet it to us, uh, Instagram it at us, whatever.

280
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't have an Instagram, do we?

281
00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:52.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I do. And I usually say, uh, whatever. I don't know. I think it'd be fun.

282
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>OK, so.

283
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Think of all the new listeners we'll get when we have a silk song episode.

284
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are you going to listen to me, Cody?

285
00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:00.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are you going to listen to me?

286
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.619
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm trying to think if I have anything else to say. No.

287
00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:01.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You...

288
00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:02.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, exactly.

289
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.700
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So listen.

290
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You missed out two arguments that you really should make.

291
00:20:09.099 --> 00:20:19.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay. In the game, he's in. Oh, and you don't think the team cherry devs are.

292
00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:12.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>One, concerned ape is in the game.

293
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So, that's the thing.

294
00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:17.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, he's credited as a voice in the game.

295
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Wait, what?

296
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.359
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Concerned Ape is in Silksong.

297
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:29.259
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. Nevermind. Okay. There you go. So you came more prepared than

298
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, they don't know who he is, but he is a voice.

299
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:46.619
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I did. I didn't know that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bugs. Bugs. Okay.

300
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>He is one of the voices in game, in Silksong.

301
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And two, and this is really the biggest argument, right, that you should use.

302
00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:43.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And it's probably the reason that I'm going to say fine, let's do it.

303
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No, no, no, definitely not.

304
00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I hate thinking of episode topics.

305
00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:59.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh my God. You're so right. Well, let's.

306
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You know this, because you see me almost every week going, "Oh, right, what's the next topic?

307
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.319
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We need more topics."

308
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You've really only been doing that like once a month. Now you're like, uh, what are we going

309
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:08.859
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>to do for the next month? And then we just like throw stuff out and you're like, yeah,

310
00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:14.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>cool. Let's run with it. Uh, so you've had to, you've had to do that less and less. I will admit,

311
00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:27.339
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>but yeah, we got you. I did. I already, I already added it y'all.

312
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.640
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, thank you.

313
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's so kind.

314
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.839
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You actually put it in the Notion.

315
00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You put it in as an episode.

316
00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:28.839
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Wow.

317
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So, for the listeners, we use Notion for tracking the episodes.

318
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And like, I have a planning board that I put on episodes, and there's different stages of planning for them.

319
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and Cody has literally put it on the board under the sedan.

320
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I've already made one.

321
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I will I will approve that you didn't put it in suggestion.

322
00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You didn't put it in planned.

323
00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

324
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.599
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I put it in suggestion.

325
00:21:50.759 --> 00:21:53.640
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So I will give you that.

326
00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:56.400
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I added me as one of the hosts.

327
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't know who else, which of the other hosts,

328
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>or if there's someone...

329
00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:02.319
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, I think you do know who it's going to be.

330
00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:05.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm not going to say it on the podcast, but you go.

331
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay.

332
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I've added it into notion.

333
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.799
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay. Who?

334
00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:10.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't know who else is playing it.

335
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are you not looking at the

336
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:12.900
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, no.

337
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:43.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h

338
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>All right. So, look, I'm not promising this will happen, listeners. I never promise episodes.

339
00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:36.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Never promise episodes. But we'll see. We'll see. Is that all you want to talk about with

340
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.200
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Silksong today, then? All right. Is that meant to mean something? Is there something in Silksong?

341
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yes. No. A-woo!

342
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:55.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is it a character in Silksong? Okay. Let's talk about some news. All righty. As I desperately

343
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>find where my news document is, here it is. First up, Dingkum, the Australian cosy survival

344
00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:08.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>sim has a release date for Switch. So I'm pretty sure we knew this was coming. It's

345
00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:12.839
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>out on Steam and they had originally been like, oh yeah, we'll come to Switch as well.

346
00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:16.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>But as with so many games, who knew when it was actually going to happen? And the answer

347
00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:26.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>is we knew. We knew. We now knew. So, it is. Oh, did I say that?

348
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We knew it. We were aware.

349
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Did I say the date? I don't know. 6th of November. That is the day after Craig's birthday.

350
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:36.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep, ooh nice happy birthday to him. Is he gonna play this?

351
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.380
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No, probably not, no. He's still playing Astro Bot because he's obsessed with it.

352
00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, oh

353
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.859
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>He's done everything in the game, but he still continues to play it.

354
00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:43.619
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, fair

355
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.099
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm trying to get him to start playing.

356
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There I

357
00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:52.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Haven't I don't know if I've ever actually looked at this game and

358
00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:57.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I just saw that there are planes and jousting and

359
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm just like, I don't know what this game is.

360
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.259
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This is one of the games, and I'll talk about this later in the podcast as well, that really

361
00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:14.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>tell you when someone doesn't play many games of this art style, because they go, "Oh, it's

362
00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:21.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>a Minecraft rip-off," and you're like, you can't call anything that uses like, you know,

363
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>rip-off.

367

<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>or was it 14 years, 2011, 14 years.

369
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.599
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh my gosh don't say that. Nope. Nope. I'm not that old.

370
00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:37.640
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Minecraft is a teenager now.

371
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.200
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>There are teenagers alive that were born after Minecraft came out.

372
00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:48.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's on its it's on its way to vote. It can almost vote. If we still can vote and by the time it's 18.

373
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, you can vote 16 in Scotland, so it's not far away from that.

374
00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:54.359
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Well in America voting is gonna about to become not a thing.

375
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, so there are so many games that do low-poly art.

376
00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:08.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Stop comparing everything to Minecraft.

377
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It just shows that you don't know what you're talking about.

378
00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:12.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's boring, right?

379
00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:16.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It is a low-poly survival sim,

380
00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:19.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and so I understand why people would compare this one to Minecraft,

381
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>because it's obviously, you know, Minecraft is a survival game as well.

382
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>But this is, I think, very much focused on, like, kind of actually living a life,

383
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.839
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>whereas like the minecraft was

384
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.279
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>you know much more about the creative aspects of things. And this is about exploration and

385
00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:43.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>survival and you can catch like massive sharks. So that's interesting. I've not played this game.

386
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm I saw that

387
00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It might be something that I would play at some point, but yeah it's cool that it's coming to

388
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:59.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Switch finally in November. Next we have Linked Banner of the Spark. This is another game that

389
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep, yep, looks cool

390
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>that was already out on Steve.

391
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:12.420
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm just going to read the blurb on Steam. I feel like that's the easiest way to try

392
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>[laughs]

393
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm excited for you to explain this.

394
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.480
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>OK.

395
00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.900
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and explain, because this game is unexplainable I think.

396
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Build a bright new world alongside a band of rescued robot buddies. In this colourful

397
00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:30.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>action RPG battle waves of enemies in solo or co-op, then return home and use their part

398
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>to craft a thriving town. Assemble your crew and grow stronger with each new adventure.

399
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:46.640
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It feels a lot like, obviously not in tone at all, but in terms of gameplay, it feels

400
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:54.180
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>a lot like Cult of the Lamb, where you're out. I think the roguelite aspect is, although

401
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Mm-hmm, yeah.

402
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:59.279
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>they never said that in that description, but it is roguelite, the roguelite aspect

403
00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:01.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think is you go out and do right.

404
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:30.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It was I'm going out to do a run and get stuff, and if I die on the run, sure, I lose some of the stuff that I got on the run, but then I come back to my base and my base is the same. It's consistent and you build it up, and you don't lose it if you die in a run. That's what I liked about cult of the lamb, and so I'm interested in this game. I mean, we vaguely talked about it in June because I think it was in the wholesome direct.

405
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Interesting version of wholesome when there's such a big combat element, but that building is a poke center.

406
00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:43.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are you looking at this on Steam?

407
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>at the banner of the Spark game.

408
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah.

409
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I mean, I already looked at it earlier.

410
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:56.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>What-- oh, yeah.

411
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Go look at the third image in the image reel. That is, tell me that's not just a poke center.

412
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That is a pokebond center, if I've ever seen one.

413
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And a Pokemart-- it's a Pokemart and a PokeCenter.

414
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:08.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's like it's a yeah, it's a Pokemon center just with like a random thing stuck on the top and the pokeball logo taken away.

415
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

416
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

417
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:26.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I like the style of this game, the art style of the game, like the kind of the thick lines around all the character models is quite, you know, eye catching. The colors are quite poppy, vibrant. There's the word, yeah.

418
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

419
00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:28.579
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Vibrant they're so vibrant. Yeah, I was just thinking that

420
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Maybe I'll try this at some point. Okay, it's on my wish list. We'll see how things go.

421
00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:35.460
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It looks it looks really cool

422
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:36.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah.

423
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.900
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's really loud

424
00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:39.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, they called it rogue life.

425
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.220
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>They call it a rogue life RPG

426
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:48.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You know what? I don't hate that term, right? If this term comes to mean like games like

427
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:56.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Cult of the Lamb, where you have a base that is the consistent thing, and you go out and do stuff and bring stuff back to your base.

428
00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.279
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I quite like that term because it's showing how it's got the

429
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>aspects to it in your runs where you can die and lose stuff, but it's life sim, but it also

430
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

431
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.740
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But it's a life sim

432
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>like, I think makes that, like that would then tell me which games I like, right? Like it's

433
00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:18.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>rogue life. I like rogue life games. I don't like rogue likes or road lights. I like rogue lives.

434
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

435
00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:21.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>There we go. I'm going to make it a thing. Rogue life. Let's go for it. That's the name of the

436
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:29.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>episode. Rogue life. No, no, no, they have written it, but that doesn't make it a thing, right? We're

437
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.440
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Well, you didn't make it a thing. They made it a thing.

438
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.380
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We're gonna make a thing.

439
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:37.920
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay. Okay. Cool. Was one of the first rogue lives.

440
00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.359
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We're gonna make everybody use it.

441
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>OK, so Cult of the Alarm is a rogue life.

442
00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:40.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, there are probably others as well.

443
00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:42.160
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, like Minecraft?

444
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.640
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, no, because there's no rogue aspect there.

445
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.640
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Well, you go out and go in dungeons and collect stuff and then you come back to your base

446
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, but like, yeah, but that's not the rogue part.

447
00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:55.359
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, if you like.

448
00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:59.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>If you die, then you're all your stuff drops where you died you have to go get it again

449
00:29:58.279 --> 00:30:00.799
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, but you can just go and get it again, because it's

450
00:30:01.119 --> 00:30:02.799
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>like a survival RPG, right?

451
00:30:03.079 --> 00:30:08.200
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Whereas with, yeah, well, surprise, surprise.

452
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:05.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Sorry, I'm just trying to I'm trying to pick I'm trying to be a but

453
00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:10.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The point is you lose stuff, right?

454
00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:11.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's a day that

455
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>If you just drop stuff and you can go pick it up, it's not a rogue like.

456
00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:19.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's a day that ends in y being a but yeah, no, I get it

457
00:30:17.839 --> 00:30:20.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>All right, I've added it to my wish list.

458
00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:21.839
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No promises I'll play it, but.

459
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.720
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I will not promise that

460
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.200
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh yeah, so it says linked banner of the spark, by the way, bad name, fuses

461
00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>the action-packed fun of a rogue

462
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>light with the rich progression and charm of a life sim.

463
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:43.240
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That definitely makes it sound like your your bass is consistent and stays between runs.

464
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.400
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, you build it up, and you get stronger with each run.

465
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah. Yeah.

466
00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:46.680
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>OK. OK. OK.

467
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.140
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That's what they say.

468
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.359
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Let's let's let's do this.

469
00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:52.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>All right. Next, we have.

470
00:30:50.319 --> 00:30:54.920
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Do this like you're going to cover that episode, that game.

471
00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:55.640
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No promises, I don't promise episodes.

472
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But you said, let's do this.

473
00:30:55.839 --> 00:31:00.799
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Let's do this as in let's consider playing the game next.

474
00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:00.640
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>OK.

475
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We have Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar, that game.

476
00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:05.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>They've released an update.

477
00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:06.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>There's not a lot in it.

478
00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's mostly bug fixes.

479
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.759
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>But there was one thing that I was very excited about.

480
00:31:09.759 --> 00:31:13.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And that's that if you fall in the water, you lose less stamina than before the update.

481
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.319
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And I am.

482
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Why did you lose stemma?

483
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:19.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, because you're draining, you drain in the water and you have to get out of the water.

484
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Oh, oh.

485
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So you lose stamina.

486
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.160
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>But it was like it was like a third of your health you lost.

487
00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:30.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So much. Whereas now it's it's like, you know, a heavy usage on.

488
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The rocks like it's it's annoying, but it's not like you could die if you were

489
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>if you only had a third of your health left is not.

490
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:46.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep, well, I still haven't played this game so good. I'm happy for you though though. Swimming is tiring. I get it.

491
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.279
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It is, it is, it is.

492
00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:51.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Next we have Traveller's Rest.

493
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:59.799
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>They have released their 0.7.3.0 update, The Pledge Banquet, and continuing the fun with

494
00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:02.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Traveller's Rest where every time they have an update they go, "Oh, right, OK, they didn't

495
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.720
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>have that."

496
00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>They've added the first chapter of the storyline.

497
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:13.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Now, well it's free, I get it.

498
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:13.359
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So this game had no story before, and now it has some story.

499
00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:15.859
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I would love to go back and play the f-

500
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:27.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The first version of this game back in 2020, and be like "What is in this game? This is such a fascinating- like, was it just a proof of concept? Like, what was it back then?"

501
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah

502
00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:27.819
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I mean lens island lens island was like that as well

503
00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:32.640
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I remember when I first played it it was very bare-bones and now it's way more of a thing

504
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, that's fair.

505
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's fair.

506
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah.

507
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.700
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So it's showing promise

508
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:46.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, no, this is not to market in a mean way. This is just like, it's funny because every time they've updated, we're like, "Oh, they didn't have that either."

509
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And it just, it's very funny because I would just love to see what the game actually was back then, five years ago.

510
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

511
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, well more important than that

512
00:32:55.339 --> 00:32:58.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>No, sorry before that they also changed bug fixes

513
00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:04.240
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And I loved that one of the bug fixes says fixed a bug that caused the housekeeper to get stuck while cleaning

514
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.740
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>infinite cleaning. Oh, no, it's it's my way.

515
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:13.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I was going to say it's my home and realize, no, it's just life with children.

516
00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:14.779
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um

517
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.099
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, wait, no, it definitely here.

518
00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:18.539
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No, here's a funny joke, right?

519
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, okay

520
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's just they just described ADHD.

521
00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:23.539
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Right, where you end up in like your

522
00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:27.140
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>infinite recursion of tidying different things and never finishing anything

523
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.259
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>because you go down in a little loop, you know, like, oh, no, what about this thing?

524
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:38.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm. Yeah, rip. But in their, like, post, did you see that they mention a new game called Cozy

525
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.279
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I did not notice this, and I only just looked at your notes right now, so I'm going to have

526
00:33:38.099 --> 00:33:51.299
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Sanctuary? Yeah. Yeah. So, on the pod. So Cozy Sanctuary is a new game, and it is made by,

527
00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:47.200
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>to look at this live on the pod.

528
00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:58.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I want to say, the same people that make, or, like, their friends of the people. Yeah,

529
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, this is never Rusty Lake, it's another Rusty Lake.

530
00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:00.299
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Yeah, so it's another rusty, like, so, quote,

531
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:28.820
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>it's coming soon, they don't have anything out about it quite yet, but yeah, it's another little rusty-like, so it sits at the bottom of your screen, looks like there's decorations, like a windmill,

532
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.820
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You can unlock new.

533
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You can unlock new species.

534
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There's some really cute little things.

535
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think the icon is a fox.

536
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But I'm not seeing a fox.

537
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I see a peacock.

538
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>[laughs]

539
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I see a duck and a horse that's bouncing really weird.

540
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And a llama.

541
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I guess that's a deer.

542
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There is a demo available now.

543
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So you can go out and play the demo.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>No, that's a red panda.

546

552
00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:15.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>They are very long legs, like.

553

555
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, it's legs are the same length as the horse's legs.

556
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>A koala should not have legs that long.

557
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I mean what

558
00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:28.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think it was on, you know, one of those like racks they used in medieval

559
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>times to try and make people taller.

560
00:35:29.019 --> 00:35:31.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

561
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh no.

562
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The giraffe, I think I see a sloth.

563
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh no.

564
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

565
00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:38.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So many, oh, a duck-billed platypus.

566
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>There are so many animals, sheep, goat, very interesting.

567
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

568
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It looks really cute. There's porcupine.

569
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So just demo out now. Go play it.

570
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It is unfortunately Windows only.

571
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Maybe they'll make it not Windows at some point in the future,

572
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>and I can play it along with Cat Cafe, but alas, not yet.

573
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.519
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So, that was it.

574
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.900
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That was the last thing in the Traveler's Rest post, they just mentioned that.

575
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.159
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, yeah, no, no, good. That's all good.

576
00:36:08.159 --> 00:36:13.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Next we have Tomodachi Life, Living the Dream. This is the new Tomodachi Life game. We got

577
00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:21.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>a new trailer in the Nintendo Direct, including not a release date, but a release season.

578
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.340
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So it's coming out. We knew it was coming out in 2026. We now know it's coming out in

579
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:35.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>spring 2026.

580
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:39.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Ooh, so I think I made the comment of will this make it worth it, but I think that what I was thinking was that this was the Plaza game, but it's not the Plaza game.

581
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.099
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, no, no, this is not Tamagotchi Plaza, this is Tomodachi life.

582
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, I'm sure I made that joke again at some point.

583
00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, it's funny because they were both announced in the same

584
00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:54.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>in the same Nintendo Direct and whenever it was March or whenever.

585
00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.059
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And that was very amusing to me,

586
00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:04.139
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>the fact that they were such similar in titles, Tomogachi and Tomodachi.

587
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.119
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah okay well I was very confused so never mind redact my will this make it worth a comment.

588
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You've redacted the thing you never needed

589
00:37:10.139 --> 00:37:13.619
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>to say because it was just written on the document.

590
00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:13.480
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Correct it was not.

591
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I know that some people absolutely love this game.

592
00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:18.539
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I am fascinated by this game.

593
00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:21.019
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I obviously have to buy it and play it.

594
00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:24.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I honestly don't know if it's going to be my kind of thing or not.

595
00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's very weird.

596
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's giving sims.

597
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.780
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, but it's giving Sims if everything was just weird.

598
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.260
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You know, it's, it's, it's, it's literally like someone took Sims and went.

599
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>What about, what about we do The Sims, but everything's weird.

600
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.739
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>[laughing]

601
00:37:42.619 --> 00:37:44.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That is literally what it just like, and it's,

602
00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:48.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>it's hard to even describe how weird everything seems, but it is all weird.

603
00:37:48.500 --> 00:38:01.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I think the thing that got me was there's a me character that eats lettuce and the lettuce is photorealistic, but it's like the me.

604
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:11.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, all the characters are me style, but yeah, it's funny to me that they've not upgraded

605
00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>the me characters, they're all still the same as they were back in the Wii times, except

606
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>they're all seem a bit shinier in this game, but like yeah, the facial expressions and

607
00:38:22.599 --> 00:38:29.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>all these things are all exactly the same as they were, just like higher res, but.

608
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No more detail, just more pixels of the same.

609
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:42.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, yeah, I don't know, I don't know how to feel about this game, but it's interesting.

610
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>As is tradition.

611
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That's okay.

612
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I mean, I thought it was it looks interesting.

613
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I think that's the best way to describe it.

614
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It sure is interesting.

615
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't think I'll play it.

616
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, fair, but some of that lettuce is terrifying.

617
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That should be the podcast title.

618
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>The lettuce is terrible.

619
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No, it's rogue life.

620
00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:06.159
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>All right, Stardew Valley, again,

621
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

622
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>they also announced in the Nintendo Direct

623
00:39:10.679 --> 00:39:13.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>that there is a Switch 2 version coming.

624
00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:15.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It will be a free update to everyone

625
00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:16.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>who owns it on Switch already.

626
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And it includes mouse mode and game share.

627
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You can play multiplayer with game share.

628
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So if one of you owns the game,

629
00:39:25.719 --> 00:39:29.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>up to four of you can play multiplayer together.

630
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.800
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>which is just awesome. Yeah, um, like

631
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So that's cool.

632
00:39:33.159 --> 00:39:35.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The mouse mode is funny because it's like,

633
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>obviously it was a mouse-based game originally,

634
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then it added controller support to go to consoles,

635
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and now it's mouse is back again.

636
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.840
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>[laughing]

637
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Nature is healing.

638
00:39:43.639 --> 00:39:47.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I really don't understand who's using mouse mode

639
00:39:47.559 --> 00:39:51.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>on the Switch too, except for gimmicks and stuff like that.

640
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like if you're playing Stardew Valley, are you gonna set up your thing to play it in mouse mode?

641
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:04.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I guess maybe if it's like your one game playing thing and you set it up on a desk like a gaming

642
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>PC, then I could maybe see doing it that way. But that feels like a very niche mark.

643
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

644
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I, I don't know.

645
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't when people get like all of these other consoles and like,

646
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>or other like ways to do it, like even controller support.

647
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Sometimes I don't understand it because I just my peanut brain

648
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>can't handle too much stimulation.

649
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So, but good that they're giving it and they're offering it.

650
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think it's really cool that he is continuing to...

651
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You know just make it easier for people to play his game

652
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:46.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And enjoying it. I feel like I saw maybe you guys mentioned this last episode

653
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I feel like I heard something about like Stardew Valley 2 like he might make a second one

654
00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:55.119
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Okay, cool

655
00:40:53.500 --> 00:41:02.860
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I haven't heard anything about that. He's got a new 1.7 update coming, and obviously there's

656
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.119
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It was a fever dream

657
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.420
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>haunted chocolate here, but I've not heard anything about Stardew Valley 2. I don't think

658
00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.619
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>he would, like I feel like if he's going to add more stuff about Stardew Valley 2, he would just

659
00:41:12.619 --> 00:41:21.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>add stuff into the game. Here we go, there is a quote from four months ago where he says,

660
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:30.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>quote, I hate when they just like take a quote and like split it up over a whole article. It's

661
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.860
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>like, let me just read the quote.

662
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.920
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

663
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>No, they want you to do the whole thing.

664
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:40.159
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like, they want you to read the whole article because it gives more screen time

665
00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:43.199
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>and they get more ad revenue from that.

666
00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:45.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>The more screen time you are on the...

667
00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:46.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Capitalism, Elle.

668
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.119
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Capitalism.

669
00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:52.199
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>No, I thought it was something recent and I feel like he was streaming with someone.

670
00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:54.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It also could have been a dream.

671
00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:55.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I have literally...

672
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.380
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>OK, here we go. I've got the actual quote finally.

673
00:41:56.579 --> 00:41:59.780
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It only took me four different articles to find it.

674
00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:02.099
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This was on a podcast

675
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.179
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and he said, I might eventually make a Stardew Valley too, to be honest.

676
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's just so much easier to add more stuff

677
00:42:08.699 --> 00:42:11.300
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch.

678
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.300
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The major systems are already done.

679
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.179
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's the stuff that's not fun to do.

680
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.820
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>When I make an update, it's like, you know, oh, throw this in, throw in that.

681
00:42:19.019 --> 00:42:21.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Let's add green rain.

682
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.760
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

683
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.260
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I do love the green rain.

684
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.460
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and your name's great.

685
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, I don't think he will.

686
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't think he'll make a Stardew Valley, too.

687
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think we'll be lucky if Hunter Chocolatier ever comes out.

688
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't see why he would, realistically, right,

689
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>when he can just keep adding more to Stardew Valley.

690
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

691
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think the only reason you would want to make another version of that

692
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>is if you have a whole different cast of characters do you do?

693
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>In which case it's not really Stardew Valley, too,

694
00:42:45.579 --> 00:42:47.579
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

695
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>unless it's like, you know, far in the future or far in the past,

696
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>where nobody is around anymore.

697
00:42:50.539 --> 00:42:52.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

698
00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:58.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It would be cute I think it'd be cute to do like a prequel where you build the valley

699
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:05.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, but then you also know that the problem with all prequels is you know that it ends with the farm being run down. Sad.

700
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm. Yeah stuff happens

701
00:43:09.079 --> 00:43:11.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Can't make me sad

702
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well done. Not swearing.

703
00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:15.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Can't make me see you're welcome. I can't make me sad. I'm an American

704
00:43:18.639 --> 00:43:20.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Sadness is in my blood

705
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:25.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So Bruce Banner in "The Avengers" when he goes, that's my secret. I'm always angry.

706
00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.360
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm always angry. Yeah

707
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's my secret. I'm always sad.

708
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:35.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>All right, we have one more piece of news before we get on to our main topic of farmland.

709
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.820
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Sorry, it's the fact that I got like the main topic.

710
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:50.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And that is the new Pokémon game has just been announced. This is for After Legends ZA.

711
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

712
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:57.780
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This is coming out in 2026, and this is Pokopia, which if you don't immediately catch it,

713
00:43:58.659 --> 00:44:06.820
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Pokémon Utopia. And this is a Pokémon farming game. And let me tell you, Cody,

714
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.340
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Mm-hmm.

715
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.219
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>did you watch the director? Did you just like what?

716
00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I didn't watch the direct, but you put a video in.

717
00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:14.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I mean, I skipped through the direct,

718
00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:16.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>but you put a video in.

719
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:25.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Let me run you through how my brain goes when we do this, right?

720
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.780
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And so I just watched the video on two times speed.

721
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So it pops up, you get the Switch 2 logo, fantastic.

722
00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:33.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And then it goes, it's black, and it opens up with this like, little kind of snowy scene,

723
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then a Pokeball drops in, and you're like, "Oh, Pokemon, that's interesting.

724
00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:39.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I wasn't expecting Pokemon in this, okay."

725
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>in the Nintendo Direct.

726
00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:42.780
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And then it hatches, and there's a ditto, and you're like, "Oh, interesting, ditto."

727
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And then you're like, "Oh, but wait a minute.

728
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.019
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That doesn't look like our model.

729
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I literally said this in the Discord, I'm like, "That does not look like it's a Legend ZA thing.

730
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>What is this? Is this a different game?" And then Ditto looks at this...

731
00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>>> Okay.

732
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:05.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Pokedex, that's it. I was like, "Poked-cyclopedia? I can't remember what the word is, yeah, Pokedex."

733
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And you're like, "Okay, interesting." And then Ditto transforms into a human, and you're like,

734
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>"Oh my word! This is horrifying! I love it!" And then you see the blocks of the world,

735
00:45:14.639 --> 00:45:16.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then it zooms out and you just.

736
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, oh my word, this is, this is, this is, I'm just swear Cody.

737
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Minecraft.

738
00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:25.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And I'm like, oh my word, is this what I think it is?

739
00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:26.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is this a Pokemon farming game?

740
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And you're like, I don't know, I don't want to get too excited yet

741
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>because it could be anything.

742
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It could be an RPG or something like that, maybe.

743
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, because you're a Pokemon.

744
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And then Bulbasaur is talking to you and you're like, oh, interesting.

745
00:45:36.239 --> 00:45:36.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>OK.

746
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:42.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And Ditto's thinking, Ditto's thinking and going, oh, I've learned vine whip

747
00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:44.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and I can now make grass.

748
00:45:44.719 --> 00:45:46.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Okay.

749
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm now thinking maybe this is a Pokemon farming game, because that's not a thing you

750
00:45:49.679 --> 00:45:56.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>just normally do in a Pokemon game. And then you learn Squirtle's Water Gun, and you squirtle

751
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

752
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>on the grass to make it happy again. And then I'm like, I'm going to fill in something. And then

753
00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:09.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Charmander pops out, you learn some fiery thing from Charmander, and you can set a fire, and great,

754
00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:15.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>fantastic. And then it very much is very clear that this is a Pokemon farming game, because you

755
00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:22.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and you cut down trees. And not only that, but you then start being Hitmonchan and punching

756
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:28.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>away the land, you're terraforming, and then you're building tables, and you've got a crafting table,

757
00:46:28.239 --> 00:46:31.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and you're, you are properly farming at this point. You've got tomatoes, you've got carrots,

758
00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:36.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>you've got potatoes, you've got, you've made fences, you've made a little hut,

759
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>you're doing more terraforming, there's water, there's a waterfall. And I'm like,

760
00:46:40.559 --> 00:46:46.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>guys, this is a Pokemon farming game, and all my dreams are coming true, and I can't believe.

761
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:50.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Pokemon farming. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

762
00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:54.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>We finally, nearly seven years after starting this podcast, finally got a Pokemon farming game,

763
00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:03.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Pokeopia. I'm so, so excited about this. It's also funny because it's actually Game Freak that's

764
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>making this, which is interesting, because obviously they did, what was the other block-based

765
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

766
00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:13.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Pokemon game? Can you remember the one? Quest, yeah, yeah, so they did Quest. It looks very much

767
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>kind of similar sort of art stage.

768
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:26.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>The blocks and stuff, obviously the Pokemon are like normal Pokemon, they're not horrifying abominations of nature, except obviously the digital human.

769
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

770
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't know what to say, except that I'm super excited and I can't believe I have to wait till next year for this.

771
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh yes, let me look at my bullet points then, if I don't know what to say. It looks like Dragon Quest Builders.

772
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It looked basically like Pokemon version of Dragon Quest Builders, which we do have an episode on Dragon Quest Builders too.

773
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I enjoyed that, but I would enjoy it a lot more if I have Pokemon.

774
00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:01.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's like a Pokemon game with no humans, you just have Pokemon, which is excellent. I enjoy that.

775
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.360
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm though you I think you can do multiplayer because there was a second person running around. Yeah, okay

776
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, but it's just another ditto.

777
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:13.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I love that Pokemon have said that our version of a Utopia has no people. I mean, same, right?

778
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.440
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Same

779
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's a Pokemon farming game.

780
00:48:14.659 --> 00:48:20.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, well I they were gonna have to do it eventually I mean farming games have just exploded

781
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:26.300
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And it's clearly a moneymaker, which is why I think game freak would would get on it

782
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Because why would they let all of that sweet sweet cash cow go to someone else?

783
00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:38.519
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Literally cow look we're probably gonna milk milk tanks. Are we gonna get milk from milk tanks and sell it?

784
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:41.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This is interesting, they didn't show any of that, they just showed like crops, they didn't show.

785
00:48:43.019 --> 00:48:49.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think it would both be weird and also make a lot of sense, so I don't know which way.

786
00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think you could make an argument either way as to why.

787
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:02.739
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It makes I mean there's it's it's clearly like I think you can buy that in a lot of games of the game, so it's

788
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:10.059
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, but we are also a Pokemon, so we're not a human, we're a Pokemon talking to Pokemon,

789
00:49:03.699 --> 00:49:05.699
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Well known that it's a thing

790
00:49:10.059 --> 00:49:14.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and I think it would be a little bit weird if we were milking a Miltank as a human.

791
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:24.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>they're allowed to use Pokemon as Pokemon too it is weird you're right yeah

792
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:31.300
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I I really like it I think it's one of those things that as I get older I

793
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:38.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>suspend my excitement for the later times because I just have so much going

794
00:49:38.039 --> 00:49:44.260
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>on in the present but like when it comes out I'm 100% playing it does it was it

795
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:58.460
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>for the switch - did they say that Jeff just yeah Jeff just asked he was like

796
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.260
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I believe it is switched to, yeah, not switch.

797
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.940
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Look, it was gonna, it was gonna happen at some point, right?

798
00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.719
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>do you would you rather have a switch to her a steam deck I was like a steam

799
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh no.

800
00:50:02.719 --> 00:50:09.440
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>deck so but I have time I have time to get this game I mean I didn't get the

801
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.340
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh no, Cody.

802
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.280
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>switch for for like the first year or two that it was out either I didn't I

803
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>waited until Animal Crossing was coming out.

804
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:27.599
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>so yeah I think yeah go for it okay uh well they also have the thing I was

805
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You know what interesting, so see the last, sorry, nope.

806
00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:34.199
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>gonna say is that they also have combi in it and so they might have like honey

807
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Honey, honey I could definitely see that makes a lot that's a lot less weird right because it's

808
00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:44.019
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>just like Combee is making the honey and saying like "hey here's some honey" right whereas like

809
00:50:44.019 --> 00:50:48.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I guess could miltank milk itself? Would that make it less weird?

810
00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You don't think it's weird a ditto be pretending to be a human milking a miltank?

811
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't think you know what happens in, in the world.

812
00:51:01.699 --> 00:51:03.860
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I mean, ditto aren't milking cows.

813
00:51:04.059 --> 00:51:09.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I mean, puppy, like a dog will raise kittens a lot of the time.

814
00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:11.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like if she has extra milk.

815
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:21.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Okay, sure, but it's the digital going up and actually doing the milking that is the

816
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So other animals benefit from the milk provided by other animals all the time.

817
00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>weird thing to me.

818
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, so, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna suck.

819
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:30.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think if the milk tank provides the milk and just goes here's milk, that I think solves

820
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.360
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, milks, milks itself.

821
00:51:30.039 --> 00:51:31.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>the problem.

822
00:51:31.039 --> 00:51:32.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's not weird.

823
00:51:32.039 --> 00:51:37.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, I think that's not weird.

824
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't know.

825
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And see the end of the trailer, right, it zooms out onto this clearly like mid-game

826
00:51:45.199 --> 00:51:50.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>area or like version of the game where you've got a bunch of crops.

827
00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:52.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think the crop management is really bad.

828
00:51:52.719 --> 00:51:55.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Why have you got those massive empty spaces?

829
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>[laughter]

830
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Go deal with that.

831
00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.480
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

832
00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>But that aside, a couple of interesting things I'd like to hyper focus on here.

833
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:02.860
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>OK.

834
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:08.460
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>One, they have a Pokemon center at the top of the center.

835
00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is that actually a focus center or is it

836
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>a building in the shape of a focus center?

837
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.159
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like what is it there for?

838
00:52:14.519 --> 00:52:22.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That leads me to believe that there are lots of other buildings that we're going

839
00:52:22.679 --> 00:52:25.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>to be building, right, because obviously at the beginning you just see like this

840
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

841
00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:28.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>little shack, essentially, right?

842
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And then we're now at this point, we've got our Pokemon Center.

843
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

844
00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:34.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Interesting.

845
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There's also a Snorlax that's blocking the way.

846
00:52:36.199 --> 00:52:38.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That was another thing that I thought was interesting.

847
00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:39.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Uh, it's.

848
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is that just as Norlax has decided to fall asleep or is that a story based thing or is that just for the trailer?

849
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:56.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This whole thing makes makes me feel like this specific bit, you know, this specific scene looks like something out of Pokemon Let's Go.

850
00:52:57.639 --> 00:53:03.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And I wonder if they're trying to make that connection, the Kanto connection.

851
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>There are non Kanto Pokemon in this scene, but not many.

852
00:53:07.679 --> 00:53:09.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Most of them are Kanto Pokemon in this scene.

853
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:18.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Lots of non Kanto Pokemon throughout the whole thing, but I'm only seeing three in this that aren't Kanto, whereas all the rest are Kanto here, I think.

854
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Mm-hmm, well, that's something that can be added in DLCs, so.

855
00:53:23.679 --> 00:53:27.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes. Yeah, no, I'm not saying that I'm worried that there aren't going to be lots of non Kanto Pokemon.

856
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:37.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I just think, are they trying to make us think about Let's Go in this scene and is that leading to some hints of what could be to come?

857
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm just spitballing ideas is what I'm thinking.

858
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.199
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>There's a bike.

859
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:49.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm I mean it this straight up by the end this just looks like a root

860
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are we going to ride the bike?

861
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, that's the thing.

862
00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:54.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>They also have the root sign at the beginning as well.

863
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah

864
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, are we going to be able to believe, is this a Pokemon maker, right?

865
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.639
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>a Pokemon game maker.

866
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, are we going to make our own Pokemon region?

867
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, that's essentially what we're building here, right?

868
00:54:05.139 --> 00:54:09.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That's what it looks like you're building.

869
00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:08.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, it really does.

870
00:54:09.139 --> 00:54:12.679
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I like the idea of that.

871
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm absolutely fascinated as to what this is going to be like to play.

872
00:54:12.679 --> 00:54:14.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I don't know.

873
00:54:17.199 --> 00:54:21.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I would like the idea of you making your own little route

874
00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.679
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>and then being a gatekeeper about your route.

875
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:34.219
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I mean, the top comment on this YouTube is, how long after launch will we see a recreation

876
00:54:34.219 --> 00:54:39.340
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>of the whole Kanto region in this game? Yeah, I mean, it's not going to take long.

877
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.739
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>[laughs]

878
00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:37.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah.

879
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:42.780
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, it just depends on how much space they give us.

880
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:49.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>If they give us other areas other than just this basic route

881
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.440
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

882
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.780
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>style, or is there a forest?

883
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Is there water other than the little stream?

884
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is there going to be a story or is it completely sandboxy?

885
00:54:57.019 --> 00:54:57.659
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't know.

886
00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:03.840
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's-- uh-huh.

887
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So this is OK, let's go back to the Minecraft thing, right?

888
00:55:03.559 --> 00:55:09.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Because the thing that all the big games websites are doing is,

889
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>"Oh, they've made Minecraft Pokémon!"

890
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And you're like, I get annoyed by that, because again, like with Dinkum,

891
00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>But even more so on this.

892
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This is clearly not like a survival game, right?

893
00:55:26.719 --> 00:55:37.179
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's town building, it's you know, but it's not survival.

894
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>The existence of a POKI Center

895
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Infers to me that are not infers but like suggests

896
00:55:37.179 --> 00:55:40.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Our main Pokémon games, are they survival games?

897
00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>No, exactly.

898
00:55:41.079 --> 00:55:43.079
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>No, they're adventure

899
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's a base building game, clearly, but it's not.

900
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Like, I don't think it's going to be like a survival like Dinkum and Minecraft are,

901
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>but my point is just like, again, people just jump to "there are blocks, therefore Minecraft",

902
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:04.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and it gets me so annoyed because no, I know exactly what you were doing, but I'm annoyed

903
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>- Yeah, that's why I made the comment.

904
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:11.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>because it's like big games news publications are doing this, and I just like "you should know better,

905
00:56:11.519 --> 00:56:16.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>no more games". There are other games that have blocks, and there are other games you can compare

906
00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>compare this to.

907
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.239
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I understand why people are comparing this to Animal Crossing, but it's also not, right?

908
00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Because it's a huge part of Animal Crossing is the villagers.

909
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And yes, there are Pokemon here, but I don't think that are.

910
00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:34.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't think this is going to be like building relationships with the Pokemon.

911
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:40.360
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I think the Pokemon are really just there as one, obviously, to learn their skills and use them.

912
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.880
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Right. Because you have to meet a Bulbasaur to be able to grow the grass.

913
00:56:43.079 --> 00:56:45.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You have to meet a Squirtle to water the plants, which I really like.

914
00:56:45.679 --> 00:56:48.159
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's a fun way of doing farming.

915
00:56:48.719 --> 00:56:53.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm excited to try that out, but I don't think we're going to be learning about Charmander's

916
00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:59.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>story, right? They're going to have things to say, but they're not going to have huge backstories,

917
00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:07.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't think. And I just feel like people, they jump to these three things, right? "Oh,

918
00:57:07.039 --> 00:57:12.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>it's like Minecraft because block, it's like Animal Crossing because you're making a town,

919
00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:15.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>or it's like Stardew because farming." And you're like, "No, there are other games,

920
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And if you're going to compare it to something.

921
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Which you don't need to, but if you're going to compare it to something.

922
00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It is Dragon Quest Builders 2, right?

923
00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:23.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That is what it is.

924
00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:29.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And it's unknown exactly whether there will be story elements.

925
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And that was the case with Dragon Quest Builders 2.

926
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It had a story.

927
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is this just going to be sandbox-y?

928
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Or is there going to be a progression through that story?

929
00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:40.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I don't know.

930
00:57:40.719 --> 00:57:42.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is there just one island?

931
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are there multiple islands?

932
00:57:43.039 --> 00:57:45.280
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Because another thing with Dragon Quest Builders

933
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>is you have different islands that you travel to throughout the story.

934
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Build up bases there on different islands.

935
00:57:50.639 --> 00:57:52.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's an interesting question to me.

936
00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is this just going to be one island or multiple?

937
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>How big is it?

938
00:57:55.599 --> 00:58:01.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>What exactly will the terraforming be?

939
00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:04.559
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are you just able to do it to a certain point like with Animal Crossing.

940
00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:06.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Where you can't expand the island.

941
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>You can only go up or down.

942
00:58:08.719 --> 00:58:10.719
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And only like up three levels or whatever.

943
00:58:10.719 --> 00:58:11.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Is it going to be that restrictive?

944
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:14.480
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Or is it going to be less restrictive like Dragon Quest Builders 2.

945
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Where you can go up really high.

946
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I still don't think you can expand the a--

947
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:25.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>or is it going to be Minecrafty where it's like, you can do whatever you want, you can get rid of any block, you can add any block.

948
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:35.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Are you going to have to get resources to build blocks or are you going to be able to just make them out of nowhere?

949
00:58:35.679 --> 00:58:41.639
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So many questions. I'm really fascinated. But yeah, get better games to compare this to, right?

950
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.679
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I agree.

951
00:58:43.679 --> 00:58:48.519
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think that also there's just like, there's a lot of possibilities, like a

952
00:58:48.519 --> 00:58:51.239
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>lot of different directions this could go in.

953
00:58:51.719 --> 00:58:55.219
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, so like saying, Oh, it's a Minecraft.

954
00:58:55.219 --> 00:58:55.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, it's a whatever.

955
00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.360
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like we don't know yet.

956
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We know very little right now.

957
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:14.079
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, agreed, agreed, I saw Vulpix at one point, where was I saw Vulpix?

958
00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.760
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So, but I am excited.

959
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I was mostly looking for Vulpix and I did not see it.

960
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.340
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, okay.

961
00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:14.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That was the most important thing to me.

962
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:23.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So the section after, so two, two minutes 18 sleeping on a bench.

963
00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>What's the timestamp timestamp timestamp?

964
00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:25.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, look at him seeping.

965
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.780
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It was barely there.

966
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.219
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think I was distracted by the Ludicolo in the next one.

967
00:59:30.219 --> 00:59:30.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Look at him.

968
00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.920
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>He's so, oh, you could see his.

969
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:38.619
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Bings screenshot.

970
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:45.099
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>there's a water wheel, there's definitely more like you're building beds inside a building.

971
00:59:45.099 --> 00:59:51.900
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So it's definitely some decoration aspects to it inside. I need I have a feeling that

972
00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:57.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>the POCA Center is just a building with that design. That is my theory because it is smaller

973
00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:04.460
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>than normal and it just looks like it's the same sort of physical size as the original hut. It's

974
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:09.340
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>just it's you know the outside looks fancier and I think it's

975
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:15.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>how do I edit this? I don't think I can. We're good.

976
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:21.059
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Okay, look, we're going to have a lot more to talk about this in the future, but that's

977
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.559
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

978
01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:26.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>probably enough for just now. So that is the news.

979
01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:27.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>POCOPIA.

980
01:00:27.739 --> 01:00:33.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>All right, on to our main topic. Let's see how long we get out of this. This is farmland,

981
01:00:33.739 --> 01:00:39.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>a YouTube playable, as I mentioned earlier in the episode. It is a thing that YouTube

982
01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:45.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>does now where you can get games and, oh boy, are they things that exist.

983
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yes.

984
01:00:46.219 --> 01:00:51.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Okay, so a quick explanation of this game. You start out on this teeny tiny little piece

985
01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:59.139
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>of land you are farming. You click a button to start sowing seeds. I think you start with

986
01:00:59.139 --> 01:01:05.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>corn. You walk around the place of land, automatically sowing seeds after you press the button. And

987
01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:11.139
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>then once you finish sowing, it then shows another button to water. You see water everything

988
01:01:11.139 --> 01:01:15.380
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and they grow almost immediately and then once you've grown them all you then get a

989
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:20.619
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>little button to harvest them, you harvest them all, and then you go and sell them,

990
01:01:22.139 --> 01:01:29.099
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then that's pretty much it. With the money you can do a few things but it's all basically

991
01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:36.219
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>just to do more of the same. There's different crops, so they start off with one tiny little

992
01:01:36.219 --> 01:01:42.860
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>island and with the money you can buy other bits of land and you can also buy workers who do things

993
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>automatically and the different pieces of

994
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:51.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>land give you like different, different crops to grow. So there's three on the first section

995
01:01:50.500 --> 01:02:03.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>um and plus animal they have there's animals um and you don't know what's going to be on the next

996
01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:56.619
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then there's three others on the next section.

997
01:02:03.539 --> 01:02:12.019
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>area so it just shows like later on it just shows how much it costs to get to the next section

998
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:27.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>And sometimes it's literally just like half a bridge or it is a corner to get to another

999
01:02:13.139 --> 01:02:18.179
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>but it doesn't tell you what's on that section so you just kind of like are randomly dispensing

1000
01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:18.679
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>money.

1001
01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep.

1002
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.960
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>piece of land. There are multiple where I've gone and it's literally just been a piece

1003
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep.

1004
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:38.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>of land. There's nothing on it at all. You don't get to. You don't get. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1005
01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I do really like there's a cat and a dog.

1006
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>We got into them yet.

1007
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.800
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Um, you don't-

1008
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>you don't choose what is where, uh, you- you go and there is what is on the land, so like,

1009
01:02:47.719 --> 01:02:53.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>you might find a single chicken on the piece of land, um, or you might find a farm, or you

1010
01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.159
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>might find a tree with apples, um, or as you say you might find a cat or a dog or nothing,

1011
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:05.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep.

1012
01:03:00.039 --> 01:03:07.400
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>just some- just the path. Um, it's very much like, I think the idea behind it is

1013
01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:10.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>automating things quickly and then just

1014
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>like building that up with the money that you have because like you can you can unlock workers

1015
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then like upgrade them with more money.

1016
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

1017
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.780
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep, they get faster.

1018
01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:25.320
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Trying to think if there's anything else to say.

1019
01:03:27.579 --> 01:03:31.340
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>There's also-- you can upgrade your barn capacity.

1020
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.460
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think-- yep, I've got fishing.

1021
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I got some boats.

1022
01:03:35.539 --> 01:03:39.699
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So I'm assuming as the game gets more and more ridiculously

1023
01:03:39.699 --> 01:03:43.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>huge, you can--

1024
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I can't figure out how to do the fishing.

1025
01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.480
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>you have to just find, you find fish that spawn around your

1026
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:54.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>islands. He's just buying the fish and he has lines, but yeah.

1027
01:03:48.159 --> 01:03:51.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh right, okay, so I thought that he's just buying the fish, right, okay.

1028
01:03:53.199 --> 01:03:53.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Of course.

1029
01:03:56.239 --> 01:03:57.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, I found the fish, there we go, I see.

1030
01:04:00.059 --> 01:04:02.820
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But yeah, so it's, it's very, very simple. It's like those

1031
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:08.860
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>games that are like additive where, you know, you, you have

1032
01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:12.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>a small amount of something in the beginning and you get like,

1033
01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:16.619
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>they have them in like zombie survival games where in order to

1034
01:04:17.539 --> 01:04:21.179
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>area to escape zombies, you have to have like a certain amount

1035
01:04:21.179 --> 01:04:25.739
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>of energy or something. And then as you just gets bigger and

1036
01:04:25.739 --> 01:04:31.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>bigger number go big is what this this game is. I do like

1037
01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:36.699
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>the every so often, I want to say like every four minutes or

1038
01:04:36.699 --> 01:04:38.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>something. It just randomly rains.

1039
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:45.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, so that's an interesting mechanic. It seems to be whatever island you're on at that

1040
01:04:45.579 --> 01:04:51.059
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>time, whatever section of the map you're on, it will rain on. And so if you're on the first

1041
01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:57.059
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>section, then you have like four fields that it uses up. But if I'm on, because it just

1042
01:04:57.059 --> 01:05:01.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>literally just rained for me there, but I was on the second island where I only have

1043
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm, mhmm, womp womp.

1044
01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:05.900
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>one plot of stuff. The interesting thing about the rain is it makes things grow even if you

1045
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:09.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>haven't sewn any seeds, which I'm not sure.

1046
01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yep.

1047
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.599
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh, pharmacy legacy crops, they're seeds.

1048
01:05:14.639 --> 01:05:17.780
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You've, you spilled some seeds and they go up.

1049
01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.039
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't know.

1050
01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:18.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm not going to complain.

1051
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It's a thing.

1052
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:28.340
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, it's a thing, but yeah, just number go big, um, and try and

1053
01:05:29.239 --> 01:05:32.900
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>like upgrade your people and they automate and get crops for you.

1054
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.400
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>And then the one thing I don't have, I don't see automation for

1055
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.960
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>you is taking stuff from your barn to the celly guy.

1056
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:49.699
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yes, I've not encountered that either. I suspect there won't be one for that, because they still

1057
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm.

1058
01:05:49.699 --> 01:05:54.340
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>want you to actually do something in the game, right? Because otherwise you would just sit with

1059
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:59.619
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>it doing nothing and it would literally be like cookie clicker or, you know, paperclip maker,

1060
01:05:59.619 --> 01:06:05.780
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>where at some point you just stop playing the game. Which is a thing you can do,

1061
01:06:06.739 --> 01:06:10.420
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>but the question is, do you want to encourage people to stop playing your game eventually?

1062
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:17.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I don't know. This is mind-numbing. I kind of like it. I don't I don't there's not there's no incentive to

1063
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>keep going other than

1064
01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:22.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>unlock all

1065
01:06:22.059 --> 01:06:24.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>locked areas

1066
01:06:24.539 --> 01:06:25.739
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I

1067
01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:30.659
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Also love so it says rain will grow your fields while you watch this video, but you can X out of that

1068
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:42.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I haven't experienced that, and I presume you're not YouTube Premium. I am YouTube Premium,

1069
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:35.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So it's like please watch this video, which I'm sure they would get content from

1070
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>You

1071
01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:51.039
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>so I wonder if I don't get that because I'm YouTube Premium, which is interesting. Look,

1072
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.880
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That would make sense

1073
01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:52.139
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I'm not

1074
01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:58.599
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm not going to pretend this is a good game. This is not a good game. You know what this

1075
01:06:53.659 --> 01:06:56.159
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>It's it's just a very basic

1076
01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:00.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>feels like so you know how you get the

1077
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:06.119
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>phone game ads which is like "oh here's an exciting like zombie game" or whatever

1078
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

1079
01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.940
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

1080
01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:08.920
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>and then you actually play it and it's something completely different.

1081
01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.380
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Mm-hmm

1082
01:07:09.719 --> 01:07:14.679
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>This is the something completely different that you would get. This is not the one that they would

1083
01:07:14.679 --> 01:07:18.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>make an advert for because nobody would look at an advert for this and go "oh yeah that looks

1084
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:24.760
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>like a good game" but it is definitely a game that exists that you could put in as that game.

1085
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.840
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Well, we have to have our game, so this is the game.

1086
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.420
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I think that this is a very simple game.

1087
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.599
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I think that people will play it and they'll get ad revenue for it.

1088
01:07:36.179 --> 01:07:37.679
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, for sure.

1089
01:07:38.099 --> 01:07:40.980
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>For the videos, if you can't, for people who might not be able

1090
01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.099
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>to X out of them, I don't know when it rains.

1091
01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:52.059
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, but yeah, I mean, it's very, very simple and I am able to play on my phone.

1092
01:07:52.059 --> 01:07:53.619
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Like I'm playing on my phone right now.

1093
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.519
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Oh, cool. I yeah, I was playing on my on my computer with the mason keyboard. So interesting.

1094
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.820
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um.

1095
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I was curious.

1096
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Yeah, I basically just like clicked the link that you sent and then it was like sign into your thingy sign into your YouTube and then I did.

1097
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Um, and that's it.

1098
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:07.980
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's cool.

1099
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>So, um, yeah, I it's it's game that exists.

1100
01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:12.579
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Nice.

1101
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Uh.

1102
01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:23.500
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'd also, one other thing I would like for this is I'd like another barn where I can hire more people for the other areas.

1103
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.539
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>I'm assuming you unlock that.

1104
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:31.779
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Yeah, I'm guessing so, but I'm at the point where it's like my next one is like 60,000, I have to earn to get there, it's going to take a while.

1105
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.920
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>Oh, yeah, I'm not there yet.

1106
01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:37.420
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>So I'm not going to do that because I'm not enjoying this.

1107
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.420
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I'm not game enough to do that.

1108
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:42.159
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>But it gets-- number get big so fast, Al.

1109
01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.619
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>It does, but also my number get big in Grand Bazaar as well.

1110
01:08:46.619 --> 01:08:49.739
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I sold like 800,000 this week in my Bazaar, so.

1111
01:08:49.500 --> 01:09:07.899
<v CECEA531-4B6E-4557-9B9A-2CDDC00F7976>That's true. That's, that's, that's, that's this game. Nope. A simple game. Interesting

1112
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:53.979
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>That's a game.

1113
01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:59.340
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>I really don't think there's anything else to talk about, is there?

1114
01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:01.899
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Cool.

1115
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.020
<v E52A2224-8EC0-43BD-827D-67081B8F8A48>Good game.

1116
