<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You know, you ever think about like what celebrities play cottage cards?

14
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>This is just a random thought, but like, you know, Danny Trejo is a big animal crossing fan, right?

15
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Like, I want to know who else on the upper echelons of celebrity society are into it.

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You know, how can we make our way there?

17
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Just tailor swift and enjoy patience.

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I just want to know, we need somebody to blow us up.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.719
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I mean, that's that's one one way of thinking of things. I'm sure there's there are ones

20
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah

21
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's the thing, that is where we get big.

22
00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Don't blow us up. That's illegal

23
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.739
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You know, let's talk about Sunsea Island, because there's a celebrity out there who wants

24
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes. Yes, this, this episode, this, this episode we are going to talk about some seed Island,

25
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.939

26
00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.939
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So let's ready. That's dead.

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>because we are zooming through as many games as possible before the end of the year.

28
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.060
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, no, not before the end of the year, before Pokemon comes out, let's be honest,

29
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, which Pokemon there's a lot of Pokemon going. Yeah

30
00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.700
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>seeing what we can do.

31
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.219
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Before ZA comes out.

32
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.419
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, that's fair

33
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>before that we have a bunch of news and it's not even all the news there's a few people

34
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:28.939
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>news I didn't add in because I mean we need something for next week and I don't want to spend an entire day talking about all those news so but there's still a lot of news before that I'm gonna ask Kevin if he has any thoughts on

35
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughter]

36
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:35.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Powell Farm before that we've got I know what you released last month but first of all Kevin what have you been up to?

37
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. I mean, okay. Well, I've been up to Sunset Island. I played that game. I did actually.

38
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>don't say I'm so convinced

39
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:53.620
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. I mean, I did. We'll talk about that. But I've been going through Shadow of the Hedgehog.

40
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Man, that game's that's a good game. I mean, yeah, I know you know it's a good game.

41
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Son is that Sonic egg shadows that

42
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah sorry shadow generation. Yes, not in half the 2000 whatever shadow

43
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>No, just checking you never know. Yeah, I never know when I'm talking to you

44
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.060
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>but not that game. If I am that that's a signal for help. That's that's a code

45
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:25.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>advantage that would be danger. Sonic 06. Yeah yeah that's a discussion that I

46
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>What would be worse that or I can't even remember which one is that the yeah, oh six that's what it is

47
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, we're we're hogs on it, which is worse I

48
00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.740
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>think many sonic fans like to have which one's the bottom of their

49
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You

50
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.539
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Personally, I lean towards Sonic 06 being worse because for every

51
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.939
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>thing, Shadow of the Hedgehog is, that game at least works, does not crash frequently.

52
00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.259
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, not that frequently at least.

53
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.939
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>That's fair. That's fair.

54
00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Anyway, yeah, I've been playing.

55
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.419
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I love that the whole marketing around that game was just, hey,

56
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:57.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, no, that's that's wrong game, you're thinking wrong game, no, that's Sonic Unleashed.

57
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>wherehog, like that was everything about the marketing was that was that not?

58
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, Sonic Unleashed is wherehog, and yes, that was all Sonic 06 is the real, with the

59
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.400
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>realistic human. That's when we're Sonic Kisses that one.

60
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.080
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The human girl, the human girl, wherehog was also not very good or the day part half

61
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.379
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, yeah, that was bad.

62
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.719
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All right, my bad.

63
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.899
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>of it was not very good. The wherehog part was not very good. But yeah, no, that I'll

64
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:26.899
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>take, I'll take wherehog over the shadow of the hedgehog game though. The self title one.

65
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.040
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>No, interesting.

66
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay.

67
00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Not shadow generations because that one's good. Even though it's reaching into all of

68
00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:29.720
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes.

69
00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.300
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>of these bad games you're talking about.

70
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.600
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, yeah, so look,

71
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.360
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I mean, I couldn't get through that game, but that is just a me with 3D sonic games problem.

72
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, but it's it's good. I mean, I'm just I'll say this. I think Sonic Generation is probably the best Sonic game ever released

73
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'd go with that.

74
00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:03.040
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And shadow that in you know releasing a shadow the hedgehog side game to go with it and it lived up to that part. That's that's impressive

75
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.060
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I I kind of agree. I agree that generations is the best Sonic game

76
00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

77
00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>What I do wish the shadow part because as far as I could tell and I didn't go through it huge

78
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

79
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.339
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The shadow part was just 3d just the modern Sonic style of game. I don't think it had any of the the the merging of things to do

80
00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.959
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There

81
00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:33.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It had some so you know how these go there. There's different acts in each little right the first act is full 3d the second act is usually too deep leaning

82
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There'll still be a few 3d segments, but it it's it's 2d leaning

83
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.120
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'll say that but

84
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that's the problem it lost me in the first act because it was like ah it's just more of the bit

85
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

86
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that I don't like rather than.

87
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.879
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's fair. That's fair

88
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But yeah, it's it's a good game

89
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.040
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And it leans into all the dumb stuff that sonic hands faded hate about shadow, but then we learned to love it

90
00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.519
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Anyways, so that's good

91
00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:08.959
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, so I've been playing that you are also been playing digie man's because digimon

92
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.120
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Now is this is this the one that has gone like has like 80,000 players on Steam just now?

93
00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Story time stranger came out but I've been playing

94
00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I

95
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Probably because it just came out like two days ago from more recording

96
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, yeah

97
00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.339
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like surprisingly big

98
00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:29.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, okay, so I'm not playing that one because I'm I don't like there's a lot of games coming out

99
00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.279
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All right, it's not the one you're playing, right?

100
00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.399
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, I'm playing the previous

101
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, so rewind to

102
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.959
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>20 I don't know 15 something like that digimon story cyber sleuth with the colon in the middle. Did you want story colon cyber sleuth? That came out

103
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>A monster collecting RPG and digie one it was very very good

104
00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Fast forward to 2018 digie mon story cyber sleuth

105
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.439
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Another colon I guess hackers memory a semi sequel

106
00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Because it was in the same exact story and world just told from the perspective of a different character

107
00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.839
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But still the same

108
00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.560
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>RPG monster collecting got it also very good

109
00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:14.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, cue the other day. We got

110
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.199
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Digimon story calling time strangers, so now it's a completely different story set of characters. It's a

111
00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:30.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>more style of gameplay though. That is not the one I'm playing. Because I want to play the new one, but I am not able

112
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.459
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And that's not the one you're playing, just now.

113
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.439
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>to, unfortunately, I'm going back to the old one. Because I never beat the other one that came on

114
00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:44.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>2018 hackers memory, the one from the different character. So I'm going to through that now.

115
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:49.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Anyways, I'm playing that it's monster collecting. It's very, very good in my opinion. I like how

116
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.439
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>they manage the systems of being able to grind and collect and do a lot of stuff at once. You can

117
00:07:55.439 --> 00:08:02.160
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>have a party up to 11 creatures. You only have through on the field at once, but all the other guys

118
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:11.439
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>get the experience nonetheless. So you can grind and evolve and collect stuff very easily. And also

119
00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:14.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So they're their collection methods interesting.

120
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.740
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You don't throw Pokeballs or whatever you just have to encounter a Digimon enough times on the wild and then you can add it to your collection

121
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:30.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Which is I don't know. I think it's fun because it's no no moss. You don't have to fret about trying to catch it just happens over time

122
00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:38.200
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Anyways, but yeah, you're a good game since last time. That's that's roughly what I've been up to though. What about you? How's going on?

123
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.120
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, obviously, I have also been playing Sunset Island, and we'll talk about that later in the podcast.

124
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.320
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But also, I picked up a couple of days ago.

125
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>One desktop.

126
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh snap!

127
00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:51.759
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Let me tell you something.

128
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah?

129
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.080
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Steam does like to snitch on me.

130
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:02.399
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I boot up the game, and about 10 seconds later I got a message from Azeland.

131
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay.

132
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

133
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughing]

134
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:07.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Who was streaming on Twitch at the time?

135
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah!

136
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughing]

137
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>With just wonderstop in all caps.

138
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Toxic live on 2-inch.

139
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughing]

140
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Ah yeah!

141
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Good stuff!

142
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:23.759
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I think we know how Azeland feels about the game.

143
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh yeah!

144
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughing]

145
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I mean, I was an on-steam at the time.

146
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>If I were, I would have done the same thing probably.

147
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughing]

148
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.799
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It was there was another one that happened with Kelly earlier than the year and I can't even remember was I got a message from them

149
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, that's hilarious.

150
00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.159
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Commenting on the fact that I'd boot it up a game

151
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, that's great. I love that.

152
00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:42.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>boom

153
00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:47.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Very silly, but there we go steam leaves no secrets. Yes before anybody

154
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Tells me in the slack yes, I know that you can turn off that setting, but I like it. It's funny

155
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It is, yeah, at least the months like this, it's good, it's good stuff.

156
00:09:56.419 --> 00:10:00.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I've only got about two hours into the game

157
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:07.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I don't I think it's too early to how to give an opinion on on it

158
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.399
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Um, I I died. I think you have a there's a pretty good picture like overall

159
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:21.379
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm not gonna talk about the gameplay because I I think I need to put more time in before I make a decision about how I feel about the

160
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.600
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

161
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Sure

162
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:29.980
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But obviously I will see that the game looks gorgeous. It sounds gorgeous, and it is definitely

163
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I can see what it's going with this story and

164
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I mean

165
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:41.100
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's it's obviously going to be very emotional. I can feel that. So yeah

166
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:47.799
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, I mean that opening that that opening comes at you with a sledgehammer like there there is

167
00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:44.379
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Those are all good things

168
00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:51.179
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You're getting into it right away

169
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:59.259
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I'll leave it. I'll leave it at that and I won't talk about the gameplay

170
00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.879
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, okay

171
00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:05.820
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>just now because I need to, I need to play some more before I make a public declaration of an opinion.

172
00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:10.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, well, let me ask you as of right now your limit experience. What would you like it?

173
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.919
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Hmm

174
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>As our game as our whole?

175
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:20.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, let me just yeah, yeah, that's a hole right there's different parts. Okay. All right, that's all I'm just curious

176
00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:27.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, I'm again with the context very limited, but that's fine. Okay

177
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.519
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>it's really hard. I don't because like I have some issues with the gameplay. Let's put it that way.

178
00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:33.679
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Sure sure

179
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:40.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Which I need some time to decide whether or not that is because I'm just not used to it yet.

180
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.159
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Or whether it's something that will always be an issue for me and I don't want to talk about those

181
00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:51.320
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>issues yet on the podcast because I think it's unfair without getting it more time.

182
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.539
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay. All right. Well, I mean Jason, I have wanted to make a second episode anyways for

183
00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:04.460
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>a while because we want to talk about the story like full full spoilers. But okay, that's

184
00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:15.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>that's that's all right. Good stuff. Wonder style. That's a good game. Very possible.

185
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.240
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So yeah, only two hours into it, but I'm hoping to have it done before ZA comes out. I've got two weeks

186
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's a it's well. Yeah, that's the thing. I mean how long to beat says 10 to 12 hours

187
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>>> That is correct.

188
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:25.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And I've got a week and a half until the game comes out. I should be able to do it considering like I put

189
00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:28.100
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>150 hours in two weeks

190
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laugh]

191
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Into tears of the kingdom. I should be able to do 12 hours in a week and a half

192
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.179
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Let's be honest

193
00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:38.259
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And if and if I don't manage to put in that minute time before ZA comes out

194
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:45.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm probably never going to right like that's the that it's one of those things where it's like you're obviously not enjoying the game enough

195
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:54.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.940
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>If you don't get in that that minute time for me, obviously different people have different

197
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Speeds of these things. I'm not judging anybody in there. They're games speed times

198
00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:59.580
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But for me if I don't manage to put 12 hours into a game in two weeks. I'm not enjoying the game

199
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:14.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's like what an hour a day. That's nothing. Yeah. Um, yeah. That's fair. And you know what, it's a good time because, you know, Z a feels like, are you, are you a rollercoaster fan? Oh, or do you get rid of the middle.

200
00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:02.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>so

201
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.980
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Exactly exactly

202
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I have been and I am a fine theory of roller coasters.

203
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.120
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay.

204
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>My problem is I get motion sick quite easily.

205
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:25.200
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Sure. Sure. Yeah, that's rough.

206
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I can only go on a certain number of roller coasters in a certain, like I have to,

207
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>if I'm a theme park with people, I will go on one roller coaster for every two

208
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.799
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, y'all limits.

209
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:58.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, okay. That's fair. That's fair. Okay. You know, well, hey, hats off to you. That's impressive because you work through it. That's good. Well, anyways, I was going to say ZA feels like the the lift, you know, the climb at the start of a rollercoaster because after ZA, oh my goodness, so much stuff is going to come out. I don't know how we're going to fit other games in. Yeah, games in general.

210
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that everyone else goes on and I'm like recovering.

211
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm recovering when they're going on the second one.

212
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.259
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You just mean games in general or are you specifically about Pokemon?

213
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yes, both.

214
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:09.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I mean, there's gonna be a lot of Pokemon next year. It's got PCopia champions if you care and then there's gen 10

215
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.940
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I keep forgetting about champions.

216
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:21.399
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, you know who will be good. I don't know but and that's and that there could still be more it's Pokemon 30. It's gonna be a big year

217
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:51.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>What, what a, yeah, come on, sure, I, I'm convinced there's going to be a fourth thing coming out next year. There'll be another spin off. And I, I'm, I'm kind of wondering whether it might be a remake of something, not, not a remake of a main series game, a remake of a, a side game, or, or something like snap, where they do another one, which is, you know, something like that. I don't know, but I don't know what it would be at this point. Maybe, maybe, but what does that look like in 2026?

218
00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:26.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I

219
00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:28.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>am - absolutely

220
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.759
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Ooh, that's a good call, I like that.

221
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.139
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>New Poke Park!

222
00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know.

223
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.600
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know.

224
00:14:51.500 --> 00:15:21.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, do you know what would be great? And it's not going to, no, and it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen, but you know what I would be great is a new RPG game. It's not going to happen, but if I could, if I could do one thing, I would love another one of those because that was so much fun. And my problem with playing the card game is like people.

225
00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:52.620
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know.

226
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.019
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Detective Pikachu remake.

227
00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.879
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughing]

228
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, yeah, it's not gonna happen

229
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.899
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:51.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>(laughs) Like there's just, there's so much, so many extra variables when you're dealing with people, but like, I really enjoyed playing the Game Boy TCG game because it was like, because it was an RPG. It was fun. You were working through a story and like, there was an end goal to get to and you were building up your deck and trying different things was fun. I don't enjoy doing that in like live or pocket as much. Um, exactly, exactly.

231
00:15:46.000 --> 00:16:16.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, no, that's right. There's a pressure when you're doing other people. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally get them. That's very fair. Um, as someone who enjoys card games, I, there's absolutely a different feeling when it is a single player game or just playing against computers and there is a different appeal. Absolutely. I get that 100%. That'd be great. It's not going to happen though. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

232
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.100
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So yeah, if that if I get to put in my vote that would be my vote a modern version of the TCG game by game

233
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.820
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>What would be your vote if you got

234
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:46.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>what I would want. I don't know. Popeye is coming out. That's all I want. But, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You know what? Uh, give us a new mystery dungeon because the last one I got was a remake. Yeah. So that's, you know, that's really easy. Yeah. It's been a minute. Yeah. Yeah. So give us a new mystery dungeon. Why not blowing your fruits? It's me.

235
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Sure, sure, sure, but like I'm talking about like a remake or a new game in a series that hasn't had one in a long time

236
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, it was yeah, and that's I'm not being like four years. I think hasn't it 21. I think it was

237
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.480
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I still haven't played that

238
00:16:46.000 --> 00:17:16.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It was a flavor, a specific flavor. So I, it's hard to, I don't know. You would let get enough. I'm going to guess no. I mean, because it's roguelike, first of all. And, and it has the big problem. Yeah. Yeah, it was. And it, it definitely has the big problem. You, you don't like where you die. You kind of lose all your progress. You can kind of salvage it gives you an option in some games. But, um, the, the momentum killing is kind of bad.

239
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.279
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, well, it was roguelike before the rogue, before roguelike was big, right?

240
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.119
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>what's really funny is I didn't I didn't know it was a roguelike until like a year ago or something

241
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:46.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Um, but it's also Pokemon. Oh, my goodness. Oh, that's amazing. Oh, yeah. But, uh, yeah, Pokemon. So wander stops. Good thing got it before Pokemon because all this is coming out.

242
00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and I found it out it was such a big surprise I was like I can't believe it's taken this long

243
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>for me to find out that the mystery dungeon games are roguelikes what is

244
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>madness

245
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:47.160
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, well, it well exactly I was trying to decide what what because part of the problem is I've got a whole bunch of games

246
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm trying to get through this year

247
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Yeah.

248
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.779
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and I was like I'd finished Sunset Island

249
00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:57.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Nearly a week ago. I think was when I messaged you saying I'm finished it

250
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.839
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Mm-hmm.

251
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.380
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And there was like I've got time now

252
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But I don't want to play another farming game that I'm gonna cover on the podcast because

253
00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:06.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Then I'll just forget all about...

254
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Before I actually record a podcast, because obviously it's not going to be the...

255
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You know, listeners don't know, you know it's not going to be the next podcast, right?

256
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

257
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So it's going to be at least two weeks until I would talk about it.

258
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And the next game I'm going to play for the podcast is a very short game.

259
00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:21.859
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

260
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So it's like I do not want to do that.

261
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And then the next one would be like even further in the future, so I don't want to do that yet.

262
00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:26.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah

263
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I was like, but here's the game that I want to play before the end of the year.

264
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But I'm probably not going to do a podcast on it because we've already done a podcast on it.

265
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.640
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. It is. That's it. It kind of fits perfectly. And that's a lot. Absolutely.

266
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And so it's perfect timing.

267
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And it's about the right amount of length of time to be able to do it before ZA.

268
00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:51.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Mm-hmm. Yeah. There you go. All the signs pointed to playing it good for you.

269
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I was like, everything's aligned. It's finally time and it was on sale.

270
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:02.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All right, that's what we've been up to. Let's, oh, oh, and you go. Go for it.

271
00:18:54.519 --> 00:19:00.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay. Wait. One small thing I forgot to mention. I had a terrifying, it's not even something I did,

272
00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:03.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>just a feeling I experienced.

273
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The other day that terrified me out.

274
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Hold on, wait. Let me see. What did year did this come out?

275
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

276
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Depends what this is

277
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay. This game came out in 27.

278
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.859
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, it's a game. So it's not but it's not about the Simpsons doing a second film then 20 years after the first

279
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, it is not.

280
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No. Which is wild. But, okay.

281
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Did you hear? Did you see that?

282
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Somebody, I think I was in the discord chair that I forget somebody from one of the Simpsons.

283
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I talked about how they didn't think they'd be doing another movie.

284
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And then, like, two days later, they know.

285
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.700
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, yeah, it was Nancy Cartwright, he'd said it on our podcast. Yeah, it was very fun. Amazing timing. She was like, I don't even know what you would do.

286
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

288
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:53.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's like, yeah, okay, like I get that, but also that's why you're not a writer. That's why you're a voice actor, right? Like,

289
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

290
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

291
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Also, that means she didn't know about it.

292
00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:04.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I also find it funny that people are like, who are even who's even asking for this. And I'm like, you realize the Simpsons is still going because people still watch it, right?

293
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:22.640
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>yeah it's yeah it is still a cultural you know milestone icon it's it's it's yeah

294
00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:06.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>like it does good ratings it's going

295
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:35.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>to do well like it's not going to be the best film the highest grossing film of the year and anything but it's going to do well like what are you talking about exactly I am I am also still doing my Simpsons watch through I don't know if I've mentioned this on the podcast or not but I I am watching one episode of the Simpsons every week every weekday and I've been doing it now for nearly two nearly two years I've been doing it for now.

296
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.400
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, that's a good pace oh my goodness

297
00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:37.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I have

298
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.240
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's the perfect thing is depending on when it comes out the film and it comes out in 2027

299
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:49.799
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But it might be just after I've like I don't think we have a date for it. Oh, no, we do. We do have it. Let me double check

300
00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.799
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I'm not talking in

301
00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:53.640
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Concepts, okay, yeah, wait, no

302
00:20:55.279 --> 00:21:04.759
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay, so it comes out in July 2027 that will have come out that will come out four months after I finish watching all of the Simpsons

303
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh my god.

304
00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:06.839
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Assuming.

305
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:24.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Assuming that they do do a season 38 because obviously they're doing season 37 just now, so I will finish season 36 at the end of next year that will be December next year and then January 27 will be season 37 February will be season 38 and then the film.

306
00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.359
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

307
00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.519
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

308
00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.319
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

309
00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:24.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

310
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:37.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, I don't know whether season 30 we finished by then or not it depends when when it's finished but point is I will just be almost to the month like just a couple of months out from finishing perfectly on time to what.

311
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

312
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.799
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There you go. You will be the most ready human being in planet Earth for that's great.

313
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Then you film.

314
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:49.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, anyways, what I was saying though, that's okay. No, that's that's crazy. You know what's crazy

315
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I've never actually seen like a maybe one for a set of

316
00:21:55.319 --> 00:22:00.839
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I maybe I should do what you're doing. Double up on it. I don't know. Anyways, but I was gonna say the

317
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>2017, eight years. Eight years.

318
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:30.099
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Not once have I ever said to myself that I want to play Fortnite, but it happened the other day out and I'm scared. I'm probably not going to, but I looked in its general direction for once and it is absolutely I was playing on PlayStation and I go to the home, you know, the menu or whatever, you know, there's like the news articles or like news related to you and I see

319
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is this K-pop demon hunters?

320
00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:32.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Contrix under the fortnight and I'm just

321
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:46.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>screaming oh that's that's a good get I'm yeah that's a good get

322
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I've seen a lot of videos of it.

323
00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:51.759
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It looks like very satisfying weapons to use as well.

324
00:22:50.500 --> 00:23:07.220
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>yeah yeah it works absolutely yes it's right

325
00:22:51.759 --> 00:22:55.359
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I totally get, it's such a good thing

326
00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:57.240
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>to do for them to do a collaboration.

327
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because sometimes it's like, oh, OK, right, fine.

328
00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:01.799
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You've got Darth Vader, OK.

329
00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:04.519
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Congratulations, do we care, right?

330
00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:06.160
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But then sometimes you've got a film which

331
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.759
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>is like one of the biggest films of the year.

332
00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:11.720
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It is the biggest Netflix film ever.

333
00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.720
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>people love it. And it's it's

334
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:34.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>animated, so they fit in perfectly. And their whole thing is combat. Like it just all comes together and it is genius. And you know, you know, this they I as much as Netflix probably had faith in this film doing reasonably well because they obviously paid money to get it from Sony.

335
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.339
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Yeah.

336
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

337
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>They I suspect they never expected to be big enough that it would go in Fortnite so you know someone's been rushing to get this done.

338
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.240
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughing]

339
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:56.259
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, they've said like after the movie's success, they're like, we are rushing to get spinoffs and the nurse going or whatever, but yeah, they got that really fast actually kind of looking at the timing.

340
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.240
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughing]

341
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes, it's impressive

342
00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:09.339
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Zane. So yeah, I will probably not play for tonight, but I'm thinking about it, and I'm very uncomfortable with that feeling because that's that's a good one.

343
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.720
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>fair enough. It's been a while since I've looked at Fortnite and gone, okay, I'm interested.

344
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:25.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm good. Let's talk about stuff that type.

345
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:26.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Again, I'm not going to play it. But yeah, okay, I see the, I see it again. Alright, we've,

346
00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:32.759
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>we've got, I know what you released last month. A relatively short list for September. We

347
00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:39.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>have four releases. We have little witch in the woods released 1.0.

348
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Good for them. 1.0. Yeah.

349
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:46.200
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>We have slime rancher to released 1.0, which I hate so much. She really should be 2.0. It's

350
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:55.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>slime rancher to 0.0. And then obviously we got star birds early access. And we got voyages

351
00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>We talked about that.

352
00:24:55.559 --> 00:25:07.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>of, we did. And we got voyages of narrow early access. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's

353
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Call me when that starboard says 1.0, then we'll be talking.

354
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I hope.

355
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that, that's September. Um,

356
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:26.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know this one at all. Cool. Oh, that's a Moana. This is, we get Moana at home.

357
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It was a cooperative survival crafting game where you must survive a magical ocean world

358
00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>brimming with lot spirits and deadly monsters.

359
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.480
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's a Moana, yeah, it's the Moana, yeah, yeah.

360
00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:37.319
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, okay. That's Moana now. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Probably, it is a pretty

361
00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:34.839
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm sure that was farming in it somewhere otherwise I probably wouldn't have been on the list,

362
00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:35.799
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>but it looks gorgeous.

363
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:52.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>little bit. I'll say that. Power farm. Yeah. Oh, I, I have in fact played power.

364
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.640
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Um, yes, tell me Kevin, I've talked a bit about Power Farm on the podcast.

365
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.160
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Tell me your thoughts, please.

366
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, remain me, you have played Power World, right?

367
00:25:50.839 --> 00:25:51.799
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes, good, right.

368
00:25:52.920 --> 00:26:06.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Um, I'm, yeah. There's farming in power. Right? Yeah, there is. You grow crops. Yeah.

369
00:25:55.079 --> 00:25:56.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You're trying to figure out where to start.

370
00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:02.839
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is there now?

371
00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:07.859
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'm pretty sure it's been a while.

372
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.900
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>to be done wrong, but no, I'm pretty sure you have farm and you're the pals maintain it.

373
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.900
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, because you have ones that water it absolutely.

374
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.099
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay.

375
00:26:14.099 --> 00:26:14.299
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

376
00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:15.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There is farming, right?

377
00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:25.299
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So like Power World is, you know, sandbox, survival, Minecraft ish sort of a game, right?

378
00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:27.700
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Crafting and building and surviving all that stuff.

379
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yep, and you catch the the the pals to like do automation and stuff for you

380
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.799
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So, you know, yes, you do.

381
00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:38.019
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And you can, you know, you level up your skill.

382
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.839
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Tree and you, you unlock new recipes to make automated, you know, automate more stuff

383
00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:44.759
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>and whatnot.

384
00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:52.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So the bones of many cottage, cord systems, farms, systems are, it already in power.

385
00:26:52.599 --> 00:27:01.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So it's not entirely crazy to see a game like this, but like the, it's two things, one, they're

386
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:07.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>just really leaning into it and both good and bad, because this is animal crossing

387
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>you took those files right from animal crossing.

388
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But it makes sense, I guess.

389
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>We never really had the pal's.

390
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:36.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And it also, it also doesn't, it correct me if I'm if, if you disagree, but it doesn't feel like they've just taken power world and made it a farming sim. It looks like a different game. Like it looks like it's got the same sort of, you know, models and textures and stuff, but it look, it doesn't just look like take that engine, throw farming into it.

391
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Mm-hmm.

392
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

393
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:29.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

394
00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:31.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

395
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

396
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

397
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, yeah.

398
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Absolutely.

399
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, absolutely, it is a different schedule.

400
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And they are building this from the ground up for a different experience.

401
00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:50.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So yeah, I'm just, I guess I'm kind of surprised to see it happen, but it makes sense

402
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:54.460
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>when you glist out all these elements, right?

403
00:27:54.460 --> 00:28:00.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The down to the fact, you know, apping off other games, which, you know, I forget the developer,

404
00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>but they've done that several times.

405
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So sure.

406
00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Why not?

407
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Um, Parker bear. Thank you. Yes. Right. It, if it also speak.

408
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:11.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Pocket pair. Yeah.

409
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.759
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The success of power. Right. Right. Got spin off. This is crazy. Um,

410
00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:20.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>the one thing I will say, like, I'm glad to see they're not showing away from the dark,

411
00:28:20.079 --> 00:28:27.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>crazy elements that that power world is not afraid to go into. You either Russian or

412
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.539
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>- What would the Russian relay?

413
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:35.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>let? Yep, you can catch your roommate. There is. Oh, okay. So like in power world, you can

414
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>capture humans like you can.

415
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.180
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Well, they're not afraid to do some bonkers stuff.

416
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.579
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughing]

417
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:50.759
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I bring this all up because the key takeaway for me is that there is a non-zero chance

418
00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:58.240
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>we can marry a pal in this game, which would be right up their alley that wouldn't be

419
00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>surprised.

420
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.660
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, so, oh, it's bananas.

421
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.660
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Am I going to play it?

422
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.660
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know.

423
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>like, I just, I guess.

424
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:22.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'd need to see more of it. It's, it's more of a time thing, right? Just like there's a lot of other games. This one isn't like pocopia is is curb stopping this, you know, cottagecore building thing. But we'll see.

425
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:36.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's, it is wild. And there is an element of like, I'm not saying pocket pair is even necessarily a good developer like ethically or whatever.

426
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But just given all the legal

427
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>they have they're putting up with from Nintendo.

428
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.799
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'm, you know, good for them to keep sticking it to them.

429
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:56.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I mean, you know, is there anything ethical is there any ethical consumption under capitalism? Probably not. But that doesn't that doesn't mean that things aren't better and worse.

430
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, yeah. Yeah.

431
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:10.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And it doesn't mean that you can't, you know, root for someone who you think is being taken advantage of or is a root against somebody that you think is taking advantage of the system.

432
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

433
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's doing things that wouldn't necessarily hold up in court, but

434
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:28.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>definitely would scare away a lot of people, these sorts of things, and also a system in and of itself that you might feel shouldn't allow software patents as a concept in and of itself, right?

436
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yes, yep, yep

437
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:44.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like there are a lot of people that have that opinion, so I think it's totally fair to be like pro or anti certain companies, even if none of them are essentially

438
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:59.420
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah, the enemy of my enemy is my friend for at least today, right? Well, okay. You know, I, I have one. I don't, I don't remember if I hurry on the podcast

439
00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:05.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>when you talk about pal farm, but a question for you, Alan, do you think the timing of that trailer

440
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.700
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So obviously, they can't have known about

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>is enough to say that they definitely did it

454
00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:48.980
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>because these things happen.

455

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The fact that they were both working on farming games

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>at the same time is evidence enough that these things happen,

457
00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:56.660
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>right? We know that people do these things.

458
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.059
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is it surprising that two of, you know,

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is that surprising? No, obviously not.

463
00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:14.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Why would that be surprising, right?

464
00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:16.619
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like that's, that would be like being surprised

465
00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:21.740
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that Ubisoft made a breath of the world like in 2018, right?

466
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:37.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, good. But yeah, let's I'm also this I'm glad pal farm exists. Well, I play. I don't know. But I am glad this nonsense exists.

468
00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:24.140
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Of course it was going to happen.

469
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:47.700
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's fun to think about, and the A's pocket pair just a bunch of trolls who are also

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>game developers, maybe, it's hard to know, but I mean, I'm not complaining about that.

471
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.519

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But for some reason everybody just seems to know that they're releasing

535
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.639
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>on that date and I'm very confused as to how that is the case.

536
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughs]

537
00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:48.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So, okay, I don't know where this came from, I can't see a press release, there's nothing

538
00:36:48.559 --> 00:36:56.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>anywhere that I can see, but for some reason every game's news says it's releasing on

539
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The video just says wishless now.

540
00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:59.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that date, so I have no idea where the original source of that was.

541
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:09.059
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know who is, we're developing this because this is, this is like China specifically.

542
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It is a Chinese developer, I believe. They're called Seed Lab.

543
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.179
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I would assume so. Yeah, I see it. Yeah, you're right.

544
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:23.860
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>They've also released a game called By Phase, which is a 2D platformer. It looks fun.

545
00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:21.780
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't, I've never heard of that. Okay.

546
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:29.219
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I don't know what the deal is with this developer this game. It seems to be everywhere.

547
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, man, I don't know.

548
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:37.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It was in a direct, I think, and it just seems to like everybody's talking about it for some

549
00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:45.179
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>you know, it's, I know it, I'll say this, this one, you know, drinking game, take your

550
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.360
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, I found it. I found it. I found it. It's on Twitter. They've announced it on Twitter February 1st, 2026.

551
00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:54.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>shot. It does look cozy actually. Oh, there you go. Yeah, it looks like you're setting

552
00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:01.659
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>up a farm garden thing. Like, I don't know how to describe it. There's your building. There's

553
00:38:01.659 --> 00:38:04.659
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Like build that you're setting buildings to or like, expect.

554
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:12.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There's a lot in this trailer. There's a panda and a capavera playing PS5. I don't know why.

555
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. I mean, to me, the game very much looks like a 3D starchy-like.

556
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, there you go. There you go.

557
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:23.219
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And I guess what we'll need to see whether that turns out to be a good one or not.

558
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And we'll see.

559
00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:30.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm still a bit FA on the 3D farming games in general. We'll see how this one does.

560
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, the production quality looks high. We'll see that.

561
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:44.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>How crazy is it like China, you know, 10 years ago, China was still bootleg laughing stock, you know, video game world.

562
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And now they're kind of kind of taking over the market. It's kind of insane.

563
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.380
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>- Yeah, cool, 'cause I was black myth with Kong

564
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>as a Chinese game, isn't it?

565
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it is.

566
00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:58.219
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And that was up for a game of the year, like.

567
00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it was.

568
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.099
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I mean, we got Mahoyo. We got a nanta.

569
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>All right, what's next?

570
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.719
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All right, next we have ages of Kateria have announced that their early access is coming on the 5th of November

571
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, remember the fifth and November.

572
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.360
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, my son's birthday

573
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There you go. Good. Good day to have birthday, kid.

574
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I Fox day.

575
00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:25.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I I think I kick started this one

576
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I do like look at this game. I think

577
00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:36.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>What I think it looks more it's I think it's more management style

578
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.159
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But I like the idea of like kind of building up a village throughout the generations, which is what this does

579
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

580
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.639
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And although it is more management style that does seem to be

581
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:56.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You can control individuals and like I've seen a bunch of many games for example and you do seem to be controlling some people sometimes

582
00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:04.940
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. All right. They got a big roadmap, though. Like, there's, there's some stuff in here.

583
00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:00.280
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So we're interested to see how it goes

584
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:13.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I would thought would be in their release, but okay. I don't know. Trading, chatting, those kind

585
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:28.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. Okay. Next we have Harvest Moon Home sweet home, apparently. So this is the one that was

586
00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:19.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>of seem important in my opinion. What? Hey, good for that.

587
00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:36.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>released on iOS and Android last year and is now coming to consoles and Steam called the special

588
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:40.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

589
00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:40.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>edition because the new version has updates to it.

590
00:40:41.000 --> 00:41:11.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>has apparently said that the update is coming to the mobile version on the same day as the game comes out October the 30th, but I can't see anything about that on the internet. I have Googled for this. I do as well. I just also want to see it from someone else. I don't know where they got it from. Yeah, I know. And that annoys me as well.

591
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.300
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay. Oh, that's nice.

592
00:40:54.019 --> 00:40:55.619
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I trust FOGU.

593
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.739
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Never stop Sarabee.

594
00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:06.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Never stop Sarabee.

595
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:41.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't know if they don't know whether it is going to cost anymore or not. That hasn't been announced, but apparently it has been announced that the update is coming, which is good. The special edition is more expensive than the mobile version. So one would assume that the update would cost money, but it would be nice if it wouldn't just say. We'll see I guess.

596
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.400
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, I mean it's yeah, we'll see

597
00:41:41.000 --> 00:42:11.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Next, we have Disney Dreamlight Valley, the returned beasts castle update. It is out now and it brings Lumière and Cogsworth. Cogsworth. Sorry from from Beauty and the Beast. Classic. Every single time.

598
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:06.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, then we're in the game already. Yeah, okay. Yeah, except this one beast in Bell were in the game like from the start

599
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:11.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I think weren't they then then this. Yeah, okay. This one's a little more valid

600
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. I think so. Certainly early on.

601
00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:20.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, no, because they needed to have return to Beast's castle. You can't do a return to Beast's castle without more characters from the film.

602
00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:17.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Sure, you guess so

603
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:22.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah fair enough that gloomy air looks great

604
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:34.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>all right cool I like I like beating the bass I like lumeer and cogsworth

605
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>uh, speaking of updates, Rusty's retirement has gotten autumn, uh, they're calling it a mini update.

606
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:45.360
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I think you could just call an update, right? Come on. Because this adds a whole, it adds,

607
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughing]

608
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Micro update.

609
00:42:45.159 --> 00:42:47.659
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughing]

610
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:52.480
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>oh, don't even start with that. This adds a whole new map, an autumn themed map. I feel like when

611
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:57.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>you're adding a map, it's legit to call it a normal, centralized update and also just call it an update.

612
00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:05.780
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of a big one. Probably okay, call mom with you.

613
00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:03.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's just an update. So.

614
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:10.480
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There is a new autumn themed map where mushrooms spawn randomly across the farm. The mushrooms

615
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>can be harvested by harvest spots, pumpkins and white pumpkins are jackal lanterns for the month of

616
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:26.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>October. 10 new berry bushes have been added. Well, exactly. Rusty will put on a special costume

617
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's cool.

618
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>This is a big list for a mini update.

619
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:41.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>on the day of Halloween and a bunch of other smaller things. So if you are

620
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Now, that's cute.

621
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>all into Rusty's retirement, go get out of retirement, go play the app.

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>question at term. And if it's a mini update, how much does the version number increase? How many

624
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh don't don't

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>decimal points? Yeah, that's, that's my mission.

626
00:43:57.079 --> 00:44:00.780
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You just look for ways to throw me don't you?

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's a good one.

631
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.980

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, that's theoretically a good one, but who on earth needs to craft up the 999 of anything.

635
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.400
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I mean, look, it's not going to be 999 most of the time, right, because you're not going to have the

636
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>stuff to be able to craft 999 of most things. So it's probably going to be like, you know, 30,

637
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I guess okay

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>but for most of the time, you can buy bundles of wood and stone instead of having to buy them

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, oh fine, okay

666
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I like, my bathtub is not particularly comfortable for bath,

667
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughing]

668
00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.260
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>so I'm not a bath guy.

669
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But I do enjoy baths, I'm sure the one was a kid.

670
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Our bath bombs worth it, I've never used it, I don't know.

671
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I, I don't get what the, as far as I can tell, they just kind of make it the bath fizzy and then smell a little bit.

672
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.219
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That and I think yeah, I roam. Yeah

673

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And then they, and then they make it a little bit weird color. I, I think they're just a fancy way of doing bubble bath.

674
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, basically I guess

675
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's like, do you want bubble bath, but also it's like a little bomb. So it just fizzes a bunch.

676
00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:34.360
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah easier bubble bath in a ball. Okay

677
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Do you want that? I don't want that.

678
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>What does tell us why we should care about bath bombs? Why do you like bath bombs? Do you like bath bombs? Tell us why.

679
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I mean, I

680
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Will say like

681
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:49.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>This is stupid because I know this is wrong, but they bath bombs look delicious. I'm like, oh, they're like delicious candy

682
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They quite often do.

683
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>hahaha

684
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So have you ever been into Losh and just looked around and been like,

685
00:46:56.599 --> 00:46:58.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

686
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I feel like I could eat everything in here.

687
00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah

688
00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:08.360
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Like dog is very cute, you know making a chicken plush is very hard because

689
00:47:09.239 --> 00:47:12.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>How are you gonna compete with the story of seasons chicken how you can't

690
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.719
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>a fair question. Firefly village have released a new update as well. These smooth moves

691
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, all right better than creepy pins

692
00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:23.719
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh

693
00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:28.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and fluffy friends update. So this adds two changes. This is the game that we talked about last

694
00:47:23.719 --> 00:47:25.719
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Hello

695
00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:35.639
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>episode. It adds two changes. One is a change to movement system. I booted up the game just before

696
00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:31.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yes

697
00:47:34.599 --> 00:47:36.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay

698
00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:38.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>this recording to test out because that was actually one of my complaints about the game

699
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>was the movement felt a little bit weird. It is

700
00:47:43.400 --> 00:48:12.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>better and worse. So it is better. It does generally feel better. So one of the issues that had with how the movement worked as it felt like it was delayed a bit. So when you took your finger off the button, you'd still move a little bit after you took it off, which didn't feel great. That's gone and the movement feels a lot more fluid, except Kevin it has the BDSP friction issue.

701
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.820
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I like that.

702
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:32.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I keep bumping into my scarecrows and stopping and I don't like it. I don't like that at all. It's too sticky. The scarecrows are too sticky. Not great.

703
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Uhh, sure.

704
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.239
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Uh huh.

705
00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:34.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's there. Yeah. Okay. Well, well, that overall, that sounds like a net positive,

706
00:48:34.639 --> 00:48:37.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>like that sounds like an easier to deal with. Yeah.

707
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:45.820
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>it is definitely an positive. The problem with specifically the scarecrows is that you don't get to choose where the scarecrows go.

708
00:48:45.820 --> 00:49:03.739
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>They are in a specific place on the farm, but they are in a, so if you go from a straight line from the barn door to your door to the exit of the farm, that's one straight line, and right smack bang in the middle of that are the four scarecrows.

709
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:50.019
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Mmm. Mmm.

710
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughs]

711
00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

712
00:49:00.639 --> 00:49:02.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh. (laughs)

713
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.880

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You constantly, constantly walk right next to them.

720
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. (laughs)

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And the problem...

722
00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>All but not now.

723
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:20.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[Laughs]

724
00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:16.639
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That becomes a measure of how good you are at the game.

725
00:49:16.639 --> 00:49:20.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, how well did you add the muscle memory to avoid that scare?

726
00:49:20.079 --> 00:49:23.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughs]

727
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I mean, the good thing is I'm not going to be playing the game anymore.

728
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Unless they add stuff.

729
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because the only other thing they've added is bunnies.

730
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>They've added an animal, the bunnies.

731
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:32.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Which, as fun as they are, they give...

732
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You add them like the chickens and the cows.

733
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Cows and they give you

734
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:45.380
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Fluff is apparently what they give you it sells for money, but like I've already done everything in the game

735
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay

736
00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.059
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I don't need to sell for more money

737
00:49:45.519 --> 00:49:47.719
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, sure

738
00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:51.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I went in I bought my three bunnies and I went great done. I've done it all here

739
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.860
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's nothing more to do there

740
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:59.780
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So it's not a particularly big update. I think it's weird that they added in the bunnies as well as it's like

741
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't know what's happening here

742
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:07.519
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Did they have more plans for other updates and I feel like it would even better to kind of put them together in a bigger up

743
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.780
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Update if that is the plan and if it's not the plan

744
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.280
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

745
00:50:11.739 --> 00:50:15.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Why are you adding bunnies in I'm just I'm fairly confused

746
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.679
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's like sometimes creators just have the whim.

747
00:50:20.699 --> 00:50:22.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Fair fair

748
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>They have that dream.

749
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I'm going to assume that they have more plans for other updates

750
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:33.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because it's it's been a month and a half since the game came out and I think that's their first proper update

751
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.980
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>other than just like bug fixes

752
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting

753
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:47.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Hmm, well, okay, you know the the buttons one thing but the movement like I think that's not just a great update

754
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:53.539
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But it's a good sign. They're they're working on it even from like the very core issue. So that's cool. Good for you

755
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes, yes

756
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.679
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, of course listening to listening to feedback improving the the experiences a good thing

757
00:50:56.679 --> 00:50:59.780
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I think it's just like if you have more features planned

758
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:04.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I would bundle them together because I don't want to I like I don't I only

759
00:51:04.199 --> 00:51:07.599
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Bit it up the game because I wanted to see what it was like so I could talk about it on the podcast, right?

760
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

761
00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:12.519
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like if I wasn't talking about in the podcast, I wouldn't a bit up because there would be no point there's nothing to do

762
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.300
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's very fair

763
00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:15.099
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, you got to wait for the two point over them

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>it's pretty much fast travel. Maybe this is fast, fastier travel. Alright, now it's time to get

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, well, up till now, it's just being Kevin trying to do it deliberately, whereas now it's like I'm actually going to get annoyed about this, right?

808
00:54:05.639 --> 00:54:16.519
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Carl Island, what are you doing? They are, ah, this annoys me so much. So the one point, okay, you go then.

809
00:54:11.739 --> 00:54:19.659
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, wait, wait, I want to read the two, no go, I just say 1.03 update, being splinted to two,

810
00:54:18.679 --> 00:54:26.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The 1.3 update is being split up into two updates. And instead of releasing 1.3, but with less stuff,

811
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>they are releasing one point to be

812
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and then one point three because they realized that they wanted to get stuff out earlier fair enough the 1.3 update was getting too big

813
00:54:37.079 --> 00:54:42.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But don't don't do this like just release 1.3 with what you want to have what you're having it

814
00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:49.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Right because what they're doing here is they're going oh, we don't think we'll get everything we want done for 1.3 in the timeline that we want to get 1.3 out

815
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:54.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But we still want 1.3 to have all of the things that we said it would have in it

816
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[laughs]

817
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So at like this isn't nobody's gonna look at this

818
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.119
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>single oh 1.3 is coming later but it's fine because I get some of the

819
00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:07.099
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>features now no they're gonna go I want the kids to grow up that's the feature

820
00:55:07.099 --> 00:55:12.280
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that I cared about and it's not coming yet like so just just change the scope of

821
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay.

822
00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:17.639
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>1.3 release 1.3 and then add those other features into 1.4 it is not difficult

823
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:17.900
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Look.

824
00:55:17.639 --> 00:55:29.719
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>1.2 b is a stupid version name don't do it oh yeah

825
00:55:21.699 --> 00:55:27.099
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>My favorite part of this is that the first part of 1.3 is actually 1.2.

826
00:55:27.099 --> 00:55:30.300
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>[Laughter]

827
00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:32.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, I will say this.

828
00:55:32.599 --> 00:55:35.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I get the logic because looking at the list of the updates,

829
00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:39.400
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>they're adding a haunted house in 1.2B or whatever, right?

830
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>They want that out before Halloween.

831
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's the reason they're splitting.

832
00:55:42.000 --> 00:56:00.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes, sure I agree. I am not I am not against them releasing an earlier version and then releasing the other stuff that they haven't got ready for this fashion into the next fashion. I'm totally fine with that the numbers what you doing?

833
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.900
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I can tell you, right?

834
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.900
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And that's fair, but like, just change the numbers.

835
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, oh

836
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.780
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>There's a jolly's see system coming out

837
00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:08.139
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Wait manual say what do you mean manual say it's not out. Okay. I

838
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.320
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Remember, I mean, Stardew doesn't have manual save, right?

839
00:56:09.139 --> 00:56:11.139
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Didn't know that

840
00:56:11.139 --> 00:56:17.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh my gosh, it doesn't I move what I didn't think about that yeah, I did I mean I

841
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.280
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Did you forget about that?

842
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You know, of all the things he's added in, he's never added in a manual save, he's still

843
00:56:21.239 --> 00:56:23.239
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Dang

844
00:56:21.559 --> 00:56:27.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>just to have the save on sleep.

845
00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.780
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Let's create, okay.

846
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:32.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All right, rant over.

847
00:56:32.079 --> 00:56:37.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Faith Arm, the drama continues, although I guess it's less drama now and it's more like

848
00:56:37.559 --> 00:56:38.559
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Good stuff.

849
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:54.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So now that faith farm has been purchased and we can debate whether or not the owners are good or bad, that doesn't be that as it may, the service for faith farm will continue to run.

850
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So that's good at least.

851
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:07.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it's launched in 2023. It's been that long that long two years. All right. I get mm. Okay. I

852
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.679
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The game's not on paper dead

853
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:20.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, and they've also said that they, uh, so they've said were committed to supporting and growing the community that has made faith farm so special.

854
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:32.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>This is just the beginning that are more announcements to come about the future of the game, which sounds like they have plans for updates, right? Because you don't say, Oh, we're keeping the servers open. And there are more announcements to come.

855
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Okay, yeah

856
00:57:33.559 --> 00:57:35.559
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

857
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:39.800
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And those announcements are we're going to shut down the servers, right? That's not what you do. That's not good.

858
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yes

859
00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:44.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, but okay, here's the question. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be real. I'm gonna be harsh for a bit

860
00:57:42.599 --> 00:57:46.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Burial Burial Kevin.

861

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Some games you're gonna wish the service and just close instead of getting updated

862
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Tushy

863
00:57:55.079 --> 00:57:57.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Look some people like this game

864

868
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:11.239
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I also got to walk up with a cold this morning, so if that my voice sounds funny, that's why

872
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:39.639

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>in space. When it says to Britannia, is that like...

875
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:53.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I've never seen the show. I don't I just know it exists. I know it has a large following. Don't ask me

876
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.360
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is that based on because like Britannia is this Roman name for Britain?

877
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, maybe I don't know like don't ask me

880
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.780
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Wait, it's as well. It's very definitely based on Britain. Let this look at his map

881
00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.579
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, okay, okay, there we go

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I mean like I'm probably not gonna play this game. I'm not vaguely interested in it, but

887
00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:32.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It was I was it there. I think it was the

00:59:47.219 --> 00:59:52.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm not gonna play it. I'm probably not gonna talk about it on the podcast, but here you go. It exists. If you caterbit this

893

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>However, the other new game, we have to talk about...

894
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.780
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Petit Planet.

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>which brings up lots of questions.

897
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:23.360
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, yeah. Okay, which I may be able to answer some. So, ask away.

898
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:29.320
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, so the first question I guess would be is this going to be a gacha game because that's what they that's what the that's what their expertise is, right?

899
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:34.820
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, no. There there is and to my no, I don't know if the first time I was gotcha. I'm

900
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:39.860
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>going. I'm going to say yes by default. I don't actually know, but I'm going to lean towards

901
01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Yes.

902
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.860
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And then I guess the next question would be,

903
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>"How do you do, uh, gotcha farming?"

904
01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:48.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Well, okay, off the top of my head.

905
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You're, it's, you unlock neighbors, basically.

906
01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:03.139
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I could see that that actually that I would be okay with that

907
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.579
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Right because I am fine with just not

908
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>not playing

909
01:01:11.539 --> 01:01:15.940
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But you know like if you took if you took animal crossing for example and instead of like the

910
01:01:16.659 --> 01:01:22.019
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Getting the villagers by going out and your thing on your little expeditions instead you just like

911
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>yeah

912
01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:25.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>paid money to speed up getting one.

913
01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I-I-I don't-

914
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:39.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I think that's-I mean, I-I'm not saying it's a good thing. It is probably not great because, you know, some people are gonna do it when they probably shouldn't, but like, there are worse things, I guess?

915
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

916
01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:50.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Realistically, people were paying for that anyway, because what they were doing was they were paying for someone who had it to get rid of them and then you could connect to their game and get them instead.

917
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I was about to say look at it just

918
01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:52.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Go back to the Raymond the meepo cards

919
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:56.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, well, exactly. Exactly. And people cards, that's a good point, and we will-

920
01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:56.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, okay, so

921
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:59.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>what cards was just this version of it paying for it, right?

922
01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, there you go. I mean, okay, here's the benefit, right?

923
01:02:03.039 --> 01:02:09.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Unlike other Mojo games if it's just cosmetic neighbors because obviously we're not combating or whatever

924
01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:15.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You know, it's not it's it's not influencing gameplay, right in the ZZ certain character

925
01:02:15.639 --> 01:02:22.239
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Just better and you got a pull for them or whatever here you're probably you know, not in a mess on any mechanics or

926
01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:27.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The neighbors won't be tiered by gameplay probably yeah, probably

927
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You never knew.

928
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I'm not saying they won't be tiered for other reasons, but

929
01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:41.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's interesting though, um, and I don't know it's what it's well because this was

930
01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Just shortly after Palafom, like everyone's getting in on-

931
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>cottagecore, it's crazy.

932
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:53.860
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, exactly. Are you surprised. Um, I can't figure out what this is going to be on.

933
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Uh, it probably, I'll tell you everything.

934
01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's gonna be everything.

935
01:02:57.699 --> 01:03:05.059
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay, because like the trailer doesn't say anything and there is no Wikipedia page for it and their their Twitter

936
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, no, I mean, no.

937
01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:10.739
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Doesn't say and their website is a dreadful website trying to do anything on that

938
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:16.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's cool. Hmm. I mean, they're gonna aim for mobile dude. Like my audio games from a while

939
01:03:11.699 --> 01:03:13.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>um

940
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:22.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But while that's the thing, is it just going to be mobile or is it going to be on because all of this seems to be like

941
01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.780
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Probably not

942
01:03:23.619 --> 01:03:25.619
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All the screenshots. I'm seeing Luke

943
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Uh landscape rather than portrait

944
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I don't think it's going to be just mobile.

945
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>They're, they are too dang big and they know that they know that they're going to

946
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>aim for everything.

947
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:44.199
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I can't, except for me, the latest game that just came out or it's coming out, I think

948
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:48.860
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. So the play test that they've got coming

949
01:03:44.199 --> 01:03:57.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>everything is on everything.

950
01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:56.860
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>up soon is on iOS and Windows. So we at least know two things that it's coming out

951
01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:03.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>on iOS and Windows. Interesting choice that those are the two things that they're doing

952
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>>> And it'll probably go from there.

953
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:11.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>the test on. It does see the test is only available

954
01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.380
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>on iOS and PC brackets windows. We will continue to expand an optimized platform

955
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:25.980
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>support in the future. So presumably it is then coming to other things. Yeah. It is very

956
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.059
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, if they're doing PC, it's gonna come.

957
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:31.579
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>interesting. I mean, in terms of like just talking about this outside of all of its other

958
01:04:31.579 --> 01:04:36.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>context, as our farming life simulation game, it looks fine.

959
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.199
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah a big part of the problem with a lot of mobile marketing it's hard to actually gauge

960
01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:47.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>what the game is like from the bit trailers they put out and that's very much true here.

961
01:04:44.000 --> 01:05:00.800
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes, there is there is a stop motion section they do which shows somebody like building up their little village and it does look very much like a you know, you would expect in the standard farming game life some game so.

962
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.440
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah, you're building paths, setting furniture, catching bugs, fences, gardens.

963
01:05:06.639 --> 01:05:11.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It looks like New Horizons but in Mohoyo flavor, that's all it is.

964
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:19.519
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I don't if it wasn't a high-virus game. I don't know if I would be interested in the game

965
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:43.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Hmm, no no it's fair. Yeah, it is fascinating. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I probably

966
01:05:20.639 --> 01:05:23.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Not because I like I've not played any high-virus games, right?

967
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.440
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I'm not interested in it for the lower of the characters just out of the fact that this is fascinating

968
01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:34.239
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Right the same thing with pal farm, right? I don't care about the pals. I don't care about pal farm in general

969
01:05:34.239 --> 01:05:38.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I care about it because it's interesting that this company is making a farming game

970
01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:49.460
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>will not play myself. Here's the thing on the hoyo verse, they usually don't cross-pollinate

971
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.739
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughs]

972
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:55.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>their properties as of right now. So, you know, I'm saying this with the big

973
01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.780
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>asterisk if they ever change that and say certain, I don't know, zenless on zero

974
01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:05.219
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>character show up and then I'll be the biggest sucker for this game, but it's

975
01:06:05.219 --> 01:06:12.099
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>just, I don't know. It's crowded space. There's a, I really playin' for copy up, man. That's what it

976
01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:16.980
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>boys down to you. I like that the dog guy is

977
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh yes, the other thing, I guess, if it is not a gadget game, does it cost money?

978
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because...

979
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's a good question cuz none of their games cost money right now, I don't think

980
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:29.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Exactly. So presumably, it's going to be one of the other, right?

981
01:06:26.679 --> 01:06:28.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh

982
01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:34.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I'm presumably. Yeah, I'm gonna guess what may it's yeah

983
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So many questions.

984
01:06:35.679 --> 01:06:40.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'm guessing gotcha or micro transaction heavy somehow. I don't know

985
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:45.639
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>probably, but I just am fascinated to what that looks like and how does the monetization

986
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.360
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I am too

987
01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:47.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>work in a farming game?

988
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:52.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep, you know, okay, what one thing I will say

989
01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:59.599
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'm trying to just feel out from the trailer like they're showing all these like small planetoids like Mario Galaxy planets

990
01:07:01.039 --> 01:07:05.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It would be cool if you could go to different ones build up different places, you know

991
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. So from what I what it my assumption based on the trailer is that these are other people's ones.

992
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, that's it. That might be it. That's a good point. Yeah. All right. That's fair.

993
01:07:15.519 --> 01:07:21.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because I'm going to like do do other hoverist games have like multiplayer stuff.

994
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Not really

995
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay, but if very much looked like they were going to someone else's thing there,

996
01:07:28.239 --> 01:07:35.719
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that it could be it that you know that that would be that would be a good angle like the first really multiplayer heavy

997
01:07:28.719 --> 01:07:30.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>like there were other there were other player characters.

998
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Muhoyo game. Yeah, that could work

999
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:44.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And then, and then you suddenly, you suddenly understand why they're doing a farming game if they wanted to make a multiplayer game. This makes sense as a multiplayer game.

1000
01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:48.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, it does yeah, I agree. Okay. Well, there we go

1001
01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:53.820
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, bye. So much. Uh, next week, we'll have four other new games to talk about. Um.

1002
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, I sick

1003
01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:04.219
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay. Now we're going to talk about Sun Z Island. Uh, I guess quick check on how these things are.

1004
01:08:04.219 --> 01:08:07.480
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I played and finished the game, Kevin, watch your status on

1005
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I played, did not finish, based off the upgrade pads, I think about it about halfway, but you know,

1006
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:22.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>fair enough. Yeah. Oh, well, yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely. It's, uh, yeah. It's a very clear

1007
01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:27.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I get the, I get the gist. Yep. What's your, wait, what's your playtime? That's important.

1008
01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:32.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>what you're wanting to do. Um, okay. What's my playtime? Let me check my playtime. I think

1009
01:08:29.159 --> 01:08:31.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I believe you said 13 hours roughly.

1010
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:41.539
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>so. Let me double check. Uh, yeah, 13 hours to 100% the game. Um, which is a thing. I mean,

1011
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:47.460
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it's a $10 game. It's 13 hour. You're in 10 13 hours. It's

1012
01:08:41.539 --> 01:08:43.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I like that sort of size of game.

1013
01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, $10 if you're buying it, Phil Price.

1014
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I mean, did you pay what what $2 for it?

1015
01:08:48.739 --> 01:08:53.140
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep. Yep. That's correct.

1016
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:58.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Was it? I paid zero dollars for it because for some reason I got it free like six months ago.

1017
01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:55.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

1018
01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:01.539
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No, I'm there.

1019
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't know how that happened.

1020
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I thought it was on sale for like 50% off went on to an apparently in the UK story.

1021
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It was free. It was very confused.

1022
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So I was like, okay, I'll buy this then.

1023
01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:17.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>you go. Okay. So the game is you are a cat. I think you have a name. I don't remember

1024
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:21.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't think that matters.

1025
01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:27.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>it, but a cat with a little sun like Pikmin style sunflower thing on your head. Every character

1026
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:25.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>>> Yeah.

1027
01:09:27.079 --> 01:09:32.100
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>has that. They're like, that's the lore of the game. Everyone's born with a little Pikmin

1028
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>flower on their head saying, "This is what you're going to do. You're going to be a carpenter

1029
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>or blanks made with yada yada, yada.

1030
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>the sun. I get that they're doing the sun equals farming but it just feels a little bit less.

1031
01:09:38.500 --> 01:10:08.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>yeah, you're going to be yeah, I think well that's a thing because in the little story you're like the last one to put because all these characters are coming off a tree basically and you're the last one to come out and nobody knows what yours is that's part of the question like what one on earth is that's supposed to be and you've caught them just as the village your little world has kind of deteriorated so you are now trying to

1032
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.359
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It makes less sense than the rest of them, I think.

1033
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:38.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>rebuild the town and village and whatnot and so in my opinion my interpretation is you're the son because you've now become the center of the solar system universe whatever you're you're bringing life and light to this place and helping you grow that yes, okay, just take it like one or two says for the same idea you're helping you grow yeah, okay, but all right so but that's the point you're

1034
01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:35.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh interesting. See I just I just did it as crops need sun. I'm very literal.

1035
01:10:38.500 --> 01:11:08.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>building up the island you know and let's get into it because it's a very to the point game oh that's a good idea I think overall I like it I give it a thumbs up the big winner is the art style right it's very cute like storybook sort of art style the presentations lovely the game runs well there's no

1036
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:52.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Alright, do you want to talk about it in general how you feel about the game before we get into the individual mechanic?

1037
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:38.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>vlogs or crashes that I've encountered and it again keeping in mind the price and the you know scope like I think it does its job well but you know I think like some overall issues like it's very grindy repetitive sort of stuff what about UL

1038
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.939
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>- Yeah, I think I'd mostly agree with that.

1039
01:11:30.939 --> 01:11:34.060
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Certainly in terms of the hundreds of farming games

1040
01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.100
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that existed is a more interesting looking one

1041
01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>graphically than many of them.

1042
01:11:40.939 --> 01:11:45.539
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The animations are quite simple, but it's okay, that's fine.

1043
01:11:47.779 --> 01:11:52.060
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I guess what I would say about this is it's fine

1044
01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.939
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and I had fun, but there was nothing

1045
01:11:53.939 --> 01:11:58.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that stood out to me as amazing or interesting.

1046
01:11:58.539 --> 01:12:02.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's just, it is what it is, I guess.

1047
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.140
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And I guess it's trying to do some things

1048
01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>in terms of your relationships with the other people

1049
01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:09.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and like you're talking to them and you get a little bit

1050
01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.939
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>of their story and then you do a little thing for them

1051
01:12:11.939 --> 01:12:13.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and then you get more of their story

1052
01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and then you're finished their quest line.

1053
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.979
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But I didn't find anybody's story interesting.

1054
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's the week part, the week is part for sure like the villagers are cute designs or whatever, but you get so little out of them.

1055
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. And they don't have a life outside of their shop. Every person that you get,

1056
01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.100
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And in a village based game, that's kind of fundamental.

1057
01:12:39.279 --> 01:12:46.720
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that you bring back to the island has a shop and they spend their entire time from the moment

1058
01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:53.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>you wake up to the moment you collapse on the ground in their shop. And you don't even really

1059
01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>talk to them directly. You're talking to them through the cash register. Like, you walk up to

1060
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.159
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>them and you can't do anything. You walk up to the cash register in the shop and you can then

1061
01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:08.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>click on that and either talk to them or buy from their shop. And so it very much feels like you are

1062
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:15.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>there as a prop. And if I'm going to talk to you, it's like kind of accidental through this feature.

1063
01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.119
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And once you're finished with your questline, you can't even talk to them after that. You can

1064
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

1065
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Which is really disheartening

1066
01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:32.159
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's kind of the the weakest point the the scope is our scale the game is limited and you can really feel those limitations

1067
01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:34.439
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>especially the villagers

1068
01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:39.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And I guess that's the problem as like yes, that is where it's weakest, but it's also where it tries to be strongest

1069
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because it's it's trying to do story

1070
01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:50.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But and realistically you've got to do something interesting to stand out from the crowd on these farming games, right?

1071
01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because there's so many of them now

1072
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't like

1073
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:55.979
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And so it tries to do that with story, but it doesn't really do it

1074
01:13:57.859 --> 01:14:03.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It dips its toe in the water and goes hey, we have story ideas and you're like, okay, you're gonna

1075
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.859
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Do anything with that? No, no, what I'm gonna do anything with that is weird

1076
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.600
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Nope. Like, I was labeling this in my head for a minute as probably the best cookie clicker ever made,

1077
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughing]

1078
01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.640
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>because well, let's get into some of the other gameplay, right? Because that's what's driving

1079
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:30.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>at the gameplay loop of collect resources, build an upgrade, a building. Like, the first, you have,

1080
01:14:30.279 --> 01:14:34.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>you know, you're standard, you walk around, there's a stamina system.

1081
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And pretty almost everything costs them, except picking up a few things.

1082
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.600
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, so yeah, so that's interesting that you say accept a couple things but one of those things is fishing

1083
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

1084
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Fishing doesn't cost stamina, which is weird

1085
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Fishing is weird cuz it also doesn't eat up time

1086
01:14:52.119 --> 01:14:57.640
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It does it doesn't you can basically fish infinitely in one day. It is such a bizarre way

1087
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You can't I

1088
01:14:58.199 --> 01:15:00.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It like you lose like you lose like two minutes

1089
01:14:58.279 --> 01:15:00.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Did that I didn't have to worry about money ever again

1090
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.439
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You lose like two minutes each time you fish and then other than that. It's so like you can you can go through so much fishing this game

1091
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:17.520
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, I like I when I did a ton of fishing like the first day or two and you know basically solve my money problem and have to worry about that

1092
01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:23.739
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, yeah. Oh, there is, there is no money problem in this game because as soon as you

1093
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.020
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But yeah, so you're

1094
01:15:23.739 --> 01:15:29.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>start getting animals, the money rolls in as well. Like if I, if I look, I currently in

1095
01:15:25.779 --> 01:15:27.779
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, that's true

1096
01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:40.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>my game, I have 290,000 money and there's nothing to buy. Right? Like things cost like 500

1097
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.899
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's correct!

1098
01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:46.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>to rebuild a shop. Right? Like it's not, and I have nearly 300 grand.

1099
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah.

1100
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:52.439
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Right? Like you're, you're, there's no such thing. Like it doesn't, it, money is not a problem

1101
01:15:52.439 --> 01:15:57.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>in this game ever. Like from the moment you start to the moment you end, you are never

1102
01:15:53.500 --> 01:16:05.739
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yep, stamina is probably the real kicker. I'd say especially in the first half of the game.

1103
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:33.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's the most limiting factor, you use a lot of stamina for a lot of things, not just early on, farming is brittle the whole time, it costs five stamina to water, and you start with a hundred stamina, and so yeah, our plant or pick is like five stamina, so if you have a full thing of

1104
01:16:07.699 --> 01:16:15.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, especially early on farming is brutal.

1105
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.319
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Or, Poe or Plant or Pick. Yeah.

1106
01:16:34.000 --> 01:17:04.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>far crops, that's the word, farming things, crops, let me double check how many it is in the...it is four by six or 24, so that is a hundred and twenty stamina just to water everything, and let me remind you, you start the game with a hundred stamina, you can't water everything! (laughs)

1107
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

1108
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's like this

1109
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, there you go, so it is

1110
01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:58.859
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, so you got to find food lying around the ground. Yeah

1111
01:16:59.539 --> 01:17:01.539
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's wild and

1112
01:17:01.539 --> 01:17:06.420
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'm jumping a little here, but the way farming works like if you don't water doesn't grow.

1113
01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's not gonna die, but it doesn't grow. It just sits there. So you have to water if you want to progress.

1114
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, yeah

1115
01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:17.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And so much of the game is so much of the story is progressed by the farming

1116
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:24.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like, you know, a lot of the things that people need for you to get them back to the island or to progress their story

1117
01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:31.239
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Requires you to farm things, which is fine. It's all tied together, right? Like it's it's all mostly fetch quests tied together

1118
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.220
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's quite a sense.

1119
01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.060
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Yeah.

1120
01:17:32.199 --> 01:17:34.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>with story

1121
01:17:34.199 --> 01:17:39.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And like, you kind of have to do everything a kind of similar piece.

1122
01:17:39.000 --> 01:18:07.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's to complete the game, which actually does mean that you finish the game kind of roughly similar in everything right I there was a couple of things that I had to like grind for at the end of the game, but because of how it's all tied together most of the things were all done at the same sort of time, because it gets you through all these features.

1123
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>- Yeah.

1124
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>it's like, you know, you're, you're.

1125
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You're first cooking will be because someone asks you for a meal and you're like,

1126
01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.239
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>oh, I can do all this cooking. That's, that's great. Um, it kind of,

1127
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. What's nice is it is, and I think part of it is you can see a lot of the big upgrades, you know,

1128
01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that is nicely tied together.

1129
01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>buildings and stuff. Like they show you what materials you're going to need. So as soon as you unlock

1130
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>them, you can just load up on them. And so you don't want to reach the next step of the quest. You

1131
01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You can just drop a mountain of resources and just upgrade all the way.

1132
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:44.939
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. I don't other kind of controls based things. Uh, I'm not a fan of how slow the walking is

1133
01:18:44.939 --> 01:18:50.060
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and like your toggle running and then running becomes the default speed. And I'm just like,

1134
01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:03.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. Yup. Yup.

1135
01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:54.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>why do they even have bother having two speeds? Why would you ever want the walking speed?

1136
01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.859
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's no negative to doing the running and it's a toggle. So you just like, you toggle on

1137
01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:02.779
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and then you're running. And then the only time you ever have to do it again is because you've

1138
01:19:02.779 --> 01:19:07.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>accidentally hit the button. And you're now walking again. It's such a weird thing.

1139
01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yup. And then you just get, it's just a frustration point. And something important. There's a,

1140
01:19:10.119 --> 01:19:16.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>you know, as most of these farming games, you have day, night, time, clock. And this is like

1141
01:19:17.079 --> 01:19:21.319
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>where it's going by real fast. You get a day done in, I don't know, a couple of minutes.

1142
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:29.479
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Because the clock is moving. So you can not afford to walk. It's not just the preference. Like,

1143
01:19:29.479 --> 01:19:35.880
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>you walk, you will not be able to do a lot in your day. I agree with you. It is kind of baffling how

1144
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>slow the walking is slash wide exists to begin with. Um,

1145
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:49.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So yeah, the first thing you do is you've got the gathering, you get wood from trees and you get stone, I think, it's been a week since I've played the game.

1146
01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:54.979
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it is with chop your, yeah, pick your stir rocks, chop your trees, get your wooden stone.

1147
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is it stone, is that what it is?

1148
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:04.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, and you use them to like you fix a bridge first and then you like build a, I can't even remember what the first shop is.

1149
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.479
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's the lumberjack and the blacksmith because they're the one who processed stuff because you get the raw wood and stone

1150
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There you go. Yes, of course.

1151
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:07.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah.

1152
01:20:09.659 --> 01:20:15.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But then you got to process something into bricks and you know like wood planks or whatever

1153
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah.

1154
01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:13.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah.

1155
01:20:15.399 --> 01:20:17.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point.

1156
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.279
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So you're, yeah. It's, it's a gathering and building thing to start with

1157
01:20:22.279 --> 01:20:26.640
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>certainly and then eventually you get to farming because I don't know about you,

1158
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.779
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>but I started the game and I was like, where, where's my seeds? How do I get seeds?

1159
01:20:29.779 --> 01:20:32.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>How do I do the farming? And they just randomly start getting them from

1160
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.319
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, yep

1161
01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:39.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>quests and it's actually quite late on that you build the shop that lets you buy.

1162
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>more seeds. And by that time, I had hundreds of seeds. Like I, I, I basically never

1163
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.560
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>bought it. I maybe bought like four tomato seeds because I needed them for one

1164
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>recipe that I'd mucked up earlier. That's it. You don't, I, I didn't buy anything

1165
01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:57.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>else, any other seeds because you keep getting the seeds.

1166
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.279
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the quests because that's the other driving factor like getting the quest right the rewards are very generous

1167
01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:08.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>They give you a lot of seeds. Oh my I agree

1168
01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.779
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I unlocked the herbalist the person sells the seeds and I haven't bought anything around me there

1169
01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:22.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And and that's and you know everything we've talked about this point build up a building do some quests and then that unlocks

1170
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.199
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You know an item. Oh, you know

1171
01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I think to keep our missing here.

1172
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:35.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You're on an island, right? So you have travel to other islands, that three collect different types of resources.

1173
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:40.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, it's very much like the the animal crossing islands, the way you travel to them.

1174
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And so... Yeah.

1175
01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:47.020
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's basically like that, except you unlock travel passes to the different islands.

1176
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Mm-hmm.

1177
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep.

1178
01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:51.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So you start off just on one island and after a certain time you get travel pass and you can go

1179
01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.779
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>to the next island and then you get another travel pass and you can get to the next island.

1180
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep.

1181
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. And...

1182
01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.539
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>That was an interesting way of doing that. It worked fine because it kind of like got you

1183
01:22:00.539 --> 01:22:03.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>because there would be no point in going to the next island because you could.

1184
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:19.020
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And you wouldn't have your your your pickaxe upgraded to the right point to be able to actually do it yet and you've got things still to do on that island. So it kind of felt like it was nicely guiding you through everything.

1185
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:44.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, absolutely. It was, yeah, the progression was intuitive, um, but, uh, but this is kind of the hard to get the game, right? Like this is why I call it like the ultimate cookie clicker case, you build up a building, you unlock a new island, maybe you go get the resource from the new island, there's a villager that you can having to move, but you have to go do a quest, so you do some farming.

1186
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>and then their quest reward will be a pass to the next island and rinse and repeat.

1187
01:22:49.000 --> 01:23:13.479
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I wish I had a little more flavor, a little more soul with the villagers talking with

1188
01:23:13.479 --> 01:23:17.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>them and interacting with them, not just all about the quests or whatever.

1189
01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, yeah

1190
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:23.659
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You mentioned the processing of items. Let's go back to that a little bit because there's a couple of weird things for it

1191
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1192
01:23:24.619 --> 01:23:26.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>first of all

1193
01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>it processes

1194
01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:29.779
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>real-time

1195
01:23:29.779 --> 01:23:36.100
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Where is the rest of the game doesn't so if you if you go to sleep

1196
01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:52.579
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. It is very weird. Yeah. Yeah, or or even in the menu, because how

1197
01:23:36.939 --> 01:23:40.859
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Nothing is processed in that time because you've been sleeping, right? It's like immediate, right?

1198
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>But if you pause the game

1199
01:23:43.739 --> 01:23:45.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And go away and come back

1200
01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:50.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It processes while you're paused because it's processing real-time

1201
01:23:52.579 --> 01:23:56.180
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>our works is you go to the menu, let's say the lumberjack, you go to the menu, and

1202
01:23:56.180 --> 01:24:00.420
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>there's basically a slot put in the wood plant, you know, the wood logs here.

1203
01:24:00.579 --> 01:24:04.739
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And then you see the bar filling as it's, it's selling them into wood planks coming out.

1204
01:24:05.619 --> 01:24:09.699
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You can stay in that menu and just watch the bars go. Time does not pass, like in that

1205
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:24.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. No. It's, it's, it's just really weird that everything else is based on the internal game clock, except processing, that what runs real time. I don't understand why it happens that way. But here we are.

1206
01:24:09.699 --> 01:24:18.020
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>menu, but stuff gets processed. Yep. Yeah.

1207
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.720
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, I don't know or better and for worse because you can use yeah

1208
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Weird.

1209
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, both. Definitely both.

1210
01:24:31.479 --> 01:24:33.479
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>What are you gonna do?

1211
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's also another complaint about process, no, I complained about processing. There's a button that allows you to.

1212
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:55.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>add. So if you press like the a bot, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So if you press the a button that adds one thing into the processing thing, if you press why it adds 10 and if you press X, it adds all of them, but it doesn't tell you that on the screen.

1213
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>What?

1214
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:59.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, I hate this.

1215
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:05.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The only reason I tried that is because that's the case for putting things into the chest. And I was like, Oh, I wonder if it does that in this menu as well, and it does.

1216
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:04.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>The chest, when you move stuff.

1217
01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:13.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I hate that you got.

1218
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And I find that right at the end of the game. So my entire 13 hours, I wasn't doing that.

1219
01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:21.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I've been mashing so much aid and put all those blogs in the lumberjack.

1220
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It was the most annoying thing about the game tapping a to get a hundred hundred rocks into this processing thing.

1221
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:28.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, my good.

1222
01:25:30.399 --> 01:25:31.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So terrible.

1223
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Okay, processing is fine other than that it's anything else we

1224
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.159
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>talk about farming we talked about the stamina thing being weird other than

1225
01:25:42.159 --> 01:25:47.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that is kind of fine right like you you tell the land you put this the seeden

1226
01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>new water and then eventually after a few days it grows. Oh I will say okay one

1227
01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>thing I really like about the game I love the designs of all the crops and the

1228
01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>animals they're all very unique I like how it did that.

1229
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, very stylized absolutely tomato pank. It's look a little gross. I will say but

1230
01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.920
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Overall, yes

1231
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:07.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>low pimples.

1232
01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:10.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, that's basically it. I don't like it

1233
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>[laughter]

1234
01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:17.039
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But my agree. Yeah, the the visual aspect is top notch in this game across the board

1235
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:24.300
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>um animals are interesting um have you done animals yet? I don't know if you're that far yet.

1236
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I was starting, too.

1237
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:31.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So you get them and the first day you don't do anything and they give you a crop the net

1238
01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:37.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>uh an output the next day but after that you have to give them feed you put feed in their

1239
01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:44.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>trough and then if you do that the next day they'll have their output great but see if you

1240
01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:49.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>forget to pick it up one day. It's gone the next.

1241
01:26:47.500 --> 01:27:01.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You can't pick it up the next day, but that means that you just lose that, right? Because then they don't have it for the next day either because you've not put the it's like they're eating. They're product, but it doesn't actually do anything because it doesn't give them another product.

1242
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.939
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh yeah!

1243
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Mm-hmm, which

1244
01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.300
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep

1245
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:15.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like it's just you just lose that day completely and you have to give them more feed and get the product the next day. It's really, I think this is this is I don't understand why it does that. I just forget that you have the thing there.

1246
01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.420
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Let's

1247
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, that's a little rough

1248
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>if you go to sleep.

1249
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:45.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You can then start selling that the product that they have and like within a couple of days you can buy another one and then it's like then a couple of days later you can buy another two and then a couple of the and you just it just exponentially increases the amount of money you have.

1250
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>have, it's wild how much?

1251
01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:59.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The animals give you like if I didn't need the crops for the cooking, I wouldn't have continued to farm because the animals are just such big money makers.

1252
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:04.939
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Um, and that's, that's kind of, uh, I think another

1253
01:28:04.939 --> 01:28:08.140
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>limitation of the game. Once you're kind of done with the resource, you

1254
01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:14.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>don't really need it for anything. So, you know, like, why ever go back to the

1255
01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.859
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>basic, what a rock. It would have been nice if there were, I don't know,

1256
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.579
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>like furniture you could craft or something, but, uh, I don't know, just

1257
01:28:21.579 --> 01:28:23.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Once you're done, you're kind of done.

1258
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Um, I don't think, I think we can have already talked about the islands and, uh, fishing.

1259
01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, we didn't talk about them any game.

1260
01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh, we didn't talk about fishing. It's it's stardew

1261
01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I hate it.

1262
01:28:32.659 --> 01:28:39.439
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's it is worse than stardew. It's the same idea of stardew of the bobber moving up and down and trying to stay on the fish

1263
01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:42.979
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But like the timing of it isn't great

1264
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:52.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The gravity is worse in this the gravity is lower so if you accidentally tap higher than the fish you're probably lost it

1265
01:28:46.579 --> 01:28:48.579
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

1266
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.020
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah

1267
01:28:52.079 --> 01:28:54.439
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You're not it's not gonna come down quickly enough

1268
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.739
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It is yeah, and it's rough

1269
01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:02.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it is aggravating a lot several fish because of that you you

1270
01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:08.819
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I'm out of hand. The the fish you mean to get like it's it's start to put worse because it's dead

1271
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.520
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like, like many things you get used to it, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it, right?

1272
01:29:10.539 --> 01:29:12.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

1273
01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.340
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I agree

1274
01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:17.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I got better at it, but I still wasn't enjoying it and one side caught every fish I was

1275
01:29:17.039 --> 01:29:18.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>done.

1276
01:29:17.939 --> 01:29:19.939
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep, that's correct

1277
01:29:18.039 --> 01:29:26.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I have a bunch of bullet points that didn't really fit into any of those individual sections

1278
01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.180
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Oh

1279
01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.180
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That last one's the last one.

1280
01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that I just want to go through.

1281
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>This one's a good one. Let's get to it.

1282
01:29:29.079 --> 01:29:34.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>So first of all, when you finish the game, this is spoilers.

1283
01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's fine. We'll live.

1284
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:42.359
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's like, you finish it, you grow the tree, and then it goes at like two pages

1285
01:29:42.359 --> 01:29:45.319
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>of story from the beginning story.

1286
01:29:45.319 --> 01:29:50.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And I can't even remember what it was, but it was like, oh, maybe we were here to bring

1287
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>the tree back, you know, like, uh-huh, obviously.

1288
01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And that's it.

1289
01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's nothing else.

1290
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like, nobody comments on the fact that you've done it.

1291
01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's no celebration.

1292
01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's nothing that's just, it's just it.

1293
01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>That's, that's, that's your done.

1294
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>No party!

1295
01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:04.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And because, and because this is on the switch, there's no achievements either.

1296
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like, how do you know you've actually finished the game?

1297
01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:09.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Tree's growing.

1298
01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:10.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Is that it?

1299
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Maybe.

1300
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't know.

1301
01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't know if that's it.

1302
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I think it's it.

1303
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.039
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm pretty sure that's it.

1304
01:30:17.039 --> 01:30:17.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I'm pretty sure it's done.

1305
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't know.

1306
01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:27.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>The menus don't support the D-pad and that's very annoying, especially as it has some weirdness

1307
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:34.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>in terms of if you open a menu and your analog stick was still slightly too

1308
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:50.560
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>way.

1309
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.239
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'll pick in the right seat. Yup.

1310
01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:55.720
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yes, you tell the land and you put in a seed and then you move immediately to the right

1311
01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and you press the button to put a seed in, but then it's still registered the fact that

1312
01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:03.640
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>you were very slightly touching the analog stick.

1313
01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>for it moves on to the second.

1314
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>you're on autopilot because you're like, I have eight tomato seeds that I'm trying to do here

1315
01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>and the tomato seed was the first one when I went to the last one so of course it will be the

1316
01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:24.119
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>first one when I go to this one as well so you tap a a a a oh wait no I just I just pumpkin in the

1317
01:31:24.119 --> 01:31:30.119
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>ground. How did that happen? Because I happened to be slightly touching the analog stick when I was

1318
01:31:30.119 --> 01:31:34.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>moving to the right, and I tapped the menu. It's a very annoying, I

1319
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:42.439
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>heated with passion.

1320
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:43.779
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, it's not great. I've many accidental clicks or selections in this game. It's not fun

1321
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:52.800
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>uh ba ba ba ba what else um oh yes so selling items uh go into what's called a chest right it's

1322
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:57.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>not a shipping container it's a chest uh which I feel like could be very confusing the first time

1323
01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:56.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah. Yeah.

1324
01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.840
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I did it I didn't know what I was doing I assumed it was going to sell them because it was sitting

1325
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.600
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>outside my house but there wasn't another chest except there was another chest is in a different

1326
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:22.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's in the position. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's one thing about the game. It has tutorials, but it's all inside a menu. You don't actually, it doesn't pop up to let you know anything.

1327
01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.420
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>building. There's a building with an actual chest in it where you store stuff.

1328
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:32.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So, you know, I don't know, because, you know, there's tutorials, you have extremes on both.

1329
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:56.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>And right, you have hand holding and everything to everything popping up. But then there's this where there's the toys. You want to go look at it. And hope it's nice to get a little guidance on some stuff like this, you know, but I don't know. I've never thought about it. I'm a busy man. I have stuff to do before midday.

1330
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.760
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. You can't sleep in the bed before midday. That's annoying. Why is that the case?

1331
01:32:56.319 --> 01:33:00.079
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, but then at the end of the game when you're trying to speedrun the last three

1332
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:08.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>cooking things that you haven't done and you're trying to get through seven days of growing

1333
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:13.359
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>ooh yeah who that's a good point

1334
01:33:08.479 --> 01:33:14.159
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>pumpkins. I don't want to do other things. I want to wake up watching.

1335
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.399
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>my plants and go to sleep, but I have to do other stuff until it's midday. Why midday, specifically,

1336
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:22.239
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>that's I don't know

1337
01:33:18.399 --> 01:33:24.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>what weird time? Why is it okay to sleep at midday, but not 11am? Like I would get if it was later,

1338
01:33:24.479 --> 01:33:33.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that's a weird time. Also, don't do it later. That's bad. The pause menu has two items, resume and

1339
01:33:33.199 --> 01:33:37.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>back to main menu. If you click back to menu menu, have you done that at all in this game?

1340
01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:58.220
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I have it more than once more than once, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1341
01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:43.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, accidentally pressed it. There's no confirmation. So you click it and you've lost your day.

1342
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.520
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And of course, as we mentioned, there are issues with the menu, registering movement when you

1343
01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.439
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>didn't realize you were doing that. I've done that so many times. I've lost most of a day because I

1344
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>just marked that up.

1345
01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:05.420
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Also like the visual part of it, like which a menu item you're selected, it's not

1346
01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:07.420
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Super Bowl like it makes a button lighter

1347
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:12.140
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>but like it's on a light of like wooden light brown background so

1348
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:17.439
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah. And also the problem, the problem so many, so many UIs do this where they have, oh,

1349
01:34:17.439 --> 01:34:23.560
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>the item you've selected is a different color. Okay, great. What if there are two items?

1350
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.520
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, like on this menu.

1351
01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:30.199
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Which, how, how do you know, how do you know which item is? Which color is the right color?

1352
01:34:30.199 --> 01:34:34.819
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>How, how you meant to know that? If you, if you've got three or more, sure, two of them

1353
01:34:34.819 --> 01:34:37.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>one color and one is the other color. But when you've got two eighths

1354
01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:45.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>them, how are you meant to know? I agree, 100%. And finally, my

1355
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You're up, yeah, be up.

1356
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.180
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>other random thought that didn't fit into anything. Why is there a letter box?

1357
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I love this one

1358
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:54.340
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>There's a letter box. I have never once. I have completed the game and I

1359
01:34:50.699 --> 01:34:59.779
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So you don't get anything? Oh, that's great. I love that

1360
01:34:54.340 --> 01:35:00.260
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>haven't once seen a letter in that letter box. I don't understand why there's

1361
01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:05.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>a letter box in this game. My only thing I can think of is there is a DLC for

1362
01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:07.220
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>This game, have you seen that?

1363
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.479
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I I got it. I am not touched it. You there's an extra island. I did not get a letter about the DLC

1364
01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, you did.

1365
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:17.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Oh, see, that was my question. I was wondering if that was, if that bit, okay.

1366
01:35:15.119 --> 01:35:17.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Nope

1367
01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:22.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>It's an island. Maybe if I go there I could get it. I haven't actually done anything with the DLC

1368
01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:26.600
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But I didn't even get any letter saying hey you get the DLC. No

1369
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:32.699
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Well, I don't know why there's a letter box in this game. I've not once had a letter and I've completed the game

1370
01:35:28.119 --> 01:35:30.119
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I don't know

1371
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.600
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's crazy

1372
01:35:32.699 --> 01:35:38.479
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I've I think I've hundred presented the game cuz I think you need to do everything like you have to have all of the

1373
01:35:39.979 --> 01:35:43.979
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All of the fish all of the plushies all of the

1374
01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.020
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Bugs all of the

1375
01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:55.619
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Artifacts all of the cooking meals meals. There's the word. You have to have all of them to grow the tree

1376
01:35:55.619 --> 01:35:57.539
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I don't think there is anything else you could

1377
01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:08.140
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>can do in the game so I think I have 100% of it and I haven't had a single letter.

1378
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

1379
01:36:08.399 --> 01:36:10.399
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't know

1380
01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:18.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Nah, that's it. Like there's a lot of great things. You've heard we got a list of stuff that's questionable

1381
01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:22.079
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Aggravating at times, but and the bigger thing is like

1382
01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.960
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>You know, you wish you could interact the villagers make it feel like an island more. You know the

1383
01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.680
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Not just hey go to the next

1384
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>quest or whatever, but that's kind of what it is.

1385
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.840
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>So it's a shade too because it looks it's such a beautiful art style.

1386
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:43.239
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, I don't know. I can't tell whether we're coming across a positive or negative about this game

1387
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, like I

1388
01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:50.800
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Look I paid zero pounds for it and I had a lot of fun for that money

1389
01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:56.520
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>You paid two dollars and it sounds like had more than two dollars worth of fun out

1390
01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:00.380
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Absolutely yeah, even you pay I would pay full price for this game

1391
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.579
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I think I'd be okay with that. It's not a bad game by any means

1392
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:09.979
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>But is it for everyone? No, I don't know. I just look at it. I guess

1393
01:37:10.659 --> 01:37:12.659
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>See if you want it. I don't know. I did

1394
01:37:13.659 --> 01:37:20.180
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I don't want it. I'm not saying I'm not recommending it, but am I gonna recommend it? No, I guess if you want like you said, it's fine

1395
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:31.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>I mean, I think what I would say is if you are looking for a small, short farming game and

1396
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.359
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, do you like those checklists number go big yep like

1397
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.920
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>you don't care about characters, this is good for you.

1398
01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:42.500
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>If you like characters, play Firefly Village, who is talking about last week, I think that's

1399
01:37:41.479 --> 01:37:48.800
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yep, yeah, I again back to my label best cookie clicker for me

1400
01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.779
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>better for characters.

1401
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.979
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I don't know what else is it yeah, yeah

1402
01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:57.460
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And yeah, it's fun. I enjoy it. It's not going to be my game of the year, but I enjoyed it.

1403
01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:05.060
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>All right. Thank you, Kevin, for joining me to talk about this game. Is there anything you would like to say to the audience?

1404
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Thank you. Oh

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, I don't know I'm not doing anything interesting. I'm fine. I'm good. Thank you. I

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>I'm very bad

1409
01:38:15.859 --> 01:38:17.619

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:25.680
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Red Sonja to finish off the list of... and it is fine. You know, I will say we talked about the fact

1423
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.960
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>that obviously she's in the comics is quite a...

1424
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:39.239
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Melgate's designed. Yep. Yeah.

1425
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.880
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>a bit of bare bodied, shall we say, not a lot of coverage.

1426
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:44.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>They do a joke about that in the film where she's given basically the size of thing that she gets in the comic books and she's like,

1427
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>"Am I really meant to be waiting this?"

1428
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:58.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And then later on she gets to select a different item of clothing and it's because she complains about how little coverage it has for not...

1429
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It's not about, like, looks, it's about...

1430
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:11.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Because obviously she's fighting, that's her thing, and she's complaining about how little protection there is, but when she gets another thing to replace it with, it has almost no more protection.

1431
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah

1432
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:27.000
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>It is almost the same. It's maybe got, like, an extra, like, two centimeters at the bottom of the bikini, and it's bizarre how they're, like, self-aware about the clothes, but then don't actually do anything if to fix it.

1433
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah, yeah, that's great. I love it. Good times.

1434
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Let's make a joke about it because we're aware, but they're not actually interested.

1435
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:51.100
<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Yeah, so it was it was fine when I was completing the superhero films. I don't think it was it would never have cropped cracked the top three that we talked about, but it's probably better than Henry Danger for me.

1436
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>Yeah

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like, what are you doing? That's madness.

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>>> Yes, yes, right, right, that there you go, that's the exact comparison point, right?

<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>That's Pokemon saying, okay, the finals, specifically the finals, they're going to be pay-per-view.

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>And if anybody could do it, Pokemon could do it, but I don't think Pokemon could do it.

<v 9988BDFC-B6ED-4D3B-A5B7-1F125440FD37>Like, that's just especially with the negative PR and like, oh, my word.

1476
01:43:01.159 --> 01:43:04.760
<v 0A4DA4E1-7152-42B5-B23C-54940DE0E743>>> Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
