(56s) **Kevin:**

> You know, you ever think about like what celebrities play cottage cards?

(1m 2s)

> This is just a random thought, but like, you know, Danny Trejo is a big animal crossing fan, right?

(1m 7s)

> Like, I want to know who else on the upper echelons of celebrity society are into it.

(1m 16s)

> You know, how can we make our way there?

(1m 17s)

> Just tailor swift and enjoy patience.

(1m 19s)

> I just want to know, we need somebody to blow us up.

(1m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, that's that's one one way of thinking of things. I'm sure there's there are ones

(1m 31s)

> Yeah

(1m 34s) **Kevin:**

> That's the thing, that is where we get big.

(1m 36s) **Al:**

> Don't blow us up. That's illegal

(1m 41s) **Kevin:**

> You know, let's talk about Sunsea Island, because there's a celebrity out there who wants

(1m 44s) **Al:**

> Yes. Yes, this, this episode, this, this episode we are going to talk about some seed Island,

(1m 45s) **Kevin:**

> us to talk about Sunsea Island.

(1m 47s)

> So let's ready. That's dead.

(1m 53s) **Al:**

> because we are zooming through as many games as possible before the end of the year.

(1m 58s)

> Well, no, not before the end of the year, before Pokemon comes out, let's be honest,

(2m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, which Pokemon there's a lot of Pokemon going. Yeah

(2m 2s) **Al:**

> seeing what we can do.

(2m 6s)

> Before ZA comes out.

(2m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's fair

(2m 10s) **Al:**

> before that we have a bunch of news and it's not even all the news there's a few people

(2m 14s)

> news I didn't add in because I mean we need something for next week and I don't want to spend an entire day talking about all those news so but there's still a lot of news before that I'm gonna ask Kevin if he has any thoughts on

(2m 18s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(2m 28s) **Al:**

> Powell Farm before that we've got I know what you released last month but first of all Kevin what have you been up to?

(2m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. I mean, okay. Well, I've been up to Sunset Island. I played that game. I did actually.

(2m 43s) **Al:**

> don't say I'm so convinced

(2m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. I mean, I did. We'll talk about that. But I've been going through Shadow of the Hedgehog.

(2m 53s)

> Man, that game's that's a good game. I mean, yeah, I know you know it's a good game.

(2m 57s) **Al:**

> Son is that Sonic egg shadows that

(2m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah sorry shadow generation. Yes, not in half the 2000 whatever shadow

(3m 4s) **Al:**

> No, just checking you never know. Yeah, I never know when I'm talking to you

(3m 4s) **Kevin:**

> but not that game. If I am that that's a signal for help. That's that's a code

(3m 12s)

> advantage that would be danger. Sonic 06. Yeah yeah that's a discussion that I

(3m 13s) **Al:**

> What would be worse that or I can't even remember which one is that the yeah, oh six that's what it is

(3m 20s)

> Yeah, we're we're hogs on it, which is worse I

(3m 25s) **Kevin:**

> think many sonic fans like to have which one's the bottom of their

(3m 27s) **Al:**

> You

(3m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Personally, I lean towards Sonic 06 being worse because for every

(3m 34s)

> thing, Shadow of the Hedgehog is, that game at least works, does not crash frequently.

(3m 39s)

> Yeah, not that frequently at least.

(3m 40s) **Al:**

> That's fair. That's fair.

(3m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Anyway, yeah, I've been playing.

(3m 45s) **Al:**

> I love that the whole marketing around that game was just, hey,

(3m 48s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, that's that's wrong game, you're thinking wrong game, no, that's Sonic Unleashed.

(3m 49s) **Al:**

> wherehog, like that was everything about the marketing was that was that not?

(3m 57s) **Kevin:**

> No, Sonic Unleashed is wherehog, and yes, that was all Sonic 06 is the real, with the

(4m 2s)

> realistic human. That's when we're Sonic Kisses that one.

(4m 4s)

> The human girl, the human girl, wherehog was also not very good or the day part half

(4m 6s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah, that was bad.

(4m 9s)

> All right, my bad.

(4m 13s) **Kevin:**

> of it was not very good. The wherehog part was not very good. But yeah, no, that I'll

(4m 20s)

> take, I'll take wherehog over the shadow of the hedgehog game though. The self title one.

(4m 24s) **Al:**

> No, interesting.

(4m 26s)

> Okay.

(4m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Not shadow generations because that one's good. Even though it's reaching into all of

(4m 29s) **Al:**

> Yes.

(4m 31s) **Kevin:**

> of these bad games you're talking about.

(4m 33s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, so look,

(4m 36s)

> Yeah, I mean, I couldn't get through that game, but that is just a me with 3D sonic games problem.

(4m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, but it's it's good. I mean, I'm just I'll say this. I think Sonic Generation is probably the best Sonic game ever released

(4m 53s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'd go with that.

(4m 54s) **Kevin:**

> And shadow that in you know releasing a shadow the hedgehog side game to go with it and it lived up to that part. That's that's impressive

(5m 3s) **Al:**

> I I kind of agree. I agree that generations is the best Sonic game

(5m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(5m 8s) **Al:**

> What I do wish the shadow part because as far as I could tell and I didn't go through it huge

(5m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(5m 15s) **Al:**

> The shadow part was just 3d just the modern Sonic style of game. I don't think it had any of the the the merging of things to do

(5m 20s) **Kevin:**

> There

(5m 24s)

> It had some so you know how these go there. There's different acts in each little right the first act is full 3d the second act is usually too deep leaning

(5m 34s)

> There'll still be a few 3d segments, but it it's it's 2d leaning

(5m 41s)

> I'll say that but

(5m 42s) **Al:**

> that's the problem it lost me in the first act because it was like ah it's just more of the bit

(5m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(5m 46s) **Al:**

> that I don't like rather than.

(5m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's fair. That's fair

(5m 50s)

> But yeah, it's it's a good game

(5m 53s)

> And it leans into all the dumb stuff that sonic hands faded hate about shadow, but then we learned to love it

(6m 1s)

> Anyways, so that's good

(6m 3s)

> Okay, so I've been playing that you are also been playing digie man's because digimon

(6m 9s) **Al:**

> Now is this is this the one that has gone like has like 80,000 players on Steam just now?

(6m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Story time stranger came out but I've been playing

(6m 14s)

> I

(6m 17s)

> Probably because it just came out like two days ago from more recording

(6m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah

(6m 21s)

> Like surprisingly big

(6m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay, so I'm not playing that one because I'm I don't like there's a lot of games coming out

(6m 28s) **Al:**

> All right, it's not the one you're playing, right?

(6m 30s) **Kevin:**

> No, I'm playing the previous

(6m 33s)

> Okay, so rewind to

(6m 35s)

> 20 I don't know 15 something like that digimon story cyber sleuth with the colon in the middle. Did you want story colon cyber sleuth? That came out

(6m 44s)

> A monster collecting RPG and digie one it was very very good

(6m 48s)

> Fast forward to 2018 digie mon story cyber sleuth

(6m 53s)

> Another colon I guess hackers memory a semi sequel

(6m 58s)

> Because it was in the same exact story and world just told from the perspective of a different character

(7m 5s)

> But still the same

(7m 7s)

> RPG monster collecting got it also very good

(7m 11s)

> Okay, cue the other day. We got

(7m 14s)

> Digimon story calling time strangers, so now it's a completely different story set of characters. It's a

(7m 21s)

> more style of gameplay though. That is not the one I'm playing. Because I want to play the new one, but I am not able

(7m 23s) **Al:**

> And that's not the one you're playing, just now.

(7m 30s) **Kevin:**

> to, unfortunately, I'm going back to the old one. Because I never beat the other one that came on

(7m 37s)

> 2018 hackers memory, the one from the different character. So I'm going to through that now.

(7m 44s)

> Anyways, I'm playing that it's monster collecting. It's very, very good in my opinion. I like how

(7m 49s)

> they manage the systems of being able to grind and collect and do a lot of stuff at once. You can

(7m 55s)

> have a party up to 11 creatures. You only have through on the field at once, but all the other guys

(8m 2s)

> get the experience nonetheless. So you can grind and evolve and collect stuff very easily. And also

(8m 11s)

> So they're their collection methods interesting.

(8m 14s)

> You don't throw Pokeballs or whatever you just have to encounter a Digimon enough times on the wild and then you can add it to your collection

(8m 22s)

> Which is I don't know. I think it's fun because it's no no moss. You don't have to fret about trying to catch it just happens over time

(8m 32s)

> Anyways, but yeah, you're a good game since last time. That's that's roughly what I've been up to though. What about you? How's going on?

(8m 40s) **Al:**

> Well, obviously, I have also been playing Sunset Island, and we'll talk about that later in the podcast.

(8m 45s)

> But also, I picked up a couple of days ago.

(8m 48s)

> One desktop.

(8m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Oh snap!

(8m 50s) **Al:**

> Let me tell you something.

(8m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah?

(8m 52s) **Al:**

> Steam does like to snitch on me.

(8m 56s)

> I boot up the game, and about 10 seconds later I got a message from Azeland.

(8m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(8m 59s)

> Yeah.

(9m 3s)

[Laughing]

(9m 4s) **Al:**

> Who was streaming on Twitch at the time?

(9m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah!

(9m 10s)

[Laughing]

(9m 10s) **Al:**

> With just wonderstop in all caps.

(9m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Toxic live on 2-inch.

(9m 14s)

[Laughing]

(9m 16s)

> Ah yeah!

(9m 19s)

> Good stuff!

(9m 20s) **Al:**

> So I think we know how Azeland feels about the game.

(9m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Oh yeah!

(9m 24s)

[Laughing]

(9m 25s)

> I mean, I was an on-steam at the time.

(9m 27s)

> If I were, I would have done the same thing probably.

(9m 29s)

[Laughing]

(9m 30s) **Al:**

> It was there was another one that happened with Kelly earlier than the year and I can't even remember was I got a message from them

(9m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's hilarious.

(9m 37s) **Al:**

> Commenting on the fact that I'd boot it up a game

(9m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's great. I love that.

(9m 40s) **Al:**

> boom

(9m 42s)

> Very silly, but there we go steam leaves no secrets. Yes before anybody

(9m 48s)

> Tells me in the slack yes, I know that you can turn off that setting, but I like it. It's funny

(9m 54s) **Kevin:**

> It is, yeah, at least the months like this, it's good, it's good stuff.

(9m 56s) **Al:**

> I've only got about two hours into the game

(10m)

> So I don't I think it's too early to how to give an opinion on on it

(10m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Um, I I died. I think you have a there's a pretty good picture like overall

(10m 12s) **Al:**

> I'm not gonna talk about the gameplay because I I think I need to put more time in before I make a decision about how I feel about the

(10m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(10m 20s)

> Sure

(10m 22s) **Al:**

> But obviously I will see that the game looks gorgeous. It sounds gorgeous, and it is definitely

(10m 30s)

> I can see what it's going with this story and

(10m 34s) **Kevin:**

> I mean

(10m 34s) **Al:**

> It's it's obviously going to be very emotional. I can feel that. So yeah

(10m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I mean that opening that that opening comes at you with a sledgehammer like there there is

(10m 42s) **Al:**

> Those are all good things

(10m 49s) **Kevin:**

> You're getting into it right away

(10m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I'll leave it. I'll leave it at that and I won't talk about the gameplay

(10m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay

(10m 59s) **Al:**

> just now because I need to, I need to play some more before I make a public declaration of an opinion.

(11m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, well, let me ask you as of right now your limit experience. What would you like it?

(11m 11s)

> Hmm

(11m 12s) **Al:**

> As our game as our whole?

(11m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, let me just yeah, yeah, that's a hole right there's different parts. Okay. All right, that's all I'm just curious

(11m 21s)

> Okay, I'm again with the context very limited, but that's fine. Okay

(11m 27s) **Al:**

> it's really hard. I don't because like I have some issues with the gameplay. Let's put it that way.

(11m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Sure sure

(11m 33s) **Al:**

> Which I need some time to decide whether or not that is because I'm just not used to it yet.

(11m 41s)

> Or whether it's something that will always be an issue for me and I don't want to talk about those

(11m 47s)

> issues yet on the podcast because I think it's unfair without getting it more time.

(11m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. All right. Well, I mean Jason, I have wanted to make a second episode anyways for

(11m 57s)

> a while because we want to talk about the story like full full spoilers. But okay, that's

(12m 4s)

> that's that's all right. Good stuff. Wonder style. That's a good game. Very possible.

(12m 8s) **Al:**

> So yeah, only two hours into it, but I'm hoping to have it done before ZA comes out. I've got two weeks

(12m 13s)

> It's a it's well. Yeah, that's the thing. I mean how long to beat says 10 to 12 hours

(12m 18s) **Kevin:**

> >> That is correct.

(12m 18s) **Al:**

> And I've got a week and a half until the game comes out. I should be able to do it considering like I put

(12m 26s)

> 150 hours in two weeks

(12m 28s) **Kevin:**

[laugh]

(12m 28s) **Al:**

> Into tears of the kingdom. I should be able to do 12 hours in a week and a half

(12m 32s)

> Let's be honest

(12m 33s)

> And if and if I don't manage to put in that minute time before ZA comes out

(12m 38s)

> I'm probably never going to right like that's the that it's one of those things where it's like you're obviously not enjoying the game enough

(12m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah.

(12m 45s) **Al:**

> If you don't get in that that minute time for me, obviously different people have different

(12m 50s)

> Speeds of these things. I'm not judging anybody in there. They're games speed times

(12m 54s)

> But for me if I don't manage to put 12 hours into a game in two weeks. I'm not enjoying the game

(13m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's like what an hour a day. That's nothing. Yeah. Um, yeah. That's fair. And you know what, it's a good time because, you know, Z a feels like, are you, are you a rollercoaster fan? Oh, or do you get rid of the middle.

(13m) **Al:**

> so

(13m 2s)

> Exactly exactly

(13m 14s)

> I have been and I am a fine theory of roller coasters.

(13m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(13m 19s) **Al:**

> My problem is I get motion sick quite easily.

(13m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Sure. Sure. Yeah, that's rough.

(13m 23s) **Al:**

> So I can only go on a certain number of roller coasters in a certain, like I have to,

(13m 28s)

> if I'm a theme park with people, I will go on one roller coaster for every two

(13m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, y'all limits.

(13m 30s)

> Yeah, okay. That's fair. That's fair. Okay. You know, well, hey, hats off to you. That's impressive because you work through it. That's good. Well, anyways, I was going to say ZA feels like the the lift, you know, the climb at the start of a rollercoaster because after ZA, oh my goodness, so much stuff is going to come out. I don't know how we're going to fit other games in. Yeah, games in general.

(13m 34s) **Al:**

> that everyone else goes on and I'm like recovering.

(13m 37s)

> I'm recovering when they're going on the second one.

(13m 54s)

> You just mean games in general or are you specifically about Pokemon?

(13m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, both.

(14m)

> I mean, there's gonna be a lot of Pokemon next year. It's got PCopia champions if you care and then there's gen 10

(14m 10s) **Al:**

> I keep forgetting about champions.

(14m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, you know who will be good. I don't know but and that's and that there could still be more it's Pokemon 30. It's gonna be a big year

(14m 21s) **Al:**

> What, what a, yeah, come on, sure, I, I'm convinced there's going to be a fourth thing coming out next year. There'll be another spin off. And I, I'm, I'm kind of wondering whether it might be a remake of something, not, not a remake of a main series game, a remake of a, a side game, or, or something like snap, where they do another one, which is, you know, something like that. I don't know, but I don't know what it would be at this point. Maybe, maybe, but what does that look like in 2026?

(14m 24s) **Kevin:**

> I

(14m 26s)

> am - absolutely

(14m 38s)

> Ooh, that's a good call, I like that.

(14m 42s)

> New Poke Park!

(14m 45s)

> I don't know.

(14m 48s)

> I don't know.

(14m 51s) **Al:**

> Oh, do you know what would be great? And it's not going to, no, and it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen, but you know what I would be great is a new RPG game. It's not going to happen, but if I could, if I could do one thing, I would love another one of those because that was so much fun. And my problem with playing the card game is like people.

(14m 51s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know.

(14m 54s)

> Detective Pikachu remake.

(14m 56s)

[laughing]

(15m 5s)

> Oh, yeah, it's not gonna happen

(15m 21s)

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(15m 21s) **Al:**

> (laughs) Like there's just, there's so much, so many extra variables when you're dealing with people, but like, I really enjoyed playing the Game Boy TCG game because it was like, because it was an RPG. It was fun. You were working through a story and like, there was an end goal to get to and you were building up your deck and trying different things was fun. I don't enjoy doing that in like live or pocket as much. Um, exactly, exactly.

(15m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, that's right. There's a pressure when you're doing other people. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally get them. That's very fair. Um, as someone who enjoys card games, I, there's absolutely a different feeling when it is a single player game or just playing against computers and there is a different appeal. Absolutely. I get that 100%. That'd be great. It's not going to happen though. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

(16m 6s) **Al:**

> So yeah, if that if I get to put in my vote that would be my vote a modern version of the TCG game by game

(16m 12s)

> What would be your vote if you got

(16m 16s) **Kevin:**

> what I would want. I don't know. Popeye is coming out. That's all I want. But, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. You know what? Uh, give us a new mystery dungeon because the last one I got was a remake. Yeah. So that's, you know, that's really easy. Yeah. It's been a minute. Yeah. Yeah. So give us a new mystery dungeon. Why not blowing your fruits? It's me.

(16m 20s) **Al:**

> Sure, sure, sure, but like I'm talking about like a remake or a new game in a series that hasn't had one in a long time

(16m 31s)

> Yeah, it was yeah, and that's I'm not being like four years. I think hasn't it 21. I think it was

(16m 40s)

> I still haven't played that

(16m 46s) **Kevin:**

> It was a flavor, a specific flavor. So I, it's hard to, I don't know. You would let get enough. I'm going to guess no. I mean, because it's roguelike, first of all. And, and it has the big problem. Yeah. Yeah, it was. And it, it definitely has the big problem. You, you don't like where you die. You kind of lose all your progress. You can kind of salvage it gives you an option in some games. But, um, the, the momentum killing is kind of bad.

(16m 55s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, it was roguelike before the rogue, before roguelike was big, right?

(17m 15s)

> what's really funny is I didn't I didn't know it was a roguelike until like a year ago or something

(17m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Um, but it's also Pokemon. Oh, my goodness. Oh, that's amazing. Oh, yeah. But, uh, yeah, Pokemon. So wander stops. Good thing got it before Pokemon because all this is coming out.

(17m 22s) **Al:**

> and I found it out it was such a big surprise I was like I can't believe it's taken this long

(17m 26s)

> for me to find out that the mystery dungeon games are roguelikes what is

(17m 36s)

> madness

(17m 41s)

> Yeah, well, it well exactly I was trying to decide what what because part of the problem is I've got a whole bunch of games

(17m 47s)

> I'm trying to get through this year

(17m 49s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(17m 49s) **Al:**

> and I was like I'd finished Sunset Island

(17m 53s)

> Nearly a week ago. I think was when I messaged you saying I'm finished it

(17m 54s) **Kevin:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(17m 57s) **Al:**

> And there was like I've got time now

(18m)

> But I don't want to play another farming game that I'm gonna cover on the podcast because

(18m 4s)

> Then I'll just forget all about...

(18m 6s)

> Before I actually record a podcast, because obviously it's not going to be the...

(18m 10s)

> You know, listeners don't know, you know it's not going to be the next podcast, right?

(18m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(18m 13s) **Al:**

> So it's going to be at least two weeks until I would talk about it.

(18m 16s)

> And the next game I'm going to play for the podcast is a very short game.

(18m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(18m 20s) **Al:**

> So it's like I do not want to do that.

(18m 22s)

> And then the next one would be like even further in the future, so I don't want to do that yet.

(18m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(18m 26s) **Al:**

> So I was like, but here's the game that I want to play before the end of the year.

(18m 33s)

> But I'm probably not going to do a podcast on it because we've already done a podcast on it.

(18m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. It is. That's it. It kind of fits perfectly. And that's a lot. Absolutely.

(18m 36s) **Al:**

> And so it's perfect timing.

(18m 39s)

> And it's about the right amount of length of time to be able to do it before ZA.

(18m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah. There you go. All the signs pointed to playing it good for you.

(18m 44s) **Al:**

> So I was like, everything's aligned. It's finally time and it was on sale.

(18m 52s)

> All right, that's what we've been up to. Let's, oh, oh, and you go. Go for it.

(18m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Wait. One small thing I forgot to mention. I had a terrifying, it's not even something I did,

(19m)

> just a feeling I experienced.

(19m 3s)

> The other day that terrified me out.

(19m 5s)

> Hold on, wait. Let me see. What did year did this come out?

(19m 10s)

> Yeah.

(19m 10s) **Al:**

> Depends what this is

(19m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. This game came out in 27.

(19m 14s) **Al:**

> Oh, it's a game. So it's not but it's not about the Simpsons doing a second film then 20 years after the first

(19m 18s) **Kevin:**

> No, it is not.

(19m 20s)

> No. Which is wild. But, okay.

(19m 24s)

> Did you hear? Did you see that?

(19m 27s)

> Somebody, I think I was in the discord chair that I forget somebody from one of the Simpsons.

(19m 33s)

> I talked about how they didn't think they'd be doing another movie.

(19m 37s)

> And then, like, two days later, they know.

(19m 37s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah, it was Nancy Cartwright, he'd said it on our podcast. Yeah, it was very fun. Amazing timing. She was like, I don't even know what you would do.

(19m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(19m 44s)

> Yeah.

(19m 45s) **Al:**

> It's like, yeah, okay, like I get that, but also that's why you're not a writer. That's why you're a voice actor, right? Like,

(19m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(19m 49s)

> Yeah.

(19m 54s)

> Yeah. Yeah. Also, that means she didn't know about it.

(19m 58s) **Al:**

> I also find it funny that people are like, who are even who's even asking for this. And I'm like, you realize the Simpsons is still going because people still watch it, right?

(20m 4s) **Kevin:**

> yeah it's yeah it is still a cultural you know milestone icon it's it's it's yeah

(20m 4s) **Al:**

> like it does good ratings it's going

(20m 7s)

> to do well like it's not going to be the best film the highest grossing film of the year and anything but it's going to do well like what are you talking about exactly I am I am also still doing my Simpsons watch through I don't know if I've mentioned this on the podcast or not but I I am watching one episode of the Simpsons every week every weekday and I've been doing it now for nearly two nearly two years I've been doing it for now.

(20m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's a good pace oh my goodness

(20m 35s) **Al:**

> So I have

(20m 37s)

> It's the perfect thing is depending on when it comes out the film and it comes out in 2027

(20m 43s)

> But it might be just after I've like I don't think we have a date for it. Oh, no, we do. We do have it. Let me double check

(20m 49s)

> So I'm not talking in

(20m 51s)

> Concepts, okay, yeah, wait, no

(20m 55s)

> Okay, so it comes out in July 2027 that will have come out that will come out four months after I finish watching all of the Simpsons

(21m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my god.

(21m 5s) **Al:**

> Assuming.

(21m 7s)

> Assuming that they do do a season 38 because obviously they're doing season 37 just now, so I will finish season 36 at the end of next year that will be December next year and then January 27 will be season 37 February will be season 38 and then the film.

(21m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(21m 11s)

> Yeah.

(21m 15s)

> Yeah.

(21m 22s)

> Yeah.

(21m 24s) **Al:**

> Well, I don't know whether season 30 we finished by then or not it depends when when it's finished but point is I will just be almost to the month like just a couple of months out from finishing perfectly on time to what.

(21m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(21m 35s)

> There you go. You will be the most ready human being in planet Earth for that's great.

(21m 37s) **Al:**

> Then you film.

(21m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, anyways, what I was saying though, that's okay. No, that's that's crazy. You know what's crazy

(21m 49s)

> I've never actually seen like a maybe one for a set of

(21m 55s)

> I maybe I should do what you're doing. Double up on it. I don't know. Anyways, but I was gonna say the

(22m 1s)

> 2017, eight years. Eight years.

(22m 5s)

> Not once have I ever said to myself that I want to play Fortnite, but it happened the other day out and I'm scared. I'm probably not going to, but I looked in its general direction for once and it is absolutely I was playing on PlayStation and I go to the home, you know, the menu or whatever, you know, there's like the news articles or like news related to you and I see

(22m 17s) **Al:**

> Is this K-pop demon hunters?

(22m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Contrix under the fortnight and I'm just

(22m 35s)

> screaming oh that's that's a good get I'm yeah that's a good get

(22m 44s) **Al:**

> I've seen a lot of videos of it.

(22m 47s)

> It looks like very satisfying weapons to use as well.

(22m 50s) **Kevin:**

> yeah yeah it works absolutely yes it's right

(22m 51s) **Al:**

> I totally get, it's such a good thing

(22m 55s)

> to do for them to do a collaboration.

(22m 57s)

> Because sometimes it's like, oh, OK, right, fine.

(23m)

> You've got Darth Vader, OK.

(23m 1s)

> Congratulations, do we care, right?

(23m 4s)

> But then sometimes you've got a film which

(23m 6s)

> is like one of the biggest films of the year.

(23m 8s)

> It is the biggest Netflix film ever.

(23m 11s)

> people love it. And it's it's

(23m 14s)

> animated, so they fit in perfectly. And their whole thing is combat. Like it just all comes together and it is genius. And you know, you know, this they I as much as Netflix probably had faith in this film doing reasonably well because they obviously paid money to get it from Sony.

(23m 18s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(23m 31s)

> Yeah

(23m 34s) **Al:**

> They I suspect they never expected to be big enough that it would go in Fortnite so you know someone's been rushing to get this done.

(23m 42s)

[laughing]

(23m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, they've said like after the movie's success, they're like, we are rushing to get spinoffs and the nurse going or whatever, but yeah, they got that really fast actually kind of looking at the timing.

(23m 44s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(23m 55s)

> Yes, it's impressive

(23m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Zane. So yeah, I will probably not play for tonight, but I'm thinking about it, and I'm very uncomfortable with that feeling because that's that's a good one.

(24m 8s) **Al:**

> fair enough. It's been a while since I've looked at Fortnite and gone, okay, I'm interested.

(24m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm good. Let's talk about stuff that type.

(24m 13s) **Al:**

> Again, I'm not going to play it. But yeah, okay, I see the, I see it again. Alright, we've,

(24m 26s)

> we've got, I know what you released last month. A relatively short list for September. We

(24m 32s)

> have four releases. We have little witch in the woods released 1.0.

(24m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Good for them. 1.0. Yeah.

(24m 38s) **Al:**

> We have slime rancher to released 1.0, which I hate so much. She really should be 2.0. It's

(24m 46s)

> slime rancher to 0.0. And then obviously we got star birds early access. And we got voyages

(24m 54s) **Kevin:**

> We talked about that.

(24m 55s) **Al:**

> of, we did. And we got voyages of narrow early access. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's

(24m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Call me when that starboard says 1.0, then we'll be talking.

(25m 3s)

> I hope.

(25m 8s) **Al:**

> that, that's September. Um,

(25m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know this one at all. Cool. Oh, that's a Moana. This is, we get Moana at home.

(25m 17s) **Al:**

> It was a cooperative survival crafting game where you must survive a magical ocean world

(25m 21s)

> brimming with lot spirits and deadly monsters.

(25m 25s)

> It's a Moana, yeah, it's the Moana, yeah, yeah.

(25m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay. That's Moana now. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Probably, it is a pretty

(25m 31s) **Al:**

> I'm sure that was farming in it somewhere otherwise I probably wouldn't have been on the list,

(25m 34s)

> but it looks gorgeous.

(25m 38s) **Kevin:**

> little bit. I'll say that. Power farm. Yeah. Oh, I, I have in fact played power.

(25m 40s) **Al:**

> Um, yes, tell me Kevin, I've talked a bit about Power Farm on the podcast.

(25m 43s)

> Tell me your thoughts, please.

(25m 47s)

> Oh, remain me, you have played Power World, right?

(25m 50s)

> Yes, good, right.

(25m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Um, I'm, yeah. There's farming in power. Right? Yeah, there is. You grow crops. Yeah.

(25m 55s) **Al:**

> You're trying to figure out where to start.

(26m 2s)

> Is there now?

(26m 6s) **Kevin:**

> I'm pretty sure it's been a while.

(26m 8s)

> to be done wrong, but no, I'm pretty sure you have farm and you're the pals maintain it.

(26m 11s)

> Yeah, because you have ones that water it absolutely.

(26m 13s)

> Okay.

(26m 14s)

> Yeah.

(26m 14s)

> There is farming, right?

(26m 15s)

> So like Power World is, you know, sandbox, survival, Minecraft ish sort of a game, right?

(26m 25s)

> Crafting and building and surviving all that stuff.

(26m 28s) **Al:**

> Yep, and you catch the the the pals to like do automation and stuff for you

(26m 28s) **Kevin:**

> So, you know, yes, you do.

(26m 35s)

> And you can, you know, you level up your skill.

(26m 38s)

> Tree and you, you unlock new recipes to make automated, you know, automate more stuff

(26m 42s)

> and whatnot.

(26m 44s)

> So the bones of many cottage, cord systems, farms, systems are, it already in power.

(26m 52s)

> So it's not entirely crazy to see a game like this, but like the, it's two things, one, they're

(27m 1s)

> just really leaning into it and both good and bad, because this is animal crossing

(27m 8s)

> you took those files right from animal crossing.

(27m 12s)

> But it makes sense, I guess.

(27m 16s)

> We never really had the pal's.

(27m 17s) **Al:**

> And it also, it also doesn't, it correct me if I'm if, if you disagree, but it doesn't feel like they've just taken power world and made it a farming sim. It looks like a different game. Like it looks like it's got the same sort of, you know, models and textures and stuff, but it look, it doesn't just look like take that engine, throw farming into it.

(27m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm.

(27m 24s)

> Yeah.

(27m 27s)

> Yeah.

(27m 29s)

> Yeah.

(27m 31s)

> Yeah.

(27m 32s)

> Yeah.

(27m 33s)

> Oh, yeah.

(27m 35s)

> Absolutely.

(27m 36s)

> Yeah, absolutely, it is a different schedule.

(27m 38s)

> And they are building this from the ground up for a different experience.

(27m 42s)

> So yeah, I'm just, I guess I'm kind of surprised to see it happen, but it makes sense

(27m 50s)

> when you glist out all these elements, right?

(27m 54s)

> The down to the fact, you know, apping off other games, which, you know, I forget the developer,

(28m)

> but they've done that several times.

(28m 1s)

> So sure.

(28m 2s)

> Why not?

(28m 3s)

> Um, Parker bear. Thank you. Yes. Right. It, if it also speak.

(28m 3s) **Al:**

> Pocket pair. Yeah.

(28m 8s) **Kevin:**

> The success of power. Right. Right. Got spin off. This is crazy. Um,

(28m 13s)

> the one thing I will say, like, I'm glad to see they're not showing away from the dark,

(28m 20s)

> crazy elements that that power world is not afraid to go into. You either Russian or

(28m 23s) **Al:**

> - What would the Russian relay?

(28m 27s) **Kevin:**

> let? Yep, you can catch your roommate. There is. Oh, okay. So like in power world, you can

(28m 35s)

> capture humans like you can.

(28m 38s)

> Well, they're not afraid to do some bonkers stuff.

(28m 38s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(28m 44s) **Kevin:**

> I bring this all up because the key takeaway for me is that there is a non-zero chance

(28m 50s)

> we can marry a pal in this game, which would be right up their alley that wouldn't be

(28m 58s)

> surprised.

(28m 59s)

> Yeah, so, oh, it's bananas.

(29m 3s)

> Am I going to play it?

(29m 4s)

> I don't know.

(29m 5s)

> like, I just, I guess.

(29m 8s)

> I'd need to see more of it. It's, it's more of a time thing, right? Just like there's a lot of other games. This one isn't like pocopia is is curb stopping this, you know, cottagecore building thing. But we'll see.

(29m 22s)

> It's, it is wild. And there is an element of like, I'm not saying pocket pair is even necessarily a good developer like ethically or whatever.

(29m 36s)

> But just given all the legal

(29m 38s)

> they have they're putting up with from Nintendo.

(29m 40s)

> I'm, you know, good for them to keep sticking it to them.

(29m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, you know, is there anything ethical is there any ethical consumption under capitalism? Probably not. But that doesn't that doesn't mean that things aren't better and worse.

(29m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah. Yeah.

(29m 56s) **Al:**

> And it doesn't mean that you can't, you know, root for someone who you think is being taken advantage of or is a root against somebody that you think is taking advantage of the system.

(30m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(30m 10s) **Al:**

> It's doing things that wouldn't necessarily hold up in court, but

(30m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(30m 15s) **Al:**

> definitely would scare away a lot of people, these sorts of things, and also a system in and of itself that you might feel shouldn't allow software patents as a concept in and of itself, right?

(30m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yep, yep

(30m 29s) **Al:**

> Like there are a lot of people that have that opinion, so I think it's totally fair to be like pro or anti certain companies, even if none of them are essentially

(30m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, the enemy of my enemy is my friend for at least today, right? Well, okay. You know, I, I have one. I don't, I don't remember if I hurry on the podcast

(30m 59s)

> when you talk about pal farm, but a question for you, Alan, do you think the timing of that trailer

(31m 8s) **Al:**

> So obviously, they can't have known about

(31m 12s)

> Pocopia coming out when they start,

(31m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Hm, right.

(31m 14s) **Al:**

> like this game has been in development for at least months,

(31m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

(31m 19s) **Al:**

> right? Like there's the, they have a game here.

(31m 24s)

> I wouldn't put it past them to have seen the release

(31m 27s)

> and go, oh, quick, get the trailer ready, right?

(31m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, either, but it's also hard.

(31m 31s) **Al:**

> And get it out as quickly as we can.

(31m 33s)

> I wouldn't put it past them doing that.

(31m 38s)

> I did, and I don't, and I don't think the coincidence

(31m 41s)

> of it coming out a week after Pocopia was announced

(31m 45s)

> is enough to say that they definitely did it

(31m 47s)

> because these things happen.

(31m 48s)

> The fact that they were both working on farming games

(31m 50s)

> at the same time is evidence enough that these things happen,

(31m 54s)

> right? We know that people do these things.

(31m 56s)

> Is it surprising that two of, you know,

(31m 59s)

> the biggest creature collection game makers

(32m 3s)

> are both making farming games in a time

(32m 6s)

> where farming games are becoming more popular.

(32m 9s)

> Is that surprising? No, obviously not.

(32m 12s)

> Why would that be surprising, right?

(32m 14s)

> Like that's, that would be like being surprised

(32m 16s)

> that Ubisoft made a breath of the world like in 2018, right?

(32m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, good. But yeah, let's I'm also this I'm glad pal farm exists. Well, I play. I don't know. But I am glad this nonsense exists.

(32m 21s) **Al:**

> Don't be an idiot.

(32m 22s)

> Of course it was going to happen.

(32m 34s)

> It's fun to think about, and the A's pocket pair just a bunch of trolls who are also

(32m 47s)

> game developers, maybe, it's hard to know, but I mean, I'm not complaining about that.

(32m 50s) **Kevin:**

> At this point, yes, they if they were before they are now.

(32m 56s)

> All right. You know what we can or not complain. I don't know.

(32m 59s) **Al:**

> There will definitely be some stuff to complain about later.

(33m) **Kevin:**

> Well, I haven't looked all these in details. Sick.

(33m 5s) **Al:**

> Probably not at the beginning. Let's start off with the news.

(33m 9s) **Kevin:**

> There's a lot of gaming things to complain about gender in general, not even just this news.

(33m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah, there's a lot of news.

(33m 19s)

> Oh, yeah, let's not, let's not, let's not get to under the EA stuff, please no.

(33m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Fuck does this first news item make us rage too? I don't know. Let's see. Okay.

(33m 26s) **Al:**

> No, it does not, because I don't know whether this is meant to be pronounced Eila

(33m 31s)

> or iali. uh...

(33m 33s) **Kevin:**

> It'll go without the sea.

(33m 35s) **Al:**

> yeah, it is

(33m 37s)

> ela, ela

(33m 39s)

> uh...

(33m 40s)

> anyway uh... ela a frosty glide

(33m 42s)

> uh... this is um... uh... another uh... which broom flying game

> they've announced that their release state is going to be the 20th of october

> That's soon.

> I kickstart at this game I think um...

(34m 3s) **Kevin:**

> [laughs] I've got you there. Um... I... it looks a little more uh... platformy.

(34m 5s) **Al:**

> shush shush it was over a year ago I kickstart at it

(34m 10s)

> but the point is that

(34m 16s)

> it's been a while I think

(34m 18s)

> yes I did kickstart at it's s oh it's estimated delivery date was November 2025

(34m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Oh dang. Oh snap. No. Yeah. And you know what? And the game does not look bad. It's, you're

(34m 24s) **Al:**

> they're getting they're releasing early from their kickstart your date

(34m 28s)

> that never happens that's mad

(34m 32s)

> Props to them, I worked.

(34m 35s)

> That's really impressive.

(34m 39s) **Kevin:**

> going to a big snowy mountain. You're, you're not riding the broom a lot of things. You're like

(34m 44s)

> surfing on it almost and platforming and jumping. Um, it's cute. I'll say that.

(34m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah

(34m 48s)

> Yes, they called themselves a cozy exploration platformer

(34m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Well, I, uh, every time, every time you just, it's, it's a mad libs of game genres and

> descriptors just, just keep making things, putting things together. Okay. I mean, but hey, good for

(35m 10s)

> them. It looks good. I'll say, you know, it looks good. They're releasing earlier than they planned.

(35m 16s)

> That's impressive. And that's going to be on everything. All of your consoles and steam. Good for

(35m 21s)

> - Wow, that's good.

(35m 23s) **Al:**

> It was February of this year that it was the Kickstarter went up.

(35m 30s) **Kevin:**

> go? Well...

(35m 30s) **Al:**

> So they've gone from launching Kickstarter to release in less than a year,

> and that's earlier than Target.

(35m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Denton

(35m 38s)

> There are people who love this game who are working on it cuz they're probably doing it before the Kickstarter um

(35m 43s) **Al:**

> Oh, for sure. Of course.

(35m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(35m 45s) **Al:**

> This one is, we need to get this over the line.

(35m 47s)

> Sort of the Kickstarter rather than we have a great idea on it to create it.

(35m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yep

(35m 50s)

> Yeah

(35m 53s)

> Which you know is honestly the best kind of Kickstarter. Let's be real like

(35m 58s)

> Yeah, that just feel good. You have a good idea.

(36m)

> It's real and we will help you carry it to the end. Good stuff.

(36m 5s) **Al:**

> Speaking of releases star signed island have announced that they're releasing on the first of February 2026

(36m 12s)

> Interestingly, I don't know where they announced this because so there is a link to in the show notes that we are linked to

(36m 20s)

> What's it called?

(36m 21s)

> YouTube video of a trailer

(36m 22s) **Kevin:**

> YouTube.

(36m 24s) **Al:**

> It doesn't mention the date anywhere in the video or anywhere in the description or anywhere on steam

(36m 31s)

> But for some reason everybody just seems to know that they're releasing

(36m 35s)

> on that date and I'm very confused as to how that is the case.

(36m 36s) **Kevin:**

[Laughs]

(36m 39s) **Al:**

> So, okay, I don't know where this came from, I can't see a press release, there's nothing

(36m 48s)

> anywhere that I can see, but for some reason every game's news says it's releasing on

(36m 50s) **Kevin:**

> The video just says wishless now.

(36m 56s) **Al:**

> that date, so I have no idea where the original source of that was.

(37m) **Kevin:**

> I don't know who is, we're developing this because this is, this is like China specifically.

(37m 8s) **Al:**

> It is a Chinese developer, I believe. They're called Seed Lab.

(37m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I would assume so. Yeah, I see it. Yeah, you're right.

(37m 14s) **Al:**

> They've also released a game called By Phase, which is a 2D platformer. It looks fun.

(37m 18s) **Kevin:**

> I don't, I've never heard of that. Okay.

(37m 24s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know what the deal is with this developer this game. It seems to be everywhere.

(37m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, man, I don't know.

(37m 30s) **Al:**

> It was in a direct, I think, and it just seems to like everybody's talking about it for some

(37m 34s) **Kevin:**

> you know, it's, I know it, I'll say this, this one, you know, drinking game, take your

(37m 45s) **Al:**

> Oh, I found it. I found it. I found it. It's on Twitter. They've announced it on Twitter February 1st, 2026.

(37m 45s) **Kevin:**

> shot. It does look cozy actually. Oh, there you go. Yeah, it looks like you're setting

(37m 54s)

> up a farm garden thing. Like, I don't know how to describe it. There's your building. There's

(38m 1s)

> Like build that you're setting buildings to or like, expect.

(38m 4s)

> There's a lot in this trailer. There's a panda and a capavera playing PS5. I don't know why.

(38m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I mean, to me, the game very much looks like a 3D starchy-like.

(38m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, there you go. There you go.

(38m 17s) **Al:**

> And I guess what we'll need to see whether that turns out to be a good one or not.

(38m 23s) **Kevin:**

> And we'll see.

(38m 24s) **Al:**

> I'm still a bit FA on the 3D farming games in general. We'll see how this one does.

(38m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, the production quality looks high. We'll see that.

(38m 34s)

> How crazy is it like China, you know, 10 years ago, China was still bootleg laughing stock, you know, video game world.

(38m 44s)

> And now they're kind of kind of taking over the market. It's kind of insane.

(38m 49s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, cool, 'cause I was black myth with Kong

(38m 53s)

> as a Chinese game, isn't it?

(38m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it is.

(38m 54s) **Al:**

> And that was up for a game of the year, like.

(38m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it was.

(39m)

> I mean, we got Mahoyo. We got a nanta.

(39m 5s)

> All right, what's next?

(39m 7s) **Al:**

> All right, next we have ages of Kateria have announced that their early access is coming on the 5th of November

(39m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, remember the fifth and November.

(39m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, my son's birthday

(39m 18s) **Kevin:**

> There you go. Good. Good day to have birthday, kid.

(39m 22s)

> I Fox day.

(39m 22s) **Al:**

> I I think I kick started this one

(39m 28s)

> I do like look at this game. I think

(39m 32s)

> What I think it looks more it's I think it's more management style

(39m 37s)

> But I like the idea of like kind of building up a village throughout the generations, which is what this does

(39m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(39m 44s) **Al:**

> And although it is more management style that does seem to be

(39m 49s)

> You can control individuals and like I've seen a bunch of many games for example and you do seem to be controlling some people sometimes

(39m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. All right. They got a big roadmap, though. Like, there's, there's some stuff in here.

(39m 57s) **Al:**

> So we're interested to see how it goes

(40m 4s) **Kevin:**

> I would thought would be in their release, but okay. I don't know. Trading, chatting, those kind

(40m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Okay. Next we have Harvest Moon Home sweet home, apparently. So this is the one that was

(40m 13s) **Kevin:**

> of seem important in my opinion. What? Hey, good for that.

(40m 28s) **Al:**

> released on iOS and Android last year and is now coming to consoles and Steam called the special

(40m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

(40m 36s) **Al:**

> edition because the new version has updates to it.

(40m 41s)

> has apparently said that the update is coming to the mobile version on the same day as the game comes out October the 30th, but I can't see anything about that on the internet. I have Googled for this. I do as well. I just also want to see it from someone else. I don't know where they got it from. Yeah, I know. And that annoys me as well.

(40m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Oh, that's nice.

(40m 54s)

> I trust FOGU.

(41m)

> Never stop Sarabee.

(41m 5s)

> Never stop Sarabee.

(41m 11s) **Al:**

> I don't know if they don't know whether it is going to cost anymore or not. That hasn't been announced, but apparently it has been announced that the update is coming, which is good. The special edition is more expensive than the mobile version. So one would assume that the update would cost money, but it would be nice if it wouldn't just say. We'll see I guess.

(41m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I mean it's yeah, we'll see

(41m 41s) **Al:**

> Next, we have Disney Dreamlight Valley, the returned beasts castle update. It is out now and it brings Lumière and Cogsworth. Cogsworth. Sorry from from Beauty and the Beast. Classic. Every single time.

(41m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, then we're in the game already. Yeah, okay. Yeah, except this one beast in Bell were in the game like from the start

(42m 6s)

> I think weren't they then then this. Yeah, okay. This one's a little more valid

(42m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I think so. Certainly early on.

(42m 13s)

> Well, no, because they needed to have return to Beast's castle. You can't do a return to Beast's castle without more characters from the film.

(42m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Sure, you guess so

(42m 19s)

> Yeah fair enough that gloomy air looks great

(42m 24s)

> all right cool I like I like beating the bass I like lumeer and cogsworth

(42m 34s) **Al:**

> uh, speaking of updates, Rusty's retirement has gotten autumn, uh, they're calling it a mini update.

(42m 39s)

> I think you could just call an update, right? Come on. Because this adds a whole, it adds,

(42m 41s) **Kevin:**

[laughing]

(42m 43s)

> - Micro update.

(42m 45s)

[laughing]

(42m 45s) **Al:**

> oh, don't even start with that. This adds a whole new map, an autumn themed map. I feel like when

(42m 52s)

> you're adding a map, it's legit to call it a normal, centralized update and also just call it an update.

(42m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of a big one. Probably okay, call mom with you.

(42m 57s) **Al:**

> It's just an update. So.

(43m 4s)

> There is a new autumn themed map where mushrooms spawn randomly across the farm. The mushrooms

(43m 10s)

> can be harvested by harvest spots, pumpkins and white pumpkins are jackal lanterns for the month of

(43m 15s)

> October. 10 new berry bushes have been added. Well, exactly. Rusty will put on a special costume

(43m 17s) **Kevin:**

> That's cool.

(43m 21s)

> This is a big list for a mini update.

(43m 26s) **Al:**

> on the day of Halloween and a bunch of other smaller things. So if you are

(43m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Now, that's cute.

(43m 34s) **Al:**

> all into Rusty's retirement, go get out of retirement, go play the app.

(43m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Unretired. I go play the retirement. Um, yeah, okay, you know what to turn here's the

(43m 45s)

> question at term. And if it's a mini update, how much does the version number increase? How many

(43m 51s) **Al:**

> Oh don't don't

(43m 51s) **Kevin:**

> decimal points? Yeah, that's, that's my mission.

(43m 57s) **Al:**

> You just look for ways to throw me don't you?

(44m 5s)

> Fields of mystery are have released speaking of version numbers 0.14.2 the feedback update

(44m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(44m 13s) **Al:**

> It adds a bunch of quality of life improvements that things things that people have been wanting such as

(44m 18s) **Kevin:**

> That's a good one.

(44m 19s) **Al:**

> buildings becoming transparent.

(44m 21s)

> When you walk behind them, crafting you have a max button,

(44m 25s)

> loving you to craft the max total items.

(44m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's theoretically a good one, but who on earth needs to craft up the 999 of anything.

(44m 34s) **Al:**

> I mean, look, it's not going to be 999 most of the time, right, because you're not going to have the

(44m 40s)

> stuff to be able to craft 999 of most things. So it's probably going to be like, you know, 30,

(44m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I guess okay

(44m 45s) **Al:**

> but for most of the time, you can buy bundles of wood and stone instead of having to buy them

(44m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, oh fine, okay

(44m 51s) **Al:**

> individually. I'm a bunch of other smaller updates as well. So another good sounding update from

(44m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, oh geez. Oh my gosh. That sounds a miserable. Oh, thank goodness

(45m 2s) **Al:**

> and feel the mystery are.

(45m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean feedback update. That's that's probably the best update you can have. That's a good one. Good for you fields of mystery

(45m 4s) **Al:**

> There's a lot of things to do.

(45m 10s)

> I'm still not going back to 1.0.

(45m 11s) **Kevin:**

> That's yeah, I mean, that's my rule of thumb and cross the board

(45m 16s) **Al:**

> They've also announced some new marriage.

(45m 18s)

> So we now have more than just the creepy pins.

(45m 21s)

> Kevin.

(45m 21s) **Kevin:**

> No, I, well, is it more creepy pants?

(45m 24s) **Al:**

> It is not as plushies.

(45m 25s) **Kevin:**

[laughing]

(45m 26s)

> No!

(45m 27s) **Al:**

> There's a chicken.

(45m 29s)

> And there's a dog on a cushion.

(45m 32s)

> >> [BLANK_AUDIO]

(45m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that is cute, actually.

(45m 35s) **Al:**

> >> And also bath bombs.

(45m 36s) **Kevin:**

> No, wait, what?

(45m 37s)

> Okay, okay, that's very targeted.

(45m 41s)

> I don't, okay.

(45m 43s)

> Wow, that dog is very cute.

(45m 44s) **Al:**

> It's a $28 set of four bath bombs in a box.

(45m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I'm not a...

(45m 52s)

> Look, this is hard for me, I'm a very tall guy.

(45m 54s)

> I like, my bathtub is not particularly comfortable for bath,

(45m 57s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(45m 57s) **Kevin:**

> so I'm not a bath guy.

(45m 59s)

> But I do enjoy baths, I'm sure the one was a kid.

(46m 2s)

> Our bath bombs worth it, I've never used it, I don't know.

(46m 5s) **Al:**

> I, I don't get what the, as far as I can tell, they just kind of make it the bath fizzy and then smell a little bit.

(46m 11s) **Kevin:**

> That and I think yeah, I roam. Yeah

(46m 13s) **Al:**

> And then they, and then they make it a little bit weird color. I, I think they're just a fancy way of doing bubble bath.

(46m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, basically I guess

(46m 23s) **Al:**

> It's like, do you want bubble bath, but also it's like a little bomb. So it just fizzes a bunch.

(46m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah easier bubble bath in a ball. Okay

(46m 30s) **Al:**

> Do you want that? I don't want that.

(46m 35s)

> What does tell us why we should care about bath bombs? Why do you like bath bombs? Do you like bath bombs? Tell us why.

(46m 38s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, I

(46m 40s)

> Will say like

(46m 42s)

> This is stupid because I know this is wrong, but they bath bombs look delicious. I'm like, oh, they're like delicious candy

(46m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They quite often do.

(46m 51s) **Kevin:**

> hahaha

(46m 53s) **Al:**

> So have you ever been into Losh and just looked around and been like,

(46m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(46m 57s) **Al:**

> I feel like I could eat everything in here.

(46m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(47m 3s)

> Like dog is very cute, you know making a chicken plush is very hard because

(47m 9s)

> How are you gonna compete with the story of seasons chicken how you can't

(47m 13s) **Al:**

> a fair question. Firefly village have released a new update as well. These smooth moves

(47m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, all right better than creepy pins

(47m 21s)

> Oh

(47m 21s) **Al:**

> and fluffy friends update. So this adds two changes. This is the game that we talked about last

(47m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Hello

(47m 28s) **Al:**

> episode. It adds two changes. One is a change to movement system. I booted up the game just before

(47m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(47m 34s)

> Okay

(47m 35s) **Al:**

> this recording to test out because that was actually one of my complaints about the game

(47m 39s)

> was the movement felt a little bit weird. It is

(47m 43s)

> better and worse. So it is better. It does generally feel better. So one of the issues that had with how the movement worked as it felt like it was delayed a bit. So when you took your finger off the button, you'd still move a little bit after you took it off, which didn't feel great. That's gone and the movement feels a lot more fluid, except Kevin it has the BDSP friction issue.

(47m 45s) **Kevin:**

> No, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I like that.

(48m 13s) **Al:**

> So I keep bumping into my scarecrows and stopping and I don't like it. I don't like that at all. It's too sticky. The scarecrows are too sticky. Not great.

(48m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Uhh, sure.

(48m 22s)

> Yeah. Uh huh.

(48m 27s)

> That's there. Yeah. Okay. Well, well, that overall, that sounds like a net positive,

(48m 34s)

> like that sounds like an easier to deal with. Yeah.

(48m 37s) **Al:**

> it is definitely an positive. The problem with specifically the scarecrows is that you don't get to choose where the scarecrows go.

(48m 45s)

> They are in a specific place on the farm, but they are in a, so if you go from a straight line from the barn door to your door to the exit of the farm, that's one straight line, and right smack bang in the middle of that are the four scarecrows.

(48m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm. Mmm.

(48m 55s)

[laughs]

(48m 57s)

> Yeah.

(49m)

> Oh. (laughs)

(49m 2s)

[laughs]

(49m 3s) **Al:**

> So...

(49m 4s)

> So...

(49m 5s)

> Uh...

(49m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, pre-generated obstacle course.

(49m 8s)

> The obstacle course.

(49m 8s) **Al:**

> You constantly, constantly walk right next to them.

(49m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. (laughs)

(49m 12s) **Al:**

> And the problem...

(49m 12s) **Kevin:**

> All but not now.

(49m 14s) **Al:**

[Laughs]

(49m 14s) **Kevin:**

> That becomes a measure of how good you are at the game.

(49m 16s)

> Oh, how well did you add the muscle memory to avoid that scare?

(49m 20s)

[laughs]

(49m 20s) **Al:**

> I mean, the good thing is I'm not going to be playing the game anymore.

(49m 22s)

> Unless they add stuff.

(49m 23s)

> Because the only other thing they've added is bunnies.

(49m 25s)

> They've added an animal, the bunnies.

(49m 28s)

> Which, as fun as they are, they give...

(49m 32s)

> You add them like the chickens and the cows.

(49m 35s)

> Cows and they give you

(49m 37s)

> Fluff is apparently what they give you it sells for money, but like I've already done everything in the game

(49m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(49m 45s) **Al:**

> So I don't need to sell for more money

(49m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, sure

(49m 47s) **Al:**

> So I went in I bought my three bunnies and I went great done. I've done it all here

(49m 52s)

> There's nothing more to do there

(49m 53s)

> So it's not a particularly big update. I think it's weird that they added in the bunnies as well as it's like

(49m 59s)

> I don't know what's happening here

(50m 1s)

> Did they have more plans for other updates and I feel like it would even better to kind of put them together in a bigger up

(50m 7s)

> Update if that is the plan and if it's not the plan

(50m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(50m 11s) **Al:**

> Why are you adding bunnies in I'm just I'm fairly confused

(50m 14s) **Kevin:**

> It's like sometimes creators just have the whim.

(50m 20s) **Al:**

> Fair fair

(50m 20s) **Kevin:**

> They have that dream.

(50m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I'm going to assume that they have more plans for other updates

(50m 28s)

> Because it's it's been a month and a half since the game came out and I think that's their first proper update

(50m 33s)

> other than just like bug fixes

(50m 37s)

> Yeah, I don't know. It's interesting

(50m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm, well, okay, you know the the buttons one thing but the movement like I think that's not just a great update

(50m 47s)

> But it's a good sign. They're they're working on it even from like the very core issue. So that's cool. Good for you

(50m 48s) **Al:**

> Yes, yes

(50m 51s)

> Yeah, of course listening to listening to feedback improving the the experiences a good thing

(50m 56s)

> I think it's just like if you have more features planned

(50m 59s)

> I would bundle them together because I don't want to I like I don't I only

(51m 4s)

> Bit it up the game because I wanted to see what it was like so I could talk about it on the podcast, right?

(51m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(51m 7s) **Al:**

> Like if I wasn't talking about in the podcast, I wouldn't a bit up because there would be no point there's nothing to do

(51m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's very fair

(51m 12s)

> Yeah, you got to wait for the two point over them

(51m 17s)

> For a major update now one of those mine mini update

(51m 22s) **Al:**

> I was I was gonna say speaking of updates to aren't gonna make me open the game

> You know speaking of many updates

> And okay fine

> Oh wait, I think, yeah, I think I saw some clips of it, but yeah, I've not

(52m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I don't watch it, but that's all this update reminds me that that shows this and looks awesome because it's it's stop-motion looks beautiful

(52m 19s)

> But hey, all right, there you go go

(52m 23s)

> If you spooky your hello kitty island adventure. Oh, oh, you can go spooky

(52m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah, but they were like actual werewolves not like this is just

(52m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'm just saying

(52m 54s) **Al:**

> this is decorations

(52m 57s) **Kevin:**

> picture plants. Yeah, okay. Oh, that I do too. You get like a square Jack Atlanta, but you could,

(52m 57s) **Al:**

> Also, backpacks.

(52m 59s)

> The van point is fine, but the jack-o-back is a great one, and I love the name.

(53m 6s) **Kevin:**

> you know, back back. That's pretty good. Yeah, it's like a bat without the face, I guess.

(53m 15s)

> Yeah, it's pretty good. Agree. Oh,

(53m 16s) **Al:**

> They've also announced there are some information about the Co-op update.

(53m 21s)

> They are kicking off a small alpha test soon, and planning for the update to be out.

(53m 25s) **Kevin:**

> And they're planning fast travel, that's cool, that's cool, I added a bunch of plants,

(53m 27s) **Al:**

> late November. Air

(53m 29s)

> Oh yes, I missed that. Well, I don't know why the subway doesn't count as fast travel,

(53m 40s)

> it's pretty much fast travel. Maybe this is fast, fastier travel. Alright, now it's time to get

(53m 40s) **Kevin:**

> I don't, oh that's a good point. Fast your travel, I like that.

(53m 48s)

> Subway, the subway's going on a subway, a big one.

(53m 54s) **Al:**

> I know you did by version numbers.

(53m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh again.

(53m 57s) **Al:**

> Goodness and thank you.

(53m 59s)

> Yeah, well, up till now, it's just being Kevin trying to do it deliberately, whereas now it's like I'm actually going to get annoyed about this, right?

(54m 5s)

> Carl Island, what are you doing? They are, ah, this annoys me so much. So the one point, okay, you go then.

(54m 11s) **Kevin:**

> No, wait, wait, I want to read the two, no go, I just say 1.03 update, being splinted to two,

(54m 18s) **Al:**

> The 1.3 update is being split up into two updates. And instead of releasing 1.3, but with less stuff,

(54m 27s)

> they are releasing one point to be

(54m 30s)

> and then one point three because they realized that they wanted to get stuff out earlier fair enough the 1.3 update was getting too big

(54m 37s)

> But don't don't do this like just release 1.3 with what you want to have what you're having it

(54m 42s)

> Right because what they're doing here is they're going oh, we don't think we'll get everything we want done for 1.3 in the timeline that we want to get 1.3 out

(54m 50s)

> But we still want 1.3 to have all of the things that we said it would have in it

(54m 53s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(54m 55s) **Al:**

> So at like this isn't nobody's gonna look at this

(54m 59s)

> single oh 1.3 is coming later but it's fine because I get some of the

(55m 3s)

> features now no they're gonna go I want the kids to grow up that's the feature

(55m 7s)

> that I cared about and it's not coming yet like so just just change the scope of

(55m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(55m 12s) **Al:**

> 1.3 release 1.3 and then add those other features into 1.4 it is not difficult

(55m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Look.

(55m 17s) **Al:**

> 1.2 b is a stupid version name don't do it oh yeah

(55m 21s) **Kevin:**

> My favorite part of this is that the first part of 1.3 is actually 1.2.

(55m 27s)

[Laughter]

(55m 31s)

> Okay, I will say this.

(55m 32s)

> I get the logic because looking at the list of the updates,

(55m 35s)

> they're adding a haunted house in 1.2B or whatever, right?

(55m 39s)

> They want that out before Halloween.

(55m 42s)

> That's the reason they're splitting.

(55m 42s) **Al:**

> Yes, sure I agree. I am not I am not against them releasing an earlier version and then releasing the other stuff that they haven't got ready for this fashion into the next fashion. I'm totally fine with that the numbers what you doing?

(55m 43s) **Kevin:**

> I can tell you, right?

(55m 44s)

> And that's fair, but like, just change the numbers.

(55m 56s)

> Yeah, oh

(55m 59s)

> There's a jolly's see system coming out

(56m 3s)

> Wait manual say what do you mean manual say it's not out. Okay. I

(56m 9s) **Al:**

> Remember, I mean, Stardew doesn't have manual save, right?

(56m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Didn't know that

(56m 11s)

> Oh my gosh, it doesn't I move what I didn't think about that yeah, I did I mean I

(56m 14s) **Al:**

> Did you forget about that?

(56m 17s)

> You know, of all the things he's added in, he's never added in a manual save, he's still

(56m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Dang

(56m 21s) **Al:**

> just to have the save on sleep.

(56m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Let's create, okay.

(56m 27s) **Al:**

> All right, rant over.

(56m 32s)

> Faith Arm, the drama continues, although I guess it's less drama now and it's more like

(56m 37s)

> Good stuff.

(56m 40s)

> So now that faith farm has been purchased and we can debate whether or not the owners are good or bad, that doesn't be that as it may, the service for faith farm will continue to run.

(56m 56s)

> So that's good at least.

(56m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's launched in 2023. It's been that long that long two years. All right. I get mm. Okay. I

(57m 8s)

> The game's not on paper dead

(57m 12s) **Al:**

> Well, and they've also said that they, uh, so they've said were committed to supporting and growing the community that has made faith farm so special.

(57m 20s)

> This is just the beginning that are more announcements to come about the future of the game, which sounds like they have plans for updates, right? Because you don't say, Oh, we're keeping the servers open. And there are more announcements to come.

(57m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah

(57m 33s)

> Yeah

(57m 33s) **Al:**

> And those announcements are we're going to shut down the servers, right? That's not what you do. That's not good.

(57m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(57m 38s)

> Yeah, but okay, here's the question. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be real. I'm gonna be harsh for a bit

(57m 42s) **Al:**

> Burial Burial Kevin.

(57m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Some games you're gonna wish the service and just close instead of getting updated

(57m 53s) **Al:**

> Tushy

(57m 55s)

> Look some people like this game

(57m 55s) **Kevin:**

> I'm looking at you Overwatch

(57m 58s)

[Laughter]

(57m 58s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(58m)

> All right, we've also got two new games to talk about. Oh, I'm tired

(58m 6s)

> I also got to walk up with a cold this morning, so if that my voice sounds funny, that's why

(58m 11s) **Kevin:**

> what what i'm sorry i'm just reading what wow i've we've been making this podcast for how many years

(58m 20s)

> and not once did I ever think we've been talking about the seven deadly sins anime what

(58m 27s) **Al:**

> The Seven Deadly Sins Origin is an open world anime RPG set in the universe of the Seven Deadly Sins,

(58m 32s)

> step into the role of Prince Tristan of Leon, Leon, and explore an open world Britannia,

(58m 40s)

> as you embark on a journey to restore order to a world thrown into chaos by the collision of time

(58m 45s)

> in space. When it says to Britannia, is that like...

(58m 48s) **Kevin:**

> I've never seen the show. I don't I just know it exists. I know it has a large following. Don't ask me

(58m 53s) **Al:**

> Is that based on because like Britannia is this Roman name for Britain?

(58m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, maybe I don't know like don't ask me

(59m) **Al:**

> Well, I did I did ask you

(59m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Why is this I'm just very confused

(59m 7s) **Al:**

> Wait, it's as well. It's very definitely based on Britain. Let this look at his map

(59m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay, okay, there we go

(59m 15s)

> there's there's the

(59m 17s)

> Britain gold

(59m 18s) **Al:**

> This this game has farming

(59m 18s) **Kevin:**

> All of them are fame. It has a lot of things.

(59m 24s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean like I'm probably not gonna play this game. I'm not vaguely interested in it, but

(59m 29s)

> It was I was it there. I think it was the

(59m 33s)

> Sony state of play it was an instant and I was like watching it going. Oh, yes, this looks very anime and then I saw farming of

(59m 41s)

> goodness sake

(59m 41s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(59m 44s) **Al:**

> So there we go you get that here's a token talk about it

(59m 47s)

> I'm not gonna play it. I'm probably not gonna talk about it on the podcast, but here you go. It exists. If you caterbit this

(59m 59s)

> However, the other new game, we have to talk about...

(1h 6s)

> Petit Planet.

(1h 8s)

> This is a Hollywood-verse farming game,

(1h 13s)

> which brings up lots of questions.

(1h 13s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah. Okay, which I may be able to answer some. So, ask away.

(1h 21s) **Al:**

> Well, so the first question I guess would be is this going to be a gacha game because that's what they that's what the that's what their expertise is, right?

(1h 23s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, no. There there is and to my no, I don't know if the first time I was gotcha. I'm

(1h 34s)

> going. I'm going to say yes by default. I don't actually know, but I'm going to lean towards

(1h 39s)

> - Yes.

(1h 40s) **Al:**

> And then I guess the next question would be,

(1h 41s)

> "How do you do, uh, gotcha farming?"

(1h 44s) **Kevin:**

> - Well, okay, off the top of my head.

(1h 48s)

> You're, it's, you unlock neighbors, basically.

(1h 56s) **Al:**

> Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I could see that that actually that I would be okay with that

(1h 1m 4s)

> Right because I am fine with just not

(1h 1m 11s) **Kevin:**

> not playing

(1h 1m 11s) **Al:**

> But you know like if you took if you took animal crossing for example and instead of like the

(1h 1m 16s)

> Getting the villagers by going out and your thing on your little expeditions instead you just like

(1h 1m 19s) **Kevin:**

> yeah

(1h 1m 22s) **Al:**

> paid money to speed up getting one.

(1h 1m 25s)

> I-I-I don't-

(1h 1m 26s)

> I think that's-I mean, I-I'm not saying it's a good thing. It is probably not great because, you know, some people are gonna do it when they probably shouldn't, but like, there are worse things, I guess?

(1h 1m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 1m 39s) **Al:**

> Realistically, people were paying for that anyway, because what they were doing was they were paying for someone who had it to get rid of them and then you could connect to their game and get them instead.

(1h 1m 45s) **Kevin:**

> I was about to say look at it just

(1h 1m 49s)

> Go back to the Raymond the meepo cards

(1h 1m 50s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, exactly. Exactly. And people cards, that's a good point, and we will-

(1h 1m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, okay, so

(1h 1m 56s) **Al:**

> what cards was just this version of it paying for it, right?

(1h 1m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, there you go. I mean, okay, here's the benefit, right?

(1h 2m 3s)

> Unlike other Mojo games if it's just cosmetic neighbors because obviously we're not combating or whatever

(1h 2m 9s)

> You know, it's not it's it's not influencing gameplay, right in the ZZ certain character

(1h 2m 15s)

> Just better and you got a pull for them or whatever here you're probably you know, not in a mess on any mechanics or

(1h 2m 23s)

> The neighbors won't be tiered by gameplay probably yeah, probably

(1h 2m 28s) **Al:**

> You never knew.

(1h 2m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'm not saying they won't be tiered for other reasons, but

(1h 2m 35s)

> It's interesting though, um, and I don't know it's what it's well because this was

(1h 2m 41s)

> Just shortly after Palafom, like everyone's getting in on-

(1h 2m 45s)

> cottagecore, it's crazy.

(1h 2m 46s) **Al:**

> Well, exactly. Are you surprised. Um, I can't figure out what this is going to be on.

(1h 2m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, it probably, I'll tell you everything.

(1h 2m 56s)

> It's gonna be everything.

(1h 2m 57s) **Al:**

> Okay, because like the trailer doesn't say anything and there is no Wikipedia page for it and their their Twitter

(1h 3m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no, I mean, no.

(1h 3m 5s) **Al:**

> Doesn't say and their website is a dreadful website trying to do anything on that

(1h 3m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's cool. Hmm. I mean, they're gonna aim for mobile dude. Like my audio games from a while

(1h 3m 11s) **Al:**

> um

(1h 3m 16s)

> But while that's the thing, is it just going to be mobile or is it going to be on because all of this seems to be like

(1h 3m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Probably not

(1h 3m 23s) **Al:**

> All the screenshots. I'm seeing Luke

(1h 3m 26s)

> Uh landscape rather than portrait

(1h 3m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I don't think it's going to be just mobile.

(1h 3m 31s)

> They're, they are too dang big and they know that they know that they're going to

(1h 3m 36s)

> aim for everything.

(1h 3m 37s)

> I can't, except for me, the latest game that just came out or it's coming out, I think

(1h 3m 41s) **Al:**

> Oh. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. So the play test that they've got coming

(1h 3m 44s) **Kevin:**

> everything is on everything.

(1h 3m 48s) **Al:**

> up soon is on iOS and Windows. So we at least know two things that it's coming out

(1h 3m 56s)

> on iOS and Windows. Interesting choice that those are the two things that they're doing

(1h 3m 59s) **Kevin:**

> >> And it'll probably go from there.

(1h 4m 3s) **Al:**

> the test on. It does see the test is only available

(1h 4m 11s)

> on iOS and PC brackets windows. We will continue to expand an optimized platform

(1h 4m 16s)

> support in the future. So presumably it is then coming to other things. Yeah. It is very

(1h 4m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, if they're doing PC, it's gonna come.

(1h 4m 25s) **Al:**

> interesting. I mean, in terms of like just talking about this outside of all of its other

(1h 4m 31s)

> context, as our farming life simulation game, it looks fine.

(1h 4m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah a big part of the problem with a lot of mobile marketing it's hard to actually gauge

(1h 4m 42s)

> what the game is like from the bit trailers they put out and that's very much true here.

(1h 4m 44s) **Al:**

> Yes, there is there is a stop motion section they do which shows somebody like building up their little village and it does look very much like a you know, you would expect in the standard farming game life some game so.

(1h 4m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, you're building paths, setting furniture, catching bugs, fences, gardens.

(1h 5m 6s)

> It looks like New Horizons but in Mohoyo flavor, that's all it is.

(1h 5m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't if it wasn't a high-virus game. I don't know if I would be interested in the game

(1h 5m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm, no no it's fair. Yeah, it is fascinating. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I probably

(1h 5m 20s) **Al:**

> Not because I like I've not played any high-virus games, right?

(1h 5m 23s)

> So I'm not interested in it for the lower of the characters just out of the fact that this is fascinating

(1h 5m 28s)

> Right the same thing with pal farm, right? I don't care about the pals. I don't care about pal farm in general

(1h 5m 34s)

> I care about it because it's interesting that this company is making a farming game

(1h 5m 43s) **Kevin:**

> will not play myself. Here's the thing on the hoyo verse, they usually don't cross-pollinate

(1h 5m 45s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(1h 5m 49s) **Kevin:**

> their properties as of right now. So, you know, I'm saying this with the big

(1h 5m 55s)

> asterisk if they ever change that and say certain, I don't know, zenless on zero

(1h 5m 59s)

> character show up and then I'll be the biggest sucker for this game, but it's

(1h 6m 5s)

> just, I don't know. It's crowded space. There's a, I really playin' for copy up, man. That's what it

(1h 6m 12s)

> boys down to you. I like that the dog guy is

(1h 6m 16s) **Al:**

> Oh yes, the other thing, I guess, if it is not a gadget game, does it cost money?

(1h 6m 21s)

> Because...

(1h 6m 22s) **Kevin:**

> That's a good question cuz none of their games cost money right now, I don't think

(1h 6m 25s) **Al:**

> Exactly. So presumably, it's going to be one of the other, right?

(1h 6m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 6m 28s)

> Yeah, I'm presumably. Yeah, I'm gonna guess what may it's yeah

(1h 6m 32s) **Al:**

> So many questions.

(1h 6m 35s) **Kevin:**

> I'm guessing gotcha or micro transaction heavy somehow. I don't know

(1h 6m 40s) **Al:**

> probably, but I just am fascinated to what that looks like and how does the monetization

(1h 6m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I am too

(1h 6m 45s) **Al:**

> work in a farming game?

(1h 6m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, you know, okay, what one thing I will say

(1h 6m 52s)

> I'm trying to just feel out from the trailer like they're showing all these like small planetoids like Mario Galaxy planets

(1h 7m 1s)

> It would be cool if you could go to different ones build up different places, you know

(1h 7m 6s) **Al:**

> Yeah. So from what I what it my assumption based on the trailer is that these are other people's ones.

(1h 7m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's it. That might be it. That's a good point. Yeah. All right. That's fair.

(1h 7m 15s) **Al:**

> Because I'm going to like do do other hoverist games have like multiplayer stuff.

(1h 7m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Not really

(1h 7m 24s) **Al:**

> Okay, but if very much looked like they were going to someone else's thing there,

(1h 7m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that it could be it that you know that that would be that would be a good angle like the first really multiplayer heavy

(1h 7m 28s) **Al:**

> like there were other there were other player characters.

(1h 7m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Muhoyo game. Yeah, that could work

(1h 7m 37s) **Al:**

> And then, and then you suddenly, you suddenly understand why they're doing a farming game if they wanted to make a multiplayer game. This makes sense as a multiplayer game.

(1h 7m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, it does yeah, I agree. Okay. Well, there we go

(1h 7m 48s) **Al:**

> Oh, bye. So much. Uh, next week, we'll have four other new games to talk about. Um.

(1h 7m 53s) **Kevin:**

> No, I sick

(1h 7m 57s) **Al:**

> Okay. Now we're going to talk about Sun Z Island. Uh, I guess quick check on how these things are.

(1h 8m 4s)

> I played and finished the game, Kevin, watch your status on

(1h 8m 7s) **Kevin:**

> I played, did not finish, based off the upgrade pads, I think about it about halfway, but you know,

(1h 8m 13s) **Al:**

> fair enough. Yeah. Oh, well, yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely. It's, uh, yeah. It's a very clear

(1h 8m 14s) **Kevin:**

> I get the, I get the gist. Yep. What's your, wait, what's your playtime? That's important.

(1h 8m 22s) **Al:**

> what you're wanting to do. Um, okay. What's my playtime? Let me check my playtime. I think

(1h 8m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I believe you said 13 hours roughly.

(1h 8m 32s) **Al:**

> so. Let me double check. Uh, yeah, 13 hours to 100% the game. Um, which is a thing. I mean,

(1h 8m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's a $10 game. It's 13 hour. You're in 10 13 hours. It's

(1h 8m 41s) **Al:**

> I like that sort of size of game.

(1h 8m 44s)

> Well, $10 if you're buying it, Phil Price.

(1h 8m 48s)

> I mean, did you pay what what $2 for it?

(1h 8m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yep. Yep. That's correct.

(1h 8m 51s) **Al:**

> Was it? I paid zero dollars for it because for some reason I got it free like six months ago.

(1h 8m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 8m 58s)

> No, I'm there.

(1h 8m 59s) **Al:**

> I don't know how that happened.

(1h 9m 1s)

> I thought it was on sale for like 50% off went on to an apparently in the UK story.

(1h 9m 6s)

> It was free. It was very confused.

(1h 9m 8s)

> So I was like, okay, I'll buy this then.

(1h 9m 8s) **Kevin:**

> you go. Okay. So the game is you are a cat. I think you have a name. I don't remember

(1h 9m 13s) **Al:**

> I don't think that matters.

(1h 9m 17s) **Kevin:**

> it, but a cat with a little sun like Pikmin style sunflower thing on your head. Every character

(1h 9m 21s) **Al:**

> >> Yeah.

(1h 9m 27s) **Kevin:**

> has that. They're like, that's the lore of the game. Everyone's born with a little Pikmin

(1h 9m 32s)

> flower on their head saying, "This is what you're going to do. You're going to be a carpenter

(1h 9m 34s)

> or blanks made with yada yada, yada.

(1h 9m 37s) **Al:**

> the sun. I get that they're doing the sun equals farming but it just feels a little bit less.

(1h 9m 38s) **Kevin:**

> yeah, you're going to be yeah, I think well that's a thing because in the little story you're like the last one to put because all these characters are coming off a tree basically and you're the last one to come out and nobody knows what yours is that's part of the question like what one on earth is that's supposed to be and you've caught them just as the village your little world has kind of deteriorated so you are now trying to

(1h 9m 43s) **Al:**

> It makes less sense than the rest of them, I think.

(1h 10m 8s) **Kevin:**

> rebuild the town and village and whatnot and so in my opinion my interpretation is you're the son because you've now become the center of the solar system universe whatever you're you're bringing life and light to this place and helping you grow that yes, okay, just take it like one or two says for the same idea you're helping you grow yeah, okay, but all right so but that's the point you're

(1h 10m 20s) **Al:**

> Oh interesting. See I just I just did it as crops need sun. I'm very literal.

(1h 10m 38s) **Kevin:**

> building up the island you know and let's get into it because it's a very to the point game oh that's a good idea I think overall I like it I give it a thumbs up the big winner is the art style right it's very cute like storybook sort of art style the presentations lovely the game runs well there's no

(1h 10m 44s) **Al:**

> Alright, do you want to talk about it in general how you feel about the game before we get into the individual mechanic?

(1h 11m 8s) **Kevin:**

> vlogs or crashes that I've encountered and it again keeping in mind the price and the you know scope like I think it does its job well but you know I think like some overall issues like it's very grindy repetitive sort of stuff what about UL

(1h 11m 28s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, I think I'd mostly agree with that.

(1h 11m 30s)

> Certainly in terms of the hundreds of farming games

(1h 11m 34s)

> that existed is a more interesting looking one

(1h 11m 37s)

> graphically than many of them.

(1h 11m 40s)

> The animations are quite simple, but it's okay, that's fine.

(1h 11m 47s)

> I guess what I would say about this is it's fine

(1h 11m 52s)

> and I had fun, but there was nothing

(1h 11m 53s)

> that stood out to me as amazing or interesting.

(1h 11m 58s)

> It's just, it is what it is, I guess.

(1h 12m 2s)

> And I guess it's trying to do some things

(1h 12m 5s)

> in terms of your relationships with the other people

(1h 12m 7s)

> and like you're talking to them and you get a little bit

(1h 12m 9s)

> of their story and then you do a little thing for them

(1h 12m 11s)

> and then you get more of their story

(1h 12m 13s)

> and then you're finished their quest line.

(1h 12m 17s)

> But I didn't find anybody's story interesting.

(1h 12m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's the week part, the week is part for sure like the villagers are cute designs or whatever, but you get so little out of them.

(1h 12m 30s) **Al:**

> Yeah. And they don't have a life outside of their shop. Every person that you get,

(1h 12m 30s) **Kevin:**

> And in a village based game, that's kind of fundamental.

(1h 12m 39s) **Al:**

> that you bring back to the island has a shop and they spend their entire time from the moment

(1h 12m 46s)

> you wake up to the moment you collapse on the ground in their shop. And you don't even really

(1h 12m 53s)

> talk to them directly. You're talking to them through the cash register. Like, you walk up to

(1h 13m)

> them and you can't do anything. You walk up to the cash register in the shop and you can then

(1h 13m 4s)

> click on that and either talk to them or buy from their shop. And so it very much feels like you are

(1h 13m 8s)

> there as a prop. And if I'm going to talk to you, it's like kind of accidental through this feature.

(1h 13m 15s)

> And once you're finished with your questline, you can't even talk to them after that. You can

(1h 13m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 13m 20s)

> Which is really disheartening

(1h 13m 23s)

> Yeah, that's kind of the the weakest point the the scope is our scale the game is limited and you can really feel those limitations

(1h 13m 32s)

> especially the villagers

(1h 13m 33s) **Al:**

> And I guess that's the problem as like yes, that is where it's weakest, but it's also where it tries to be strongest

(1h 13m 40s)

> Because it's it's trying to do story

(1h 13m 44s)

> But and realistically you've got to do something interesting to stand out from the crowd on these farming games, right?

(1h 13m 50s)

> Because there's so many of them now

(1h 13m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't like

(1h 13m 52s) **Al:**

> And so it tries to do that with story, but it doesn't really do it

(1h 13m 57s)

> It dips its toe in the water and goes hey, we have story ideas and you're like, okay, you're gonna

(1h 14m 3s)

> Do anything with that? No, no, what I'm gonna do anything with that is weird

(1h 14m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Nope. Like, I was labeling this in my head for a minute as probably the best cookie clicker ever made,

(1h 14m 15s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 14m 15s) **Kevin:**

> because well, let's get into some of the other gameplay, right? Because that's what's driving

(1h 14m 21s)

> at the gameplay loop of collect resources, build an upgrade, a building. Like, the first, you have,

(1h 14m 30s)

> you know, you're standard, you walk around, there's a stamina system.

(1h 14m 35s)

> And pretty almost everything costs them, except picking up a few things.

(1h 14m 41s) **Al:**

> Well, so yeah, so that's interesting that you say accept a couple things but one of those things is fishing

(1h 14m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 14m 47s) **Al:**

> Fishing doesn't cost stamina, which is weird

(1h 14m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Fishing is weird cuz it also doesn't eat up time

(1h 14m 52s) **Al:**

> It does it doesn't you can basically fish infinitely in one day. It is such a bizarre way

(1h 14m 55s) **Kevin:**

> You can't I

(1h 14m 58s) **Al:**

> It like you lose like you lose like two minutes

(1h 14m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Did that I didn't have to worry about money ever again

(1h 15m 1s) **Al:**

> You lose like two minutes each time you fish and then other than that. It's so like you can you can go through so much fishing this game

(1h 15m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I like I when I did a ton of fishing like the first day or two and you know basically solve my money problem and have to worry about that

(1h 15m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. Oh, there is, there is no money problem in this game because as soon as you

(1h 15m 20s) **Kevin:**

> But yeah, so you're

(1h 15m 23s) **Al:**

> start getting animals, the money rolls in as well. Like if I, if I look, I currently in

(1h 15m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's true

(1h 15m 29s) **Al:**

> my game, I have 290,000 money and there's nothing to buy. Right? Like things cost like 500

(1h 15m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's correct!

(1h 15m 40s) **Al:**

> to rebuild a shop. Right? Like it's not, and I have nearly 300 grand.

(1h 15m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 15m 46s) **Al:**

> Right? Like you're, you're, there's no such thing. Like it doesn't, it, money is not a problem

(1h 15m 52s)

> in this game ever. Like from the moment you start to the moment you end, you are never

(1h 15m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yep, stamina is probably the real kicker. I'd say especially in the first half of the game.

(1h 16m 4s) **Al:**

> It's the most limiting factor, you use a lot of stamina for a lot of things, not just early on, farming is brittle the whole time, it costs five stamina to water, and you start with a hundred stamina, and so yeah, our plant or pick is like five stamina, so if you have a full thing of

(1h 16m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, especially early on farming is brutal.

(1h 16m 23s)

> Or, Poe or Plant or Pick. Yeah.

(1h 16m 34s) **Al:**

> far crops, that's the word, farming things, crops, let me double check how many it is in the...it is four by six or 24, so that is a hundred and twenty stamina just to water everything, and let me remind you, you start the game with a hundred stamina, you can't water everything! (laughs)

(1h 16m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 16m 41s)

> It's like this

(1h 16m 46s)

> Yeah, there you go, so it is

(1h 16m 52s)

> Yeah, so you got to find food lying around the ground. Yeah

(1h 16m 59s)

> It's wild and

(1h 17m 1s)

> I'm jumping a little here, but the way farming works like if you don't water doesn't grow.

(1h 17m 6s)

> It's not gonna die, but it doesn't grow. It just sits there. So you have to water if you want to progress.

(1h 17m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 17m 11s)

> And so much of the game is so much of the story is progressed by the farming

(1h 17m 17s)

> Like, you know, a lot of the things that people need for you to get them back to the island or to progress their story

(1h 17m 24s)

> Requires you to farm things, which is fine. It's all tied together, right? Like it's it's all mostly fetch quests tied together

(1h 17m 25s) **Kevin:**

> It's quite a sense.

(1h 17m 27s)

> - Yeah.

(1h 17m 32s) **Al:**

> with story

(1h 17m 34s)

> And like, you kind of have to do everything a kind of similar piece.

(1h 17m 39s)

> It's to complete the game, which actually does mean that you finish the game kind of roughly similar in everything right I there was a couple of things that I had to like grind for at the end of the game, but because of how it's all tied together most of the things were all done at the same sort of time, because it gets you through all these features.

(1h 18m 4s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(1h 18m 7s) **Al:**

> it's like, you know, you're, you're.

(1h 18m 9s)

> You're first cooking will be because someone asks you for a meal and you're like,

(1h 18m 11s)

> oh, I can do all this cooking. That's, that's great. Um, it kind of,

(1h 18m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. What's nice is it is, and I think part of it is you can see a lot of the big upgrades, you know,

(1h 18m 16s) **Al:**

> that is nicely tied together.

(1h 18m 21s) **Kevin:**

> buildings and stuff. Like they show you what materials you're going to need. So as soon as you unlock

(1h 18m 26s)

> them, you can just load up on them. And so you don't want to reach the next step of the quest. You

(1h 18m 31s)

> You can just drop a mountain of resources and just upgrade all the way.

(1h 18m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I don't other kind of controls based things. Uh, I'm not a fan of how slow the walking is

(1h 18m 44s)

> and like your toggle running and then running becomes the default speed. And I'm just like,

(1h 18m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yup. Yup.

(1h 18m 50s) **Al:**

> why do they even have bother having two speeds? Why would you ever want the walking speed?

(1h 18m 54s)

> There's no negative to doing the running and it's a toggle. So you just like, you toggle on

(1h 18m 58s)

> and then you're running. And then the only time you ever have to do it again is because you've

(1h 19m 2s)

> accidentally hit the button. And you're now walking again. It's such a weird thing.

(1h 19m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yup. And then you just get, it's just a frustration point. And something important. There's a,

(1h 19m 10s)

> you know, as most of these farming games, you have day, night, time, clock. And this is like

(1h 19m 17s)

> where it's going by real fast. You get a day done in, I don't know, a couple of minutes.

(1h 19m 23s)

> Because the clock is moving. So you can not afford to walk. It's not just the preference. Like,

(1h 19m 29s)

> you walk, you will not be able to do a lot in your day. I agree with you. It is kind of baffling how

(1h 19m 35s)

> slow the walking is slash wide exists to begin with. Um,

(1h 19m 39s) **Al:**

> So yeah, the first thing you do is you've got the gathering, you get wood from trees and you get stone, I think, it's been a week since I've played the game.

(1h 19m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it is with chop your, yeah, pick your stir rocks, chop your trees, get your wooden stone.

(1h 19m 49s) **Al:**

> Is it stone, is that what it is?

(1h 19m 54s)

> Yeah, and you use them to like you fix a bridge first and then you like build a, I can't even remember what the first shop is.

(1h 20m 3s) **Kevin:**

> It's the lumberjack and the blacksmith because they're the one who processed stuff because you get the raw wood and stone

(1h 20m 4s) **Al:**

> There you go. Yes, of course.

(1h 20m 7s)

> Yeah.

(1h 20m 9s) **Kevin:**

> But then you got to process something into bricks and you know like wood planks or whatever

(1h 20m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1h 20m 13s)

> Yeah.

(1h 20m 15s)

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point.

(1h 20m 17s)

> So you're, yeah. It's, it's a gathering and building thing to start with

(1h 20m 22s)

> certainly and then eventually you get to farming because I don't know about you,

(1h 20m 26s)

> but I started the game and I was like, where, where's my seeds? How do I get seeds?

(1h 20m 29s)

> How do I do the farming? And they just randomly start getting them from

(1h 20m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yep

(1h 20m 32s) **Al:**

> quests and it's actually quite late on that you build the shop that lets you buy.

(1h 20m 39s)

> more seeds. And by that time, I had hundreds of seeds. Like I, I, I basically never

(1h 20m 45s)

> bought it. I maybe bought like four tomato seeds because I needed them for one

(1h 20m 49s)

> recipe that I'd mucked up earlier. That's it. You don't, I, I didn't buy anything

(1h 20m 54s)

> else, any other seeds because you keep getting the seeds.

(1h 20m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the quests because that's the other driving factor like getting the quest right the rewards are very generous

(1h 21m 6s)

> They give you a lot of seeds. Oh my I agree

(1h 21m 9s)

> I unlocked the herbalist the person sells the seeds and I haven't bought anything around me there

(1h 21m 14s)

> And and that's and you know everything we've talked about this point build up a building do some quests and then that unlocks

(1h 21m 22s)

> You know an item. Oh, you know

(1h 21m 25s)

> I think to keep our missing here.

(1h 21m 28s)

> You're on an island, right? So you have travel to other islands, that three collect different types of resources.

(1h 21m 33s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's very much like the the animal crossing islands, the way you travel to them.

(1h 21m 35s) **Kevin:**

> And so... Yeah.

(1h 21m 40s) **Al:**

> It's basically like that, except you unlock travel passes to the different islands.

(1h 21m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 21m 47s)

> Yep.

(1h 21m 47s) **Al:**

> So you start off just on one island and after a certain time you get travel pass and you can go

(1h 21m 51s)

> to the next island and then you get another travel pass and you can get to the next island.

(1h 21m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yep.

(1h 21m 56s)

> Yeah. And...

(1h 21m 56s) **Al:**

> That was an interesting way of doing that. It worked fine because it kind of like got you

(1h 22m)

> because there would be no point in going to the next island because you could.

(1h 22m 3s)

> And you wouldn't have your your your pickaxe upgraded to the right point to be able to actually do it yet and you've got things still to do on that island. So it kind of felt like it was nicely guiding you through everything.

(1h 22m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, absolutely. It was, yeah, the progression was intuitive, um, but, uh, but this is kind of the hard to get the game, right? Like this is why I call it like the ultimate cookie clicker case, you build up a building, you unlock a new island, maybe you go get the resource from the new island, there's a villager that you can having to move, but you have to go do a quest, so you do some farming.

(1h 22m 44s)

> and then their quest reward will be a pass to the next island and rinse and repeat.

(1h 22m 49s)

> I wish I had a little more flavor, a little more soul with the villagers talking with

(1h 23m 13s)

> them and interacting with them, not just all about the quests or whatever.

(1h 23m 13s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 23m 18s)

> You mentioned the processing of items. Let's go back to that a little bit because there's a couple of weird things for it

(1h 23m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

(1h 23m 24s) **Al:**

> first of all

(1h 23m 26s)

> it processes

(1h 23m 28s)

> real-time

(1h 23m 29s)

> Where is the rest of the game doesn't so if you if you go to sleep

(1h 23m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. It is very weird. Yeah. Yeah, or or even in the menu, because how

(1h 23m 36s) **Al:**

> Nothing is processed in that time because you've been sleeping, right? It's like immediate, right?

(1h 23m 41s)

> But if you pause the game

(1h 23m 43s)

> And go away and come back

(1h 23m 46s)

> It processes while you're paused because it's processing real-time

(1h 23m 52s) **Kevin:**

> our works is you go to the menu, let's say the lumberjack, you go to the menu, and

(1h 23m 56s)

> there's basically a slot put in the wood plant, you know, the wood logs here.

(1h 24m)

> And then you see the bar filling as it's, it's selling them into wood planks coming out.

(1h 24m 5s)

> You can stay in that menu and just watch the bars go. Time does not pass, like in that

(1h 24m 8s) **Al:**

> Yeah. No. It's, it's, it's just really weird that everything else is based on the internal game clock, except processing, that what runs real time. I don't understand why it happens that way. But here we are.

(1h 24m 9s) **Kevin:**

> menu, but stuff gets processed. Yep. Yeah.

(1h 24m 24s)

> Yeah, yeah, I don't know or better and for worse because you can use yeah

(1h 24m 26s) **Al:**

> Weird.

(1h 24m 29s)

> Yeah, both. Definitely both.

(1h 24m 31s) **Kevin:**

> What are you gonna do?

(1h 24m 32s) **Al:**

> There's also another complaint about process, no, I complained about processing. There's a button that allows you to.

(1h 24m 38s)

> add. So if you press like the a bot, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So if you press the a button that adds one thing into the processing thing, if you press why it adds 10 and if you press X, it adds all of them, but it doesn't tell you that on the screen.

(1h 24m 40s) **Kevin:**

> What?

(1h 24m 52s)

> Oh, I hate this.

(1h 24m 56s) **Al:**

> The only reason I tried that is because that's the case for putting things into the chest. And I was like, Oh, I wonder if it does that in this menu as well, and it does.

(1h 24m 59s) **Kevin:**

> The chest, when you move stuff.

(1h 25m 4s)

> I hate that you got.

(1h 25m 8s) **Al:**

> And I find that right at the end of the game. So my entire 13 hours, I wasn't doing that.

(1h 25m 13s) **Kevin:**

> I've been mashing so much aid and put all those blogs in the lumberjack.

(1h 25m 19s) **Al:**

> It was the most annoying thing about the game tapping a to get a hundred hundred rocks into this processing thing.

(1h 25m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, my good.

(1h 25m 30s) **Al:**

> So terrible.

(1h 25m 33s)

> Okay, processing is fine other than that it's anything else we

(1h 25m 38s)

> talk about farming we talked about the stamina thing being weird other than

(1h 25m 42s)

> that is kind of fine right like you you tell the land you put this the seeden

(1h 25m 47s)

> new water and then eventually after a few days it grows. Oh I will say okay one

(1h 25m 53s)

> thing I really like about the game I love the designs of all the crops and the

(1h 25m 57s)

> animals they're all very unique I like how it did that.

(1h 26m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, very stylized absolutely tomato pank. It's look a little gross. I will say but

(1h 26m 6s)

> Overall, yes

(1h 26m 6s) **Al:**

> low pimples.

(1h 26m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's basically it. I don't like it

(1h 26m 8s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 26m 11s) **Kevin:**

> But my agree. Yeah, the the visual aspect is top notch in this game across the board

(1h 26m 17s) **Al:**

> um animals are interesting um have you done animals yet? I don't know if you're that far yet.

(1h 26m 23s) **Kevin:**

> I was starting, too.

(1h 26m 25s) **Al:**

> So you get them and the first day you don't do anything and they give you a crop the net

(1h 26m 31s)

> uh an output the next day but after that you have to give them feed you put feed in their

(1h 26m 37s)

> trough and then if you do that the next day they'll have their output great but see if you

(1h 26m 44s)

> forget to pick it up one day. It's gone the next.

(1h 26m 47s)

> You can't pick it up the next day, but that means that you just lose that, right? Because then they don't have it for the next day either because you've not put the it's like they're eating. They're product, but it doesn't actually do anything because it doesn't give them another product.

(1h 26m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Oh yeah!

(1h 26m 58s)

> Mm-hmm, which

(1h 27m 1s)

> Yep

(1h 27m 1s) **Al:**

> Like it's just you just lose that day completely and you have to give them more feed and get the product the next day. It's really, I think this is this is I don't understand why it does that. I just forget that you have the thing there.

(1h 27m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Let's

(1h 27m 8s)

> Oh, that's a little rough

(1h 27m 15s) **Al:**

> if you go to sleep.

(1h 27m 17s)

> You can then start selling that the product that they have and like within a couple of days you can buy another one and then it's like then a couple of days later you can buy another two and then a couple of the and you just it just exponentially increases the amount of money you have.

(1h 27m 45s)

> have, it's wild how much?

(1h 27m 47s)

> The animals give you like if I didn't need the crops for the cooking, I wouldn't have continued to farm because the animals are just such big money makers.

(1h 27m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Um, and that's, that's kind of, uh, I think another

(1h 28m 4s)

> limitation of the game. Once you're kind of done with the resource, you

(1h 28m 8s)

> don't really need it for anything. So, you know, like, why ever go back to the

(1h 28m 14s)

> basic, what a rock. It would have been nice if there were, I don't know,

(1h 28m 17s)

> like furniture you could craft or something, but, uh, I don't know, just

(1h 28m 21s)

> Once you're done, you're kind of done.

(1h 28m 23s) **Al:**

> Um, I don't think, I think we can have already talked about the islands and, uh, fishing.

(1h 28m 28s)

> Oh, we didn't talk about them any game.

(1h 28m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, we didn't talk about fishing. It's it's stardew

(1h 28m 31s) **Al:**

> I hate it.

(1h 28m 32s) **Kevin:**

> It's it is worse than stardew. It's the same idea of stardew of the bobber moving up and down and trying to stay on the fish

(1h 28m 40s)

> But like the timing of it isn't great

(1h 28m 44s) **Al:**

> The gravity is worse in this the gravity is lower so if you accidentally tap higher than the fish you're probably lost it

(1h 28m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 28m 51s)

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 28m 52s) **Al:**

> You're not it's not gonna come down quickly enough

(1h 28m 54s) **Kevin:**

> It is yeah, and it's rough

(1h 28m 59s)

> Yeah, it is aggravating a lot several fish because of that you you

(1h 29m 3s)

> Yeah, I'm out of hand. The the fish you mean to get like it's it's start to put worse because it's dead

(1h 29m 5s) **Al:**

> Like, like many things you get used to it, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it, right?

(1h 29m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 29m 12s)

> Yeah, I agree

(1h 29m 12s) **Al:**

> I got better at it, but I still wasn't enjoying it and one side caught every fish I was

(1h 29m 17s)

> done.

(1h 29m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, that's correct

(1h 29m 18s) **Al:**

> I have a bunch of bullet points that didn't really fit into any of those individual sections

(1h 29m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 29m 26s)

> That last one's the last one.

(1h 29m 26s) **Al:**

> that I just want to go through.

(1h 29m 28s) **Kevin:**

> This one's a good one. Let's get to it.

(1h 29m 29s) **Al:**

> So first of all, when you finish the game, this is spoilers.

(1h 29m 33s) **Kevin:**

> That's fine. We'll live.

(1h 29m 36s) **Al:**

> There's like, you finish it, you grow the tree, and then it goes at like two pages

(1h 29m 42s)

> of story from the beginning story.

(1h 29m 45s)

> And I can't even remember what it was, but it was like, oh, maybe we were here to bring

(1h 29m 50s)

> the tree back, you know, like, uh-huh, obviously.

(1h 29m 52s)

> And that's it.

(1h 29m 53s)

> There's nothing else.

(1h 29m 54s)

> Like, nobody comments on the fact that you've done it.

(1h 29m 56s)

> There's no celebration.

(1h 29m 57s)

> There's nothing that's just, it's just it.

(1h 29m 59s)

> That's, that's, that's your done.

(1h 30m) **Kevin:**

> No party!

(1h 30m) **Al:**

> And because, and because this is on the switch, there's no achievements either.

(1h 30m 6s)

> Like, how do you know you've actually finished the game?

(1h 30m 8s)

> Tree's growing.

(1h 30m 9s)

> Is that it?

(1h 30m 10s)

> Maybe.

(1h 30m 11s)

> I don't know.

(1h 30m 12s)

> I don't know if that's it.

(1h 30m 13s)

> I think it's it.

(1h 30m 14s)

> I'm pretty sure that's it.

(1h 30m 17s)

> I'm pretty sure it's done.

(1h 30m 17s)

> I don't know.

(1h 30m 20s)

> The menus don't support the D-pad and that's very annoying, especially as it has some weirdness

(1h 30m 27s)

> in terms of if you open a menu and your analog stick was still slightly too

(1h 30m 35s)

> way.

(1h 30m 49s) **Kevin:**

> I'll pick in the right seat. Yup.

(1h 30m 50s) **Al:**

> Yes, you tell the land and you put in a seed and then you move immediately to the right

(1h 30m 55s)

> and you press the button to put a seed in, but then it's still registered the fact that

(1h 31m)

> you were very slightly touching the analog stick.

(1h 31m 3s)

> for it moves on to the second.

(1h 31m 5s)

> you're on autopilot because you're like, I have eight tomato seeds that I'm trying to do here

(1h 31m 11s)

> and the tomato seed was the first one when I went to the last one so of course it will be the

(1h 31m 16s)

> first one when I go to this one as well so you tap a a a a oh wait no I just I just pumpkin in the

(1h 31m 24s)

> ground. How did that happen? Because I happened to be slightly touching the analog stick when I was

(1h 31m 30s)

> moving to the right, and I tapped the menu. It's a very annoying, I

(1h 31m 35s)

> heated with passion.

(1h 31m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's not great. I've many accidental clicks or selections in this game. It's not fun

(1h 31m 44s) **Al:**

> uh ba ba ba ba what else um oh yes so selling items uh go into what's called a chest right it's

(1h 31m 52s)

> not a shipping container it's a chest uh which I feel like could be very confusing the first time

(1h 31m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 31m 57s) **Al:**

> I did it I didn't know what I was doing I assumed it was going to sell them because it was sitting

(1h 32m 1s)

> outside my house but there wasn't another chest except there was another chest is in a different

(1h 32m 2s) **Kevin:**

> It's in the position. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's one thing about the game. It has tutorials, but it's all inside a menu. You don't actually, it doesn't pop up to let you know anything.

(1h 32m 7s) **Al:**

> building. There's a building with an actual chest in it where you store stuff.

(1h 32m 22s) **Kevin:**

> So, you know, I don't know, because, you know, there's tutorials, you have extremes on both.

(1h 32m 32s)

> And right, you have hand holding and everything to everything popping up. But then there's this where there's the toys. You want to go look at it. And hope it's nice to get a little guidance on some stuff like this, you know, but I don't know. I've never thought about it. I'm a busy man. I have stuff to do before midday.

(1h 32m 44s) **Al:**

> Yeah. You can't sleep in the bed before midday. That's annoying. Why is that the case?

(1h 32m 56s)

> Yeah, but then at the end of the game when you're trying to speedrun the last three

(1h 33m 3s)

> cooking things that you haven't done and you're trying to get through seven days of growing

(1h 33m 6s) **Kevin:**

> ooh yeah who that's a good point

(1h 33m 8s) **Al:**

> pumpkins. I don't want to do other things. I want to wake up watching.

(1h 33m 14s)

> my plants and go to sleep, but I have to do other stuff until it's midday. Why midday, specifically,

(1h 33m 17s) **Kevin:**

> that's I don't know

(1h 33m 18s) **Al:**

> what weird time? Why is it okay to sleep at midday, but not 11am? Like I would get if it was later,

(1h 33m 24s)

> that's a weird time. Also, don't do it later. That's bad. The pause menu has two items, resume and

(1h 33m 33s)

> back to main menu. If you click back to menu menu, have you done that at all in this game?

(1h 33m 37s) **Kevin:**

> I have it more than once more than once, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

(1h 33m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah, accidentally pressed it. There's no confirmation. So you click it and you've lost your day.

(1h 33m 44s)

> And of course, as we mentioned, there are issues with the menu, registering movement when you

(1h 33m 49s)

> didn't realize you were doing that. I've done that so many times. I've lost most of a day because I

(1h 33m 56s)

> just marked that up.

(1h 33m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Also like the visual part of it, like which a menu item you're selected, it's not

(1h 34m 5s)

> Super Bowl like it makes a button lighter

(1h 34m 7s)

> but like it's on a light of like wooden light brown background so

(1h 34m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah. And also the problem, the problem so many, so many UIs do this where they have, oh,

(1h 34m 17s)

> the item you've selected is a different color. Okay, great. What if there are two items?

(1h 34m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, like on this menu.

(1h 34m 23s) **Al:**

> Which, how, how do you know, how do you know which item is? Which color is the right color?

(1h 34m 30s)

> How, how you meant to know that? If you, if you've got three or more, sure, two of them

(1h 34m 34s)

> one color and one is the other color. But when you've got two eighths

(1h 34m 37s)

> them, how are you meant to know? I agree, 100%. And finally, my

(1h 34m 39s) **Kevin:**

> You're up, yeah, be up.

(1h 34m 45s) **Al:**

> other random thought that didn't fit into anything. Why is there a letter box?

(1h 34m 46s) **Kevin:**

> I love this one

(1h 34m 50s) **Al:**

> There's a letter box. I have never once. I have completed the game and I

(1h 34m 50s) **Kevin:**

> So you don't get anything? Oh, that's great. I love that

(1h 34m 54s) **Al:**

> haven't once seen a letter in that letter box. I don't understand why there's

(1h 35m)

> a letter box in this game. My only thing I can think of is there is a DLC for

(1h 35m 5s)

> This game, have you seen that?

(1h 35m 7s) **Kevin:**

> I I got it. I am not touched it. You there's an extra island. I did not get a letter about the DLC

(1h 35m 8s) **Al:**

> Oh, you did.

(1h 35m 12s)

> Oh, see, that was my question. I was wondering if that was, if that bit, okay.

(1h 35m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Nope

(1h 35m 17s)

> It's an island. Maybe if I go there I could get it. I haven't actually done anything with the DLC

(1h 35m 22s)

> But I didn't even get any letter saying hey you get the DLC. No

(1h 35m 27s) **Al:**

> Well, I don't know why there's a letter box in this game. I've not once had a letter and I've completed the game

(1h 35m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I don't know

(1h 35m 31s)

> That's crazy

(1h 35m 32s) **Al:**

> I've I think I've hundred presented the game cuz I think you need to do everything like you have to have all of the

(1h 35m 39s)

> All of the fish all of the plushies all of the

(1h 35m 45s)

> Bugs all of the

(1h 35m 47s)

> Artifacts all of the cooking meals meals. There's the word. You have to have all of them to grow the tree

(1h 35m 55s)

> I don't think there is anything else you could

(1h 35m 57s)

> can do in the game so I think I have 100% of it and I haven't had a single letter.

(1h 36m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 36m 8s)

> I don't know

(1h 36m 11s)

> Nah, that's it. Like there's a lot of great things. You've heard we got a list of stuff that's questionable

(1h 36m 18s)

> Aggravating at times, but and the bigger thing is like

(1h 36m 22s)

> You know, you wish you could interact the villagers make it feel like an island more. You know the

(1h 36m 27s)

> Not just hey go to the next

(1h 36m 29s)

> quest or whatever, but that's kind of what it is.

(1h 36m 32s)

> So it's a shade too because it looks it's such a beautiful art style.

(1h 36m 37s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know. I can't tell whether we're coming across a positive or negative about this game

(1h 36m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, like I

(1h 36m 47s) **Al:**

> Look I paid zero pounds for it and I had a lot of fun for that money

(1h 36m 51s)

> You paid two dollars and it sounds like had more than two dollars worth of fun out

(1h 36m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Absolutely yeah, even you pay I would pay full price for this game

(1h 37m)

> I think I'd be okay with that. It's not a bad game by any means

(1h 37m 4s)

> But is it for everyone? No, I don't know. I just look at it. I guess

(1h 37m 10s)

> See if you want it. I don't know. I did

(1h 37m 13s)

> I don't want it. I'm not saying I'm not recommending it, but am I gonna recommend it? No, I guess if you want like you said, it's fine

(1h 37m 18s) **Al:**

> I mean, I think what I would say is if you are looking for a small, short farming game and

(1h 37m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, do you like those checklists number go big yep like

(1h 37m 31s) **Al:**

> you don't care about characters, this is good for you.

(1h 37m 36s)

> If you like characters, play Firefly Village, who is talking about last week, I think that's

(1h 37m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, yeah, I again back to my label best cookie clicker for me

(1h 37m 42s) **Al:**

> better for characters.

(1h 37m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I don't know what else is it yeah, yeah

(1h 37m 52s) **Al:**

> And yeah, it's fun. I enjoy it. It's not going to be my game of the year, but I enjoyed it.

(1h 37m 59s)

> All right. Thank you, Kevin, for joining me to talk about this game. Is there anything you would like to say to the audience?

(1h 38m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Thank you. Oh

(1h 38m 5s)

> Yeah, I don't know I'm not doing anything interesting. I'm fine. I'm good. Thank you. I

(1h 38m 8s) **Al:**

> He's doing our good look at his art.

(1h 38m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Do I just the rumors have it I've made ours don't post it

(1h 38m 15s)

> I'm very bad

(1h 38m 15s) **Al:**

> Well, post it then. Goodness me.

(1h 38m 17s) **Kevin:**

> I did on the discord. I didn't post it up. No, wait. I did did I think I did I don't remember I look

(1h 38m 23s)

> look, I'm also a spider squared, artist squared.

(1h 38m 30s) **Al:**

> All right, you can find the podcast on Tumblr and on blue sky at THS pod.

(1h 38m 34s)

> You can send us feedback on our website harvest season.club.

(1h 38m 39s)

> We have a working feedback form on there just now.

(1h 38m 43s)

> You can also find links to everything to do with the podcast including a link to our

(1h 38m 47s)

> patreon patreon.com/thspod where you can get access to a slack and talk to us all about

(1h 38m 54s)

> the silly things we are up to. People on there are just experiencing stardew for the first

(1h 39m)

> time. So that's fun to watch. It has. It has. You can also get access to our bonus episodes of

(1h 39m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's, uh, it's like, it's been popping off lately.

(1h 39m 7s) **Al:**

> the podcast. What was the one we just did recently? Oh, the superhero films. Yes, I finally watched

(1h 39m 12s) **Kevin:**

> super hero films. Okay. Okay. Okay.

(1h 39m 16s) **Al:**

> Red Sonja to finish off the list of... and it is fine. You know, I will say we talked about the fact

(1h 39m 25s)

> that obviously she's in the comics is quite a...

(1h 39m 30s) **Kevin:**

> the thing. Yeah. Yeah. Melgate's designed. Yep. Yeah.

(1h 39m 31s) **Al:**

> a bit of bare bodied, shall we say, not a lot of coverage.

(1h 39m 35s)

> They do a joke about that in the film where she's given basically the size of thing that she gets in the comic books and she's like,

(1h 39m 44s)

> "Am I really meant to be waiting this?"

(1h 39m 47s)

> And then later on she gets to select a different item of clothing and it's because she complains about how little coverage it has for not...

(1h 39m 58s)

> It's not about, like, looks, it's about...

(1h 40m)

> Because obviously she's fighting, that's her thing, and she's complaining about how little protection there is, but when she gets another thing to replace it with, it has almost no more protection.

(1h 40m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 40m 11s) **Al:**

> It is almost the same. It's maybe got, like, an extra, like, two centimeters at the bottom of the bikini, and it's bizarre how they're, like, self-aware about the clothes, but then don't actually do anything if to fix it.

(1h 40m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's great. I love it. Good times.

(1h 40m 32s)

> Let's make a joke about it because we're aware, but they're not actually interested.

(1h 40m 36s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so it was it was fine when I was completing the superhero films. I don't think it was it would never have cropped cracked the top three that we talked about, but it's probably better than Henry Danger for me.

(1h 40m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 40m 50s)

> Well, okay

(1h 40m 54s)

> I believe you

(1h 40m 56s) **Al:**

> All right, I think that's everything then. Thank you, Kevin again for joining me.

(1h 41m 2s) **Kevin:**

> I'm a good harvest everyone, I miss them completely.

(1h 41m 3s) **Al:**

> Thank you listeners for listening, and until next time, have a good

(1h 41m 7s) **Theme Tune:**

> The Harvest Season is created by Alma Henry, with support from our patrons, including our

(1h 41m 17s)

> pro farmers, Kevin Stewart, Analisa.

(1h 41m 21s)

> Our art is done by Micah the Brave, and our music is done by Nick Burgess.

(1h 41m 26s)

> Feel free to visit our website, harvestseason.club for show notes and links to things we discussed

(1h 41m 32s)

> in this episode.

(1h 41m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I'll give you a small just a just a little nibble here. Okay capcom capcom cup. It's their big

(1h 41m 48s)

> the Street Fighter

(1h 41m 51s)

> yearly annual tournament, right?

(1h 41m 53s)

> It is the prize money. I think is over a million at this point. Oh

(1h 41m 58s) **Al:**

> I'm never going to bed tonight, am I?

(1h 42m) **Kevin:**

> No, no

(1h 42m 3s)

> They've done it for years. They're doing pay per view this year for the finals you have to pay

(1h 42m 8s) **Al:**

> What? No! That's insane!

(1h 42m 9s) **Kevin:**

> 60 bucks to watch.

(1h 42m 11s)

> There's the finals live.

(1h 42m 14s)

> Yeah.

(1h 42m 18s)

> There we go.

(1h 42m 19s) **Al:**

> I can't, am I like...

(1h 42m 23s) **Kevin:**

> All right.

(1h 42m 25s)

> And you know, it's fighting games.

(1h 42m 27s)

> Fighting games are not the most popular kind of games, you know, to be from the.

(1h 42m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah, who's spending that money?

(1h 42m 32s) **Kevin:**

> To.

(1h 42m 33s)

> I don't know.

(1h 42m 35s)

> I don't know.

(1h 42m 37s)

> >> [BLANK_AUDIO]

(1h 42m 37s) **Al:**

> Like, if Pokemon tried to do that, I'd laugh in their face and walk away.

(1h 42m 40s)

> Like, what are you doing? That's madness.

(1h 42m 41s) **Kevin:**

> >> Yes, yes, right, right, that there you go, that's the exact comparison point, right?

(1h 42m 46s)

> That's Pokemon saying, okay, the finals, specifically the finals, they're going to be pay-per-view.

(1h 42m 51s) **Al:**

> And if anybody could do it, Pokemon could do it, but I don't think Pokemon could do it.

(1h 42m 54s) **Kevin:**

> >> Yeah, yeah.

(1h 42m 56s) **Al:**

> That's, I don't, this feels like, um, it feels like they've set themselves up for failure.

(1h 43m 1s)

> Like, that's just especially with the negative PR and like, oh, my word.

(1h 43m 1s) **Kevin:**

> >> Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

(1h 43m 8s) **Al:**

> I would be raging if I was like one of the competitors.

(1h 43m 11s) **Kevin:**

> >> Yeah.
