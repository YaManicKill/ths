00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - Yeah.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

18
00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So no news we're just gonna talk about the games of the year except

19
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:27.680
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Because obviously we've got Micah on we don't often have Micah on and Aslan's been a few weeks

20
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.680
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We're gonna talk about what we'd be up to as well

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So Micah, what have you been up to?

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I can't do the indie game, but again, I already did it all.

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, I know a bit. People would have heard it yet. It's not. It kind of comes out later.

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You know, a little indie game called Pokemon Legends EA primarily is what I'd been up to.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I am doing, I very stupidly did a challenge run for my first playthrough of it, and I'm still doing it.

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So we'll see if I get to play the DLC when it comes out.

27
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:08.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yes, we're recording this four days before the DLC comes out so just to put that in context, obviously.

28
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Stop saying the time.

30
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.740
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

31
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:18.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm just giving people context for why we're talking about it as if we haven't played it because we haven't played it.

32
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's dressing me out, huh?

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

34
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We played the game, but not the DLC.

35
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.340
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm fine with the context to be fair. So as far as I know, it's only Micah that's

36
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:37.099
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's crazy that you guys would do this to me.

37
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.060
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: opposed. It's not me. Just putting it out there.

38
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:39.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Are you trying to carry favor here?

39
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.340
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: We're talking for the first time. I'm against him. I'm opposed to him.

40
00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:47.099
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I have actually played quite a bit.

41
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Have you played anything else since we've last talked to my car?

42
00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I've been playing a lot of, uh, Yakuza zero.

43
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Ooh, is that the new one?

44
00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:03.300
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, it is not. It was the first one that they released on the switch to was the Yakuza zero directors cut.

45
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, this is, this is a remake, isn't it?

46
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It is chronologically the first one. It's not. It's a port. It's just a port of, of Yakuza zero.

47
00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:19.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So the, the Yakuza franchise has gone like they did Yakuza one and then two and then three and then four and then five.

48
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And then I think six and then zero.

49
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:43.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So zero is like the, the, the, the, the, the backstory for the main character Kiryu and another main character Majumagoro and they're kind of like them coming up as young Yakuza and they're like trials and tribulations and stuff. Very interesting, very well written.

50
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: If you know anything about the Yakuza franchise, sometimes at least in the like side quest portion of it.

51
00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:18.819
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: A little raunchy, so, um, be, buyer beware, I guess. Uh, but it is, so they, they are some of the most intricately made open world games and in my opinion, there's so much to do in them. There's a whole in Yakuza zero, it takes place in the 80s in Japan and there's a whole side bit where you can just like build.

52
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Pocket race cars and race them on like tracks against

53
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.899
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: kids and stuff and it's it's awesome.

54
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.379
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I keep thinking about playing one of these. Um, I think the thing that made me go, oh, interesting

55
00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:37.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: was infinite wealth where they had that like random Pokémon game in it. And I'm like, oh, interesting.

56
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.480
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Mm-hmm. Yeah, not just an in Pokemon game, but they have an entire animal crossing

57
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.360
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: style game that I've heard. I haven't played it, but

58
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.019
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, yeah, that was the one that that was the island one, wasn't it? They've got random island you go

59
00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:57.040
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yes, yes, because infinite well takes place in Hawaii. It's the first time that it doesn't take place in a Japanese territory and

60
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: which is ironically not the game that has Hawaii in the title.

61
00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:04.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right, correct. That one is a pirate game that's a spin off.

62
00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.540
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's the next one.

63
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:24.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's an insane experience playing the acting game because it's like the the core story is very serious and very dramatic and it's you know about the Japanese mob and all the like horrors that come along with it, but like, and it's very gritty, but everything else in the game is insane.

64
00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.660
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Obviously.

65
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.860
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

66
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's just like goofy, it's wild. There's tons of stuff to do. It's it's it's very funny and like doesn't take itself super.

67
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:51.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: super seriously, which I love, unless you're in the like core of the story, then for the most part, it takes itself pretty seriously until you get to seven, which is like a dragon and the main character is is very goofy, but also in a really charming way.

68
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:04.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I highly recommend them their attention to detail for like the areas to the the the the cities that they take place in, which are actual real world Japanese cities, but.

69
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:18.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: They're just the names are slightly changed or like you know the not the exact businesses, but they still have a lot of like licensing rights for things like if you know donkey hote the like big Japanese.

70
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Department store chain that just fully exists in the game like they have the rights to put those in the game for whatever reason.

71
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: There's there's lots of stuff and it's Sega so they always have, you know, Sega arcades that you can go into.

72
00:06:34.000 --> 00:07:03.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and just play old Sega games and like the arcade. Just there's lots of stuff to it. It's it's a lot of fun and I've been playing through zero because they just released one and two the one and two remakes on the switch to and they're releasing the remake of three in like February and it's got new story content. So they are I mean they've all existed for quite a while now. I think they're just trying to get as much of the library onto the switch to as they can.

73
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, but the thing is that porting still takes a lot of work, right?

74
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:21.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh for sure for sure. Right. Right. Right. Right. Totally.

75
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's not you don't you don't just click the big port button right like

76
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: This is the thing like people talk about porting as if it's like, oh, just port it to a new console

77
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.019
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Be like it's not that simple though, right?

78
00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:23.139
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like especially especially if you're talking about, you know, the first game came out on PS2 PS3 and Wii U and those

79
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I mean first of all those three consoles had very different

80
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: architectures and in all the first place. And then, you know, you're talking.

81
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: about moving on to this which, too, which is an arm based

82
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:43.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: processor that sure existed back then. But like, no games were using it. So it's like, it's a massive, a massive difference there.

83
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:55.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: The studio that makes these games is extremely dedicated and very talented, and it's very worth your time if it's something that you might be interested in.

84
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.279
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm just worried that I start to like them and then that is like several hundred hours gone.

85
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.040
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh totally, yep, there's a whole side, like, mechanic in Yakuza Zero, where you, as part

86
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.800
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm in that same camp.

87
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.279
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: of the story, you become a real estate agent, and there's a whole side portion of the

88
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:26.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: game, where you can just run, like, real estate and make a bunch of money that way.

89
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I've put probably like 30 or 40 hours of it has been just doing the like, I know,

90
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's a whole game. That's a whole game. You're talking about it there.

91
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

92
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and that's the thing with infinite wealth is that the Pokemon game and the animal

93
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: crossing game, I've heard because I haven't played it yet myself, I've gotten that far,

94
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that they are like full 40 plus hour games that you could, they could just be games themselves,

95
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.879
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that they just included for no reason other than just to put them in the game.

96
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.360
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: like do I have the time in my life to play a yakuza game? That's my real worry. Do I have

97
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh my god.

98
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that's that's a valid question so i'm playing that that's a lot of whatever

99
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:12.440
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't, I legitimately don't know the answer to that question. Fair enough. All right,

100
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.480
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Aslan, what have you been up to?

101
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.340
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I have been up to a number of variety of things.

102
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think since I was last on, I don't think I talked about vampire survivors, I don't remember.

103
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.019
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So I finally, for the first time, picked that game up and that was fun.

104
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think you talked about it as you were going to be playing it.

105
00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:38.059
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay, so then post vampire survivors update, I like the game a lot.

106
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:44.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Because I don't remember what we talked about it and I was like we talked about how it looks and I had been surprised

107
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.419
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: When I eventually looked at a screenshot of what the game looks like and you were like yummy too because it looks bad

108
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.919
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, it's not aesthetically, it's not my favorite.

109
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.080
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

110
00:09:52.259 --> 00:10:00.379
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's what that is a very diplomat that is the that is the description of someone who hates the look of the game, but now likes playing the game

111
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

112
00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.320
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, that's how I feel.

113
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Honestly, that's how I feel.

114
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.360
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's been fun to pick up the game here and there.

115
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.879
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So aesthetically, and debatable.

116
00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:13.879
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But it's a time, but aesthetically,

117
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.480
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [laughter]

118
00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:18.200
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I did enjoy and finish and played one session

119
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: with care and that was very nice.

120
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:29.700
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, is that the game where you're like you are putting like electronics together and stuff at like a desk?

121
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.080
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, you're kind of traveling around, I guess you could say in one sense or another, but you are like yes

122
00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:35.779
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, okay, okay

123
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.779
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: You're fixing your disassembling fixing things and then put it things together and then it progresses a story

124
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.259
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That looks so fun

125
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, it's us too. They're the ones who make Monument Valley and they also made Alba.

126
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Ohhh... Yeah.

127
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:55.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh well they made a great game with this one. It was like I think I played it in like maybe

128
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Same people.

129
00:10:55.539 --> 00:11:07.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: no more than two hours so it was a very bite size game but it was satisfying to play.

130
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.320
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That sounds, yeah, that sounds like a nice two game.

131
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.240
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [laughter]

132
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

133
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.559
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't know what to say.

134
00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:11.639
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's currently on sale of minus 75% on Steam.

135
00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:15.679
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I can get it for £1.44 as basically free.

136
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.259
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - I think it's worth it, that's super worth it.

137
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Steam Deck verified, or what are we talking about?

<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Let's have a look.

139
00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:22.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We are Steam Deck verified.

140
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.360
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Demo available?

141
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.080
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - Hello.

142
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.639
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No demo.

143
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.799
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, that's okay.

144
00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:28.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But it's less than £2.

145
00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:25.919
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Let's-- you can't win them all.

146
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - It's...

147
00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.519
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That's-- yeah, true, true.

148
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Bye the game!

149
00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:33.799
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - I think it's worth the purchase, I would say.

150
00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:35.399
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's a very bite-sized game.

151
00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:41.679
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But otherwise, I started playing Snacko two weeks ago

152
00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:44.179
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: and really, really enjoying that.

153
00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:46.700
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Still working through Persona 3 Reload,

154
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: that's nothing new, that's gonna be

155
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.700
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: for the rest of my life, I guess.

156
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, what a good game. Is this your first time playing Persona 3?

157
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: And...

158
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.759
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I've never played Persona game period.

159
00:11:56.679 --> 00:12:02.580
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, and I'm assuming when you say it's going to probably going to be the rest of my life you're enjoying it then.

160
00:11:58.059 --> 00:11:58.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So...

161
00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:03.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh yeah, for sure.

162
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm just, I'm very much so taking my time with it.

163
00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:06.179
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm so happy to hear that.

164
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.860
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So it's just a very long game.

165
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.419
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So I think after I finished this game,

166
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:09.899
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It is. Yeah.

167
00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:13.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm gonna take a step away from a Persona game,

168
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: like a couple other, like maybe.

169
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: like shorter games than, than dive into either, I guess, Persona 4 when the remake comes out,

170
00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:26.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: or jump over to Persona 5 is what I'm thinking. But I also kind of want to check out metaphor,

171
00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:31.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: some a little torn, but I'm not in any particular rush to play any of them after I finish Persona 3,

172
00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:33.700
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: so I'll assess that when the time comes.

173
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.440
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Persona is the other the other game series that I'm like I feel like I would probably enjoy it

174
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But also like I don't want my entire life to be consumed by it

175
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:57.320
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: time. Yeah. I imagine that we are very much the same in how we put them, especially previous

176
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, it's definitely a time-sync.

177
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:49.320
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I don't know if it necessarily has to be a time-sync, but the way that I've been playing

178
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.440
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: it, I make it a time-sync and I enjoy it, so.

179
00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:04.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: discussions about having stuff up while you're playing to be able to, you know, get the full

180
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.919
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: experience of whatever, like, I love nothing more than like sitting down with a persona

181
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I, yeah.

182
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.919
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: him and trying to min max the the days, you know, because it's there's a like only so much

183
00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:22.879
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: you can do during a day. If you miss something, then you miss it. Okay, that's good.

184
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I actually haven't been playing Persona with a guide.

185
00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Funny enough.

186
00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:24.059
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I've actually just been made a masking it on my own

187
00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:24.740
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: and it's been fun.

188
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I've been enjoying it.

189
00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:30.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But then otherwise I've obviously Pokemon Legend ZA.

190
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.279
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: as if that's not enough games, as if that's not enough games.

191
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:32.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's no, we said that again.

192
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.259
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

193
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

194
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I know I'm like cycling through so many different games

195
00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:42.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: right now and I'm like, oh, but obviously Legend ZA.

196
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: We don't need to rehash that.

197
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: And then I did purchase finally for the first time.

198
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.820
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: New Leaf, Happy Home Paradise,

199
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:58.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, my God, all masterpieces.

200
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: and Detective Pikachu.

201
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.620
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So at some point, I don't think we could close up.

202
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.700
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

203
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.120
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Is that the original detective Pikachu is that the original detective Pikachu or the the one for switch?

204
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.299
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Sorry, I said that again, Al.

205
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That is a valid question.

206
00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:01.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: What was the question?

207
00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:01.980
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Sorry.

208
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.740
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh, the original.

209
00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:07.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, cool. Just check him. Just check him.

210
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

211
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I have...

212
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I feel like I can't play the new one

213
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's true.

214
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't know. I mean, have you watched the film? Like, that's the story. Except it's most of the

215
00:14:17.159 --> 00:14:20.120
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: story, but then also some of not the story.

216
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh, true. Yeah, I forgot that was a thing. But regardless, you know what, it's fine.

217
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:48.059
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I am so excited that you have, have you never played New Leaf or, well, you don't have

218
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.080
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Sorry, I over-conf- I over-conf- I over-conf-

219
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.759
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I just completed my own point there, I just completely, and the same sentence proved myself wrong.

220
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.980
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But otherwise, that's it. Just cycling through a lot of different games.

221
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: No, my first, unfortunately, my first Animal Crossing game

222
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.059
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: was New Horizons.

223
00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:50.059
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Unfortunately, but

224
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:57.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, it's great.

225
00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:53.580
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Well, that seems to be the consensus.

226
00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.019
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I really love it.

227
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.580
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But that seems to be the general Animal Crossing community

228
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Look.

229
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Mal, enjoy what you enjoy.

230
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.340
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: consensus.

231
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.220
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So I'm like, I guess I'm supposed to say, unfortunately.

232
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:09.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Look, it don't do not do not feel the pressure, right? Like I did not like New Leaf. So, that's all.

233
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I guess that could tie me, you know.

234
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.580
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh.

235
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:15.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: newly for new horizons or both oh, okay. I thought you didn't like new horizons

236
00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:16.240
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No, I like New Horizons. I didn't like New Leaf. Wow, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, right. Okay, right.

237
00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:14.179
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: OK.

238
00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:19.440
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: My...

239
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.559
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I definitely didn't like New Leaf. I didn't get into it. Like I spent a few hours

240
00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:25.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: unsan-related everything.

241
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:49.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think about it. New Horizons, I put in like 100 hours and did I enjoy that game is a complicated answer, but it's more complicated than new leaf. I definitely didn't like new leaf. I maybe didn't like new horizons, but it's harder to say you don't like a game when you spent 100 hours playing it and covering it and like probably I like what 30 hours talking about it on podcasts.

242
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.759
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

243
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

244
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.360
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

245
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I'm like I'm going to be buying the Switch 2 version when it comes out next year.

246
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So like I don't know what is what is like? How does one define whether one likes a game?

247
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.039
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I have a great video for you Al for later. It's called I played Animal Crossing every day for five years.

248
00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:14.919
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think you would enjoy that video. I'm going to just, I'm just going to drop it in a group chat and leave it at that.

249
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:18.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [Laughter]

250
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:24.019
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, no. Oh, goodness. How long is this gate? Oh, it's only 20 minutes. Oh,

251
00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.159
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, it's a quick video.

252
00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:27.259
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that's easy. Easy. Goodness.

253
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.379
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, I think that New Horizons is a great game on its own.

254
00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.320
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm just going to leave it there.

255
00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:39.580
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think that New Leaf is also a great game on its own.

256
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:45.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think that if you go into New Leaf expecting what you got out of New Horizons, you will

257
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.820
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: probably be disappointed, but I think if you go into it understanding that it's a completely

258
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:58.899
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: different game in a lot of ways than you will be able to enjoy it for what it is.

259
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.120
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's definitely how I'm approaching it. No, go ahead.

260
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.200
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I'm just going to say that New Leaf, I have immense memories tied to New Leaf.

261
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:15.640
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I love that game, but I also do to the circumstances of the time really enjoyed New Horizons

262
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.400
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: because of the context of the time that it came out and everything, so I think it depends

263
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:28.200
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: on there's different ways that you can enjoy each of them, and I think that they're both

264
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: awesome.

265
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.799
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Don't let anybody make you feel like you shouldn't, like you like the wrong Animal Crossing

266
00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:44.440
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: game, that's a non-fair way to.

267
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:44.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, ignore Kevin ignore Kevin. He's he can he can he can like what he likes, but you can like what you like

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:49.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: that this this point feels very, very reminiscent about a conversation we

269
00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:58.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: may or may not have just had oh it's great

270
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.259
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

271
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Is the best thing about recording episodes I have order, right? It's

272
00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:03.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Speaking of recording episodes of order. I have also been playing snacko and

273
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.339
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: listeners will know that's because we will have

274
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:23.900
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: a couple of weeks by the time this episode comes out.

275
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.700
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Something like that so that the math, the math is somewhere, I haven't marked down somewhere.

276
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.940
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But time is an illusion.

277
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I've not put in a huge amount of time, maybe a bit 10 hours into that so far.

278
00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:35.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But let's, I mean, listeners will know by now what my opinion is.

279
00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:37.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I think it's probably safe.

280
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I have to say it's a great game, love it.

281
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: You put it already, you put it in more time than I have, that's crazy.

282
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, but like that's not a lot of time for me for a week.

283
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like I did for my tears of the kingdom run through.

284
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I did 150 hours and it was three weeks.

285
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I only played that game for three weeks.

286
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Whoo, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

287
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And I put it in 150 hours.

288
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

289
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like if I get really, really into a game,

290
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It becomes...

291
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: A problem.

292
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.200
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Oh, for sure, same.

293
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I mean, my Legend ZA playtime hit 180 hours

294
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and I took like three weeks off after it came out

295
00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:27.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: 'cause I hyper fixated and burned myself out.

296
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.160
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And that's how you know you were shiny hunting because I finished the game after 80 hours

297
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I... Oh...

298
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and there's nothing left to do in the game except that stupid battle the thousand battles

299
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.180
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

300
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and any shiny hunting.

301
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.240
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

302
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.700
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, there's so much more.

303
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You know, you got to get all the clothing items.

304
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.140
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You got to get all the side quests.

305
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:57.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think it's the shiny hunting. I think it's the fact that you're like, "I need to have

306
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You got to do all the-- OK, well, all right.

307
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.099
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Maybe I just play slow, Al.

308
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.759
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

309
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: OK, all right, all right, all right, all right.

310
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

311
00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:03.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: sick, shiny Pokemon for my team."

312
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: The worst part is that it doesn't count a lot of that,

313
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:13.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yes, however, however, your Switch is saving that time, so.

314
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: because a lot of it is resetting, so it doesn't show in the time.

315
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.240
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh my god, yeah.

316
00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.940
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

317
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.440
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So, so it does.

318
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:42.259
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And I have also, well, maybe I should talk about this now, I've been playing snackle on my,

319
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I wish that it didn't.

320
00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:23.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

321
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.039
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I wish that it didn't.

322
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I don't want to look at it.

323
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.759
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah. I have questions and I will save them for the later.

324
00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:48.339
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: know what is the name in this device? ROGXBox

325
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:55.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think that's the official title for it. So that's the the Xbox handheld made by ROG which is ACES. So it's actually ACES ROG Xbox

326
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:08.839
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: What are they doing over there?

327
00:20:55.779 --> 00:21:04.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: LAX. I think it's its full official title. Look, look, this is the problem with the PC gaming market is they just don't know

328
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think I just call out the Aces Rogg.

329
00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:16.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: how to name things. But this is the thing, like this is the thing, like a calling

330
00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:14.680
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Xbox has been on one as far as naming stuff goes for a long time.

331
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.940
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: at the Xbox ally. Would you be fine? But no, they had to like they had to because it's ROG making it

332
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:27.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: who are owned by ACES. They had to like shovel that on the front as well. Oh, goodness. And also like

333
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

334
00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:33.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: calling it the Xbox ally X, there is a problem with calling it that because they had the the ACES ROG

335
00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:39.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: ally X before, which is basically the same name. It is merger to try and Google anything about this

336
00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:46.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: console. Well, yeah, so, so

337
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

338
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: At least you can play a snack on it though.

339
00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:51.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, I haven't talked about this here, man, because it came out on the same day the Pokemon did.

340
00:21:51.859 --> 00:22:00.339
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I spent a month and a half playing nothing but Pokemon. And so now I've spent about week

341
00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:06.740
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: using it for snackle. And what I will say is great handheld. I love the ergonomics. Very nice and

342
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:13.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: powerful. It plays everything I wanted to play. The Xbox Windows interface is terrible and I wish it

343
00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:16.380
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: it would die. (laughs)

344
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

345
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.940
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And I am seriously considering installing Steam OS on this device.

346
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:29.339
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I can't get rid of Windows because obviously one of the big advantages of this is that you can install game pass games, which you can't do on Steam OS.

347
00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:44.140
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I'll need to install it in Jubit, which when was the last time I jubited a machine that that is an era of my life I thought I was past, but apparently I am not, I am back to, I'm not just boot jubiting a machine, I'm jubiting a console now, what is happening with my life.

348
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [Laughter]

349
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.079
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

350
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.240
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

351
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But yeah, I think I would probably rather...

352
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: play games that I can play on Steam OS, on Steam OS, because it is just better.

353
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:56.019
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's like, you'll be sitting playing, you'll be sitting doing something on the Xbox interface,

354
00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:59.700
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and then you click something, and it goes, "Oh, here's our Windows window."

355
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:06.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And you're like, "Why am I seeing a Windows window? Why are you opening the Windows settings for this?"

356
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

357
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: This is a touch screen handheld console.

358
00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:15.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I want to never see Windows get that away from me, give me the things in it.

359
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.660
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Never get that with Steam OS, unless you are doing something like, "So niche."

360
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You then go, "I want to see the desktop mode," but you have to explicitly go to that.

361
00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:31.740
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: When this handheld will just pop up random Windows from Windows.

362
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.940
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You're like, "Why am I seeing the Windows terminal right now? I should never be seeing the Windows terminal.

363
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Why am I seeing this? This is absolutely dreadful."

364
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, that's kind of wild.

365
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.740
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That is unusual.

366
00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:45.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So, they need to work a lot on the software on this, but it is a great handheld.

367
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.140
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's basically way too expensive. Do not buy this machine.

368
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

369
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.900
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But I was feeling the limits of the power of the Steam Deck and a few things,

370
00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:01.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and so I wanted to get something, and this felt like a good one with its integration with Game Pass.

371
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.839
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Mm-hmm.

372
00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:08.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And so now, I'm going to get rid of that integration with Game Pass, and it stalls, Steam OS.

373
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.599
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

374
00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:12.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - I'm sure that the price increase

375
00:24:08.779 --> 00:24:15.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah.

376
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: probably helped that decision, too, though.

377
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.720
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Mm-hmm.

378
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.980
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

379
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:42.019
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: OK, I thought it was pre-COVID, but no, it's post-COVID. OK, sure, fine.

380
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.160
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's really been that long.

381
00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:46.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I got it released basically so three nearly four years because it was five year old

382
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: four years, I'm feeling the pain of it. I didn't have the all led version. So I was like

383
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:56.900
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: feeling some of the, you know, pain aspects of it. So I knew I was going to be upgrading

384
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: to something. And when they were like, oh, we're not going to have a new steam deck coming

385
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:09.180
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: out, you know, in 2026, I was like, okay, let's try something else then. I could, I can

386
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:16.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: foresee myself going to the steam deck too when it comes out just because of how nice the software

387
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and the idea of like manually installing it on my machine is just painful.

388
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, I still got my launch steam deck too. I granted I've done a lot of like upgrading to like, you know,

389
00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:47.240
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: hardware upgrades to it and whatever that like, you probably aren't doing normally, but I love it. I am a big proponent. Like my primary console consoles at this point are like the switch and the steam deck and this kind of kind of it.

390
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: the Steam Deck completely changed how I game because I would buy things on the Switch if they

391
00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:56.740
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: were on the Switch and if they weren't on the Switch I wouldn't play games. You know it just like

392
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

393
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah.

394
00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:03.940
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that's just how I was. What else now I have a handheld device that I can use to play basically any game

395
00:25:58.579 --> 00:25:59.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Yep.

396
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.660
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and basically any game works on it and considering how many indie games and especially farming

397
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:14.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: games release on Steam it's just it's a complete game changer and I do think having played

398
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: now with a console that runs.

399
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:35.900
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think most people should just have a steam deck, I don't think most people should

400
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right

401
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:42.299
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: look at anything else because it has the perfect balance, I think of console versus PC.

402
00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:46.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So the advantages of console is, uh, use.

403
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.180
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You know that if you buy a game, it's going to work on the thing that you buy it for, right?

404
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: PC, you don't get that, right?

405
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like, yeah, you're probably going to be fine, but like, who knows?

406
00:26:55.819 --> 00:26:59.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Maybe there's something weird in one of your pieces of hardware that means it's not going

407
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: to work.

408
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Whereas because it's like the baseline, the steam deck, you know that if it says on steam, it's

409
00:27:04.539 --> 00:27:06.299
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: going to work, it's going to work.

410
00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:08.099
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And you know that people are testing against it.

411
00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:13.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Every game test against the steam deck now, it just is the default and that is an incredible

412
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: advantage, the bot.

413
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:32.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: if you want to customize it and you want to do weird stuff to it, you can. But none of that is in your face. None of the weirdness is in your face. You have to go find the weirdness, right? The fact that I can go and install emulators on my steam deck.

414
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:46.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And I can integrate those emulated games specifically onto the steam interface. So I can have my Pokemon collection on the steam deck is incredible. But you don't have to, you don't have to do any of that.

415
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:59.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And so being able to the, the, the customizability of a PC combined with the reliability of a console makes the steam deck almost the perfect device.

416
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right. Yeah, I agree.

417
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.299
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: 1,000% agree. And that's why I'm, like, kind of intrigued to see the steam.

418
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.779
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: PC? What are we calling it? Whatever, we're calling it.

419
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Hmm the steam machine is what is called

420
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh yeah. Okay.

421
00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:14.099
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah. I mean, intrigued to see how that pans out.

422
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, no, I

423
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Those are gonna be really interesting and also like I'm really excited about the VR that they've got because I have a meta

424
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Quest and I hate that I'm reliant on meta

425
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:31.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: For that and the fact that I could get a valve one like there is I've said to a couple of people like there is no company that is user

426
00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:36.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: focused, it does not exist, there is not a single company that can't.

427
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:48.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Heres about his users. But in the gaming world, if there is one company that is closest to that, I think it's clearly Valve at this point.

428
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And saying this as a Nintendo Super fan, I think Valve are clearly the closest to a user-focused company.

429
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:06.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And I would trust them over any other gaming company to provide me with hardware that I know is going to do what it's meant to do and not feel like they're going to suck every, every last pound out of me.

430
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Hello, Nintendo.

431
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:15.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: right. I agree. I think just generally there's a lot of really positive things about

432
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.859
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

433
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And so, yeah.

434
00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:12.180
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I agree.

435
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:25.619
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: those business that like, you know, it's still business. So it's 100%, but like, you know,

436
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: They're still an evil capitalist company, but.

437
00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:32.740
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: just the fact that they have such a wild split for developers too and things like that,

438
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:37.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: you know, they're doing better than the majority, which is

439
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.519
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yes, we can give credit where credit is due, but also still give criticism

440
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:45.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: you know, totally. Yeah.

441
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, yeah. So my point is being able to replace my meta quest run by one of the most evil

442
00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:56.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: companies in the world of all time with a valve run one that we know is going to work

443
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: with everything, right? You can, you know your games are going to work on it. It's an incredible

444
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: idea. And the fact that you can also then plug in your dongle into your more powerful device

445
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and play more powerful games that can't quite run on that is an incredible idea.

446
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I absolutely love that. The question is how much it's going to be. And we don't know and that's going to be,

447
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right.

448
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.839
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - Yeah.

449
00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:22.400
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that's going to be the difference between oh this is a cool thing for hobbyists and this is game change.

450
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yep. Totally. I am very nervous about that, especially the like, you know, kind of

451
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.240
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Hemingon hawing. They've done so far about like, it's going to be priced more in

452
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.839
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the like PC range sort of like, I don't know, I don't know, but we'll see.

453
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's probably important that they don't lose money on it because

454
00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:57.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Steam will not make as much money on games as Nintendo or Sony etc. Will make and we want them to be able to continue making a good thing

455
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Because it is self-sufficient and making the money, but also if it costs too much money

456
00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:04.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's not nobody's gonna buy it

457
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.019

459
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.400
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: He says having bought an 800 pound the handheld console

460
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.799
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm not a good example of the the standard game buyer. Don't be like me

461
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But also no hate if you are.

462
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.240
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But also don't be like me. So all right, that's what we've been up to

463
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:32.839
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, yeah, I've also been played Pokemon, but we talked a lot about that both in this episode and in the other episode

464
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.759
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

465
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.259
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: We did.

466
00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:35.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, what?

467
00:31:35.319 --> 00:31:38.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, so explanation of this episode. We are gonna talk about

468
00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:41.559
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: games that I've come out

469
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:50.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and we're going to talk a lot about them and hopefully not too long, so that I can go to bed.

470
00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:00.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So, we have three sections in this podcast. We have the update of the year, we have the early access game of the year, and we have the game of the year.

471
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.579
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

472
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

473
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:09.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Also this year, I put, so I think last year I had a poll to the other hosts on the podcast, so we got some more input than just the people on the podcast.

474
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: forecast this year, I extended that poll.

475
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:36.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: just to go through this for the update of the year and the early access of the year, we will just officially nominate every one that came out because those lists are shorter, but I mean, the updates list is still quite long, but we'll get to that.

476
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Then the three of us for those two will take into

477
00:32:41.000 --> 00:33:06.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: a position for the game of the year, we will explicitly go through our individual lists of what our games of the year will be, like what our nominations will be, and then I will also add on stuff from the poll and then from those nominations because we're not just going to nominate every game because there's far too many, we will make a decision as to what the game of the year is.

478
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: One of us will probably come out of this angry.

479
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And that's just life and

480
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:20.680
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm sure someone in this lack will be angry as well. But that is that is just life.

481
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm flexible, so I'm ready to not be angry.

482
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.640
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So goes. Yeah, have a-

483
00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:40.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Well look let's wait until we actually know what we're nominating because the three of us don't know what we're not each of us is nominating for game of the year. We don't tell each other that and I have it explicitly hidden in the our show note so that we can't see until we actually talk about it. So it's going to be interesting, although I do have a very strong theory for what I think

484
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I say now.

<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: the two finalists will be, but we'll we'll come to that. So first up, we have update of the year and just as a reminder, we started this category last year because we wanted to give starchy a win, so 2024 starchy 1.6 won the update of the year. And of course now we have to continue and actually give a second update of God a reward. So here we go. The nominations for update of the year are

486
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: are Teranelle Heatwave.

<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Rusty's, but I also recognize that Lens Island was a big one, so I can kind of give something

536
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:06.139
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: to that.

537
00:37:06.139 --> 00:37:10.440
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I don't know, because obviously I've never played Disney Dream like Validate Valley.

538
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:16.619
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I don't know if I would say any of them could be updated a year, I only say that because

539
00:37:16.619 --> 00:37:22.019
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I feel like that game is always getting updates, so it's like, what can we consider

540
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.860
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: the year if that game is always being updated?

541
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.300
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think I would mostly agree with you there. I think that the, I think there is an argument,

542
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.059
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm not, I'm not making this argument, but I think there is an argument for Wish Blossom Ranch,

543
00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:40.739
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: adding the horses, like I do feel like that feels like a significant update. I agree generally

544
00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:46.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that I don't think any other Disney Dreamlight Valley update ever is going to entice people to come

545
00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:51.219
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and play the game with they haven't already been enticed to do it, any more than the base game would.

546
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and nor do I think that someone who's like fallen out of the game and they haven't

547
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: played it for the last year is going to look at any of them and go oh it's

548
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.179
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: time to go back in except maybe wish blossom ranch because adding in the

549
00:38:04.179 --> 00:38:08.739
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: horses does feel like a significant thing I don't think it it's not my game it's

550
00:38:08.739 --> 00:38:12.300
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: not my update of the year I just like like I think if any of them have an

551
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:22.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: that's fair, that's fair. I'll also give credit to Mika, but the only criticism I have

552
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.940
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: argument I think that would be the one that has a

553
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:29.320
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: to is that I understand it's an indeed studio indie game, everything, but the fact that

554
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: it needed an update to feel like a full game is unusual to me. I don't know if it's bad,

555
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I don't know if it's good. It's just unusual to me, but I am glad that it like fixed the

556
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: game significantly, so I'd like, I'm very happy to hear that.

557
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Have you played, have neither of you played me, alright?

558
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I could totally mesh with that.

559
00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:56.119
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I played it when it came out, because I backed it on Kickstarter.

560
00:38:56.119 --> 00:38:59.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, but I have not played it.

561
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, yeah. No, that's fair. So I love Becca, right? Like it was, it was one of my favorite

562
00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:03.320
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So take that for what it's worth.

563
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

564
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: games of last year. And the update I do think was a, I think I would probably say this is my update

565
00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:23.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: of the year. I think that their decision to release some of the features of the game in updates

566
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:30.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: did feel a little bit not great, but those updates were in the

567
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.440
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: previous update that came out last year, not in this one. Right. I think the part, the first update,

568
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.639
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: which I can't remember the name of, was the one that felt to me like it should have been the

569
00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:48.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: first release. The into the month mount gone added stuff that I know Kevin said it makes it feel

570
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.280
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: like a fill game. I think it felt like a fill game after the first update. I think the second update

571
00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:00.280
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: felt like, ooh, some more stuff rather than, okay, now it's a, now it's a fill game, you know.

572
00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:06.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So that would be my, I think the mica should win this because I think that update is great.

573
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The game was great before it. I think if this hadn't come, it wouldn't have felt

574
00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:16.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: unfinished personally. I suspect Kevin is merging those two updates together because they did

575
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:22.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: come out like only a couple of months apart. And I think originally the where it just meant to be

576
00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:32.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: one update, but they came out as two updates. But I think it was.

577
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:36.679
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: A good update. I did like dungeons into the game, which didn't feel like they needed to be there

578
00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:41.639
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: in the first place, but where I've fun extra challenge afterwards. And as Kevin says, it

579
00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:46.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: it was free update as well. So like there's only so much you can complain about a free update.

580
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:57.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Right. I am happy to give it a win. It's so hard for me to speak on it because I have not

581
00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:04.480
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: really any strong opinions about any of these. A note that I did make though is that the

582
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:11.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: day of the diver update, I heard there was a lot of hype about it. I don't...

583
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:20.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: If I'm not, if I'm not wrong, I feel like there was hype about it, but ended up being disappointing this one in particular as you, it's your band's holiday correct me from wrong. I didn't play it. She bands holiday and also it was a paid DLC.

584
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:48.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Um, I, I don't know, did Micah, did you play it?

585
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.980
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. I did write that down yet.

586
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I did not. I didn't actually even know that it existed until I was looking over the like

587
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.099
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You've played, you've played Dave the Diver though, right?

588
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:41.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: show notes for this. And I wrote, I have, yeah. And I wrote in my nominations for update.

589
00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:36.099
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah.

590
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:48.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I wrote Snacco, because that I think, and I think I'll get to that more later for why

591
00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:54.940
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I voted Snacco for update of the year, but I also wrote, yeah, because the Dave the Diver

592
00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.059
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: across over rules.

593
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.619
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Because I like the idea of that, but that's the extent of it.

594
00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:05.619
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, each bond as a character in the Yakuza franchise is one of my favorites.

595
00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:09.480
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: He's just, he's incredible.

596
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.119
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So I'm, I'm very interested to go back to David.

597
00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:18.820
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I would be because of that, but I don't know if it's enough to like, you know, for me to call

598
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:25.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it updated the especially having that played it, but also just like a collab being

599
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: you know, like updated the year, I don't know if that, that is, is valid for me.

600
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.519
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: A valid enough for me to, to call it updated the

601
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:40.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think I, yeah, I agree with it. I don't think I would, I would strongly fight against the age of

602
00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:47.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: anxiety being update of the year for two reasons. One, um, it's, it's, it's a time limited

603
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:54.900
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: paid DLC, which I really don't like just as a concept, right? That is really not great. Um,

604
00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:01.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and to having a look at the reviews on Steam, they are very mixed on this. And most people

605
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: saying it's really short. Why is this paid compared to the other

606
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:10.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: ones like I think the the Godzilla DLC which was a free DLC but still time limited which I

607
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:17.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: still don't like it being time limited. There's not great but at least it was free. That was pretty

608
00:43:17.619 --> 00:43:24.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: short as well but it felt fun and it felt good. If I had paid how much is the H. Ben's Holiday one?

609
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:33.139
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Six pounds. If I had paid six pounds for the Godzilla DLC I would not have been happy but having it free I

610
00:43:33.139 --> 00:43:35.059
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think was really good.

611
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:45.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And because of the amount it was, it felt like a fun addition to the story, but from why I can see this seems to be shorter than that and paid, which doesn't feel good.

612
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure

613
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:57.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, hey, it makes me wonder what the like what went on behind the scenes to make it so different and it's I was would assume some sort of rights negotiation

614
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:03.679
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's for sure rights. They're, but, but all of their DLCs, I think are time limited.

615
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.480
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That has like you know

616
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.320
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, I mean as far as like price goes and stuff, you know like charging for it

617
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh, interesting.

618
00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:13.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why was this one? Why was this one paid, but why was the dredge in Godzilla one's free? Yeah. Yeah. Weird.

619
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:21.719
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right like did they have to pay more for the rights to to each bond and did they you know, which is funny to think about considering that Godzilla is like

620
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: - Yeah.

621
00:44:22.039 --> 00:44:25.920
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You know, but who knows maybe Godzilla is kind of like

622
00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:33.440
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: What is it Winnie the poo that's like, you know, he can anybody can make whatever out of it?

623
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:44.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I think they were doing the Godzilla one for free, because I think it was, they viewed it as advertising, because it was a round, it was just after Godzilla minus one came out.

624
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.739
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

625
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:49.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I see. Yeah.

626
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I think it was like, no, we want people to go and see our film, please.

627
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I, well, I guess to to circle back to Snacko, I'm curious to hear your thoughts,

628
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:04.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Michael, in regards to like, why you would nominate this the update? Or yeah,

629
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I

630
00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:14.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Guess what I'll say is you know what it's there will be plenty of discussion, so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna spit it out now, but I

631
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Think snacko is great

632
00:45:17.699 --> 00:45:23.059
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I did not nominate it for game of the year and this is my kind of compromise is that

633
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.139
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Giving it update of the year is sort of my like compromise for not nominating it for game of the year

634
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay.

635
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:40.559
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't... I would not want to give it update of the year just now in exchange for not giving

636
00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:32.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Also, I didn't play a lot.

637
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm not a fan of these. So...

638
00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:45.280
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: it game of the year later, right? Like I think those conversations need to be separate.

639
00:45:46.639 --> 00:45:53.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I mean, I guess we could say let's table the discussion for now. Do the rest of the

640
00:45:52.500 --> 00:46:06.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: What I will say is that because I didn't play a lot of these updates, I was kind of picking

641
00:45:53.920 --> 00:46:01.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: episode and come back depending on what happens out of the game of the year?

642
00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:14.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and choosing what I have played and what I think I could reasonably, you know, I have

643
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.320
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: played a lot of, like I played a lot of Hellkitty Island event, but like it's not, I didn't

644
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.519
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: play a lot of updates. So I don't.

645
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.780
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I don't really know, you know, like, uh, haven't played any of the

646
00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:31.219
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: paleo update. It haven't touched dreamlight Valley in a very long time.

647
00:46:31.219 --> 00:46:35.780
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So as far as updates go, I am very, you know, snacko was kind of my

648
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:40.780
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: compromise for myself as like, I love that game. And I wish that I had, you

649
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:45.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: know, more to be able to like place it in in game of the year, but I still

650
00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:51.940
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: love that game. And that's why I was, I kind of put it there. I am not very, I

651
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:57.360
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: have very strong feelings about update of the year. So I am willing to

652
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

653
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: flex a lot on this one. So, you know, I wouldn't take this as like, I'm

654
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.179
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: arguing for snacko to be culinary update to be game of the year or

655
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, yeah, no, no, that's fair.

656
00:47:07.179 --> 00:47:11.219
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: updated the year. It's just in the context of what I have played or have not

657
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - Yeah, I mean, I got it.

658
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.360
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So there's one there's one more suggestion that I haven't said that I was in my list of

659
00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:22.480
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: these are the things I'm going to suggest for winning update of the year. My first one was Mika.

660
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Mm-hmm

661
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:31.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I wasn't going to suggest 1.1.1 purely because I might discuss it later on in the episode,

662
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

663
00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:37.280
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: but also because it is an update that focuses on cooking, which is never my

664
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Never a thing that I enjoy in farming games.

665
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:48.860
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and see I do so but that's okay that's okay we can we'll get there

666
00:47:42.000 --> 00:48:07.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But that's fair, but also I do obviously once and I go to win something, but the other thing I was going to suggest is nothing wins update of the year, because I have not been other than Mika, I've not been like super excited by any of the updates this year.

667
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

668
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Phil stop, like nothing, I, I, it feels like it's a week.

669
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.900
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I, yeah.

670
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You're for updates for farming.

671
00:48:15.699 --> 00:48:21.699
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: For-for additional context, a lot of the notes that I took on every game was...

672
00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:24.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Seems like I literally copied and pasted it.

673
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.099
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Seems like a good free update.

674
00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:28.400
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Seems like a standard free update.

675
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:34.199
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Not interested in the game, but seems like a good free update seems like a good paid update.

676
00:48:34.199 --> 00:48:37.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's-I wrote a lot of that for a lot of these updates.

677
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I was just like, this seems pretty stan-

678
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Standard. This seems pretty good. That's it!

679
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.219
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I also hate the idea of giving it to nothing,

680
00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:51.820
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: but also like that is an argument for it.

681
00:48:49.500 --> 00:49:19.400
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I need to, but I also don't love the idea of like, I'm with Hazel and on that, like, I don't love the idea of it, I will, you know, I will hand it to, to Mika if it goes that route, but like, because it is, you know, a great game, you know, they, that, that team worked very hard on this, I love a lot of stuff that they've made, but I, I do feel a little bit weird about giving it to something that like the update.

682
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:37.900
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: is what made the game finished, you know, kind of, but that's also coming from the context of like not having actually played set up date. So I, I, I'm going off of what other people are saying the update did for the game rather than my own experience of it. So.

683
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.480
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm not saying this is a direct comparison.

684
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:47.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So take this with a green assault, but the context of giving Mika the update of the year in my

685
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: head right now, there's a slight comparison happening where it's like, oh, this update helped

686
00:49:52.880 --> 00:50:01.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: to finish this game is like giving Pokemon Legends ZA switch to version update of the year,

687
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:09.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: because they made it better or start out Legends ZA, sorry, Scarlett and Violet updated the year.

688
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: because they finally fixed the graphics relatively speaking in this for the switch too.

689
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah. And again, I don't know.

690
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:23.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So, as the only player, a person who has actually played the entire game before the update

691
00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:19.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So again, not a direct comparison, but just something that I just thought about.

692
00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:30.380
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and then played the update afterwards, that's not a fair comparison at all.

693
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay, that's fair.

694
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:35.699
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think it's, and as I said, I think it's totally fair to make an argument about the first

695
00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:36.860
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Mika update.

696
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.739
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I do think that is a fair argument.

697
00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:43.219
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think that should have been the 1.0, and it's the same sort of argument that I've made

698
00:50:43.219 --> 00:50:44.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: about Carl Island one point.

699
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.219
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: One that should be the one point. Oh, but I think that into the

700
00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:52.659
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: mon gone mountain gone. I just to keep saying it the wrong way. I'm

701
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

702
00:50:52.659 --> 00:50:55.139
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: sure I think at one point, I think at one point, the rotor is

703
00:50:55.139 --> 00:50:59.059
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Mont rather than mount because they're, I think they're Italian. So it

704
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and it changed forever. I think they're Spanish. I think they're from Spain, yeah.

705
00:50:59.059 --> 00:51:05.260
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: was a translation issue is a Spanish not Italian. My bad, that's a

706
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:12.260
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: big mistake to make. I.

707
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:19.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, you know, I would be a fairer comparison to, because just contextually from what I'm

708
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

709
00:51:19.639 --> 00:51:25.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: hearing and what, you know, people said, like, it would be a fairer comparison to, say,

710
00:51:26.679 --> 00:51:28.679
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: in the same vein as how

711
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:58.599
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: animal crossing, new horizons, got a lot of updates that added stuff to it that made it feel like everybody kind of argued that the game felt more finished once they had all the updates in it, but they should have included them in the final release anyways, is that kind of there's that well, you know, I don't necessarily agree with this because I think that like, you know, I think it's an unfair way to look at it, especially in the context of,

712
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:07.320
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the time, you know, the what was happening with games at the time, right.

713
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.480
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, like yeah, exactly like new horizons would not have been what it was if it hadn't released when it did

714
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:13.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And so saying like it should have had the next two years worth of updates included when it came out is such a bizarre

715
00:52:13.519 --> 00:52:18.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Argument because it doesn't mean anything you're talking about something that doesn't exist and never would have existed

716
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:29.519
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think the argument was that it was mechanics that felt like they were patched in after the fact that weren't finished in time for releases what the like the mentality of

717
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.820
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, maybe, but that's also like, I don't think it's fair to say like, that is something

718
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:42.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that like, whoa, that is not an unusual thing nowadays, and I'm not saying that to

719
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:48.260
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: mean that like, games should come out broken and fix themselves, but like, do people think

720
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: -Mm-hmm.

721
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:53.019
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that Fortnite should have been released as it currently is?

722
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

723
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

724
00:52:53.019 --> 00:52:57.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You know, like that sort of comparison, like a game releasing and then having updates,

725
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: -Sure.

726
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: feels like such a '90s view on things.

727
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.719
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: -Yeah, I think that there are some instances where, like,

728
00:53:04.719 --> 00:53:10.860
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the corporate hands get in the way of whether or not

729
00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:15.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: something is released, like, ready for release,

730
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah. Fair.

731
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: on the developer side.

732
00:53:18.039 --> 00:53:21.519
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I can see where that is, you know,

733
00:53:21.519 --> 00:53:23.480
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and that I think tends to be more

734
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:27.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: a complaint about, like, the corporation that

735
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.360
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: is in control of that, rather than the developers themselves.

736
00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.599
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I can understand that frustration.

737
00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:41.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I say this fully as a, like, massive enjoyer of New Horizons,

738
00:53:41.639 --> 00:53:45.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: one of my, you know, favorite Switch era games.

739
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I loved it, and I still love it.

740
00:53:48.639 --> 00:53:52.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I still play it fairly regularly.

741
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But I can't understand where I think, again, like,

742
00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.599
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: we don't know all the behind-the-scenes,

743
00:53:59.599 --> 00:54:01.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: all the inner workings, everything that's going on.

744
00:54:01.639 --> 00:54:04.360
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So we don't know what was planned for release

745
00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:08.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and what wasn't, I think, that, like, using it

746
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.519
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: as a comparison for things that existed previously

747
00:54:12.519 --> 00:54:14.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: in Animal Crossing games that didn't make it

748
00:54:14.639 --> 00:54:16.639
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: until it was an opportunity.

749
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it's a great update later on is a little bit more understandable as a like...

750
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I get your part. Okay. I get your point. The comparison is more fair. I just disagree with the

751
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:32.719
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: starting point of that animal crossing your horizon should have released with

752
00:54:32.719 --> 00:54:36.400
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: all everything that it currently has in the game. Like, I just, I just disagree with that

753
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.940
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure. Sure. Right.

754
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.639
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: feels stop. And so therefore, as a comparison, it's fair, but it doesn't argue against this update

755
00:54:42.639 --> 00:54:48.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: being the update of the year, because I don't think I would say it's like, I would say multiple

756
00:54:48.159 --> 00:54:52.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: of the, I would say the farming update, for example, of, I can't even remember.

757
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: One that one was, but the one that I did farming into the, into Animal Crossing, I could argue would be the update of that year.

758
00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Mm-hmm.

759
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like I think that is, that was a good update and I like, does it make the original game any less than it was?

760
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like the, the fundamental problems that some people have with Animal Crossing, your horizons were never fixed.

761
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:12.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Right.

762
00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:21.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And so if, if it had better conversations with and felt like the villagers were more real people at the beginning,

763
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:35.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: complained about the other things that were added, well, you know, obviously some people would because there's always going to be someone to complain, but like, it would feel, it would feel less fair to argue about those things because these are just new things coming into the game.

764
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I mean, yeah, everybody's gonna complain about something eventually, but...

765
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:44.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We, we got two years worth of updates for that game and then people complained when they didn't add more, you know, like, I, I think.

766
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:50.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah Oh, well totally, absolutely I and as someone who is very laid back about a lot of this stuff like I am very much like taken as it comes

767
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.079
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

768
00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:53.920
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I do whatever they decide they want to do even at the you know

769
00:55:54.760 --> 00:56:00.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: At the behest of like the corporation who's got their hands in it and is dictating how it goes

770
00:56:01.639 --> 00:56:05.019
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm still pretty laid back about a lot of stuff.

771
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:26.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But I can see we're Animal Crossing New Horizons, some of the things like as an example, the museum not having a top floor and it just goes to know where until they, you know, patching what was supposed to be there, things like that where there are like little things where you can see they probably ran out of time on some of this stuff.

772
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But how much of that is running out of time and how much of that is

773
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I mean, for some of that stuff, I can agree with, but for things.

774
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That feel much more egregious like a top floor that goes nowhere. I think it's a little less like, you know, and maybe it was. Maybe it was. I don't know, but

775
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:46.099
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't know. I like, I actually, I thought that was one of the examples of like, oh, there's

776
00:56:46.099 --> 00:56:50.980
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: cli, like when they fit released the first update, you go back and you look at things differently,

777
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and you're like, oh, this clearly going to be something here in the museum. We were all talking

778
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure. Yeah.

779
00:56:54.579 --> 00:56:58.739
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: about that. There's clearly going to be something in the museum. We didn't know what it would be,

780
00:56:58.739 --> 00:57:00.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: but we was clearly going to be something.

781
00:57:00.659 --> 00:57:07.940
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right. Yeah. And I think especially because the game didn't like, you know, adding that stuff

782
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:16.099
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: didn't change the like end game for anybody. It didn't change like the the the full experience of

783
00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:23.619
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: of the game. I think that that's understandable too and changes, you know, the argument about like

784
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:30.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: what I'm quote unfinished. I think and again, I think that it's totally reasonable that they're to

785
00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:37.139
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: expect that there are things just like with Pokemon Scarlet and Violet like probably a lot of stuff

786
00:57:37.139 --> 00:57:44.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: behind the scenes that included the Switch 2 development cycle and the and how the pandemic impacted

787
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:51.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that and how the Pokemon merch machine needs to keep moving and, but you know, that that probably

788
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: hindered a lot of what happened behind the scenes.

789
00:57:54.500 --> 00:58:24.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And so I think it's fair to say that, like, expect that probably there are things that they just ran out of time on and I think there are certainly things that felt like that in Animal Crossing New Horizons, but to say that it's a like detriment to the game is unfair for sure, but you know, I think if it's if it's something that does wind up being this is what completes the game, this is what makes the game complete and it's you know.

790
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:53.900
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Two years or whatever after the release, then I think it there's a little bit more of like a question about like for me at least if like, okay, well, does that, does that, you know, does that make it the the like definitive experience then or is the like pre update the defeat, you know, I don't know, but again, this is also coming from someone who has not played this specific me go update I'm just trying to get a little bit more understanding of how.

791
00:58:54.500 --> 00:59:00.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Hopefully the update impacts the how the game turned out after the fact, sorry, it's going to go ahead.

792
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.280
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, that was going to be my question.

793
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.219
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: No, that was pretty much exactly my question.

794
00:59:03.219 --> 00:59:09.480
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I was like, this update with Mika, how did it affect the end game at all?

795
00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:16.099
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No, no, it was it's it's not something you realistically could have done before and game

796
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.820
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Okay, well, yeah, then that that changes it for sure

797
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.639
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So then in that case, there's a lot of winded conversations.

798
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's definitely postgame stuff

799
00:59:23.639 --> 00:59:27.480
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think then that I'm happy to give it to Mika.

800
00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:30.780
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Again the the first update the first update absolutely is and should have been the 1.0 release

801
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I well it was the 1.0 release

802
00:59:32.539 --> 00:59:38.380
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: They've released it in early access for some reason and then release two updates within three months and suddenly it wasn't in early access

803
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I will never understand.

804
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:51.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And that decision they should have just released the first update as the 1.0 that's when you release it and then mount gone as an update later on I think should have been the decision I don't know why they made the decision they made.

805
00:59:51.500 --> 01:00:02.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But be that as it made that update added a bunch of stuff that did change how you play the game as you go through and I think should have been the first version.

806
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:09.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But the said the the the manga on is basically post game dungeons which.

807
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:22.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The other the other thing to say is that I think there is as Kevin says in his his comment it's a great reason to go back and I do think there is something to do that and it's a hard balance to make.

808
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:35.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I do think that sometimes updates to games are a good reason to go back in. Would I have gone back to stardew last year without 1.6 coming out probably not some people do but I probably wouldn't have.

809
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure. I agree.

810
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But I went back and spent another 150 hours in that game.

811
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.480
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah. [laughs]

812
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Because that update came out.

813
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It was the first time I perfected the game.

814
01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The first time I did everything in the game.

815
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So, like, it's a hard balance to make.

816
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I do think the start you probably has the right balance of any game of doing it.

817
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Disney Dreamlight Valley has completely the wrong direction.

818
01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Right?

819
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: They have really too many updates with too little content.

820
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You're like, oh, here's another update.

821
01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's got two new characters.

822
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Cool.

823
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

824
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: All right, what am I going to do?

825
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:26.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm going to go back next year to the jungle.

826
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I can't remember the jungle update, I can't remember what it's called.

827
01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:33.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Am I going to go back and play that? Maybe? Maybe it's been long enough now,

828
01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.820
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: but had I completed the game and then three months later, the Godzilla one came out,

829
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.820
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Would I go back just to play the game?

830
01:01:39.500 --> 01:02:02.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm going to contradict myself here because it was a small update. It just added a bunch of postgame dungeons and nothing else, but also that game isn't a massive game in and of itself. Right? Like you can complete that game in about 10 hours I think.

831
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:09.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It just adds a couple more hours into an already great game and it probably came about the right sort of time that hadn't completely forgotten.

832
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: about the game and if it came out now, would I go back?

833
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think with that with that context in mind

834
01:02:17.659 --> 01:02:20.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: of like, this is not necessarily a strict criteria

835
01:02:20.659 --> 01:02:23.219
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: but keeping cutting in the back of our heads

836
01:02:23.219 --> 01:02:27.579
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: with updates or trying to decide on the update of the year.

837
01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:31.739
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Knowing or yeah, keeping and keeping the context of

838
01:02:31.739 --> 01:02:36.739
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: would I go back to this game and either replay the game

839
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: or sink in however many more hours into the game.

840
01:02:40.659 --> 01:02:42.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think that's a general criteria

841
01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.699
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: that's good to kind of keep in mind

842
01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:45.599
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: with the update of the year?

843
01:02:45.500 --> 01:03:02.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: And from what it sounds like with Snacko, it's hard for me to say, because I didn't play it before, but for what it sounds like a Snacko, I think while cooking can be really cool for people, I don't know if that's necessarily an update that would bring people back to the game.

844
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:15.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: The DLC for Day the Diver, I don't know if that's something that would bring people back to the game. Lens Island? I don't know either. Horses maybe?

845
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:24.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Again, I played Lens Island after the 1.0 came out, so I can't, I'm not even sure what was in the 1.1 update because I, yeah, I played it. I didn't play it. Pre 1.1.

846
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, that was a community feedback update.

847
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:31.300
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Right, I mean, it's great that they are very involved with their community. That's a really awesome

848
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:40.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It, I don't, yeah, yeah, I know it was like there was camera settings and chunk loading settings and a sorting button for storage items.

849
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

850
01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't, they added a bunch of stuff.

851
01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:56.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Stuff that is good, but also I, if we're going to go back to the like argument of what should be in a 1.0, a lot of these things are like, you can now move items, whereas previously you had to delete and recreate them.

852
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Mmm, I'd see.

853
01:04:00.199 --> 01:04:02.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah...

854
01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:09.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I feel that sentiment. I feel that sentiment as well. Whatever that sound is, I get it. I agree.

855
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't think it should be lines island 1.1, and I agree with you, I don't think it should be snack a 1.1 because, yeah, cooking is not.

856
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: what I want to go back and take aim for.

857
01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:19.219
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It might be for some people, but I feel like for me, I'm the same way.

858
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.940
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think also especially after so soon after.

859
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:36.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Maybe that it's it's not it doesn't really it who knows maybe like people are coming coming back to it because of the cooking

860
01:04:36.699 --> 01:04:43.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But like you probably if you're playing snack, oh, you probably maybe you still playing it or like it's still pretty fresh to you

861
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:50.860
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So there's not really much of a need to come back, but I don't know I am very prepared to

862
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: default to what the consensus is

863
01:04:56.039 --> 01:04:58.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: for update of the year.

864
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.480
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Well, and we did have two people on the pole saying Mika and nothing else got to two votes so

865
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Just to clarify.

866
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I did hear it quite a bit.

867
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Did Disney dream live on it?

868
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Valley not have to.

869
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:13.639
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It had for two different updates and we are we are not doing

870
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I thought I'd heard it at you, but.

871
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, got it.

872
01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Rank choice voting here. Sorry

873
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:25.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, I mean it sounds like we're giving it sounds like nobody's really got an argument against it being Mika anymore

874
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah.

875
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:34.380
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: enough I am pretty I feel comfortable about that and after tube if it helps too

876
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - No.

877
01:05:28.519 --> 01:05:31.119
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I had questions, you answered them,

878
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.940
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: after like looking through all of these and everything considering I haven't

879
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.980
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: played a lot of these games Mika was a game that shot up and like oh I would

880
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:46.179
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: like to play the student rather than later this update also added to me

881
01:05:46.179 --> 01:05:49.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: wanted to check out the game more so

882
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think Chibi Games might be the first people to win two of the years from our podcast,

883
01:05:55.199 --> 01:06:00.719
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: because they of course won 2020 with Summer in Mara. So there we go, a first.

884
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.280
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

885
01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:06.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: All right, let's go slightly faster for this next section, because we've only got 45 minutes left

886
01:06:06.239 --> 01:06:11.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: before Mike needs to leave. Early access of the year. So this was also added last year,

887
01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:18.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and we gave it last year to fields of mystery. I've only, I've

888
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.719
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: limited it to games that have released in early access this year. So we're not including games that

889
01:06:22.719 --> 01:06:27.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: were released in early access before and are still in early access. They can get another shot

890
01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:33.519
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: at a game when they released a 1.0. So the nominations list are Abyss, New Dawn, Artisan Story,

891
01:06:33.519 --> 01:06:39.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Chronomon, Dolok Town, Galactic Getaway, Grimshire, Honeymancer, Hotel Galactic, Out and

892
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:46.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: About, Seeds of Calamity, Starbirds, Superforming By, Tales of Sake You, Voyages of Nara.

893
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.280
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Our opinions from the poll are Kevin says, "Despite clearly lacking a lot, including a reason to keep

894
01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: playing, Starbirds works technically well, has a delightful art style and has lots of potential."

895
01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:09.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And then everyone else said nothing, except Cat gave a reason why they were saying nothing.

896
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

897
01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:15.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm basically abstaining from this because I only have anti-votes against Tales of Sake You,

898
01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and ran so poorly my perfectly good PC could barely.

899
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And hotel galactic sounded like a nightmare launch.

900
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No early access really grabbed me this year.

901
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:32.480
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I agree with those two anti-votes. Obviously haven't played either of those, but only early

902
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Disguss!

903
01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: access game out of this list that I played, and I only played the demo was to look down.

904
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:41.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I also heard about the poor. I read about the poor reception.

905
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:50.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Well, in the sense of the bug-iness of Tales of Sake-U and Hotel Galaxy, go Galactic. Oh, no, no, no.

906
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I wanted to get a pre-reception, I missed that.

907
01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:49.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, sorry, I thought you meant doll looked down, doll looked down.

908
01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.480
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Doll looked down has overwhelmingly positive reviews.

909
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's all.

910
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:51.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's all.

911
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's all.

912
01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's all.

913
01:07:53.519 --> 01:07:55.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It has a 90% on Steam DB.

914
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yes, Grimshire does as well.

915
01:07:57.159 --> 01:07:59.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I really should, I really should play this game.

916
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.599
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I really should. Maybe I'll wait to 1.0.

917
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I really enjoyed it.

918
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I will say I only played the demo, really enjoyed it.

919
01:08:05.599 --> 01:08:10.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I will say I disagree with Kevin. I don't want, I don't want Starbucks to win it.

920
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like, yes, it looks great.

921
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.280
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And it has a lot of potential, but that's all it has.

922
01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It has potential.

923
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It has a core gameplay loop that you spend five minutes playing and go,

924
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: cool, why? And that's, that's it.

925
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Mm-hmm.

926
01:08:25.239 --> 01:08:29.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And it's, it's cool arts, it's delightful art style, while delightful is

927
01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: just the same art style as Kurtzka's that uses in their videos, which is why

928
01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:38.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: they've done it, right? But like, it's not like it's new and inventive.

929
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:41.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's just what they have in their videos that they've then put in a game.

930
01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.699
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I mean I marked it down as a game that I'm not interested in so take that as you will

931
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

932
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I would be happy with giving it to Dool-Octone based on

933
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:55.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Aslan having played it and enjoyed it and it having very good reviews

934
01:08:55.539 --> 01:08:59.699
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and I actively don't want to give it to anything else.

935
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:13.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - I mean the only things that I really thought were like interesting and like a super

936
01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:04.260
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Unless mica can convince us of something else.

937
01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:20.720
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: farming boy has a really cool art style and like I like the concept of the you know switching

938
01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:27.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: up the the farming genre to be a little bit more like active and combo-based and stuff.

939
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And it's not something that...

940
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:36.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it's super, like, life-changing to me, you know?

941
01:09:36.159 --> 01:09:47.720
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I really love games that do things that, like, out and about did as far as, like, forging goes and real-world identifiers and stuff like that.

942
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:53.560
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Also, still stuff that has kind of been done before, but I think in the package that it's in...

943
01:09:53.560 --> 01:10:02.939
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's a little more interesting and enticing.

944
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:30.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I have not played it, and I will say that, oh, this is my, you know, my one chance to gripe about early access, very briefly, if you are releasing an early access game, and it's not done yet, maybe put out a demo, because it's hard to justify buying into a game that is incomplete, and you don't really know what you're getting out of it.

945
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:41.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So, you know, I don't know, I think everything should have demos, but I also think that early access should, for sure, have demos, because I think you're...

946
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:44.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that's fair yeah I think that is a very fair point and I do think there is

947
01:10:44.119 --> 01:10:49.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: possibly an argument that we shouldn't be giving an early access award I mean

948
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.300
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I did it last year because I really wanted to give fields of mystery

949
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:57.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: award and award let's be honest absolutely absolutely and I'm so excited for

950
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

951
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Which deservedly deserved it?

952
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: 1.0, which presumably is coming out next year. I don't think they've

953
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: said anything, but goodness. I, yeah, it's difficult. There's always going to be issues

954
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:16.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I just think that if you're right, and I think, oh, sorry, go ahead.

955
01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:15.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: with early access games and the question, you know, you go for

956
01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:23.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I was just going to say that I think an easy way to justify, you know, there's, there

957
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:29.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: is justification for early access for, you know, indie studios that it's generating income

958
01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: well.

959
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: There's still working on the game and so on.

960
01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:38.140
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think, you know, if, if you're going to do that, though, putting out a demo so that people

961
01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:45.140
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: for it, because there's been so many games over the years that like, maybe I'm just

962
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:50.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: jaded at this point that I'm like, I wish that I had known a little bit more about what

963
01:11:50.079 --> 01:11:53.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: this game was going to feel like before I bought into the early access.

964
01:11:53.239 --> 01:11:59.100
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And then the, by the time the game releases at 1.0, I don't really care about it as much

965
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.020
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and I don't really, you know, it's, it's too late.

966
01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:08.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I already own it, you know, like, I think it, I think having a demo is, is great.

967
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:14.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm not going to play dole at town, but I, I'm, I'm not ready yet to, to throw $15 at something

968
01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:19.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that I don't know, really how it's going to play or what it's, you know, going to wind

969
01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: up being.

970
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So, but the art style looks awesome.

971
01:12:22.539 --> 01:12:25.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I love the, the pixel art that they did for it.

972
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:35.020
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's very like unique looking pixel art, lots of like jagged edges and sharp, like the,

973
01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the sharp grass and sharp angles and stuff.

974
01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it's very good.

975
01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:42.979
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But yeah, I don't know beyond that.

976
01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:45.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I like the post-apocalyptic world, too.

977
01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:49.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think how I'm looking at this, again, to be fair,

978
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.380
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I didn't play the early axes.

979
01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I've only played the demo, so I'm coming from that context.

980
01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:56.859
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I think, out of all the games on this list,

981
01:12:56.859 --> 01:13:01.020
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: in regards to just purely something that looks

982
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:04.859
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: like it has some future promise, I think

983
01:13:04.859 --> 01:13:09.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Deloque Town caught my interest the most.

984
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Ronomon, seem very interesting.

985
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Because you can play it on a smart watch apparently.

986
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So that also is very intriguing.

987
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I don't know, I have to relook at it.

988
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:27.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I also want to take into consideration when picking early access of the year is how did people receive it as well.

989
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Because like, tails of sake, you looks very interesting to me.

990
01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:35.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But if it's so buggy, then I don't think it should be winning early access of the year.

991
01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Because it's like, why is it out then?

992
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It should be a consistent, promising

993
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:47.699
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: look into what the full game is going to be. Doesn't have to be perfect, but...

994
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: When I was looking through this, yeah. No, I totally agree. When I was looking through this

995
01:13:49.439 --> 01:13:57.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: list, because a lot of these I hadn't really heard of too. I had looked at, you know, I wrote

996
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: down the ones that I thought looked cool and interesting to me. And Tales of Sekhi was definitely

997
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:09.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: in there, but I guess I didn't realize that it was running as poorly as it was. I mean, it's got

998
01:14:09.359 --> 01:14:14.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: like pretty positive reviews on Steam, but I, you know,

999
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:28.319
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that's also the, like, the, some of the woes of early access is like the optimization is not there. The, you know, I don't know. It's, it's in a lot of ways,

1000
01:14:28.319 --> 01:14:56.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: probably not ready for, uh, consumer eyes, but I.

1001
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:46.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think this is the thing is like an early access for a game to win early access. It doesn't it doesn't need to be perfect because it's obviously is an early access. It will have missing things.

1002
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think I agree in that it needs to run well.

1003
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: At least half with you soon.

1004
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:57.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think I think I think run well on a half decent computer. I think it I think that's a fair thing. It needs to be playable.

1005
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, totally.

1006
01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I also think that people's reaction to it is an important part.

1007
01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.579
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1008
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:19.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There are a few others that have very positive, but there's only two that have overwhelmingly.

1009
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:34.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And I guess part of the problem is like we're competing massively different games, right? There's always the issue with games of the year, and especially with early access because we're talking about things that could be almost finished with things that are like barely started, right?

1010
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, goodness. Which which of these are your most exciting?

1011
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm happy to give it to D'Loctown.

1012
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: D'Loctown.

1013
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I mean, I do. I do like the concept of Cronomon for sure. Again, no demo, so I wasn't

1014
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:58.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: really ready to commit to it, but I like the idea of crossing boundaries for tech and stuff

1015
01:15:58.239 --> 01:16:05.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the same way that like Rusty's retirement did and in creating a genre of like desktop

1016
01:16:05.079 --> 01:16:12.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: functioning games, but again, I haven't played it so I can't really, you know, I think

1017
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1018
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: a dull look down looks interesting. Is it the most like interesting of these to me? Not

1019
01:16:17.479 --> 01:16:25.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: necessarily, but also, you know, it's slim pickings for me. I hate to say two times in a row,

1020
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No, that's fair

1021
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:34.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: like I'm willing to default to others opinions, but I, you know, it's hard not to when

1022
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:40.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think if I look at all of these games and I think I can only play one of them, I think it's

1023
01:16:40.779 --> 01:16:45.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: going to do a lot of time. There's quite a few games of these that I do want to play at some point,

1024
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, and I'm okay with that.

1025
01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's definitely.

1026
01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:50.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: but it does seem to be that. It looks like it runs well. It looks like people like it. And also,

1027
01:16:50.779 --> 01:16:57.260
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I just love the look of it. I like what it's doing. I like its differences, but also how it's similar.

1028
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, totally.

1029
01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:03.180
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I like the, there's something really fun about the kind of like 2D spirit fairter style farm.

1030
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:10.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm really excited to play in another game. Not many games do it. It's funny that we're talking about

1031
01:17:10.539 --> 01:17:15.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: spirit fairter again. Listeners won't know that we've talked about it already, but we talk about it in

1032
01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:21.899
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: the greenhouse episode. I'm not about to talk about it again, but yeah, I'm good with it being

1033
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I can comfortably accept that.

1034
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Woo! (laughs)

1035
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:33.100
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Whoo, congratulations to all of the uptown early access game of the year 2025

1036
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Huge. Yeah.

1037
01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:39.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So we're gonna come into game of the year. I wanted to have a quick discussion about how people feel

1038
01:17:39.739 --> 01:17:44.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Without talking about specifics how they feel the year compares to previous years

1039
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We have more more games released this year than any other game year in this genre

1040
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:51.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But does it feel like that's good or bad?

1041
01:17:51.819 --> 01:17:57.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm like is there other things that you're like these are amazing games or does it feel?

1042
01:17:57.579 --> 01:18:03.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like you've just are you farming game doubt etc etc. Cool. It's on first

1043
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.680
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yes. I'm farming game doubt. That's my one sentence. I, it's, it's a great year if you love farming

1044
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

1045
01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.600
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: games. If you are farming game doubt, it is very overwhelming.

1046
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So are you farming gained out because there are so many?

1047
01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So is it a great year if you're like farming games or is it too much?

1048
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:31.939
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think it's too much. For me, it's too much. I don't know. There are some strong contenders

1049
01:18:31.939 --> 01:18:38.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: that catch my interest, which I do appreciate. But like, it's the oversaturation is kind of like

1050
01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:43.859
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: getting to me personally. I'm just like, I am happy with my two or three farming games,

1051
01:18:43.859 --> 01:18:47.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: and then that's like it. I don't even want to look at too many more.

1052
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: This is the problem, right? There are games that generally ask so much of you.

1053
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like, I, when I start a farming game, I'm generally, unless there's a game that I'm specifically

1054
01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:04.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: picking up because it's short, which there were, where a few that I did in September and October

1055
01:19:04.159 --> 01:19:08.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that I picked up because I knew they were short. And I was like, let's get up my number of games

1056
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:14.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: that played this year. Unless you're specifically doing that, so many farming games you go in,

1057
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: expecting to sink in, you know, 10

1058
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: of if not hundreds of hours, you know, like rpgs like we've been talking about in the the green

1059
01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:30.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: house episode we were talking about. What's it called? Yeah, the Yakuza games or no, was that that

1060
01:19:30.479 --> 01:19:34.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: wasn't the green house? This was in this game this episode. I'm so confused. We were talking about

1061
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That was a simple story.

1062
01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: We were talking about oblivion and stuff.

1063
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1064
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yakuza and we're talking about persona. It's the same sort of thing you expect to sink in a lot of time

1065
01:19:39.119 --> 01:19:46.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: into those games. And so therefore, and part of this maybe because obviously you guys not as much as me

1066
01:19:46.800 --> 01:20:16.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: but still to some

1067
01:19:48.000 --> 01:20:18.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I physically can't play every game. There were I think it's 65 games released this year in the farming games genre. And there are probably ones I've missed. It's impossible. It's just physically, if you played one a week, you still wouldn't get through them all. And a week is not a long time to play through

1068
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Holy cow, yeah.

1069
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:20.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I was trying to think about this question when you, when you should present it earlier

1070
01:20:20.199 --> 01:20:26.279
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and like prior to recording and I guess the most succinct way that I can like put how I feel

1071
01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:33.319
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: about it is that I feel like we are at a point where we have surpassed the like boom of farming

1072
01:20:33.319 --> 01:20:42.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: games and we're at a point now where creators need to really like figure out what they want to

1073
01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:52.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: because I feel like there's a lot of repetition in the space creatively you know as I was

1074
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: going through some of this stuff and looking at some of the games that were released this year

1075
01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:04.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: or even just the early access I'm like okay this looks like you know it so and so I'm not that

1076
01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:09.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: interested in it moving on to the next one and like okay this looks like the same thing so I'm

1077
01:21:09.479 --> 01:21:12.920
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm moving on to the next thing and I think we're out of kind of like

1078
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: awkward growth stage in it where it the last couple years the last few years have been so

1079
01:21:20.039 --> 01:21:26.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: successful for farming games and college core games in general that like we've seen so much of

1080
01:21:26.439 --> 01:21:35.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: everything that now the creativity really needs to like shine through in in how you approach them

1081
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:44.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: rather than just making the same thing with a different skin you know.

1082
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah. I agree. I definitely agree. Sometimes that works for some people because maybe like,

1083
01:21:46.439 --> 01:21:52.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: like if you told me there was a magical girl farming sim, I'd be like, signed me up.

1084
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:57.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I was going to say, I have a great game for you.

1085
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:56.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But that's also kind of already feels a mystery on a way, at least just like Sailor Moon all the way.

1086
01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:07.939
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But but this is the thing, there's also there's also this 10 of them already, you know, like this is this is the problem is every every hook that every farming game has is also been done by someone else.

1087
01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Which is why I picked it up.

1088
01:22:08.579 --> 01:22:20.979
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Right, and so like they also then need to be good and they also need to be a reason to do it. I think I'm I've been thinking about this quite a bit over the last few weeks because like I don't know is it fair to say I've been feeling burn out a little bit with farming games.

1089
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:27.300
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And like seriously considered stopping the podcast after this episode. Um,

1090
01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:40.939
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But I'm not going to don't worry listeners. I'm going to continue into next year, but I'm changing how I'm thinking about things and changing how I'm going to keep going forwards because I can't just keep going in the same way I am, I will die.

1091
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure. (laughs)

1092
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:48.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Right, there's there's too many. I'm trying to play too many games and I looked back on my list and I talk about this in the greenhouse episode.

1093
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, 100%.

1094
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:57.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There's almost no games. I've played the aren't farming games. There's this this three. That's it. There are well, except like I did play a bunch of old Pokemon games earlier in the year.

1095
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:07.100
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Because I wanted to get the home decks is done for for the stuff and in Pokemon home, but other like other than that, I didn't play any other games that weren't farming games.

1096
01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:19.659
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I played I think 13 farming games this year averages out just over one a month and I played five games that weren't farming games.

1097
01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:27.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And so yeah, I need I need I need to rethink how I go forward and I think the problem is that

1098
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:34.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: like, I'm like, oh, well, we need someone to decide what are the good games and tell people these are the ones you should play and then I realized wait, that's me.

1099
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1100
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1101
01:23:37.819 --> 01:23:51.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So yeah, I don't know. I don't know what that means going forward. I just it's interesting because like there are more games now, the their more games are less year than there have been farming games basically every year, except last year combined.

1102
01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:57.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Right, like there are just it's insane how many games have released this year that it's just impossible to keep up and

1103
01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:04.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think I've missed out on games that I think I should have played and because it's just so hard to decide which ones to play.

1104
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Totally. I completely agree.

1105
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.060
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - Right, yeah, I could.

1106
01:24:06.939 --> 01:24:16.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: On that note, what is the game that you most wish you had played you'd managed to make or find the time to play this year that you haven't.

1107
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Do you want to go, Micah?

1108
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:27.739
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: well, I've got a fun one. Uh, well, I've got, I've got, I've got two technically one that I think

1109
01:24:20.779 --> 01:24:23.739
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Go for it a fun game. What a crazy idea.

1110
01:24:27.739 --> 01:24:36.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: will be a fun thing for Al. I wish that I, I genuinely wish that I had more time to be able to

1111
01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:41.899
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: play Corel Island this year because I have heard you rave about it for so long and I finally

1112
01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:47.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: bit the bullet got the game and I just didn't have time to touch

1113
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and I wish that I would have, especially with updates and stuff that happened

1114
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:59.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and I was hopeful to be able to like talk about it, but I just did not get

1115
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:05.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: an opportunity to play it. maybe next year maybe game of the year 2026 will be when we

1116
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:14.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's always maybe next year, do you, do you need me, do you need me to schedule an episode

1117
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:11.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: finally get to talk about coral island, but again just too much stuff came out this year

1118
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1119
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:19.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: too many things that you know

1120
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:17.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: where we talk about it, even though I've talked about it twice already.

1121
01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.899
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Uh, just so you actually play it.

1122
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

1123
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:29.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that does force me to play games, but and then the more serious answer I guess is a bugaboo pocket which

1124
01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:22.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's true.

1125
01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:37.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: again didn't really know that this existed until I was looking through show notes and looking through some of this stuff

1126
01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:45.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: um I after I looked into it and looked at the store page and looked at the trailer and so on I just I just bought it

1127
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: bought it 'cause it, it.

1128
01:25:47.739 --> 01:25:55.100
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It really speaks to me the, like, bug collecting aspect in a little, like,

1129
01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:04.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: virtual pet sort of style presentation seems very cool to me. I, I think bugs are very cute.

1130
01:26:05.819 --> 01:26:13.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I love the idea of this. So I wish that I had gotten a chance to play it so that I could talk about it

1131
01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: in time for this episode, but unfortunately I didn't.

1132
01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.420
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: good news for you. I have the game and I played the game and he recorded an episode about the game.

1133
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:22.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

1134
01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:26.420
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But so I can give some some takes on that, but I will say you made a good purchase.

1135
01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:29.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Cool, that's good to hear.

1136
01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:32.180
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I thoroughly enjoyed it. And I guess since I'm already talking, you want me to

1137
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:32.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: What about you, isn't it?

1138
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yes, please.

1139
01:26:34.659 --> 01:26:41.060
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: since I started talking about Bugaboo Pocket. I'll say because I wasn't, I was like, I figured

1140
01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:46.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: this would be a like a cottagecore game or like farming game conversation.

1141
01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So I was like, if we're talking cottagecore game or farming game, that I would say

1142
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: the game that I wish that I played was spirit fair. Even though it wasn't released this year,

1143
01:26:56.899 --> 01:27:02.579
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: it's, I literally had the game in my library for a hot minute and I just haven't worked my way to the

1144
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I cannot say that you're wrong because we gave Spidot Fader a game of the year and a year it didn't come out so

1145
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.460
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1146
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:19.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I also just said Corel Island and that didn't come out this year, so that's you know, I think we're all on the same page.

1147
01:27:15.399 --> 01:27:21.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, look Spidot Fader is a game. I think anybody who plays games should play

1148
01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay, so we're good.

1149
01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:24.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Spidot Fader it is

1150
01:27:24.479 --> 01:27:31.939
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: An amazing game like it is it is one of my favorite games of all time full stop like it is just it is so good if you like games

01:27:33.079 --> 01:27:36.699
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You should play this game. Like it's just any if you like any games

1152
01:27:37.439 --> 01:27:41.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: You should play this game except maybe maybe don't

1153
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.800
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: You know, you don't got to convince me more. I've had it. I've owned it.

1154
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1155
01:27:41.939 --> 01:27:46.640
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Maybe don't play it like the week after a family member dies give it a couple months

1156
01:27:47.079 --> 01:27:47.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Fair.

1157
01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:51.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's that's all that is that is all I would say like don't

1158
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Very very very fair

1159
01:27:52.319 --> 01:27:57.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like don't give it years, right? You got a you got a you got to process these things

1160
01:27:57.199 --> 01:28:01.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But like maybe give yourself a couple months after a family member dies. That's all I'm saying

1161
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Fair

1162
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1163
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So I've heard so I've heard

1164
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I also listed it. I was like just in case we want a game that released this year

1165
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I don't know if this is necessarily

1166
01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Consid I feel like it's considered cottagecore but a game that I still really really really want to pick up this tiny bookshop as well

1167
01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.680
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I've heard a lot of good things about that game, too

1168
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:23.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it totally counts as cottagecore.

1169
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's not on my list, but like I mean my list is

1170
01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Loose shall we see

1171
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

1172
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1173
01:28:32.579 --> 01:28:36.300

<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it's a very cute game.

1175
01:28:38.619 --> 01:28:42.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I stumbled onto it from a friend's recommendation.

1176
01:28:42.699 --> 01:28:48.140
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And it's a very cute and comfy game.

1177
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay, sweet. I will definitely pick it up at some point.

1178
01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I highly recommend it.

1179
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: All right let's decide on whoo we love a demo.

1180
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And it's kind of demo.

1181
01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Ah, I love that. No, I love it.

1182
01:28:53.859 --> 01:28:57.619
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sorry, I got to just call out the demos when they show up,

1183
01:28:57.619 --> 01:29:00.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So. (laughs)

1184
01:28:59.079 --> 01:29:00.399
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: You're the devil person. Got it.

1185
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughs]

1186
01:29:01.079 --> 01:29:04.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm not going to play that demo because I already know I'm not going to enjoy playing the game

1187
01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:10.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: because it's a management style game. All right let's decide on a game of the year we can do this

1188
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That's fair. That's fair.

1189
01:29:10.359 --> 01:29:14.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: we're nearly there I'm going to change up how I'm doing this a little bit in that I'm not

1190
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.279
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: going to announce all of the previous winners because now that list is getting quite long

1191
01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:23.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'll just say that last year, Russell.

1192
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [Woo]

1193
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:32.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm not going to go through the list of all the games released this year because this list has 50 games in it.

1194
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:40.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The 65 was because of the 1.0 releases as well, but this really, this, or not, early access, that's what I'm talking about.

1195
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:48.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: This list of games that came out in 1.0 is 50 games long. I am not going to read out 50 games in a row to use.

1196
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think we go straight into nominations so just to remind

1197
01:29:51.000 --> 01:30:16.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: you guys can do it however you want and should we go in the order that we've got there, Michael, you can go first.

1198
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:12.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Yeah.

1199
01:30:16.739 --> 01:30:19.640

<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I put runners up on here and I don't really know why.

1201
01:30:22.479 --> 01:30:25.140
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: There's just were a lot of games that I played that I liked.

1202
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:28.659
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, okay. If we've got, no, that's fine. That's fine. We'll do that first then. So if you've got, if you've got games that you're not actually nominating,

1203
01:30:28.659 --> 01:30:34.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: you're just saying these are ones that you want to say that were great. And in any other year might have gotten nomination, then go for it.

1204
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I will say that I listed these as runners up because I like them. I know that they are not going to win

1205
01:30:42.039 --> 01:30:47.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That's that's the that's the premise that I'll set except for one of them. Tomigachi Plaza

1206
01:30:48.199 --> 01:30:53.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: as a Tomigachi fan absolutely loved the game. It was a switch

1207
01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:03.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It was a like switch version of the DS corner shop games, which I loved and grew up with it's great

1208
01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.640
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Is it gonna win? Absolutely.

1209
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: We're not. Did people really not like it? Absolutely. They didn't like it. Case in point, Alice speaking right now.

1210
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.159
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No, 'cause it was a terrible game.

1211
01:31:09.119 --> 01:31:14.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I absolutely hate that game with an absolute passion.

1212
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.399
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm like Slack John right now.

1213

<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Most games, it's not for me.

1216
01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:23.060
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There are only two games that I've said are bad,

<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Sugar Jew Island and Tamagotcha Plaza is a bad game.

1219
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.100
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's okay listeners. He just doesn't get it and that's okay

<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: No, you are just blinded by nostalgia.

1222
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:42.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: is what it is and you are never going to say anything negative of it, Tamagotchi, mica.

1223
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:47.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Now that's not necessarily true, but it's not necessarily wrong either

1224
01:31:48.500 --> 01:32:02.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Whew! This is crazy. I thought that was like, because all I know is Al's opinion, I thought that was like, you were like, coming in with like sarcasm. I was like, oh, and then I realized how much I was like, no, you're serious. Oh!

1225
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:07.319
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, I loved it. I fully 100% of it. I think it got a lot more hate than it deserved,

1226
01:32:07.319 --> 01:32:17.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: given what it was supposed to be. And they still have like regularly little updates and things

1227
01:32:17.479 --> 01:32:23.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: to like scenery as the seasons change and so on. I think it's great and I love it and I love

<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: playing it. Did I think it was going to win? Absolutely not. That's why it's where it is.

1230
01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:39.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Tales of the Shire. I also got a lot of dislike from what I had seen. I loved it because I love

1231
01:32:39.239 --> 01:32:46.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Lord of the Rings. I love Tolkien. I love the Hobbit aesthetic. I thought it did some really,

1232
01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:54.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: really cool things with like the social aspects of it and inviting people to dinner and

1233
01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I just thought it was really good.

1234
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I understand that people don't agree.

1235
01:33:03.359 --> 01:33:09.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I don't think it was game of the year material, for sure, but I thought it was good.

1236
01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:14.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And if you like toking, then yeah, it's probably for you.

1237
01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:18.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think it's problem is people's expectations.

1238
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: They heard, "Oh, it's a Hobbit stargie."

1239
01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.140
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And they went in expecting a Hobbit stargie.

1240
01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:28.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And like, it's not what people expected.

1241
01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:33.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And that is hard to say that people are wrong about that.

1242
01:33:33.939 --> 01:33:37.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But it's also hard to manage those expectations.

1243
01:33:38.899 --> 01:33:41.979
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The game didn't do itself any favors

1244
01:33:41.979 --> 01:33:44.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: by just announcing themselves.

1245
01:33:44.500 --> 01:34:13.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But you're still going to get people going in with their expectations and it's also like if you compare it to other lord of the ring stuff, it is obviously there are some similarities but like it's it's kind of anti a lot of token stuff.

1246
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:44.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Because it is the bits that you don't see, right? Like you don't you don't see the shy or living its life because that's not interesting film or book, right? And although I'm sure if given enough life that token probably would have done that. But if anybody would he would. But it's it's just it's a hard hard thing to live up to people's expectations.

1247
01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:22.100
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right. Yeah, sure, of course. Yeah.

1248
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Hey

1249
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.119
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Right 100% he would have uh

1250
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:48.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: totally. And I think that they already, unfortunately, sort of

1251
01:34:49.699 --> 01:34:55.939
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: blew it out of the gate because of the delays, I think that immediately set off red flags to

1252
01:34:55.939 --> 01:35:01.300
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: people who were already maybe on the fence about it to say, like, oh, this is something's going wrong.

1253
01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:09.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So, um, I, you know, I don't think that that's necessarily always fair, because we don't know

1254
01:35:09.859 --> 01:35:13.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: what goes like it. Like we've said, for other things, we don't really know what goes on behind the

1255
01:35:14.579 --> 01:35:21.300
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: for why things get delayed and why they don't. Uh, but I, having played it, having avoided that,

1256
01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:28.180
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: you know, um, kind of frustration or that like, you know, negativity about it and having played it

1257
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:35.300
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: myself, I really enjoyed it. I thought it was a really cozy game and a lot of what I was expecting

1258
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:44.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: out of a, uh, hobbit life sim, I guess. Um, but again, don't think it's going to win game game with

1259
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:57.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the year. I don't, you know, uh, yeah, yeah. It's true. And then my last, I, the one of them,

1260
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.640
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Which is weird because like a year ago, I would have said it it was in for a chance, but

1261
01:35:52.039 --> 01:35:54.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's just how these things happen sometimes

1262
01:35:57.539 --> 01:36:01.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'll save, because I know this discussion is probably going to come up some point, but

1263
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [laughing]

1264
01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:06.739
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: squeak cross. I, I was shocked that it wasn't on your list, uh, but I understand that there's a

1265
01:36:06.739 --> 01:36:14.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: lot of stuff as a die hard pick cross defender squeak cross was a beautiful combination of

1266
01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:24.100
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: pick cross and, uh, animal crossing, happy home designer, uh, house decorating. Uh, and it

1267
01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:44.180
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: was another thing that I 100% had happily run factory pixel cross was, it was on the list.

1268
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Maybe maybe next year you can on your own do our which is the best pakras came of the year

1269
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1270
01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We did have we also was it was uh

1271
01:36:40.199 --> 01:36:45.680
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The Rune Factory one came out this year, didn't it? Yeah, couldn't this me? What a what a year?

1272
01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I was like, isn't there one?

1273
01:36:44.819 --> 01:36:52.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: There is squeak cross. However, was not on the list. And in my opinion is maybe the better game,

1274
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It was it

1275
01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: but that's, you know,

1276
01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: look, Renfak tree was bought.

1277
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:07.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: This is both better and worse than the story of season's one.

1278
01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:09.020
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Absolutely. I am shocked how much content is in that game, though. I've put a lot of time into it,

1279
01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:14.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and it's someone who like barrels through pick-cross games. I'm like not even 50% of the way through,

1280
01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:21.100
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and I've just, it's, there's holes. They put a lot into it, and that is both a positive and a negative,

1281
01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think. But those are my, those are my runner-up.

1282
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.060
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Aslan, do you have any runners up that you want to mention?

1283
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:47.600
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I will say so it's so it's so hard for me to talk on this because there are so many games that I have not played because time is limited for me, but my I know, so

1284
01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:38.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [Laughing]

1285
01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:50.939
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: We also didn't play them.

1286
01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There are 50 games in this list,

1287
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Eslin. You don't have to keep saying there are lots of games you didn't play.

1288
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We know that. [Laughing]

1289
01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There are lots of games nobody played.

1290
01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:57.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It seems like I'm just gonna give a big old list of games that I think from just

1291
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:08.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: general knowledge are like games that I think are contenders for like game of the year just purely from reception. I'm sorry. I hate giving context, but I'm going to keep giving context.

1292
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:21.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So my quick speedrun list is Binkum, Discounty, Fantasy Life, Hello Kitty, Lens Island, Slime Adventure 2, Story of Seasons, Hail the Shire. Those are my speedrun!

1293
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I played some of those.

1294
01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:25.260
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, okay, fine, great.

1295
01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:25.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Hey, that's a way to minute now.

1296
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.600
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm breaking Al down.

1297
01:38:25.579 --> 01:38:28.380
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That's two tails of the Shire mentions.

1298
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [Laughter]

1299
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:31.819
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: We might be honest, nothing here.

1300
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:32.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Fantastic, Mike, Mike, what's your first nomination?

1301
01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:39.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, my first nomination is going to be Hello Kitty Island Adventure.

1302
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:45.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Amazing. Cool. This is probably where I see that's also my first nomination.

1303
01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [Laughing]

1304
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:46.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, okay.

1305
01:38:44.899 --> 01:38:46.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh...

1306
01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:52.279
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Hello Kitty Island Adventure is a fantastic game. I did not play it very much this year

1307
01:38:46.899 --> 01:38:48.899
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [Laughing]

1308
01:38:52.279 --> 01:38:56.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: because I played it a lot when it came out on Apple Arcade but most people will have

1309
01:38:56.239 --> 01:39:03.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: played it this year and so that's I'm counting it as a new release because like 90% of

1310
01:39:03.319 --> 01:39:07.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: people who've played the game have probably played it on Switch, right? Let's not let's let's not

1311
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:14.300
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: pretend that many people are on Apple Arcade. It's a fantastic game. It is better than it had any

1312
01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:20.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: right to be. It is amazing because the coincidence of it being called the same thing as the South Park

1313
01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:25.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: joke and they have confirmed it was a coincidence. They did not know about the South Park joke when

1314
01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:33.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: they named the game just makes it even better. I never would have expected it was 2023 I think

1315
01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Kiritima and Apple Arcade.

1316
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Before that game was announced, I never would have existed.

1317
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:42.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I just expected that I would ever actively enjoy a Hello Kitty game.

1318
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:47.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And then this comes out and it's so deep and fun and everything.

1319
01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:57.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And like also, and this sounds like such a silly thing, but like the movement in the game is actively enjoyable.

1320
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah.

1321
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:01.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I will always enjoy jumping in a game.

1322
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:07.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Again, I think every one of my games on my list, you can jump.

1323
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: They did a great job with the movement.

1324
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:13.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And it translated really well from what it was in Apple.

1325
01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And just saying.

1326
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Because I also played it what it launched in Apple Arcade.

1327
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And with everything that launches on Apple Arcade, I go,

1328
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I wish this was on Switch, or I wish this was on console,

1329
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: or something, so I'm not playing on my phone.

1330
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But I did play quite a bit of it, and then I kind of waited to see if it was going to come to this switch.

1331
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I'm happy that I did, because then I played much more of it on the switch.

1332
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And this year, it's just so good.

1333
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Such a good experience. Very fun. It's very task-driven, which I had heard some people had gripes about it in that way.

1334
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That it was just, it just felt like fetch quest sort of, but I...

1335
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I liked it because of that.

1336
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I agree. I love how it's like, you know exactly what you would need to do to continue going like so many games are like

1337
01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh, we're not gonna tell you what you need to do to get to the next friendship level or to get to the next story beat

1338
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:19.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And it's like no no here are the like five things you can do to progress your friendship here are the two things you need to do to get to the next

1339
01:41:19.439 --> 01:41:29.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Anything and you can you can do and also this is what you need to do to get the next quest for this person is also like mind-blowing

1340
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The fact that they can go you can't currently get a quest for this one because you need to raise your friendship level with this other person like you can say

1341
01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's fetch quest all you want, but that's all games are games are just fetch quest. They're go here do that

1342
01:41:41.119 --> 01:41:42.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's the entire game

1343
01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:52.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Right, and you can ignore the quest if you want you can just do things and talk to people and naturally get those things or you can look at the list and do them if you want and I want

1344
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1345
01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I can't argue with any of this because if I had played Harlow Calo Kitty, I would probably agree.

1346
01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:09.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's been on my wishlist for like a really long time. It's just my only hesitation is I fear that

1347
01:42:09.119 --> 01:42:16.079
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: when I download it, it will take all of my time, which is what exactly what it sounds like.

1348
01:42:16.079 --> 01:42:25.760
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: And initially, initially, $40 felt like a lot. But, but it sounds like it's worth its value.

1349
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It is a steep entry point for sure, I will agree.

1350
01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:30.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: And I would probably get good value out of it for the $40. And it goes on sale like someone

1351
01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: regularly, like maybe $5, $10 off or something like that. So I feel like it's worth it.

1352
01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:42.479
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's got overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam. It's constantly, I feel like being updated.

1353
01:42:42.479 --> 01:42:48.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So while I've never played it from what y'all have said, my general interest in it over many,

1354
01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:54.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: many, however long it's been out since Apple Arcade. And just, yeah, the general consensus,

1355
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I would be happy to also

1356
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: nominate it and also it doesn't there's been for whatever reason I'm not a

1357
01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.800
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: huge Sam Rio person but like I have like generally notice that there for

1358
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:12.279
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: whatever reason has been like a slow erasure of Tuxedo Sam and I don't know why

1359
01:43:12.279 --> 01:43:18.279
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: because he is my boy and I love that little dude and he's in the game so the

1360
01:43:18.279 --> 01:43:22.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: fact that he's not a race from the game makes me happy.

1361
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:26.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yes, completely as a karopi stand. I feel the same way, so

1362
01:43:24.119 --> 01:43:26.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh.

1363
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Good, good pick.

1364
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Robbie still exists though, Tuxedo Sam is tough to find, very tough to find.

1365
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.020
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yes, I have noticed that a lot of the like

1366
01:43:35.579 --> 01:43:38.819
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Western stuff they tend to not include karopi for whatever reason

1367
01:43:38.819 --> 01:43:44.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It makes me very sad because he's such a good character. He's such a good good little boy, but

1368
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.680
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: He's such a good

1369
01:43:44.439 --> 01:43:46.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Agreed

1370
01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: if this helps you in any way.

1371
01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:57.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Or one way or another, I agree that the entry point is pretty pricey for it.

1372
01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:04.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It was my wife's main point of contention with it, because I knew that she would love it.

1373
01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:05.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I played it on Apple.

1374
01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:08.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So I was like, it's for sure your type of game.

1375
01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:09.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You will love it.

1376
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: She was like, yeah, I'm at that price.

1377
01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I eventually just bought it for her.

1378
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:15.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I was like, you just got to play it.

1379
01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I know that you're going to like it.

1380
01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:18.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: You have to play it.

1381
01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it was that the game that

1382
01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:25.779
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: she has spent the most time playing this year like she's put hundreds of hours into it which

1383
01:44:25.779 --> 01:44:32.739
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: is tends to be like a rare thing for her so it's always interesting to me when a game gets her to do that so

1384
01:44:34.579 --> 01:44:40.979
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it is well worth the $40 price point but yes if you can get it for sale, get it for sale for sure.

1385
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Um, I don't think Aslan, you understand what nominee thing works. You don't, you don't nominate

1386
01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:52.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: something that has already been just because other people, we will discuss at the end what we think

1387
01:44:52.239 --> 01:44:56.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: wins based on the nominations. So, Aslan was your first nomination.

1388
01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.020
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Uhh...

1389
01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.260
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: My... one of my nominations is Snacko.

1390
01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So this is where I say this, not always another one of my nominations. Am I going to be

1391
01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:04.659
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Just because I...

1392
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1393
01:45:06.319 --> 01:45:13.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: here to announce anything myself. Goodness me.

1394
01:45:06.779 --> 01:45:07.579
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: What?

1395
01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.739
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Didn't this happen last year?

1396
01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't think this much, but anyway, we'll get, well, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I get to go next,

1397
01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: so I can get to announce my third game. Continue. Snack. Go.

1398
01:45:20.939 --> 01:45:21.819
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So yes, Snacko.

1399
01:45:21.819 --> 01:45:23.539
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I, while I haven't, so.

1400
01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:28.380
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: A lot of time into it is one of the few games that I have played on this list, and between

1401
01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:37.180
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: the, definitely the music, the art style, the colors, the characters so far are very silly, cute,

1402
01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:43.340
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: quirky, all that sort of stuff. The character designs are all really cute, and just the gameplay loop

1403
01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:49.979
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: is so good. Like, all I want to do as of recently is just pick up the game, and just, I love,

1404
01:45:49.979 --> 01:45:53.420
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I love the quest love the quest love playing it with the wiki

1405
01:45:53.500 --> 01:46:09.739
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: side by side. I have been really really really enjoying snacko so I that's my that's my spiel. It's hard for me to speak say too much more because I haven't done the full time sink in but like my desire to sink time into it is very strong.

1406
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:12.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: know that's fine yes we we're also at this point where a week away from

1407
01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:17.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: recording a detailed episode on the game but people will have already

1408
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1409
01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:24.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: heard that by the time this comes out I agree I think it's great the I mean

1410
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I've been excited but it's not cool for literally years I interviewed the

1411
01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: developers I think in

1412
01:46:31.000 --> 01:47:00.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: was a 2020 or maybe 21 it was certainly quite a few years ago and I played the alpha of the game back then and when it wasn't even publicly available that point they somehow managed to get an interview with them and they were like hey here's the the alpha if you want to play it before the interview and it was 2020 January of 2020 that I interviewed them and even back then I adored the

1413
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:25.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: the game I didn't put a lot of time into it then but like I said in the interview that it's the first game that I have actively enjoyed decorating in because it's so easy and flexible at the same time the the way you can just like pop things up and you can rotate them and it's not just like not it's kind of grid based but not really grid based.

1414
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.199
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Ooh.

1415
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah

1416
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:31.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The one thing I would I'd find frustrating in the decorating is paths paths are.

1417
01:47:31.000 --> 01:48:00.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It's hard to get me to enjoy decorating and the world is great the graphics are really fun the the controls are good I've been playing it as I say on my my ally and.

1418
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:18.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The has like proper controller support none of this fake controller support you can jump again jumping is a big thing for me in these games you will see as we continue on I like that you can jump it's fun it's fun to jump alright.

1419
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.300
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, you know what? That's a very good point too. It is actually very fun to jump and like the movement system

1420
01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:25.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Like you can go as slow as you want

1421
01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But if you want to like jump over hills and houses and stuff

1422
01:48:30.239 --> 01:48:35.220
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's pretty accessible to do that. So you can like kind of speed through the game if you want to it's it's quite nice

1423
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I've got some words to say about snake how if I'm allowed.

1424
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.760
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1425
01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:47.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I put snacco as one of my runners up and I waited to talk about it because I knew that

1426
01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it probably was going to come up. The only reason, the only reason I have it as a runner up,

1427
01:48:52.199 --> 01:48:57.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I want to say like Al, I have been waiting for this game for a very, very long time.

1428
01:48:57.479 --> 01:49:04.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I played the alpha, I played the beta, I am mutuals with the developers, they're great people,

1429
01:49:04.359 --> 01:49:06.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I love them, they're very funny, they're very...

1430
01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: enjoyable people. Um, I

1431
01:49:11.479 --> 01:49:17.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: somehow, after backing it on Kickstarter and playing it, all the, like, pre-releases for it and

1432
01:49:17.079 --> 01:49:24.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: stuff, missed that it fully released, that the 1.0 released. And that is the only reason that I don't

1433
01:49:24.039 --> 01:49:30.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: have it as much, because I did not get a chance to play like the 1.0 yet. Now that I know it's, it's out,

1434
01:49:30.359 --> 01:49:36.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I, I'm very excited to, uh, sink a lot of time into it. Um, I think just...

1435
01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.640
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: the madness of Pokemon release and everything else that's been going on is just

1436
01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:51.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: trip me up and in, in, it's, uh, in the news of its 1.0 release, but, you know, yeah,

1437
01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Micah, Micah, the 1.0 came out in me.

1438
01:49:53.239 --> 01:49:56.680
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: uh, you know, there was a lot going on in May for me. Okay.

1439
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1440
01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.100
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, but you can't use Pokemon as an English kiss.

1441
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, I can't use, uh, Legend Zier as an excuse.

1442
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:14.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Uh, but yeah, I, I couldn't justifiably put it as like my game of the year just because I haven't

1443
01:50:14.439 --> 01:50:21.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: played the 1.0 yet. So, um, but what I have played of it, I agree with everything that's been said,

1444
01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:29.180
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay. So. All right. So onto my final one because YouTube both picked ones that I've

1445
01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [Laughter]

1446
01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:38.659
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: already picked, but my final nomination is Story of Seasons grand bizarre. I look, it wouldn't

1447
01:50:38.659 --> 01:50:41.979
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: be the first time that a story of seasons game has won if it were to win, to Raymon one

1448
01:50:41.979 --> 01:50:47.460
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: in 2019. A lot of the more recent story of seasons have felt.

1449
01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:58.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Black Luster, is that fair to say, Micah? But this one, but this one, look, I mean, it's,

1450
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:58.520
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I mean, I think they just felt like faithful remakes.

1451
01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think where this felt like much more innovative remake.

1452
01:50:58.819 --> 01:51:06.180
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: yes, but yeah, not even just, just if he makes it, but like pioneers of all of town.

1453
01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:15.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It was fine. It was fine. What is this? I love this game so much. It is one of my, one of

1454
01:51:06.439 --> 01:51:10.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, yeah, it definitely was just fine.

1455
01:51:15.779 --> 01:51:20.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: favorite. I hate to say the term start.

1456
01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:47.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But it's one of my favorite like fully rounded farming games where you are like life simulating rather than anything else like you are a person and you are inheriting this farm and it's in this village and your aim is to build up this farm and to find someone to marry and to progress this town and build it up and blah blah blah.

1457
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1458
01:51:49.500 --> 01:52:00.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The story the overall story. So I would say that I think Stardew still definitely wins in terms of like individual characters stories. I think I don't think anything will ever surpass that.

1459
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:12.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Maybe we'll see but it is incredible. But I think the overall story for the game as a whole, I think this is my favorite of any of the farming games.

1460
01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:19.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like the building up of the bizarre and like it's such a silly story. I don't want to talk too much about it because.

1461
01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:37.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Like there's a silliness to it while also being a seriousness to it that I think is a really nice balance of things and I was really not excited about the idea of the bizarre because I was like I don't like the idea of having to wait a week to sell stuff but they did it so well.

1462
01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:47.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It feels so balanced. I feel like I get to focus through the week on doing what I want to do and then sell on sell on Saturday.

1463
01:52:48.500 --> 01:53:00.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: To think about the money very much because that's when you're buying your seeds as well. Right. You've got one day to focus on the money and then you go the other days to focus on the farming and the villagers and all of these other things.

1464
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:12.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think it's a really nice balance of things. I think it's the best story of seasons game, which is saying something because tree of tones was great. I love tree of tones but I think this I think this tree of tones I think has better characters.

1465
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.279
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Hmm. That's interesting. Uh, it's good to take into consideration since, you know,

1466
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: What?

1467
01:53:22.279 --> 01:53:29.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I also have it on my list. And we also recorded an episode about it. Uh, it is a second on my

1468
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Mmm.

1469
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:35.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: list. Or if season's grand bazaar, uh, for a lot of the same reasons that you said, it feels so

1470
01:53:35.479 --> 01:53:43.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: polished. It feels well rounded and like, uh, expanding on the experience of just being a farming

1471
01:53:43.479 --> 01:53:44.920
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: games so much more.

1472
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:51.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But the gameplay loop is comfortable and doesn't feel incredibly intrusive.

1473
01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:55.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of things.

1474
01:53:55.239 --> 01:54:07.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Once I really get the cycle going and it just feels more polished.

1475
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh and and it has jumping

1476
01:54:07.039 --> 01:54:08.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It does have jumping.

1477
01:54:08.039 --> 01:54:14.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Not only does it have jumping, it has jumping barrels and it has gliding, so there's

1478
01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:18.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The gliding is so good. The only complaint I have is the invisible walls that you have

1479
01:54:15.279 --> 01:54:17.279
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: facets to the jumping.

1480
01:54:18.119 --> 01:54:23.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't like the invisible walls especially in the mountains, but other than that jumping is great

1481
01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:21.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I agree.

1482
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.859
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: The gliding is great. The barrels are great. It's I love jumping in games. Sue me

1483
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1484
01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.380
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1485
01:54:29.859 --> 01:54:34.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: see. I think trio of towns was the first. I think trio of towns were the first. I think

1486
01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:35.060
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: That might be the biggest takeaway this year.

1487
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:40.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: of towns was the first farming game I played that had jumping and I just jumped everywhere.

1488
01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:46.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Every farming game should have jumping now. Please jump in your game. Please and thank you.

1489
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:51.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I mean, I thought I figured this was going to happen, I'm not opposed to it.

1490
01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It sounds great.

1491
01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:56.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I've only heard great things about it, so that's my little spiel on it.

1492
01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:02.020
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: All right, who has how many do each of you have left because I have none left

1493
01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:02.180
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it's I got one.

1494
01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:08.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, well Micah you go for yours first then and then easily and you can do your others your other one

1495
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: My game of the year number one nomination is fantasy life I

1496
01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:21.699
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I was worried this was gonna happen because I've not played the game and I really wish because I realized in the last section

1497
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.560
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Ahhhhhh

1498
01:55:21.699 --> 01:55:27.739
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Where we're talking about what game we most wish we should have played. I didn't actually say mine and I was trying to say life. I

1499
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:36.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I, I saw that in the doc, uh, when I opened it before recording and I thought to myself,

1500
01:55:28.939 --> 01:55:30.939
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Really wish I'd played it

1501
01:55:36.479 --> 01:55:46.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, no, it pretty much, it's such a good game.

1502
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1503
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:40.220
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Was that the moment you realized that wasn't gonna win when

1504
01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:45.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. It's it's my

1505
01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:51.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: biggest it's my biggest failure this year. I think I've heard so much good about it and it just I just I just

1506
01:55:51.899 --> 01:55:56.779
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I just didn't and I can't give you a reason why I just didn't

1507
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:54.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Yeah.

1508
01:55:56.739 --> 01:55:59.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Too many games, too many games, Elle.

1509
01:56:01.239 --> 01:56:04.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I was a very, very big fan of the original fantasy life.

1510
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I am a very big fan of a lot of the things

1511
01:56:08.439 --> 01:56:13.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that level five does leaning into generative AI

1512
01:56:15.319 --> 01:56:16.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and not included.

1513
01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:22.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And it seems like they have dialed that back since I just,

1514
01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:23.920
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I was so excited.

1515
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.760
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: for this game to come out because of what I liked about the original fantasy life and it just didn't

1516
01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:39.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: like exceed the expectation. It just absolutely blew it away. There's so much to do in this game.

1517
01:56:39.199 --> 01:56:46.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: There's three different maps. There's, you know, animal crossing style like island,

1518
01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:55.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: not really an island, but like your village that you build up you can rescue.

1519
01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:02.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: New characters that become villagers and they give, they can come along with you on your adventures.

1520
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:09.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: They, there's, each class has really, really straightforward and easy to follow tasks in order to,

1521
01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:17.279
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: to upgrade those classes. They've just like, not just like streamlined it, but just made it a better

1522
01:57:17.279 --> 01:57:26.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: experience overall. The story is fun and interesting. It's

1523
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:31.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it's a very, it's just a very addictive game and it's a really enjoyable game. I'm very happy

1524
01:57:31.039 --> 01:57:39.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: with how it turned out. I was very nervous about it. And I was blown away. I highly, highly recommend it.

1525
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:45.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'll add on that if I had to pick between fantasy life and story of seasons it

1526
01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:51.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Like looking through both of those because I was like, oh if I wanted to play I actually had this thought of like if I wanted to pick between the two

1527
01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: What would I pick and it feels like I would pick?

1528
01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.680
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: fantasy life as well

1529
01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We're going to do all that discussion in a minute.

1530
01:57:57.500 --> 01:58:06.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it's so good. But neither of you have played it. So I, I'm, it's already doing it, but that's

1531
01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Let's, we're doing the nominations just now.

1532
01:57:59.039 --> 01:58:01.039
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay

1533
01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Get Aislin, Aislin.

1534
01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:09.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Let's, Micah, let's get, we'll get to that in a minute because there's more to come.

1535
01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:10.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: okay. Go right ahead.

1536
01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.800
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I

1537
01:58:09.399 --> 01:58:11.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Aislin, your final nomination, please.

1538
01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:16.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Final nomination should not come as a surprise, but it's won or stop

1539
01:58:18.399 --> 01:58:20.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: um, I

1540
01:58:20.239 --> 01:58:25.279
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Really really really enjoyed that game. That's this this this game is probably like

1541
01:58:26.159 --> 01:58:29.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I would say top like out of all the games that I played this year

1542
01:58:29.439 --> 01:58:32.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I would say it's like top. I don't know where it would fall but top five

1543
01:58:33.199 --> 01:58:34.319
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: in

1544
01:58:34.319 --> 01:58:36.800
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Game of the year for me like overall

1545
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:45.039
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It left a very good and big impact on me in the sense of just the theme of just learning

1546
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: patience and

1547
01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:54.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Taking my time as someone that struggles sometimes with that and just like taking a step back and like just

1548
01:58:55.359 --> 01:58:56.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: slowing down

1549
01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.840
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: so

1550
01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:04.359
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: While that theme is not a very uncommon theme in regards to storytelling the way that this game told that story

1551
01:59:04.359 --> 01:59:07.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think was very touching to me, and I really enjoyed the game.

1552
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:14.399
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I played a lot. The music was fun, the characters were silly. I personally love the characters,

1553
01:59:14.399 --> 01:59:19.119
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I know sometimes those type of characters in this game, I feel like can be all putting for some people,

1554
01:59:19.119 --> 01:59:29.199
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: and some people may not particularly care, but I personally found a lot of the characters to be quite

1555
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:25.100
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: - Yes, some people, yes.

1556
01:59:29.199 --> 01:59:37.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: charming, and just I felt initially it took a little bit of work to get into, but once I got

1557
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:44.560
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: into it, I really enjoyed it, but I think the reason it took a little bit of work to kind of get into

1558
01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:51.920
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: the game and figure out if I liked it or not was because of just going in with the mindset of not

1559
01:59:51.920 --> 02:00:00.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: having patience, and I felt like I, as the story progressed, I kind of slowed down with the main

1560
02:00:00.239 --> 02:00:07.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: character, and really while the main character and I are very different personality-wise, I felt like

1561
02:00:08.239 --> 02:00:14.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I found ways to relate to her, and found that to be very special as she is, again, someone very

1562
02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:19.439
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: different from how I am, so the fact that I could relate to someone that was very different,

1563
02:00:19.439 --> 02:00:22.720
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I found to be very special too, so I really liked it.

1564
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:29.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I find that I find that really funny because, um, I, I, I understand why people like this game,

1565
02:00:29.079 --> 02:00:36.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I, not a fan at all. Um, and I find it funny that you're like, you're saying that you're

1566
02:00:36.479 --> 02:00:42.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: not like the main character, but you find ways to, um, understand her. And I'm like,

1567
02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I am that character that is me. And that's why I couldn't play the game. Like, I, I just,

1568
02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I, I know what it's trying to do. I get what it's going with story. I see what it's

1569
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:59.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: her. Um, and it wants me to go along the journey, but I just, I hate the characters so

1570
02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:06.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: much that I cannot deal with them. I cannot keep playing the game because the characters are just

1571
02:01:06.199 --> 02:01:14.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: actively annoying me. Um, that's, and that's, and that's the thing I know. I know what it's trying

1572
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:12.180
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I don't know, it sounds like you gotta slow down, I don't know.

1573
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughs]

1574
02:01:14.119 --> 02:01:22.279
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: to do. I know that it's trying to tell me that, but I, I just can't do it. And I actively didn't

1575
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:30.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: making, which is like the core aspect of the game. It's too complicated, it's too long-winded,

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:27.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh, I love that it was great!

1577
02:01:30.439 --> 02:01:41.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: it's too, dare I say slow. I just, I get why people like it, but I can't, I just can't.

1578
02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:36.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

1579
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Hey, that's fair. That's totally fair. I'm not going to argue against it. I'm not going to argue against that. I understand.

1580
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I didn't play this game. I don't really know what it is, but this conversation has

1581
02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Immediately made me want to play it

1582
02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:01.899
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: have fascinated that you've not even heard of it. So it's the it's the newest game from the

1583
02:02:01.899 --> 02:02:11.659
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: developer of the Stanley Parable. We've probably talked, we probably talked about it on a previous

1584
02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:06.300
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, you know what? It it's in my wish like

1585
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laugh]

1586
02:02:08.699 --> 02:02:10.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Let's you know

1587
02:02:11.659 --> 02:02:19.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: episode and you've been like oh it sounds good. It's a gorgeous, it's a gorgeous looking game and

1588
02:02:14.819 --> 02:02:17.020
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That's usually how things wind up on my

1589
02:02:19.579 --> 02:02:26.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I love what it's trying to do, I just can't.

1590
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.520
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Oh, it's Annapurna.

1591
02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Huh.

1592
02:02:26.359 --> 02:02:27.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It looks beautiful.

1593
02:02:27.359 --> 02:02:31.720
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And it is when you're storied, really sold me on it.

1594
02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:29.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah.

1595
02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:33.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Heck yeah, let's go!

1596
02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:36.720
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So, I mean, I also have a pretty hard time

1597
02:02:37.239 --> 02:02:39.359
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: like slowing down on things.

1598
02:02:39.359 --> 02:02:42.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I've noticed more and more as time has gone on

1599
02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:45.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that then as we've been like,

1600
02:02:45.439 --> 02:02:48.159
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to do social commentary,

1601
02:02:48.159 --> 02:02:52.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: but you know, like as we've been trained to accept.

1602
02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:52.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Oh yeah, 'cause we never do social commentary on this podcast.

1603
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.239
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1604
02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.520
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: as we've been trained to, you know, be more interested

1605
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.520
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: and excited about quick, you know, immediate satisfaction.

1606
02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:06.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I've found myself struggling with that.

1607
02:03:06.199 --> 02:03:09.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And the internal struggle of wanting to slow down,

1608
02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.479
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: but not feeling like I'm able to.

1609
02:03:11.479 --> 02:03:15.560
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So, I'm very interested in this based on your experience

1610
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: with it.

1611
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:23.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I think from that perspective you would like the game.

1612
02:03:19.359 --> 02:03:20.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Cool.

1613
02:03:20.199 --> 02:03:22.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm also interested in it because I'll seem to hate it so much.

1614
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [Laughter]

1615
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:28.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I mean clearly we have some differing opinions about Tamagotchi Plaza, so...

1616
02:03:23.439 --> 02:03:25.600
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1617
02:03:25.439 --> 02:03:32.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Look, look, look, it is not, it is no Tamagotchi Plaza, it is no Sugar Jew Island, I understand

1618
02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: why people like this game, it is not actively a bad game, it's just not for me, the other

1619
02:03:37.359 --> 02:03:41.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: two are bad games.

1620
02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And that's totally fair.

1621
02:03:39.039 --> 02:03:39.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah.

1622
02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:40.880
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh, wow, okay.

1623
02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:42.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1624
02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:45.800
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So when are we going to go through, let's go quickly through the opinions from the poll.

1625
02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:52.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So first up, we had a entry entrance on the poll and we had an exact eight...

1626
02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:59.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: way Thai for a game of the year on the poll, eight people voted for different games.

1627
02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:56.739
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1628
02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:02.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Okay.

1629
02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:01.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So we're going to go through them.

1630
02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:09.199
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: First we have three silly answers, Cody voted soaksong, which is not a Cogico game.

1631
02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:10.619
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, that's that's valid though, so we should consider it

1632
02:04:09.199 --> 02:04:17.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Stuart voted for Legends ZA, which all I'm going to say, Stuart is obviously that's

1633
02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:21.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: not going to win the game of the year on this episode, but like maybe listen to the greenhouse

1634
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: episode coming out soon.

1635
02:04:24.079 --> 02:04:34.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And we do argue about it a lot.

1636
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:27.220
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Just gonna be argue about it the whole time.

1637
02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:29.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: we all have differing opinions

1638
02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:30.300
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Yeah.

1639
02:04:34.479 --> 02:04:38.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Come back to this after you've listened, you might find it funny.

1640
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1641
02:04:38.239 --> 02:04:46.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And Vincent voted for Expedition 33, which was the full name for that, I can't remember.

1642
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Ooooh.

1643
02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:47.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Player obscure.

1644
02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:47.199
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Clear Obscura.

1645
02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There we go, there we go, obviously also not a Cogico game.

1646
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:51.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: where we're moving on.

1647
02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:10.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There we go.

1648
02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:09.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughter]

1649
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1650
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:19.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Nami has said, "I haven't actually played hairdling, but it's been on my wishlist forever and I've seen gameplay of it, and I know people that have beaten it. I cannot wait to play it."

1651
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: fantasy life I use a strong contender as well so now me actually voted

1652
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:21.840
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh.

1653
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:30.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: for hardling. Next we have Kevin who says quite a long paragraph, he's done a

1654
02:05:30.119 --> 02:05:35.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: journey because Johnny did this really long paragraph last year for what was it, Rusty's

1655
02:05:35.359 --> 02:05:40.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: retirement. Here is Kevin's long paragraph. In a space where cozy has been underused

1656
02:05:40.239 --> 02:05:44.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: to the point of almost holding no weight, one to stop does in fact manage to capture

1657
02:05:44.399 --> 02:05:50.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: the essence of cozy through its gameplay and setting. While still aggressively confronting

1658
02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:47.060
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Oh. No way.

1659
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yes! Yes! Sorry.

1660
02:05:50.439 --> 02:05:52.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: us with the existential horrors.

1661
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: of anxiety burnout and search for purpose so many people in this day and age can relate to.

1662
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:02.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It manages to blend the whimsy and almost absurdity of changing the color of birds and

1663
02:06:02.439 --> 02:06:08.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: brewing tea in a multi-story contraption, which with the grim images of injured warriors and

1664
02:06:08.039 --> 02:06:10.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: inner parts of ourselves we fear.

1665
02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:15.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Wonderstop is a story for the times and for the ages, cottagecore games these days often travel

1666
02:06:15.399 --> 02:06:20.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: the well-traded ground of seeking escape from a carpet, capitalistic world of overworking

1667
02:06:20.399 --> 02:06:21.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: and overachieving.

1668
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: games have managed to follow through with that to the degree Wonderstop has. Clearly I'm biased

1669
02:06:26.399 --> 02:06:30.479
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: because it's playing off personal issues I know all too well, but at the same time it's hard to

1670
02:06:30.479 --> 02:06:36.640
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: say that any game we have ever covered has ever managed to speak directly to me like this. And

1671
02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:43.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: also yes, the fastest bullet alive, the second Dirk Warhard novel we get to read from, is deserving

1672
02:06:43.039 --> 02:06:48.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: of a Pulitzer all in its own. Kevin, I think a Pulitzer is a journalism reward, isn't it? It's not a

1673
02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:46.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah.

1674
02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:51.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: novel the word. I know that's not

1675
02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:56.680
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I love that that's what you pulled out of the head.

1676
02:06:52.000 --> 02:07:02.279
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: a word. I don't. Okay, so that's a vote for one to stop.

1677
02:06:56.680 --> 02:07:03.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So funny.

1678
02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Of...

1679
02:07:03.039 --> 02:07:13.819
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It is an award in journalism arts and letters so you know, not just journalism but...

1680
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:14.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, so it's not just journalism fair enough. My bad. My bad. So that's Kevin's vote for one to stop

1681
02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: next we have cat

1682
02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:18.060
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I second everything he said, just just as a heads up.

1683
02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:22.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: That's fine next we have cat who said research story and rune factory were also great

1684
02:07:22.319 --> 02:07:25.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But story of seasons grand bazaar was just so incredible

1685
02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:29.359
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Absolutely the best game in the series including harvest moon honestly

1686
02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:30.340
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Oh.

1687
02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:32.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I feel like I am the only person who really disliked

1688
02:07:32.479 --> 02:07:37.680
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Hello kitty island adventure even though I like Sanrio characters and obviously I like this style of game

1689
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:41.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh. Oh.

1690
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It was just so boring and flat

1691
02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:45.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So that's a positive vote for story seasons grand bazaar and a negative vote

1692
02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:48.880
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Kitty island adventure. I don't know. Do we do negative votes?

1693
02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:51.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And then Spencer has just said hello kitty

1694
02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:53.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: so

1695
02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There we go

1696
02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:00.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: And Chris and Chris has voted for fantasy life. I the girl who steals time

1697
02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:03.520
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: uh-oh the cancel each other out huge

1698
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So we are in a bit of a pickle

1699
02:08:05.119 --> 02:08:07.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I feel like this is this is the

1700
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: narrowed it down to five games for the

1701
02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:20.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We have a snackle who has two point five votes. I feel like you're you kind of gave it half of all in your

1702
02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:22.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: runner-ups

1703
02:08:22.319 --> 02:08:24.319
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Micah

1704
02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:28.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah. Yeah. I was very ready if you recall in our discussions

1705
02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:26.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Hello

1706
02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:27.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah

1707
02:08:28.239 --> 02:08:30.239
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah

1708
02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:32.819
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: out previously about Snacko. I was very ready for Snacko to be my game of the year.

1709
02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:34.960
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yep

1710
02:08:33.619 --> 02:08:36.819
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I unfortunately just blank. I don't know what happened.

1711
02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.520
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Didn't play it

1712
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughter]

1713
02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:44.640
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We then have Hello kitty which has two votes from us plus one from the polls

1714
02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.640
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So that's three votes for Hello kitty

1715
02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:48.560
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We have story of seasons grand bazaar

1716
02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:52.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Which again has two votes from us and one from the polls so three in total

1717
02:08:52.239 --> 02:08:53.680
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: We then have fantasy life

1718
02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:57.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I which has one vote from us and one from the polls so two and one to stop

1719
02:08:57.439 --> 02:09:00.079
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Which also has one from us and one from the polls so that's two

1720
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:05.119
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So we have five games that have two two and a half or three

1721
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I will say for what it's worth.

1722
02:09:07.399 --> 02:09:09.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: The ticker has moved.

1723
02:09:09.079 --> 02:09:13.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I have gone from adding wanders up to my wishlist to now.

1724
02:09:13.079 --> 02:09:14.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I doubt just downloaded the demo.

1725
02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So it's, you know, for whatever that's worth.

1726
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:22.779
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'll take these, I'll take these wins, so that's it.

1727
02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:28.939
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm gonna start off by saying I think Snacko should win because it's the only one that

1728
02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:19.800
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I just want to...

1729
02:09:28.939 --> 02:09:34.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: all three of us mentioned even if nobody in the poll voted for it. That's my that's

1730
02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: my opening gambit response.

1731
02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:40.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: That is a very fair and valid opening gambit and

1732
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [laughing]

1733
02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:51.239
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm prepared for fantasy life. I tend to not make it through. I'm very sad that that's the case, but I also

1734
02:09:53.239 --> 02:09:56.979
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Am prepared for that eventuality so

1735
02:09:56.500 --> 02:10:14.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: fantasy life, I is probably going to go the way of Cartel Island, where if one other person had played it, it probably would win, and there's probably going to be an angry person in Slack, who says it should have won, but I think it's hard to justify winning in its current.

1736
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.439
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure, I think so too and that's that's I that's okay with

1737
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.760
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'm gonna say no to Hello Kitty even though I nominated it. I think if we have to strike an extra one off

1738
02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:30.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I think it's gonna be Hello Kitty because it didn't actually come out

1739
02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:39.579
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I think that's fair to I I think most of our game play of it between the the two of us who did play it

1740
02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:33.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Bye! Yeah!

1741
02:10:40.619 --> 02:10:44.699
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Did not take place during this year anyways, so I'm also okay with that

1742
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.520
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not opposed to it.

1743
02:10:46.659 --> 02:10:52.979
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It is a great game though and you should play it and I can't remember who it was that voted against it, but

1744
02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:51.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah, well. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, I think

1745
02:10:51.159 --> 02:10:52.039
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Oh, yeah, 100%.

1746
02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:56.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Don't listen to that

1747
02:10:54.539 --> 02:10:56.539
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It was cat I think yeah, it was cat

1748
02:10:57.720 --> 02:10:59.479
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: No, I'm still, I'm still going to check it out.

1749
02:10:59.479 --> 02:11:01.319
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I am 100% still going to check it out.

1750
02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:10.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Look I I I I suspect cat would just I say it's it's just not for them, right? Like it did I don't think they're saying it's actively bad

1751
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Sure. Yeah, totally.

1752
02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:18.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: They do explicitly say I feel like I'm the only person who disliked it. So you know that that's

1753
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1754
02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:21.979
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Sometimes we are sometimes games. Just don't grab us and that's

1755
02:11:22.279 --> 02:11:24.039
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: - Well Kat, if it makes you feel any better,

1756
02:11:24.039 --> 02:11:26.199
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: you are not the first person that I've heard say

1757
02:11:26.199 --> 02:11:27.119
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: that they didn't like it.

1758
02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:31.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: So in that regard also, I will yield.

1759
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.899
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, so we're down to three we've got Snacko, Story of Seasons, Grand Bazaar, and Wonderstop.

1760
02:11:34.899 --> 02:11:41.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I don't want to strike off Story of Seasons, but if I'm choosing between Story of Seasons and Snacko...

1761
02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:48.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I'd probably picking Snacko Story of Seasons have one, one before.

1762
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.560
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm picking Snacko, but again.

1763
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:51.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I...

1764
02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.560
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I don't think that should be a arguing point.

1765
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:58.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Sure, yeah, I'm not saying they shouldn't win, I'm just like, I've just, it's a thing to consider.

1766
02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:53.600
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think it's OK for them to win again.

1767
02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:54.399
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: But I think--

1768
02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:07.859
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: As someone who has story of seasons on their list and did not play Snacko this year in its 1.0 finish state,

1769
02:12:07.859 --> 02:12:15.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: it feels more right to me spiritually maybe to give it to Snacko over story of seasons,

1770
02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:28.460
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: especially because, and again, I don't know that this necessarily needs to be a point of argument, but it is also a remake of an existing game.

1771
02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:40.539
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Which did an incredible job with it, but it is not necessarily completely new in the ways that Snacko is, I guess.

1772
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:45.899
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I understand what you're saying, but also I think that grandpa's art does the things that

1773
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:54.840
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Remakes should do it took a game that people might have missed a game that people didn't really play a game that could use a lot of improvement and

1774
02:12:55.199 --> 02:12:59.699
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It did all of that remakes far too often take here's a really popular game

1775
02:12:59.699 --> 02:13:02.140
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Let's just do it again and this did not do that at all

1776
02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:08.140
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: It took a game that people hadn't really played and gave them an opportunity to play it much better than it had been before

1777
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, that's true.

1778
02:13:09.319 --> 02:13:15.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, I can understand that. I just it just feel I don't know I don't know how else to describe it other than it feels right for

1779
02:13:10.619 --> 02:13:12.619
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I

1780
02:13:15.619 --> 02:13:20.060
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Know that's fair. I'm fine. I'm I'm I'm not fine to strike off

1781
02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:23.659
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: I do think I do think it's my favorite game of the year

1782
02:13:23.899 --> 02:13:27.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Studies seasons grandpa's art. I think personally I prefer it to snackle

1783
02:13:27.739 --> 02:13:29.819
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But I think in terms of our collective one

1784
02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:38.340
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Probably snackle wins over story of seasons grandpa's art, but we still have the wonder stop of all to discuss. I don't want to give it to wonder stop

1785
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: There's a very

1786
02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:44.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Persuasive argument

1787
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.699
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But also I still just don't like the game. Sorry

1788
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:54.640
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I mean, that's fair. That's, I, I understand that you just don't like the game.

1789
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.960
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: just hate bond and whimsy and that's understandable.

1790
02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: [laughter]

1791
02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:06.479
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I, I just, the, the, the problem is I love the game. I love, it's not, it's not necessarily doing

1792
02:14:06.479 --> 02:14:10.960
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: anything revolutionary, but at the same time it's doing something revolutionary during this time.

1793
02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:16.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think this game coming out during this specific period and like snapshot of time,

1794
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:17.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I think it's doing something great.

1795
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:22.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It's very special to me with, again, encouraging.

1796
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:29.439
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: But also what is, what it's, but what it's saying is, hey, capitalism bad by the such an original idea. It's not really, right? Like, I get, I get.

1797
02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:30.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But it's very true, so...

1798
02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.359
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: No, it's not. It's but the thing is I

1799
02:14:31.279 --> 02:14:47.039
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Sure, sure, sure. I get the point and I get Kevin's point about it doing it best, but it's also like not that original. And also it's doing it in our, I don't have a fully formed sentence.

1800
02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:50.159
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1801
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:57.720
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I can't say one way or another because I did not play it and I mostly just learned about it here.

1802
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: So I stopped on a comma.

1803
02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:15.399
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: But, you know, and in that way I have a hard time pushing it through to the game of the year because my compromise is a game that I have played just in its alpha and beta stages.

1804
02:15:15.399 --> 02:15:18.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I am willing to, you know, accept that as.

1805
02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:24.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: It's a game of the year. I just can't do that with Wonderstop personally because I just haven't played it.

1806
02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:38.500
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I think it sounds incredible and I am very excited to play it now based on everything that I've heard, but it's it's it just doesn't make sense for me to to say it's my game of the year if I haven't played it and I just learned about it so.

1807
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:38.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, no, that's, I got it.

1808
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:41.720
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: well yeah and just just a reminder it's not individual games of the years is the

1809
02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:47.600
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: podcasts game of the year so that's fair but yeah I think selfishly I would

1810
02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:51.399
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: say that I think it's hard for us to say that the podcast game of the year is

1811
02:15:51.399 --> 02:15:55.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: a game that one of the three of

1812
02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.479
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, no, I mean, I mean, I'm not, I, I, yeah, no, I, I can agree, I can agree with that.

1813
02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:56.420
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: Yeah, I agree.

1814
02:15:58.479 --> 02:16:04.340
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I mean, we all kind of collectively like snacko and one sense or another in

1815
02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:05.880
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: regardless of the stage that it was in.

1816
02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:16.000
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Yeah well I mean I get the reasons why you like it I just yeah I think it's hard

1817
02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:10.479
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: So I know going for Wanderstop is like a selfish pick.

1818
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.920
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: to justify it as being the podcast game of the year and Kevin's going to kill me.

1819
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.079
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: [laughing]

1820
02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:26.500
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, probably. Probably. Kevin might also kill me for not pushing for it harder.

1821
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:32.700
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: yet, oh yeah, absolutely. So, Snacko is the harvest season's game of the year,

1822
02:16:33.659 --> 02:16:39.100
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: 2025. Congratulations to Snacko. I can't believe we got there, especially considering

1823
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah. Hey.

1824
02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:42.540
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Michael was saying it's not going to win right at the beginning.

1825
02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.819
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: [laughing]

1826
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, wait, when did I say that?

1827
02:16:45.819 --> 02:16:49.579
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: During the update, you said you wanted to give it update because you knew it wouldn't get

1828
02:16:49.579 --> 02:16:56.540
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: game of the year.

1829
02:16:50.079 --> 02:16:56.540
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: No, no, no, no, what I said was I wanted to give it update because I didn't nominate it as one of my options for game of the year and

1830
02:16:55.500 --> 02:17:05.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1831
02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.379
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: - Okay, yeah, that's fair.

1832
02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:04.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: And I said it I would wait because I figured it was going to get nominated and that would be a

1833
02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:07.260
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: deeper discussion from that point

1834
02:17:07.979 --> 02:17:11.180
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: All right. Okay, uh, I think

1835
02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.920
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: I'm very happy with that though. I'm very happy with that as well.

1836
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.399
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: I'm happy with the two.

1837
02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:17.420
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: good. We're all happy with the winner. It might not be anybody's

1838
02:17:18.059 --> 02:17:25.500
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: top game, but collectively it is our average to best game. It is a great game. And also,

1839
02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:30.059
<v A00F4600-32A4-449B-971D-ED74D86DA78B>Al: it's how this is not the reason for doing it.

1840
02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:38.579
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Yeah, I think too, it also encapsulates the theme of the podcast well.

1841
02:17:38.579 --> 02:17:44.100
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: It meshes well with this podcast, awesome that it's indie.

1842
02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:55.780
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: And even though we live in a society, we're farming games, our over-saturated,

1843
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
<v 43BC2581-6828-4605-9AE9-73AAF10FB3F9>Micah: We do.

1844
02:17:55.780 --> 02:18:00.379
<v FCC943CF-9507-40BB-81C7-471F02A842B8>Aislinn: Snacko feels like a farming game that stands out amongst the rest of them.

1845
