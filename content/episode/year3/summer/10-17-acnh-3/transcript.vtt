12
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.340
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: because it's really just news, but one news that demands our attention.

13
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's news there's not there's so much news

<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But we're gonna talk about that specifically

15
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Before that we have I know what you released last month

<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, I have been up to, well, I mean, spoil alert for the new section.

<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Let's build a zoom. We're like, let's wear a hat.

<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: We'll get to that.

27
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I've been playing Digimon.

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, at least.

29
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:22.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm just grinding filling out the decks and doing stuff, I'm enjoying it, but it is a grind fest, it's an enjoyable grind fest.

30
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But yeah, this is Digimon.

31
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:38.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, and mostly just screaming about Kirby air writers, not game wise, I'm not playing it, but I'm just screaming about it, because that direct came out and I'm happy.

32
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Wait, is that already? I thought it was still on, no, yeah.

33
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, it's not out, I'm just saying the direct, the second direct for Kirby air writers.

34
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, did she say, "You're not playing it?" And I'm like, "Well, yeah, obviously, it's not, yeah."

35
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I'm not playing exactly, but it's close, it's so close, I'm scared, we're going to be in a post Kirby air writers world.

36
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, what about you? What's going on speaking of things

37
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Pokemon! I have been playing the Pokemon I'm continuing I'm not like

38
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm not playing?

39
00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:10.099
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: playing it super fast because you know life. Life gets in the way but I have

40
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: been playing I'm progressing through the story I'm continuing to do my

41
00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.939
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: side quest and catch all the Pokemon as I go.

42
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.219
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah. How far are you?

43
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's hard to know because I've not really looked at the, so I think I'm on main quest 20, but I don't know how many main quests there are.

44
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, okay, I don't know that either.

45
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:45.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So I'm not, yeah, I'm trying not to like, super spoil myself. I have spoiled myself on the mega that we'd most interest me.

46
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.939
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

47
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, I want to know what that is

48
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, I mean, I think you know what it would be.

49
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.979
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, wait. Oh, yeah, of course. I know what it is. Oh, yes. I do know well, okay

50
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I've been trying not to have the mega spoiled for me, but that one seems to be just everywhere.

51
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.860
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

52
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, well, I mean it okay. Just is it thumbs up or thumbs down? Let's just say that what is it for you?

53
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: from what I've seen thumbs up but obviously I've not seen, I've not actually used it,

54
00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.379
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay

55
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.060
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I've not like seen it in my actual game, I've not like seen how it's introduced to you and

56
00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

57
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.779
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

58
00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.939
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: like I'm seeing the lead up to it but I've not actually experienced it myself yet.

59
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.899
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

60
00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.259
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, I think it looks cool. It's thumbs up. I mean, I still like the I

61
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.100
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Like the other parts too, but that's all right. There's another part. I like more you know what I mean

62
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.720
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: This conversation is so vague as to be pointless now.

63
00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:42.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, but you know what I'm talking about though, probably

64
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.759
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't think I do.

65
00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:52.720
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, fair enough.

66
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.220
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I like that Pokemon a lot too

67
00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:52.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'll say that okay, that's what I mean, okay, yes

68
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.600
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I know what you mean, I know what you mean.

69
00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.819
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes, yeah

70
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.060
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay

71
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.040
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So yeah, I am enjoying the game.

72
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.720
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The good good for you. I haven't played it yet. I want to it looks good

73
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.180
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There's come I already have complaints going in, but I like it nonetheless. It looks fun

74
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.360
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I totally understand people's complaints about the game. I don't think it feels

75
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.879
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: kind of incomplete myself. I feel like it's kind of giving me a complete enough story that I feel

76
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.639
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: you know, whatever. I don't particularly care about the lack of 3D balconies, right? Like it's

77
00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.399
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: just not something I care about. I understand why some people do. But I mean, realistically, you

78
00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:38.839
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: have to be an um.

79
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:52.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: you know, very specific angle to actually even notice that I'm not really looking up at the buildings at that sort of angle. So I don't really care. Again, I'm not saying that anyone that cares is wrong. I just personally don't care.

80
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:57.860
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, I mean, it's it yeah, like, I mean, that's such a smallish complaint. It's it's really a symptom of the bigger problem of

81
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:07.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: the cheap feel of a lot of it. And I think that's that's the underlying issue, which I think is very valid

82
00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.540
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But I see that haven't played it, but at the same time

83
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Sure.

84
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:21.720
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm like you know Pokemon fans they were plenty cheap or economical before but that was on you know GBA and DS so didn't you didn't feel it as much

85
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.220
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But you know it's the good parts are still good. What can I say, right?

86
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.939
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Let's put it this way. I said this in the last episode, but I'm not sure if you've heard it or not,

87
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.740
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: but I am just, I'm glad that we are back to the conversations of the graphics are bad,

88
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.540
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: rather than the performance is bad. It's, it's much better situation to be in, because like with the,

89
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, oh, for sure.

90
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.459
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: with the graphics, I'm just like, eh, I don't really care, right? Like, I, I, I, I'm just to point this

91
00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:57.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: out. I know that if we got a better looking game, I would probably enjoy the

92
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.459
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: more. I'm not saying I wouldn't, but it's not the same as the graphics ruin the game for me,

93
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.540
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, you're. Yeah, you're right.

94
00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:09.660
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: they definitely do not. However, bad performance ruins the game for everyone, right? Like,

95
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.139
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: there's very few people who can be like watching the jittery nonsense and all that

96
00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:21.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: horrificness of the, of scarlet and violet and, and not have it ruin some of the experience for them.

97
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

98
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:28.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You're yeah, you're super right at least the baseline of the game works has been met that is appreciated

99
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.300
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, absolutely.

100
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Even on even on switch one, I'm not really hearing anybody complain about it.

101
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.279
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, I heard it's bad. I don't know, but I've heard it's bad on switch one, but

102
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay.

103
00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:41.899
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The hearsay complete hearsay

104
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:49.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I have heard from people actually playing on it that I know you're like in, you know, in chats that we're in who have said that it's perfectly fine on switch.

105
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't know because I'm not playing on switch, but I'm playing on switch too. So there we are.

106
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, there you go. Pokemon. It's good again mostly

107
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Depends that you ask.

108
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But at least we're in that situation where it depends that you ask rather than it just being universally terrible to run.

109
00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:06.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

110
00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:08.699

112
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.500

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:27.340
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Uh, I like said rocket lab probably. Eli, uh, I don't know how to see because

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.299
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: like as fun as the boom writing is I can that it can only go so far. You know, um,

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:39.059
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: like I got a good bit of mika. Can I do another round of that? Uh, maybe it depends if it interests me. Um,

127
00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:49.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: yeah, that is just broom platform. I'm looking at it now. Um, yeah. Be good. Yeah. Yeah.

<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yes, it looks much more platformy than Mika did, so yeah, interesting.

129
00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:56.419
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So I don't know, but, uh, at least, uh, I can say a little rocket lab does my attention.

130
00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:57.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So, make it better.

131
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So, point.

132
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500

133
00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:08.039
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And I'm pretty sure I have Eila because I kickstarted it.

134
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:13.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So I'll probably play it at some point but

135
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.039
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Little Rocket Lab, yeah, I'm intrigued by but I don't know if I will

136
00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:20.639
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Actually end up playing it

137
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But it intrigues me and obviously I'm not gonna buy harvism in home sweet home again. No. Thank you

138
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:34.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But the content...

139
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:34.720
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I got my fail. I got my fail and I enjoyed it, but we're done. We're done. They're content

140
00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:41.379
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No, it's not $40 worth of content

141
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, good times.

143
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Ooh, really, huh?

144
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, let's talk about the news first up as a

145
00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:57.559
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: alluded to in an earlier section of this podcast.

146
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:06.340
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Let's build a zoo have released their hats update it is out now and I think it's safe to say that it's kind of obvious what's in this update.

147
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.440
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, so first off, they announced this update like over a year ago, I believe there's 2024. Yeah.

148
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, did it.

<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But for hats, you know, I would expect it a little sooner, you know, that's just it. But, but it's, it's fine.

151
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I think it's really just that.

152
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There's a few other things, but you can put how there's a hat factory.

153
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You can make hats to sell or put them on your animals.

157
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:01.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Or your llama has antlers.

158
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Your bear can have a graduation cap.

159
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000

160
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Hepo with a tall top hat.

161
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.440
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's a very tall top hat.

162
00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:18.120
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Halo, Halo before the people think they're dead before they actually are dead.

163
00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:28.600
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Um, yeah, it's all cosmetic and it's like, yeah.

164
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:32.820
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Well, they've also added the screenshot tool that allows you to screenshot your entire zoo at once, which is a nice feature

165
00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:34.919
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: which it, it is cool. It's a little

166
00:12:35.000 --> 00:13:04.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: hard to see, like, you know, just the screen shot. Like, there's a lot of detail in there, right? You have to really zoom into, to get the full view of the zoo. But man, that's such a nice zoo that uses an example. Why can't my zoo would be able to be that good? I still have to figure out to make it look nice, but yeah, screenshot the whole zoo. That is cool. And yeah, and then a few other decor for in honor of the new game. Let's build the dungeon.

167
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:20.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: which is just, again, all day course stuff. So nothing really new mechanically. All, all cosmetic stuff. Some fixes, etc, etc. And hey, let's build the dungeon. They're working on that. I'm looking forward to that. I enjoy this game.

168
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:29.700
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Next, we have Chronomon, which is a monster-catching farming game.

169
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They have announced that their 1.0 is coming soon.

171
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:48.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No. This is a different one. Presumably, time-based, because chrono, one.

172
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.620
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

173
00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:50.139
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

174
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's gonna be some time mechanics.

175
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:58.379
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, I'm just rewatching the trail because I forgot like I remember the name, but I just don't remember the monsters are helping farm

176
00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:02.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So the the the basic lit missed test has been passed in my opinion

177
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.820
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: - Yeah, what an original idea.

178
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.820
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Look

179
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.899
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Look you think but a lot of people struggle with it for some reason

180
00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:14.299
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Like I'm sorry, but oh

181
00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:22.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm excited the mom. Yeah, it's pixel art. It's some of the monster designs themselves are fun. There's like a little goo guy

182
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I don't know, let's see

183
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:33.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the the graphics feel kind of snaeze like because it doesn't it doesn't look GBA it doesn't look DS

184
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.820
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Kind of

185
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.220
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, no

186
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:39.379
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: it looks almost in between them and it feels kind of snazzy

187
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:46.899
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, like, kind of like, uh, it feels like an earthbound almost with more colors, maybe, something about there.

188
00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:50.100
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: yeah well yeah yeah it's definitely not nazzy it's more more colorful than

189
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:56.399
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Oh, man, there's like skill trees. There's a lot in this.

190
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:04.299
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, I'm excited. I will try this. Obviously, I have a penchant for monster collectors and farming and one where they can help

191
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.200
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: farm. That's, that's all I ask for people. Do we give a date?

192
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.659
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No, they don't have a specific date. It's just coming soon.

193
00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:14.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, that means nothing. Yeah.

194
00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:20.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Very likely this year, and sooner rather than later, whatever that means.

195
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:31.259
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: they say, but we'll see eggs days, they confirmed Xbox is consular first console. They believe

196
00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:36.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: in the trailer, they said they're aiming for like all consoles, but Xbox is first, I guess.

197
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:51.139
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, and then there's stuff they're working on ahead, they want online multiplayer

198
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.820
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: which makes sense if you're using the Microsoft dev tools.

199
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.580
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's very easy to then click the button.

200
00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:53.139
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: co-op, and they said that one is very

201
00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:19.480
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: reasonable for money saying so that sounds very doable relationships we don't we we don't have to that it's really okay it's okay my dude we don't have to that one and then story expansions and map expansions because of course um okay yeah that sounds like a solid plan I'm excited I like

202
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: [laughter]

203
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Next we have cattle country, the family life update is out now, um, marriage and kids has been added.

204
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:43.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: because we're cottage corn and we do that, we gotta always, okay, let's see, I will say it's,

205
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.279
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Gotta gotta have it.

206
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: you'll usually see the marriage and then the kids later, so you know adding one that's nice I guess.

207
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I don't like, okay, so one thing I would say hey, it would be nice if you can do stuff with your spouse last child or whatever, right?

208
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:14.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And you can basically just command them and do, you know, pick crops, collect stuff or, or, or just wander, which is something I guess, but still feels a little weird because you're just commanding them.

209
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It's not exactly how you think.

210
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, I feel like they could probably do it a little bit better, but I do like the idea of

211
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.559
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: your marriage actually meaning something rather than just being, "Oh, this person now lives on

212
00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:35.160
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: your farm rather than on their house." And especially better than the Cordle Island we have.

213
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

214
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.160
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They are now an empty husk of a person.

215
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:44.180
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, do you think you think stardew? Well, we'll get a little better at that

216
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:54.140
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, I mean, I never feel like stardew ruined a person when you married them and I kind of like

217
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, for sure

218
00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:05.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: how they kind of got a little area of your house and your farm. And the water, like they fill

219
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.319
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know what you're right. I forget about that part you expand and then like you get there. They get that little here. You're right

220
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:11.259
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: up the water of your pet, which is nice. I mean, a completely unimportant thing, right? It doesn't

221
00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:09.559
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

222
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

223
00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:15.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: actually change anything and before people get it, you know, obviously you should give

224
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.299
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: water to your pets, I'm talking about in the game, people really get really get

225
00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:24.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: annoyed when I talk about this. But realistically, giving your pet water in the

226
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.660
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: game makes no difference mechanically. So it's a nice little thing that you can

227
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: kind of will world building thing that but not actually affecting the

228
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.299
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: gameplay at all. But yeah, I mean, it would maybe nice if you could give them

229
00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:39.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: something to do like this.

230
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.039
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, but but you I'm okay. Well, I'm going back to cattle country. You're right. It is a step in the right direction at least, right?

231
00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:58.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay. A little something after the marriage in this family. And I, I wonder if you can, like, if you have the child and the spouse, can you ask them both to do something that would be kind of cool actually.

232
00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm guessing.

233
00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:07.680
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's the case. Yeah, you know, and that's that's pretty all right. Actually, at least just mechanically. Um, but, uh, but yeah.

234
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: that um wait that they...

235
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:19.839
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: at a tarot reading what does that how what does that what you know just going down the updates um

236
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:23.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, it might be like a lock based thing, like it's starchy when you can you can increase your

237
00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:25.200
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: pumpkin carving yeah I just getting your fortune read yeah I guess so

238
00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:28.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: lock or decrease your lock depending on something. Alright, next we have Firefly Village,

239
00:19:28.019 --> 00:19:31.700
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the item stacking update. Can you guess what features in this update?

240
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.319
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: hahaha, is it maybe stacking items? Wow!

241
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:41.619
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Correct. This was a thing that annoyed me about this game is the each item in your inventory

242
00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:45.859
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: could be one item, and it was so easy to fill up all of your storage.

243
00:19:46.500 --> 00:20:06.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Imagine that, when they were younger, they played farming games with less quality of

244
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh my gosh.

245
00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:11.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: life improvements. Then we have now. And now that they've played the quality of life improvement,

246
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.059
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: they know that that was a huge quality of life improvement, and maybe there's a reason that

247
00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:16.660
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Every farming game has it now.

248
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [Laughs]

249
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:32.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I get it. I, I totally get it. Like some things I can see why you would argue like this is a feature. It's an important thing that I want to keep blah, blah, blah, but like come on, stack item stacking. Yeah, this was the right. This was the right.

250
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Can you imagine?

251
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:40.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Can you imagine concerned ape, you know, years ago being like, why would you guys want more than two item inventory slots?

252
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [Laughter]

253
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:51.039
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, I absolutely hated playing that harvest min game. I don't know whether I would have hated it if we'd played it at the first time, but like all

254
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:54.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [Laughter]

255
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, well, good that stacking, you know, that's fine.

256
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Even as me, someone who has people have heard on the

257
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: show and may hear again, complains about things changing, and what they once were, you know what's

258
00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:17.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: taken, that's a good one, you can have that. That's okay. Ah, the weird bugs.

259
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:25.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They've also, because we always love a little weird bug fix, fixed an issue where players could sometimes slide unexpectedly during the start of date scenes in the grove.

260
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:31.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's good, that's good, I like that, that's a good one.

261
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Guess they were a bit anxious.

262
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Just eating yourself out of there, nope.

263
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:46.119
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah. So there we go. Another update from Firefly Village. There's quite a few small updates

264
00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:50.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: they've done since they released. So it's interesting. I'm definitely not going to go and

265
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:58.279
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: play the game just for this update because it doesn't add anything if you're 100%.

266
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:05.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Actually, let me transition off. I want to go back to

267
00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:00.839
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But you know, just making the game slightly better.

268
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: California. I skipped over some of those other updates. There's new farm layouts on my game. Did you

269
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.059
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, nice. I missed that.

270
00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:17.200
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: see that? That's good. You can sit on stuff building upgrades. Okay. And I start. Yeah. Kind of

271
00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:16.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, yeah.

272
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:24.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: coming. That's good. Lots of little updates. Yeah.

273
00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:20.660
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I think more, I think more farming games need to do that.

274
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.339
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We, I think I talked about that a while ago.

275
00:22:22.579 --> 00:22:26.539
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: This might be the first time I've seen a game other than Stardew do the different

276
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:38.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Mm. You're right. It is. It does. I agree. Like, mmm.

277
00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:29.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: farm layouts and I don't understand why more haven't done it because that's

278
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: a really good feature of Stardew.

279
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.259
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I love it makes it makes you want to replay it.

280
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Every time I reduce Stardew, I do a different farm layout because

281
00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:43.339
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: not done them all yet and it's interesting.

282
00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:46.339
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It makes a different challenge and more, I like it.

283
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: More games should do that, please.

284
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.319
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, Firefly, you should do that too. Maybe I will play then. Maybe not.

285
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:53.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I would, yeah.

286
00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:56.819
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, if there was something, if something fundamental, I'd cry, because I mean,

287
00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:58.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the game didn't take a humongous amount of time to finish.

288
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, Dokod.

289
00:22:59.859 --> 00:23:01.339
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Next we have Sugar Jew Island.

290
00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:04.180
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: My favorite game ever sarcasm.

291
00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:09.059
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They've released a Halloween costume DLC.

292
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: so you can pay

293
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:18.740
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: one dollar and get Halloween costume it's one costume

294
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, just one.

295
00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:26.599
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Gothic outfit it's I mean it's Wednesday Adams, right? That's the outfit

296
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.079
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay.

297
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.480
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, oh yeah, it is, I just went there, hello.

298
00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:31.259
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So

299
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.119
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There you go, game is saved.

300
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: The game is still bad

301
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: This is bizarre. I don't okay. They yeah, whatever

302
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:48.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Do you want this is a bizarre game. This is a bizarre DLC added to a bizarre game

303
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.680
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, okay, you know you said it, but I'm just I'm just thinking now of Adam's family farming game. That'd be sick

304
00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:03.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I think the best character to play as in that game would be things.

305
00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:57.319
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'd love that that'd be awesome

306
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:11.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, you're super right. Oh, like I default to Uncle Fester, but no, I think is absolutely the one to go. Oh

307
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.799
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But I also think just like thematically, he would make the most sense.

308
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:19.059
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, because he does so much, you're

309
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.680
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Does so much that like, why would, why would any of the others be like, you know,

310
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

311
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:38.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: tilling the land and like, come on, exactly. And, and, and Kevin, it would make it almost impossible.

312
00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:30.259
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, no thing is the one who gets gets stuff done in that family

313
00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:33.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Sorry, Lurch, I'm sure you'd want to, but you're a little...

314
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.539
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: a little sluggish there, buddy. Yes.

315
00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:48.539
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I mean, I don't know how you could conceive of an Adam's family farming

316
00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:52.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: game and try to fit romance. I don't want to think about that, how you'd want.

317
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.839
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You know they would try unless your character was thing.

318
00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:01.339
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Thank you. Yeah. Well, I mean, if they work cowards maybe.

319
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The... the...

<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But yeah, you know, it was all right.

<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We've got the date and time for the wholesome snack

328
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.359
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm sure there will be. Is that a Saturday? It is a Tuesday. Oh, goodness.

329
00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:53.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, no, I'm going to have to do that thing. I did a few years ago where me and Cody watched it

330
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.160
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and recorded an episode straight away and then I edited it through the night and posted it the

331
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:06.779
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Hm, you lunatic first. Oh my gosh, you're gonna do that. You crazy first. Can you at least delay? Okay, you know, no, do what you want. You know, the frantic energy

332
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:07.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: next day. Of course I'm going to do that. No, I'm not delaying the podcast. Are you mad?

333
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:16.200
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But you know what now I take it back the the essays do at 9 a.m. Tomorrow at energy. That's it. That's a good energy to bring I

334
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Like it. I'm down with that

335
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, I did to my list.

336
00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:27.339
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There we go

<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I mean, we have to. It's our... Do we actually have to?

338
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, that's all of the game news.

339
00:26:35.019 --> 00:26:44.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: We're tired of farmers in farming games, so let us replace it with this new game called the farmer

340
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.700
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We also have a new game, which is the farm.

<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: game, which is a terrifying title, in my opinion.

343
00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:52.160
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Programming optimizer drone to automate a farm

344
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and watch it do the work for you.

345
00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Collect resources to unlock better technology

346
00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:59.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and become the world's most efficient farmer in the world.

347
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Improve your problem solving and coding skills

348
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and Kevin!

349
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Did somebody just make a game for me?

350
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:19.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I think they did a holy miracle. I saw the premise. I didn't look at the thing, but all that is just coding. Wow. That's insane. I guess they did.

351
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't know what to say!

352
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:35.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It's not only is it like one of your favorite aspects automating and optimizing the farming, but it's actually your skill set.

353
00:27:36.500 --> 00:28:02.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That is made directly for Al. That's incredible. Oh, man. Okay. It's all grid based and you're like farming everything. I do. This is wild. Oh, yeah. That's good. Yep. That's what I see.

354
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:55.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I am very intrigued by this game and I will definitely need to try it out. It is out now.

355
00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I presume it's $10 based on what I'm seeing.

356
00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:08.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It looks like it... wait, no, no, no, no. I think it did an early access. Yeah, so early access came

357
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:16.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: out in February 2023 and it's 1.0 came out in October, so yeah.

358
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:21.640
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: we missed it. Well there you go. We also know what was released last month. This game

359
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:26.180
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yes, that's a good point. I missed that off the list, isn't it? Yeah, cool.

360
00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:35.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: code code and farm. That's our life. This game. That's fascinating. Are we here?

361
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:39.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: There we go. All right, Kevin. Shall we talk about Animal Crossing, New Horizons,

362
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.859
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Switch to Edition and 3.0 update?

363
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, okay far okay before anything else because you know, we're gonna go over this trailer and go

364
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.799
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Chronologically we're just gonna kind of frame by from talk about it, but if

365
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Maybe not frame by frame, but yeah.

366
00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:56.539
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: what you don't be at yeah, yeah

367
00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:04.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But I like the the the prelude how the last update said that was gonna be the last update

368
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.720
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah. Yeah, they don't mention this at all, right? But like, yeah, the last update, they were like,

369
00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:08.539
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: and

370
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.759
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: this will be the last content update. And then it's now four years later, and they're obviously

371
00:29:15.759 --> 00:29:24.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: having trouble getting the new game done. So no, right. No. Okay. No, no, no. So here's, here's,

372
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So they went that welcome amiibo route good stall for time

373
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:32.240
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: here's my theory. Here's my theory, Kevin. The next game is based on this game. Same engine,

374
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Okay.

375
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.240
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: same graphics. Different sounds.

376
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We'll see if I'm writing.

377
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And they have kept as close as possible to the code when they're building the new game.

378
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So they could just copy and paste these features back into this game.

379
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay

380
00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:47.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Sure, okay, so this is their alpha their beta. Yeah

381
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Give them self. Give them self more time.

382
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: To get the new game out while giving us a bunch of stuff animal crossing wise.

383
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay

384
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, like what Pokemon does but they do it badly

385
00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:02.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But yes, okay, I I get the logic. I buy it. Oh

386
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.039
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We'll see if I'm right or not.

387
00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But that's this is my theory.

388
00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:09.740
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I can see that yeah, okay

389
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, so yeah, they are releasing a switch to edition and 3.0 update.

390
00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:17.799
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Both of which are coming on the 15th of January next year.

391
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:26.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So this does not count as the for the update of the year in our game of the year episode this year.

392
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.759
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [laughs]

393
00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:28.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, but has it locked in for next year?

394
00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:29.440
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Maybe.

395
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.200
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You know, we'll see, we'll see.

396
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: as Kevin said we're gonna go through

397
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the video and just talk about the things as they come up in the video. So I guess it starts

398
00:30:41.519 --> 00:30:50.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: off with the Switch 2 edition. Obviously Kevin presumably you don't care about buying this

399
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: which, sure, that makes sense.

400
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:57.240
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: one. [laughs]

401
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:57.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I will not buy a Switch 2 for Animal Crossing Switch 2 edition.

402
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, I would buy further games, but probably not this.

403
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Although, I don't think they talked about it on the video, or just mention it on the video,

404
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: but $5 for the update.

405
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know what?

406
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Hats off to them for that.

407
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, that's not mentioned in the update, but yeah, it turns out it's $5, which is not bad not bad

408
00:31:13.099 --> 00:31:17.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Not the $30 breath of the wild update.

409
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.559
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: of literally first switch game 30 bucks to play it again.

410
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And on your switch too, uh-huh.

411
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:28.859
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Right so their first thing is enhanced revolution, enhanced resolution from improved graphics

412
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.400
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: which I did they even put in the work for that? Maybe not.

413
00:31:36.059 --> 00:31:38.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, who knows who knows what you know

414
00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:44.740
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I actually I actually think they did this the wrong way right what they did is they show you the switch to footage and then put the switch footage next to it

415
00:31:43.500 --> 00:32:08.859
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

416
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I think they should have done the other way around because I kind of looked at it when oh

417
00:31:48.259 --> 00:31:52.859
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Let's see how this improves because I thought we were looking at the old footage and then it shows them

418
00:31:53.619 --> 00:31:55.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Which footage next time I go oh, no

419
00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:03.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Because it's not like it's looked that looks bad, but like you're still seeing it some individual pixels and I'm like

420
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay, it's gonna look nicer then. No, no, this is the switch to version

421
00:32:10.099 --> 00:32:16.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Because it does look much better next to it and you know, they've zoomed in so you're not really like noticing this if you're doing it

422
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.180
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: This is like the switch

423
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:25.700
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Screen shot is very very like it feels like it's on handheld mode because it's so bad like they try to

424
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:35.220
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks like you're seeing a 3DS to switch upgrade.

425
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:31.660
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: What's the opposite of optimizing me it is worse as possible to show the difference kids

426
00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.140
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It looks so much like a 3DS for

427
00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:44.180
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So I think they stretched it little I think they tried to make it as bad as possible

428
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.299
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I love it. I love it. Yeah, yeah. So not not allowed to say about that. Good. Good high resins and great.

429
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay

430
00:32:50.099 --> 00:32:52.099
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Joy can't do mouse controls.

431
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.259
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, as someone who doesn't have a switch to have you ever use the mouse controls and anything ever

432
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No

433
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, that's that's the answer. It's right

434
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: but but

435
00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:09.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But you know, I'm a handheld controller guy. I am not a sit at a table and play games kind of guy

436
00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:11.119
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

437
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So I'm realistically never gonna

438
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:42.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: use mouse mode this was exactly why I was thinking when I was watching this is I'm not gonna do this right because yeah sure you can do it on your like sofa arm not gonna do that come on it's just annoying I get why they're doing this and I think that for some people it'll be really nice and when they shoot like they show you like you know grabbing a bunch of stuff and moving it all at once with the most mode it looks really nice but one I'm not gonna do that and two I would have to care about decorations to do that

439
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

440
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, there you go. That's exactly that's the the number one number two

441
00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:49.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know, just as a general thing

442
00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:56.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Instead of doing like integrating into the joy chords or whatever. They should have just made and sold the different

443
00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:59.319
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I think I would have preferred that just a separate mouse accessory

444
00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:04.680
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Or you know ideally connect your own mouse, but but I did it

445
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:09.260
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can yeah, you can use a USB mouse on your switch to

446
00:34:05.319 --> 00:34:07.319
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You can't oh never mind. Oh

447
00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:11.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, no. That's much better than okay. Well, well either

448
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.340
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: but like is it and at least for this decorating application, I'm not like, you know, I'm not freaking out about it. So okay, it's fine

449
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:26.340
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I definitely don't care. The other thing they show is using it for the art, the pixel art that you can do in the game.

450
00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:27.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That that's a little better, you know what? That's fine

451
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Again, I get why people would do that. I'm not, I'm not doing that.

452
00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.199
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

453
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:39.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Actually, give me, I can't remember whether it has touch screen support for that. That's why I would prefer for that.

454
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:51.719
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: you're right you're super right about that um yeah that's I'm both I think it's cool and kind of

455
00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:48.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, the megaphone, the weirdest feature.

456
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:56.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Um, it is, yeah, it is cool, but also I'm never going to use it.

457
00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:59.400
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: dumb so I don't know it's yeah that's correct

458
00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:59.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So like, you buy this megaphone, it's an item in the game.

459
00:35:00.059 --> 00:35:07.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And if you shout a villager's name at your console, then you, they'll shout back at you in the game and say, I'm over here.

460
00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:10.539
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: That's it. That's the entirety of this feature.

461
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

462
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:18.059
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Like two things, two things. One, what an over complicated way to find out where your characters are.

463
00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:19.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: just in general, even if there was

464
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:28.139
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: another way to know, really overcomplicated way to do it. Two. Two. You can see them on the map.

465
00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:28.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yep, are you who needs map icons? Oh, wait there on the map. I don't remember that are they?

466
00:35:28.139 --> 00:35:31.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They're on the map, I'm pretty sure.

467
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, if they are well, that's hilarious. That's incredible. Oh

468
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, then in that case the only benefit is you you can just cuss out your neighbors finally

469
00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:41.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Truthfully, they can hear yours.

470
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:55.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's incredible. That's pointless. Oh, that's great. Yeah.

471
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So yeah, I double check so it shows you your list of villages at the left and when you go on to one of them

472
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It shows you where they are then

473
00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:59.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm pretty sure that's how it works anyway. I I don't I

474
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:06.820
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay fine. I can see why this might be fun one or two times, but like it also feels so over complicated

475
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.119
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And the final Switch 2 edition feature is that.

476
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: 12 player multiplayer game chat and the, you know, your camera floating heads thing.

477
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Which is

478
00:36:18.699 --> 00:36:20.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Like

479
00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:23.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: 12 is so much like and

480
00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:26.760
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yes, 12 is so much, but also they all have to have Switch 2's.

481
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:34.239
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that's true. Oh my goodness, and like I

482
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So you have to have, you have to have 11 friends who have Switch 2's.

483
00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:34.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And animal crossing.

484
00:36:36.699 --> 00:36:38.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Just wish there was like

485
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since I've played, but are there even

486
00:36:44.500 --> 00:37:11.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: to like newly fed many games, right? I just, because you know, and that's fine, the nature of the beast, that's always been that way. You know, Animal Crossing is primarily multiplayer has been primarily, hey, check out my stuff, or maybe I have different items in my shop, right? So, you know, like adding up to 12, it's cool, I don't know what the benefit is, and like you said, that's a lot of money to be spent to make that happen. But it's cool. And there's a lot of money to be spent to make that happen.

487
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: but it's cool and there

488
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: is the camera feature, look at each other's faces, I guess.

489
00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The last thing I want is my case with people.

490
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, so that's a switch to addition. They've confirmed it's coming on the 15th of January.

491
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:35.840
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: There will be obviously the upgrade in the eShop, which is $5, or you can buy the physical switch to

492
00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:41.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: addition, which will work like all the other switch to additions. It has the switch game and the upgrade,

493
00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:48.559
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and you can plug it into either. Next, we have the 3.0 update, which gives us some stuff.

494
00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:54.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, first stop, it's for both switch and switch to, which is obviously nice.

495
00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Which super nice because they could lock all this blind switch to work something or make it paid or something, but they didn't good for them

496
00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:04.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They could. Yeah, well, that's the other thing. It's just an update. It's not a paid DLC. It's just a free update.

497
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.280
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Mm-hmm. It's free

498
00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:10.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Coming the same day as the switch to addition, 15th of January. And the big feature

499
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: is the resort hotel run by the Captain family.

500
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.539
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: They're back, baby, and that's cool. I'm excited by that. I like cappin and his family. It did a little girl has grown up. That's the doorable. I love that.

501
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:31.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: One thing I find really funny is they just like slap it on to the pier that captain has his bow on

502
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. That is pretty funny. The pier just stretched out.

503
00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay

504
00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:35.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: fine

505
00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:42.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm not sure I want a hotel like literally on the sea that feels dangerous to me

506
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:52.739
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, from the most part, like, I mean, that, this is the thing out in the real world.

507
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But I guess it is our pretty calm environment like I don't remember there being any storm

508
00:38:52.739 --> 00:39:00.300
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There are, there are definitely hotels hanging over the ocean, but, yeah, you know, that's fine.

509
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm okay with it, but it's fine to be terrified.

510
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:15.699
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So the point of this feature, the hotel is, well, it's basically a happy home designer, right?

511
00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:04.219
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's understandable.

512
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:29.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: it is it is just happy home designer yep yep and you can spend it yep like okay I'm not

513
00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:20.440
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You go in and there's either like, oh, we want to decorate this room in this theme and you

514
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:26.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: go and decorate the room and then you get some currency and then people move in for temporarily.

515
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:37.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: wanting to complain about happy home designer because I love happy home designer but what is

516
00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:41.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So odd to me, like, happy home designer was already at.

517
00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:47.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: In the game and the DLC, the paid one, but it's free now, which is cool.

518
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:52.059
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm just, uh, it's surprising me that I'd ever do that, but, but okay,

519
00:39:52.059 --> 00:39:56.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: how cool, make the thing you had behind paywall free and not like that.

520
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:11.099
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, it's all, I guess they kind of had to do it in this way where it was like a new version of it rather than just make the existing one free because they've obviously like sold it to lots of people and it would feel a little bit rubbish if you'd bought it and no, it's free.

521
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.739
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But yeah, interesting.

522
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.760
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yep. Yep. Good.

523
00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:24.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I, I'm probably not going to do this much. I might try it once and then get bored because as I've mentioned, I'm not a big fan of the decorations.

524
00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:27.539
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the possibly

525
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I might do it a couple of times so I can get some of the rewards, yeah.

526
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:39.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: the rewards and hey you know what like the well good it's a double-edged sword like for you it's a

527
00:40:39.619 --> 00:40:45.300
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: good thing the generally speaking unless they change it for this but happy home designer you can do

528
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: you could just place like one thing call it a day maybe they'll have a list of like three items you

529
00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:59.780
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: have to put but you don't actually have to decorate the room so yeah but uh

530
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:16.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And and the rewards the amount of currency you get and how much they cost seems not bad like you see them getting 200 of these tokens and things are costing like between 10 and 50 so it sounds like you could get like a you know decent amount without doing a humongous amount of work.

531
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.800
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: - Mm-hmm, yep.

532
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.840
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: - Mm-hmm.

533
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:25.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, yes, yeah.

534
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: - No.

535
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:52.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, that's a good point. So yeah, you can use a memo to summon villagers which I guess is cool because if you really care about some characters but you've already got your island fill you can interact with them in a different way rather than because obviously you could bring them to your campsite before but that feels presumably that that's just one night the campsite isn't it and they just kind of sit in the tent the whole time.

536
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:54.739
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: yeah yeah yeah well can't they move from the camps I don't remember or can they do that to

537
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.360
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't think they can.

538
00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:57.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: DLC maybe they can't I just I genuinely don't remember

539
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I honestly don't think they can because I remember always going into the tent talk to them.

540
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Whereas they do hear, they go out and we see them talking to the villagers out and about.

541
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:18.300
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But you definitely could because wasn't that a big part of the initial release back when everyone was spending

542
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: real world money on getting raim into whatever?

543
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.599
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: what do you mean? Oh, move into your town. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But when they're wet,

544
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.260
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Like to move into your town, I'm talking about.

545
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.219
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes. Sorry. I wasn't clear. Yes.

546
00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:31.840
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: but you had, so what, what happened is you, you would summon them to the campsite

547
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:37.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and then you would go into the tent and you would talk to them and you'd have a random chance

548
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:42.280
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

549
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:43.679
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: of them agreeing to come and stay in your village, but they don't venture out of the tent while

550
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, yeah, you're right.

551
00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:48.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: they're there. I'm pretty sure correct me from wrong listeners, but I'm pretty sure they stay

552
00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:49.039
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, I believe you're right.

553
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: in the 10th of the whole time. What is here, they are going out.

554
00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:10.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the hotel and they are venturing around the island, which fuels much, we are going to talk about this later obviously, but one of the big problems that we have had with this game is that it fuels much less like people have agency and are doing things.

555
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

556
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And the campsite felt like a big thing. Part of that, they would come and sit in their tent front of the day.

557
00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.780
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

558
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: whereas they're actually coming to this hotel and going around the island actually feels like their day

559
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.639
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: on holiday, rather than just there because you want to see them.

560
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, it's true.

561
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.340
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: All right, it's true.

562
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.179
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: OK, that's good, you're right.

563
00:43:31.179 --> 00:43:34.179
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I wonder if that works for the special characters,

564
00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:36.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: like the shop keeps or whatever.

565
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm going to guess no, but it'd be interesting.

566
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:52.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: there's also there's also special crafting that you can you can get so they will ask for specific

567
00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: OK, well, hey, that's it.

568
00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:44.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's the hotel.

569
00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:44.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, not nearly.

570
00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.780
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, there's more.

571
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: things and then it will give you a new crafting recipe I think is how it works

572
00:43:57.199 --> 00:44:05.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: or is it oh no it's not it's not it's yes yeah it's it's asking you to craft a certain

573
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It's for expanding the hotels, suppose it gives you tickets.

574
00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:09.679
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: number of an item and they'll give you the tickets so it means you can get the special stuff from

575
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:20.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: tell without designing the rooms and I like that the other thing we note it the other thing

576
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:19.179
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There you go that is good that not way to get the stuff that you're right that is great

577
00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:26.719
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I noticed or some people noticed and I saw their comments about it is that in this section they

578
00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:33.599
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: very quietly just mention sure on the UI that you've got multi crafting bulk crafting now wow

579
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.800
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, nope. Okay. Okay. Look, I'm this is a stretch

580
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: There you go!

581
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.480
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I don't want to be a day to be down here, but it would be the most

582
00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:47.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Nintendo slash animal crossing thing ever if you could only multi craft on the target items

583
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I would hate it.

584
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I can't or imagine, I can't, I can't imagine them actually.

585
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Love it just doesn't be wild

586
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.860
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Look you'd think but they have gone out of their way to do especially in this game

587
00:45:02.039 --> 00:45:11.760
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: To do some like just unfathomable nonsense. Well, I just not forget. This is the game where they introduced the feature to

588
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.840
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Just transfer, you know when you go to those islands on those random islands

589
00:45:17.199 --> 00:45:21.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You could store stuff, but only at harves Island

590
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Kevin, I hate that you brought this into the world.

591
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.820
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So let's just assume that you're wrong

592
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and multi-crafting just exists.

593
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.820
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm not a man of festive. (laughs)

594
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Ah, I'm... okay. (laughs)

595
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.340
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Anyway, cool, you can do this.

596
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can get the tickets without designing

597
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.139
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the building, the rooms.

598
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Ignoring me. Cool. (laughs)

599
00:45:43.059 --> 00:45:45.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's quite fine 'cause what it seems like

600
00:45:45.579 --> 00:45:48.699
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Captain has like orders to deliver these things to people.

601
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah.

602
00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:49.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And so you go and you craft it

603
00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.780
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and you're essentially giving them to Captain to go in

604
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

605
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: deliver and you get some tokens.

606
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's an exchange for that. It's a fun little additional thing.

607
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I like cabin. Yep, yep.

608
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.719
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: storge almost doubled that that's a good that's a good one

609
00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:07.139
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yes, so yes, I agree with that, but here's my question. Why almost doubled?

610
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: any animal causing game. [laughs]

611
00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:14.659
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Why does it go from 5,000 to 9,000? Why?

612
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.239
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: They didn't have the game doesn't have enough storage, don't you know, well?

613
00:46:14.659 --> 00:46:20.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No, no, let's not do that. Let's not do that. That's not how these things work anymore, right?

614
00:46:19.719 --> 00:46:25.639
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There's physically not enough bits in the switch to cart to handle, don't they?

615
00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.739
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They would...

616
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: That's not how this works.

617
00:46:28.739 --> 00:46:35.659
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: 9,000 is not a special number that they use some stupid way of storing how much they have

618
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:42.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [laughter]

619
00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and that they can't do more than 9,000. That's not how this works.

620
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Just give us 10,000 already.

621
00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:43.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, you're right.

622
00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Or better yet, give us infinite.

623
00:46:43.019 --> 00:46:43.760
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You're right.

624
00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.139
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Theoretically infinite.

625
00:46:47.659 --> 00:46:48.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You're right, actually.

626
00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, but you're well.

627
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Let's not forget one of the earliest updates

628
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: in New Horizons specifically.

629
00:46:55.659 --> 00:46:59.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It was nerfing the turnip market in the single player

630
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [laughs]

631
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [laughs]

632
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, yeah.

633
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But also, in storage, you can now store trees and shrubs and flowers.

634
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Plants?

635
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know what? That's a great one. I like that.

636
00:47:14.679 --> 00:47:18.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, but you're going to fill your entire storage with trees and shrubs and flowers.

637
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I guess, 'cause I mean, I don't see the introduced flowers dying, so that means infinite flowers keep popular things, so yeah.

638
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, yeah, especially with the next feature, which is

639
00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:31.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Rosetti

640
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.679
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: - Risk setting!

641
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.679
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Which by the way, I have only ever heard people call them Rosetti before I didn't realize it was

642
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:42.159
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

643
00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Rosetti as in like reset, but that makes sense. I just like I heard them talk about it in the video

644
00:47:42.079 --> 00:47:47.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So Rosetti I really like what they've done with him here he resets areas

645
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yep. That.

646
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.320
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: That's quite cool

647
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So you can basically say I would like you to clear an area

648
00:47:55.079 --> 00:47:57.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: The options you've got are

649
00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:02.920
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'll pick the area so you can like choose an area that he will take everything and put it into your storage

650
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.760
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can say just the beach so you can be like oh

651
00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.639
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: That's a really nice feature. You can be like I'm bored of grabbing things from the beach every day

652
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Mm-hmm

653
00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:20.280
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'll just go get Rosetti to do instead or you can get the entire island. You can get recetti to reset your island

654
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yep

655
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:34.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: yep. Yep. Yeah. That's, it's pretty cool. Um, that extra 4000 storage can be good for

656
00:48:21.639 --> 00:48:25.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: and pick everything up and put it all in your storage, including fl--

657
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: flowers. This is mad.

658
00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:39.400
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: this. It's good. Uh, that that is a great feature. Andrew said he like he hasn't been

659
00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: able to, you know, do his reset thing in a while. So good, good for, good for them for

660
00:48:44.519 --> 00:48:51.079
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: giving us in. Uh, my only small asterisk, I'm upset they, he's still nerfed. Um, he's not named

661
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:02.039
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: angry boy. Um, I guess so, but it was really funny to see how mad he got. I liked the

662
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Well, no, I think this is nice to get to do something positive for one.

663
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:06.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: also really nice is if you ask him to cover an idea that has flowers he will ask you whether

664
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:12.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: he want you want to keep the flowers or get rid of them which might solve the infinite flower problem

665
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:18.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh my gosh you're right. Oh, I didn't think about that. That's good

666
00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:21.300
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: throw all my flowers in the bin please Rosetti

667
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, does dawn show up? Where are you dawn? He has a brother

668
00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:32.260
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: oh no anyway

669
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:35.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: nice I love this I love this feature this is a great feature speaking of things that they're doing

670
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:42.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: after i've already spent all the time to clear my island and do an interesting thing with my island

671
00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:51.539
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: they've added slumber island which is basically exactly it's creative mode I love that they've done

672
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Creative mode, it is

673
00:49:51.539 --> 00:49:57.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: this I also hate that they took so long to do this because how many times have I reset my island to

674
00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.260
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: to do something interesting and then I've been like,

675
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

676
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I want whereas I could have done it in the dream world, I could have done it with my slumber islands,

677
00:50:05.219 --> 00:50:11.699
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I could have done them all at the same time because you get three save files which is fantastic.

678
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

679
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:17.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So two things about this just in general, one, this is their way of being able to give you multiple

680
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:25.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: islands per switch, right? Very clever, right? Good idea. Go for it.

681
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No

682
00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:28.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, I'll actually question about this because because maybe I'm a little into it, but can you build a house on this island?

683
00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, I don't think--

684
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:43.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can run it like a normal island. It is essentially creative mode. You can build--there is a house. You can build buildings, but I don't know if you can live in that.

685
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.380
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay. Yeah, cuz

686
00:50:38.179 --> 00:50:40.179
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No

687
00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Enter and decorate it. Yeah

688
00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:51.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Well, I think you can go in and decorate it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

689
00:50:45.059 --> 00:50:48.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Can you you're okay? Let it I'll be watching the trailer by

690
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, always go ahead can see talking.

691
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:59.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Because the whole point is it's creative mode, right? So, it's like do everything you can normally do in the island, but without limitations, right?

692
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:10.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It comes from a menu rather than having to craft them or buy them. So, I would be weird if you couldn't go in and design.

693
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:15.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I don't know cuz I I'm looking at this section like and I just don't see like them actually going inside a house

694
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:21.599
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I know that up at the house is there. Why would they have the house if you couldn't go in the house? What would be the point?

695
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:25.300
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I that's like I'm thinking it might just be decorative or the mental basically

696
00:51:24.099 --> 00:51:26.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No. No, there's no way.

697
00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:32.260
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm gonna say I don't see you going into a house. That's all I'm saying, but okay, we'll see

698
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I would be so shocked.

699
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: like not even just a house like I think maybe you can introduce

700
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:48.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: villagers and that might be a villagers house like you know neighbors they're the animals you have your house

701
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.280
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Sure, but you'd still be able to go in there.

702
00:51:45.599 --> 00:51:47.440
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't think it matters, right?

703
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: What is your house compared to other people's faces?

704
00:51:49.699 --> 00:51:53.380
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: well I mean you get bigger more rooms and you can decorate it or whatever right like we don't know

705
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.840
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Sure, but it's creative mode.

706
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.280
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can just add more houses.

707
00:51:54.739 --> 00:51:58.260
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: okay all right we'll see we'll see uh

708
00:51:57.639 --> 00:51:59.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You're right, there are still questions.

709
00:51:59.159 --> 00:52:00.679
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You're right, absolutely right.

710
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.320
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay, yeah, so as you pointed out,

711
00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: you can bring your islanders, which is cool.

712
00:52:07.239 --> 00:52:09.320
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't wanna think about the lore there.

713
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:15.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It's you're just dreaming about your neighbors that's all there you go

714
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay, sure, let's go with that.

715
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can add, there are three different island sizes.

716
00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:21.760
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It looks like the largest one is just the standard island size,

717
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.480
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I think, but it's hard to know from just what

718
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:35.079
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, it is, but that is kind of fun. Different. I don't know, that's pretty cool.

719
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: What I really like as well is the co-op terraforming, right?

720
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So you can still invite your friends over to this island and they can all terraform.

721
00:52:38.039 --> 00:52:43.480
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's, you know what? You know what? That's actually, I talked to complain about like,

722
00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:47.480
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: you know, is there enough to do with the multivolt. This, this is which enough for 12 people.

723
00:52:48.199 --> 00:52:51.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That that is a cool thing. And honestly, I'm kind of surprised like that. This feels like they

724
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:52.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: they want an extra step.

725
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: to have online co-op for creative mode.

726
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So that is cool.

727
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.360
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I mean, this just sounds madness, right? Like it sounds like chaos.

728
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah.

729
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I know. I love it. It's great. I can't wait.

730
00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:11.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: The other thing as well, in this section we notice, there is sidestepping and back and forward

731
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:17.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: stepping, which is mostly useful for terraforming, where, you know, how many times have you done

732
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:29.059
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

733
00:53:17.079 --> 00:53:21.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the terraforming and you've like had to run backwards and then turn around and you accidentally

734
00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:25.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: face the wrong direction and you terraform the wrong bit, whereas this you can like just

735
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: backstep and keep going.

736
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:44.360
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And I'm intrigued as to how like what the control is going to be, like how you're going to

737
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:56.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Look forward to the harvest season dream island adventure where Aubrey Os hops on and we we've been open island and and fight

738
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:10.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I love how like there are so many of these little features that they just kind of show in passing in the thing because they know they don't need to point out. They know that people will notice it.

739
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

740
00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:20.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's cover because that way they don't have to admit they should it should have been there in the first place

741
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:21.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You know, the multi crafting and the side stepping and the most, you know, these sorts of things is very fun.

742
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, that's a good point, it's a good point.

743
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm intrigued to see what that that will be like fun.

744
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.320
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know what else is fun?

745
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: There's a few other things.

746
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.800
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Nintendo gaming is fun.

747
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:44.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, so we've got some collaborations and new start, new items. First stop.

748
00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:42.079
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Finally, Nintendo cross animal crossing.

749
00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:44.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: [laughing]

750
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:55.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, well, they called this section collaboration, various collaborations, right? It's not me that made that up. You can, well, to be fair, they did originally, you could buy a switch.

751
00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:48.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah.

752
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:11.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: For you for your house, but you can now also buy a switch to a Famicom, a NAS, a Famicom disk system, a Gameboy, a Super Famicom and presumably more, but they don't show any more in the video.

753
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: and maybe others

754
00:55:10.139 --> 00:55:12.940
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Nope, oh my gosh

755
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'd be surprised if they didn't have all the standard Nintendo consoles.

756
00:55:14.179 --> 00:55:18.039
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes, okay, all right, you know hold that thought hold that thought

757
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Wait a minute, wait a way to wait a minute. Did you just notice why I noticed?

758
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.380
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, I don't know what you notice but

759
00:55:23.099 --> 00:55:30.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, let me say okay, first of all so it's not just the consoles you can actually play emulators on them, right?

760
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:39.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: That's what I just noticed. How did I not, how did I not notice that till this moment that you can play, you can play some games from these consoles?

761
00:55:31.139 --> 00:55:35.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know, yeah, you didn't notice that. Oh my goodness. Oh

762
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:42.280
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes, which is not unheard of the original animal crossing had this feature

763
00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:52.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Did it? There's, but what, okay, is it, you can play ice climber, you can play Doctor Mario?

764
00:55:43.099 --> 00:55:44.440
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes

765
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.860
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The exact same thing you get the consoles and you can play the games

766
00:55:49.659 --> 00:55:51.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, you can play a bunch of games

767
00:55:52.139 --> 00:55:56.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, you could play Wario Woods or Wario. Oh, yeah, really it's something like you're worried as woods

768
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.719
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I think there was a bunch of games in the original animal crossing

769
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.519
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: you think you'll have multiplayer for Dr. Murray.

770
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I don't know about that, but okay, but here's the thing

771
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:13.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: All right, let's tie this together. Oh, what did we just say? We see we up to super family comment nothing after that, right?

772
00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:18.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You just said and I agree they're gonna have all the standard consoles, right?

773
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No game by

774
00:56:19.019 --> 00:56:21.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: How far are they gonna go with with ma with games?

775
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: What game

776
00:56:21.699 --> 00:56:27.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: What game are they gonna emulate on on the GameCube, Calvin or oh my god? I just called you Calvin my brother

777
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:32.940
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh no, I'm not Calvin, but yeah, and no they wouldn't surely they wouldn't

778
00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:31.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: This is discussion

779
00:56:32.059 --> 00:56:35.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, they wouldn't but I'm gonna put the idea. What if we could

780
00:56:34.579 --> 00:56:36.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'll be amazing

781
00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:41.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Emulate the original animal crossing in our animal crossing

782
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Amazing

783
00:56:44.219 --> 00:56:50.739
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That'd be incredible. It's not gonna happen. In fact, I don't think those games. I don't think the 64 will emulate like I think

784
00:56:46.199 --> 00:56:48.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No

785
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No, I think you're right. I think I think oh just yeah, yeah, I don't think they'll go as far as that

786
00:56:54.099 --> 00:57:00.260
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I think they'll be in there purely ornamental, but yeah, there's no one earth. We're gonna get a 64 game

787
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.260
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Emulating on this thing

788
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:05.099
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, I think it might just be the NES, maybe the SNES.

789
00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:07.420
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I think it might even just be the NES though.

790
00:57:07.059 --> 00:57:09.059
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: We might get a game boy

791
00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.539
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Maybe, but also like, a lot of Game by Games

792
00:57:10.659 --> 00:57:12.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Something simple

793
00:57:12.539 --> 00:57:16.579
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: were just like NES games, but on handheld, right?

794
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.300
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

795
00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:17.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't know.

796
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.099
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Look, if this is how we get Pokemon Red on Switch.

797
00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: This is the way

798
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.900
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm all for it.

799
00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.820
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: [laughing]

800
00:57:31.059 --> 00:57:35.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The 4.0 update includes connect connectivity to the Pokemon home

801
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: you know that's where people would be asking for it as well

802
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.380
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh

803
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:47.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I want my Animal Crossing Charizard to be able to go into Pokemon Home

804
00:57:41.219 --> 00:57:43.219
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: My goodness

805
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.260
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay

806
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:57.380
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So there are certain online communities of of games like a more traditional games like I think Shogi is one of them

807
00:57:58.179 --> 00:58:01.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Where they don't have like a de facto online simulator, whatever

808
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:12.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Ah. Okay. Yeah.

809
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.179
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So a lot of people actually default to Final Fantasy 14

810
00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:11.139
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: because Final Fantasy 14 has an arcade essentially section area

811
00:58:12.099 --> 00:58:15.619
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: With many games including like real games like Chewy and stuff like that

812
00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:23.219
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And so there's there's like weird niche groups playing Final Fantasy 14 just to play the simulators and emulators

813
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.599
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: [laughing]

814
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:25.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: - Why am I not surprised?

815
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:26.179
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I want that to happen in animal crossing

816
00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:26.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: That's amazing.

817
00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.760
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: - Yeah, fantastic.

818
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.679
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, more collaborations.

819
00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: All right

820
00:58:34.679 --> 00:58:38.719
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We've got Lego, Lego furniture.

821
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:35.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Lego!

822
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:37.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay.

823
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:42.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So, when I heard Lego furniture, I just assumed I meant block furniture, like yeah, sure.

824
00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.039
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: No, Lego, yeah.

825
00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:49.019
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But then I saw, like, no, that is Lego copyright R, not TM, but Lego brand.

826
00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:49.440
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, yeah.

827
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, and I feel like this.

828
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, this goes further than I think I first initially realized, right?

829
00:58:54.159 --> 00:59:00.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, there's some Lego clothes, there's things like a sofa, an a table, and a partition.

830
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:19.039
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: a full room. There's a flower. That's pretty cool. There's a Lego. It's a world you

831
00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:07.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: There is also a bed, which is cool, and there's a DIY workbench.

832
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:12.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You can make a Lego workbench, and there's an arcade game.

833
00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I wonder if that'll have it.

834
00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:20.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Well, that have a game that you can play in it, like these new ones.

835
00:59:19.039 --> 00:59:28.760
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: never known now. Who knows? Oh, yeah.

836
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.739
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: The game does show space invaders on the screen.

837
00:59:24.739 --> 00:59:33.460
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't know, look, I wouldn't, at this point, I wouldn't bet against being able to play space invaders on the Lego arcade car.

838
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: You know what? You're, you're right. You're not wrong. I wouldn't put a pass. I wouldn't be

839
00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:37.380
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: In fact, oh wait, no, oh no, I just realized what's going to happen.

840
00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:44.619
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, you know how they do this thing, where they have some furniture that has like, you know, eight different versions of it.

841
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:55.300
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that'd be cool. Yeah. They are right. You're super right. And we already

842
00:59:44.619 --> 00:59:50.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And though just every day it'll be a different one, there's going to be a whole load of these Lego arcade games

843
00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:01.860
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: see that there's at least one or two variants of the Lego furniture at least the pink and those

844
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:11.860
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: the workbench looks really cool and I'm hoping it's like actual functional in the game like

845
01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:06.340
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: like a brown one. Yeah. You're right. Um, that'll be interesting to see.

846
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:20.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, and for sure is, it has to be, it's the DS, DIY workbench, it looks like the other one, it's going to be fun.

847
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:24.019
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, well exactly. The partition is so funny because it's literally just some blocks of leg or

848
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:32.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I like the flower pot, like it's, you know, it's like an actual like Lego like one of the set you'd build. That's fun.

849
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah

850
01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:35.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, the partition is funny.

851
01:00:34.139 --> 01:00:38.980
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, these all look like things you could actually build with pieces. I'm pretty sure you could and I'm gonna

852
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.699
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure.

853
01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.179
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: See you're gonna see people on doing it online. I'll be surprised if someone hasn't already done all these one

854
01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:46.460
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, yeah, it's a good point. All that'll be cool. That'll be cool to see.

855
01:00:45.619 --> 01:00:52.739
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And then the clothes look pretty generic it generically Lego clothes, but wherever, you know each to their own

856
01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:55.420
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, and then it's the slap the logo on. Well, each

857
01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:06.780
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: here's to my own. I like Zelda, and I like this breath a while and tears the kingdom and and now we put it in my animal crossing. So I like that.

858
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:17.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, it's very cool. So you've got again some furniture. You've got some essentially cosplay. You've got you can dress up as link or Zelda

859
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yup, yup, here's the kingdom Zalva.

860
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.320
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The two, the two.

861
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.840
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And the furniture seems to be pretty

862
01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You know

863
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.039
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Quite a lot of it and it's it's really nice looking. There's also

864
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:50.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: one complaint is it's it's one of those sets that's not actually like a furniture set. There's not a bed. It's like, it's just decorative stuff, which isn't bad because you can use that on the outside. You can have, you know, you're broken down guardian outside. That's cool. But like, you know, it'd be nice to have a bed.

865
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's just decoration stuff. Yeah.

866
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah.

867
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: There's also a wand, which is in the style of Zelda, and it makes the little interface that

868
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.900
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yep, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like that.

869
01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:03.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: comes up when you change your outfit. It makes it Zelda-e, which is very cool.

870
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:12.760
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: You've got your gems and heart containers and stuff like that. Yeah.

871
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:16.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Rupies that flowers all the likes the master sword. Oh, all your stuff. It's all. Oh,

872
01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:21.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's very cool. But then you also have two new characters,

873
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: the acarina's there.

874
01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.059
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That school, I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get

875
01:02:21.239 --> 01:02:23.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: "Minera Antulin"

876
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.579
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: on the other characters, like Epona and Ganon. But I'm not joking.

877
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:40.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So well, I mean, I know you're joking, but just to make a point, they had to they had to use characters that still use the like base model animal models, right?

878
01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:46.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Like they couldn't get who was Ganon who was Ganon going to be what which of the standard villager types was he going to be.

879
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.800
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, no, no, those dang.

880
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.440
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, ow, ow, those characters were already a new leaf.

881
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Were they?

882
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.159
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes, they had Zelda cross silver characters.

883
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:56.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah.

884
01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.559
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I wasn't joking.

885
01:02:53.559 --> 01:02:55.159
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: They had Ganon was a pig.

886
01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Are there even pigs in new horizons?

887
01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.679
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yes, yeah.

888
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, I don't remember the pigs. Okay, fair enough.

889
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.280
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, they're pigs, yeah.

890
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.360
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No, the Epona wolf link, Ganon,

891
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.840
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I can't remember who else,

892
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.559
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: but there were previous Zelda crossover characters

893
01:03:09.559 --> 01:03:11.099
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And they're not returning.

894
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.679
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That's a Monero and Tulen are fun picks for the new ones.

895
01:03:16.679 --> 01:03:21.159
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm not complaining about them, they look great, although Monero is even as little goggles

896
01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:27.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: on her head, but I do limit the loss of the other ones.

897
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:35.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And then we have Splatoon, which again has furniture and cosplay, and also brings CC and VJ, who are-

898
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, ma-

899
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.800
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay, so, well, CC and V each are actually returning characters.

900
01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:39.880
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, are they?

901
01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:46.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: They were also in new leaf, but they were cosplaying the squid sisters, the difference

902
01:03:42.679 --> 01:03:43.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Okay.

903
01:03:46.679 --> 01:03:48.679
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yes. Yeah.

904
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.360
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: between characters basically.

905
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.199
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: This time they're, they're, I forget their name, the new one, the new band.

906
01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:53.719
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Oh, I can't remember their names either, but-

907
01:03:53.199 --> 01:03:57.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Oh, yeah, I can't wrap them in, but yeah, they're just, it's fun because their cosplayers

908
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.440
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah.

909
01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:02.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: basically and now they're cosplaying the other, the new, the new idols.

910
01:04:02.599 --> 01:04:04.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The furniture set is nice because there are...

911
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: at least a sofa.

912
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I don't know if I see a bed, but there is a sofa and a tape where they might be a generic table.

913
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But there's a lot of furniture items, like clothes and stuff like that.

914
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Because they introduce shoes and hats from the Splatoon series, so there's a lot you can hang.

915
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The crab bot is pretty cool.

916
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: The television looks nice.

917
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:38.199
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. So I think that's pretty much it. That's, I mean, there's a lot of a lot

918
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I like it.

919
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There's a jukebox that I think.

920
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Squid jukebox.

921
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: soon. Yeah.

922
01:04:38.199 --> 01:04:43.219
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: of extra content. I did see one thing where someone online was claiming that the crafting

923
01:04:43.219 --> 01:04:48.159
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: no use is your storage as well as what you have on you, but I've not actually seen any evidence

924
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, I heard that I

925
01:04:48.159 --> 01:04:50.400
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: of that, but that would be nice if that was the case.

926
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.860
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Don't

927
01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.519
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, I'm I also forgot that they didn't add that in already. Yeah

928
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, well, yeah. Okay. So now that we've gone everything in detail, Kevin, what are your thoughts?

929
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:18.360
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I hate it. No. Okay. So. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. The update on that song, what it actually

930
01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:14.559
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Well, well, okay. So I, I mean, I guess by that, I mean, it's not solving the core issues you have

931
01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:23.400
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: was presented. I think it's cool. It's all good stuff. I like happy on designer, so the hotel is

932
01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:30.599
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: nice. I like that bit. The crossover stuff on the sucker for that, I love it. The creative mode,

933
01:05:30.599 --> 01:05:32.980
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm not as big on it.

934
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:43.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But it's a big sell for the game and a lot of people do like it, so I'd recognize that as a cool thing to add, especially like the multiplayer thing, that might be cool to do an island with your friends.

935
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:55.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So, you know, the update is good, but you're right, it doesn't add the things I want to solve or fix the game.

936
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, the fix says if they were broken, to change the game how I want it to be, let's say that. Right.

937
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Are the neighbors going to be...

938
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: a little more interactive. I mean, maybe sometimes they add a lot of stealth updates and these things. So, you know, maybe there's more dialogue.

939
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.760
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, I mean, we already know that the stuff that they've not talked about, right?

940
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.559
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Like the about grafting and the strafing and stuff like that.

941
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:25.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

942
01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:16.440
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They didn't talk about it.

943
01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.119
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: They just showed it.

944
01:06:17.119 --> 01:06:21.079
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So there's no way that there is other stuff that they've not talked about.

945
01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't think it will be completely overhauling how the villages live and talk,

946
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: No. No. If they at least add dialogue, I'd probably...

947
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'd probably want a significant amount, but at least some dialogue, more dialogue options for the villagers. That would be nice.

948
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Like, I mean, overall, like it's direction of the game, it's not going to change or whatever, so I'm still going to have issues.

949
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: But we'll see. Like I said, what is actually here is nice. Is it going to fix the game for me? I don't know, probably not.

950
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:04.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Okay. So, one thing that's not clear to me, like some people say there are, but...

951
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:14.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And they're probably will, but I just haven't seen it highlighted. Are they going to be adding more base furniture, you know, just regular furniture, not the colab or the hotel stuff, right?

952
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:24.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And I say that because one of the other big issues I had with the game was a lot of the aesthetics of the game became a lot more grounded.

953
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:33.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Like, are you feeling out of the Robo Series, the, of furniture, the Robo Series furniture from previous? Okay.

954
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:46.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: So, you don't hear, I'll send you a link or whatever, but in previous animal crossings, but my all-time favorite set of furniture in animal crossings is called the Robo Series.

955
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:59.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It's just a furniture series of, you know, bad and table and all that stuff, but they all look like little robots. They all have little faces and light up and it's very cute. I love it.

956
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: My favorite set, and I think it represents what I like about Amazon.

957
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:14.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And I don't know what Carson said, some that are kind of over the top and just fun, but not very practical or realistic as furniture sets.

958
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And they kind of straight away from that in New Horizons.

959
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:26.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Could they add that back in maybe? And like I said, we just said there's stealth stuff, so maybe they'll add that in.

960
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That would be nice, but I'll just see if it happens.

961
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, so, you know, I'm still...

962
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:43.960
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm upset, I had to go back to this game, but I will do it, and I will enjoy some parts, like I said, I do like a beyond design, I'll enjoy the hotel.

963
01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: What about you, Al? Tell me your highlights.

964
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:59.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And yeah, I mean, I've always had a complicated relationship with this game and I'm never quite sure whether I like it or not, but I will say the creative mode gets me very excited.

965
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:15.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: A lot of what I did in this game was like completely demolished my island and do something interesting like I made a water world, a water island, for example, it was basically like an atoll, right, it was just a tiny bit of land around the side.

966
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: side. I find it fun to do that sort of stuff.

967
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And this just allows me to do more of that without kind of demolishing my main island without having to reset it every time.

968
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:34.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm guessing at some point you can like, you can just delete one and create a new one if you want rather than having to clean it all up.

969
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And again, recetti as well is a nice thing that I'm really looking forward to.

970
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Will I spend a lot more time in the game? I don't know. I kind of worry that maybe this came too late for me.

971
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I don't know, we'll see.

972
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I first of all need to figure out which switch my save files on.

973
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So that's a problem for me.

974
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.840
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: oh man oh man I already saw some talk about that how do you transfer from

975
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:08.560
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: switch one to switch to yeah wasn't it wasn't it already weird like that was

976
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Presumably, just the same way you'd transfer from one switch to another, the switch.

977
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.600
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: different wasn't it like you had to have a separate like app or something okay

978
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It is, yes, it's weird, but it's easy.

979
01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.720
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: well hopefully it is just that but Nintendo being Nintendo I wouldn't be

980
01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.880
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: surprise if it's not.

981
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah.

982
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:31.220
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I just need to figure out where it is because I have too many switches but yeah I think

983
01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:36.800
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: it's fun I'm gonna find it sometime in the next couple of weeks and kind of tidy up my

984
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.920
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm not. I'm just going to have resetty. You know what? That might be actually fine.

985
01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.760
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: And if I just start up and resetty, just do the thing. Just wipe it. Let's start over.

986
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:52.060
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I need to see what I need to at least see what state my island is in before I decide what to do, right?

987
01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.039
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Ah, that's a good point. That's a good point.

988
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.220
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So yeah, I I agree with you

989
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.819
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: It's not gonna solve some of the underlying issues that some people have with the game

990
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.819
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: But that's not something that has ever been my issue with the game

991
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.500
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah

992
01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:09.060
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So, you know the stuff that I like about the game. It's improving

993
01:11:09.539 --> 01:11:13.979
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It is it it is improving the game. Yeah, yeah

994
01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.979
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: And I'm gonna go buy all that Lego furniture

995
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:21.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'm I'm all excited to see the the real the real people then all the people building the real Lego sets of that stuff

996
01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:22.859
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: I'd be cool

997
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:35.279
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah. Correct. And you put the Lego sets and yeah, yeah, yeah, you could do that.

998
01:11:22.859 --> 01:11:24.859
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Wait, can we get oh?

999
01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:29.079
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: There's a there is animal crossing leg go the other way

1000
01:11:29.819 --> 01:11:33.859
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: What if we dig we just go full circle and just get sets of this furniture?

1001
01:11:34.659 --> 01:11:36.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah, oh

1002
01:11:36.239 --> 01:11:38.960
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Because these are very simple sets as well. You could absolutely just

1003
01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:39.659
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: They are oh

1004
01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.600
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: That'd be good. They charge so much money for it, but it'd be good

1005
01:11:47.859 --> 01:11:49.859
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Why the leg is so expensive?

1006
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:54.939
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Well, but because everything's imported at least for me. That's why

1007
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.180
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Animal cross

1008
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.520
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right. Well, I think that's everything then. We will obviously talk about this when if we learn more and presumably

1009
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Or when it comes out

1010
01:12:08.479 --> 01:12:13.239
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yes, presumably some of us will be at least trying it out and maybe doing an episode of it after it comes out

1011
01:12:13.239 --> 01:12:15.720
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Got it got away out that's how it was free

1012
01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:22.539
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: It's contemplating playing Animal Crossing new leaf again somebody in down back the body back one nice job

1013
01:12:21.479 --> 01:12:23.479
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: I'm back in the building

1014
01:12:25.439 --> 01:12:27.439
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: All right, well, thank you for joining me

1015

1016
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:39.140
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: find me, look, I'm on Twitter unfortunately, but there's still some begging fan art on there,

<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: there's some really funny comics and stuff, especially with Z.A. Oh my gosh, there's so

1018
01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:52.180

1024
01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:24.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: into when you when you have a thread when you have a thread.

1025
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:51.000
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is I was it took me a minute to realize that's what it meant. Like, okay, but yeah, that's good. I, you know, I thought about it because like, I'm not the owner does that, but I thought of it, but I do it the most. There's no denying that. So you know what? Fine. Fine. I'll take it. Yes.

1026
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: So you talk about an episode that's never Kevin Fred.

1027
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:49.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Look, there are, there are worse things to have named after yourself, you know?

1028
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:56.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: What also, I'm sure we'll have some more greenhouse episodes soon. I've just been busy.

1029
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.399
<v 3FDB47D4-D4E3-466F-976A-0EB193311287>Kevin: We have many weird ideas. We just have to sit down and record them because we're all tired.

1030
01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:02.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Yeah, I've, I've got quite the list.

1031
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:06.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: We still haven't done our Sonic 3 episode.

1032
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.500
<v 6F3783F8-FC86-40D4-864D-A0D26E99B333>Al: Been out for so long.

1033
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:19.800
