(47s)

> Episode idea for this episode and then the animal crossing news drops and I was like oh, I think this is our episode

(53s) **Kevin:**

> Never mind. Let's make a two hour episode out of a 12 minute trailer. Yeah

(1m) **Al:**

> I hope not two hours. I want to go to bed before two hours time

(1m 5s)

> So yeah, we're gonna talk about that's gonna be our main topic

(1m 7s)

> So when we're going through the news don't be confused that we're not talking about animal crossing because we're gonna do all that at the end after all the other news

(1m 17s) **Kevin:**

> because it's really just news, but one news that demands our attention.

(1m 18s) **Al:**

> It's news there's not there's so much news

(1m 22s)

> But we're gonna talk about that specifically

(1m 24s)

> Before that we have I know what you released last month

(1m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I have been up to, well, I mean, spoil alert for the new section.

(1m 28s) **Al:**

> Uh, but first of all, Kevin.

## What Have We Been Up To

(1m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Let's build the zoo, we had an update and I saw that and I thought, hey, I like that

(1m 42s)

> game.

(1m 43s)

> I'll start a new zoo.

(1m 44s)

> So I started in a zoo.

(1m 45s) **Al:**

> Let's build a zoom. We're like, let's wear a hat.

(1m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I haven't reached that yet.

(1m 49s) **Al:**

> Violers.

(1m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, we'll get to that.

(1m 52s)

> We'll get to that.

(1m 54s)

> I've been playing Digimon.

(1m 56s)

> Yeah, at least.

(1m 58s)

> I'm just grinding filling out the decks and doing stuff, I'm enjoying it, but it is a grind fest, it's an enjoyable grind fest.

(2m 22s)

> But yeah, this is Digimon.

(2m 28s)

> Oh, and mostly just screaming about Kirby air writers, not game wise, I'm not playing it, but I'm just screaming about it, because that direct came out and I'm happy.

(2m 36s) **Al:**

> Wait, is that already? I thought it was still on, no, yeah.

(2m 38s) **Kevin:**

> No, it's not out, I'm just saying the direct, the second direct for Kirby air writers.

(2m 41s) **Al:**

> Oh, did she say, "You're not playing it?" And I'm like, "Well, yeah, obviously, it's not, yeah."

(2m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I'm not playing exactly, but it's close, it's so close, I'm scared, we're going to be in a post Kirby air writers world.

(2m 53s)

> Okay, what about you? What's going on speaking of things

(2m 56s) **Al:**

> Pokemon! I have been playing the Pokemon I'm continuing I'm not like

(2m 58s) **Kevin:**

> I'm not playing?

(3m 3s) **Al:**

> playing it super fast because you know life. Life gets in the way but I have

(3m 10s)

> been playing I'm progressing through the story I'm continuing to do my

(3m 14s)

> side quest and catch all the Pokemon as I go.

(3m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. How far are you?

(3m 23s) **Al:**

> It's hard to know because I've not really looked at the, so I think I'm on main quest 20, but I don't know how many main quests there are.

(3m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay, I don't know that either.

(3m 33s) **Al:**

> So I'm not, yeah, I'm trying not to like, super spoil myself. I have spoiled myself on the mega that we'd most interest me.

(3m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(3m 45s)

> Oh, I want to know what that is

(3m 46s) **Al:**

> Oh, I mean, I think you know what it would be.

(3m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, wait. Oh, yeah, of course. I know what it is. Oh, yes. I do know well, okay

(3m 53s) **Al:**

> I've been trying not to have the mega spoiled for me, but that one seems to be just everywhere.

(3m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(3m 57s)

> Okay, well, I mean it okay. Just is it thumbs up or thumbs down? Let's just say that what is it for you?

(4m 4s) **Al:**

> from what I've seen thumbs up but obviously I've not seen, I've not actually used it,

(4m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(4m 9s) **Al:**

> I've not like seen it in my actual game, I've not like seen how it's introduced to you and

(4m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(4m 15s)

> Yeah

(4m 15s) **Al:**

> like I'm seeing the lead up to it but I've not actually experienced it myself yet.

(4m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(4m 22s)

> Yeah, I think it looks cool. It's thumbs up. I mean, I still like the I

(4m 29s)

> Like the other parts too, but that's all right. There's another part. I like more you know what I mean

(4m 32s) **Al:**

> This conversation is so vague as to be pointless now.

(4m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but you know what I'm talking about though, probably

(4m 39s) **Al:**

> I don't think I do.

(4m 44s)

> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, fair enough.

(4m 46s) **Kevin:**

> I like that Pokemon a lot too

(4m 49s)

> I'll say that okay, that's what I mean, okay, yes

(4m 52s) **Al:**

> I know what you mean, I know what you mean.

(4m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yeah

(4m 56s)

> Okay

(4m 58s) **Al:**

> So yeah, I am enjoying the game.

(5m 1s) **Kevin:**

> The good good for you. I haven't played it yet. I want to it looks good

(5m 5s)

> There's come I already have complaints going in, but I like it nonetheless. It looks fun

(5m 9s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I totally understand people's complaints about the game. I don't think it feels

(5m 16s)

> kind of incomplete myself. I feel like it's kind of giving me a complete enough story that I feel

(5m 24s)

> you know, whatever. I don't particularly care about the lack of 3D balconies, right? Like it's

(5m 31s)

> just not something I care about. I understand why some people do. But I mean, realistically, you

(5m 37s)

> have to be an um.

(5m 39s)

> you know, very specific angle to actually even notice that I'm not really looking up at the buildings at that sort of angle. So I don't really care. Again, I'm not saying that anyone that cares is wrong. I just personally don't care.

(5m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean, it's it yeah, like, I mean, that's such a smallish complaint. It's it's really a symptom of the bigger problem of

(5m 59s)

> the cheap feel of a lot of it. And I think that's that's the underlying issue, which I think is very valid

(6m 8s)

> But I see that haven't played it, but at the same time

(6m 9s) **Al:**

> Sure.

(6m 12s) **Kevin:**

> I'm like you know Pokemon fans they were plenty cheap or economical before but that was on you know GBA and DS so didn't you didn't feel it as much

(6m 22s)

> But you know it's the good parts are still good. What can I say, right?

(6m 27s) **Al:**

> Let's put it this way. I said this in the last episode, but I'm not sure if you've heard it or not,

(6m 33s)

> but I am just, I'm glad that we are back to the conversations of the graphics are bad,

(6m 39s)

> rather than the performance is bad. It's, it's much better situation to be in, because like with the,

(6m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh, for sure.

(6m 46s) **Al:**

> with the graphics, I'm just like, eh, I don't really care, right? Like, I, I, I, I'm just to point this

(6m 52s)

> out. I know that if we got a better looking game, I would probably enjoy the

(6m 57s)

> more. I'm not saying I wouldn't, but it's not the same as the graphics ruin the game for me,

(6m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, you're. Yeah, you're right.

(7m 2s) **Al:**

> they definitely do not. However, bad performance ruins the game for everyone, right? Like,

(7m 9s)

> there's very few people who can be like watching the jittery nonsense and all that

(7m 14s)

> horrificness of the, of scarlet and violet and, and not have it ruin some of the experience for them.

(7m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(7m 20s)

> You're yeah, you're super right at least the baseline of the game works has been met that is appreciated

(7m 26s) **Al:**

> Yeah, absolutely.

(7m 28s)

> Even on even on switch one, I'm not really hearing anybody complain about it.

(7m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I heard it's bad. I don't know, but I've heard it's bad on switch one, but

(7m 37s) **Al:**

> Okay.

(7m 39s) **Kevin:**

> The hearsay complete hearsay

(7m 41s) **Al:**

> I have heard from people actually playing on it that I know you're like in, you know, in chats that we're in who have said that it's perfectly fine on switch.

(7m 49s)

> I don't know because I'm not playing on switch, but I'm playing on switch too. So there we are.

(7m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Well, there you go. Pokemon. It's good again mostly

(7m 58s) **Al:**

> Depends that you ask.

(8m 2s)

> But at least we're in that situation where it depends that you ask rather than it just being universally terrible to run.

(8m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(8m 6s)

> Yeah

(8m 8s)

> Yeah

(8m 9s) **Al:**

> All right. Kevin, I know what you released last month.

## I Know What You Released Last Month

(8m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Do you what did I release?

(8m 15s) **Al:**

> Last month October, because whenever in November in October, we have three game releases, a small, a short month, a small number of releases for month.

(8m 27s)

> Little Rocket Lab, ILA, a Frosty Glade, and Harvest Moon Home Suite Home Special Edition. That's the Consulance.

(8m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, little rocket lab, I remember, and I'm somewhat intrigued by home sweet home, of course,

(8m 46s)

> this is the hardest one, so we know what is EY, I don't remember.

(8m 49s) **Al:**

> um it was uh it's a broom guide a broom riding game

(8m 57s) **Kevin:**

> of the the new genre of meekalikes. I don't know. Oh, um, that, uh, kiki,

(9m 2s) **Al:**

> are the mekelegs or are the thing me what's what was that what was the studio ghibli film

(9m 10s)

> yeah are they kiki likes

(9m 11s) **Kevin:**

> delete research. They're kiki likes. Yeah, you're right, kiki souls.

(9m 20s) **Al:**

> are you gonna get any of these ones?

(9m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, I like said rocket lab probably. Eli, uh, I don't know how to see because

(9m 27s)

> like as fun as the boom writing is I can that it can only go so far. You know, um,

(9m 32s)

> like I got a good bit of mika. Can I do another round of that? Uh, maybe it depends if it interests me. Um,

(9m 39s)

> yeah, that is just broom platform. I'm looking at it now. Um, yeah. Be good. Yeah. Yeah.

(9m 43s) **Al:**

> Yes, it looks much more platformy than Mika did, so yeah, interesting.

(9m 50s) **Kevin:**

> So I don't know, but, uh, at least, uh, I can say a little rocket lab does my attention.

(9m 56s)

> So, make it better.

(9m 57s)

> So, point.

(9m 57s) **Al:**

> No, no harvismen. No.

(10m 1s)

> And I'm pretty sure I have Eila because I kickstarted it.

(10m 10s)

> So I'll probably play it at some point but

(10m 13s)

> Little Rocket Lab, yeah, I'm intrigued by but I don't know if I will

(10m 18s)

> Actually end up playing it

(10m 21s)

> But it intrigues me and obviously I'm not gonna buy harvism in home sweet home again. No. Thank you

(10m 27s) **Kevin:**

> But the content...

(10m 27s) **Al:**

> I got my fail. I got my fail and I enjoyed it, but we're done. We're done. They're content

(10m 37s)

> No, it's not $40 worth of content

(10m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, good times.

(10m 43s) **Al:**

> Now if they were bringing the update to mobile that I would do

(10m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, really, huh?

## Game News

(10m 48s) **Al:**

> All right, let's talk about the news first up as a

(10m 53s)

> alluded to in an earlier section of this podcast.

(10m 57s)

> Let's build a zoo have released their hats update it is out now and I think it's safe to say that it's kind of obvious what's in this update.

(11m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, so first off, they announced this update like over a year ago, I believe there's 2024. Yeah.

(11m 15s) **Al:**

> Oh, did it.

(11m 17s) **Kevin:**

> And I mean, like, okay, they're working on a new game. So obviously, like, let's build the zoo and get like front and center.

(11m 24s)

> But for hats, you know, I would expect it a little sooner, you know, that's just it. But, but it's, it's fine.

(11m 35s)

> I think it's really just that.

(11m 38s)

> There's a few other things, but you can put how there's a hat factory.

(11m 40s)

> You can make hats to sell or put them on your animals.

(11m 45s)

> And then your your capy bearer has a pirate hat or the lion with the bunny ears or the football helmet.

(11m 52s)

> Oh, there's some bro.

(11m 53s)

> There's a lot of hats.

(11m 56s) **Al:**

> Or your llama has antlers.

(12m 1s)

> Your bear can have a graduation cap.

(12m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Walrus with the gladiator helmet.

(12m 7s) **Al:**

> Hepo with a tall top hat.

(12m 10s) **Kevin:**

> That's a very tall top hat.

(12m 13s)

> Halo, Halo before the people think they're dead before they actually are dead.

(12m 22s)

> Um, yeah, it's all cosmetic and it's like, yeah.

(12m 25s) **Al:**

> Well, they've also added the screenshot tool that allows you to screenshot your entire zoo at once, which is a nice feature

(12m 31s) **Kevin:**

> which it, it is cool. It's a little

(12m 35s)

> hard to see, like, you know, just the screen shot. Like, there's a lot of detail in there, right? You have to really zoom into, to get the full view of the zoo. But man, that's such a nice zoo that uses an example. Why can't my zoo would be able to be that good? I still have to figure out to make it look nice, but yeah, screenshot the whole zoo. That is cool. And yeah, and then a few other decor for in honor of the new game. Let's build the dungeon.

(13m 6s)

> which is just, again, all day course stuff. So nothing really new mechanically. All, all cosmetic stuff. Some fixes, etc, etc. And hey, let's build the dungeon. They're working on that. I'm looking forward to that. I enjoy this game.

(13m 17s) **Al:**

> Next, we have Chronomon, which is a monster-catching farming game.

(13m 29s)

> They have announced that their 1.0 is coming soon.

(13m 34s) **Kevin:**

> I mean let me see which one this is this isn't the the Shawn young one it's what it is on

(13m 40s) **Al:**

> No. This is a different one. Presumably, time-based, because chrono, one.

(13m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(13m 48s)

> Yeah, yeah

(13m 48s) **Al:**

> It's gonna be some time mechanics.

(13m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I'm just rewatching the trail because I forgot like I remember the name, but I just don't remember the monsters are helping farm

(13m 58s)

> So the the the basic lit missed test has been passed in my opinion

(14m 1s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, what an original idea.

(14m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Look

(14m 5s)

> Look you think but a lot of people struggle with it for some reason

(14m 12s)

> Like I'm sorry, but oh

(14m 15s)

> I'm excited the mom. Yeah, it's pixel art. It's some of the monster designs themselves are fun. There's like a little goo guy

(14m 23s)

> I don't know, let's see

(14m 24s) **Al:**

> the the graphics feel kind of snaeze like because it doesn't it doesn't look GBA it doesn't look DS

(14m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Kind of

(14m 32s)

> No, no

(14m 33s) **Al:**

> it looks almost in between them and it feels kind of snazzy

(14m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, like, kind of like, uh, it feels like an earthbound almost with more colors, maybe, something about there.

(14m 42s) **Al:**

> yeah well yeah yeah it's definitely not nazzy it's more more colorful than

(14m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Oh, man, there's like skill trees. There's a lot in this.

(14m 56s)

> Okay, I'm excited. I will try this. Obviously, I have a penchant for monster collectors and farming and one where they can help

(15m 4s)

> farm. That's, that's all I ask for people. Do we give a date?

(15m 8s) **Al:**

> No, they don't have a specific date. It's just coming soon.

(15m 12s) **Kevin:**

> No, that means nothing. Yeah.

(15m 15s) **Al:**

> Very likely this year, and sooner rather than later, whatever that means.

(15m 23s) **Kevin:**

> they say, but we'll see eggs days, they confirmed Xbox is consular first console. They believe

(15m 31s)

> in the trailer, they said they're aiming for like all consoles, but Xbox is first, I guess.

(15m 36s)

> Yeah, and then there's stuff they're working on ahead, they want online multiplayer

(15m 38s) **Al:**

> which makes sense if you're using the Microsoft dev tools.

(15m 41s)

> It's very easy to then click the button.

(15m 51s) **Kevin:**

> co-op, and they said that one is very

(15m 53s)

> reasonable for money saying so that sounds very doable relationships we don't we we don't have to that it's really okay it's okay my dude we don't have to that one and then story expansions and map expansions because of course um okay yeah that sounds like a solid plan I'm excited I like

(16m 6s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(16m 21s)

> Next we have cattle country, the family life update is out now, um, marriage and kids has been added.

(16m 29s) **Kevin:**

> because we're cottage corn and we do that, we gotta always, okay, let's see, I will say it's,

(16m 32s) **Al:**

> Gotta gotta have it.

(16m 43s) **Kevin:**

> you'll usually see the marriage and then the kids later, so you know adding one that's nice I guess.

(16m 50s)

> I don't like, okay, so one thing I would say hey, it would be nice if you can do stuff with your spouse last child or whatever, right?

(16m 59s)

> And you can basically just command them and do, you know, pick crops, collect stuff or, or, or just wander, which is something I guess, but still feels a little weird because you're just commanding them.

(17m 14s)

> It's not exactly how you think.

(17m 15s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I feel like they could probably do it a little bit better, but I do like the idea of

(17m 21s)

> your marriage actually meaning something rather than just being, "Oh, this person now lives on

(17m 27s)

> your farm rather than on their house." And especially better than the Cordle Island we have.

(17m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(17m 35s) **Al:**

> They are now an empty husk of a person.

(17m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, do you think you think stardew? Well, we'll get a little better at that

(17m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, I never feel like stardew ruined a person when you married them and I kind of like

(17m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, for sure

(17m 54s) **Al:**

> how they kind of got a little area of your house and your farm. And the water, like they fill

(17m 57s) **Kevin:**

> You know what you're right. I forget about that part you expand and then like you get there. They get that little here. You're right

(18m 5s) **Al:**

> up the water of your pet, which is nice. I mean, a completely unimportant thing, right? It doesn't

(18m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(18m 10s)

> Yeah

(18m 11s) **Al:**

> actually change anything and before people get it, you know, obviously you should give

(18m 15s)

> water to your pets, I'm talking about in the game, people really get really get

(18m 20s)

> annoyed when I talk about this. But realistically, giving your pet water in the

(18m 24s)

> game makes no difference mechanically. So it's a nice little thing that you can

(18m 29s)

> kind of will world building thing that but not actually affecting the

(18m 32s)

> gameplay at all. But yeah, I mean, it would maybe nice if you could give them

(18m 37s)

> something to do like this.

(18m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but but you I'm okay. Well, I'm going back to cattle country. You're right. It is a step in the right direction at least, right?

(18m 45s)

> Okay. A little something after the marriage in this family. And I, I wonder if you can, like, if you have the child and the spouse, can you ask them both to do something that would be kind of cool actually.

(18m 57s) **Al:**

> I'm guessing.

(18m 59s) **Kevin:**

> That's the case. Yeah, you know, and that's that's pretty all right. Actually, at least just mechanically. Um, but, uh, but yeah.

(19m 8s)

> that um wait that they...

(19m 10s)

> at a tarot reading what does that how what does that what you know just going down the updates um

(19m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it might be like a lock based thing, like it's starchy when you can you can increase your

(19m 19s) **Kevin:**

> pumpkin carving yeah I just getting your fortune read yeah I guess so

(19m 23s) **Al:**

> lock or decrease your lock depending on something. Alright, next we have Firefly Village,

(19m 28s)

> the item stacking update. Can you guess what features in this update?

(19m 32s) **Kevin:**

> hahaha, is it maybe stacking items? Wow!

(19m 35s) **Al:**

> Correct. This was a thing that annoyed me about this game is the each item in your inventory

(19m 41s)

> could be one item, and it was so easy to fill up all of your storage.

(19m 46s)

> Imagine that, when they were younger, they played farming games with less quality of

(20m) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh.

(20m 6s) **Al:**

> life improvements. Then we have now. And now that they've played the quality of life improvement,

(20m 11s)

> they know that that was a huge quality of life improvement, and maybe there's a reason that

(20m 15s)

> Every farming game has it now.

(20m 17s) **Kevin:**

[Laughs]

(20m 17s) **Al:**

> I get it. I, I totally get it. Like some things I can see why you would argue like this is a feature. It's an important thing that I want to keep blah, blah, blah, but like come on, stack item stacking. Yeah, this was the right. This was the right.

(20m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Can you imagine?

(20m 32s)

> Can you imagine concerned ape, you know, years ago being like, why would you guys want more than two item inventory slots?

(20m 40s)

[Laughter]

(20m 44s) **Al:**

> Oh, I absolutely hated playing that harvest min game. I don't know whether I would have hated it if we'd played it at the first time, but like all

(20m 46s) **Kevin:**

[Laughter]

(20m 54s)

> Okay, well, good that stacking, you know, that's fine.

(20m 58s)

> Even as me, someone who has people have heard on the

(21m 2s)

> show and may hear again, complains about things changing, and what they once were, you know what's

(21m 8s)

> taken, that's a good one, you can have that. That's okay. Ah, the weird bugs.

(21m 12s) **Al:**

> They've also, because we always love a little weird bug fix, fixed an issue where players could sometimes slide unexpectedly during the start of date scenes in the grove.

(21m 24s) **Kevin:**

> That's good, that's good, I like that, that's a good one.

(21m 26s) **Al:**

> Guess they were a bit anxious.

(21m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Just eating yourself out of there, nope.

(21m 35s) **Al:**

> Yeah. So there we go. Another update from Firefly Village. There's quite a few small updates

(21m 46s)

> they've done since they released. So it's interesting. I'm definitely not going to go and

(21m 50s)

> play the game just for this update because it doesn't add anything if you're 100%.

(21m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Actually, let me transition off. I want to go back to

(21m 58s) **Al:**

> But you know, just making the game slightly better.

(22m 5s) **Kevin:**

> California. I skipped over some of those other updates. There's new farm layouts on my game. Did you

(22m 11s) **Al:**

> Oh, nice. I missed that.

(22m 11s) **Kevin:**

> see that? That's good. You can sit on stuff building upgrades. Okay. And I start. Yeah. Kind of

(22m 16s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah.

(22m 17s) **Kevin:**

> coming. That's good. Lots of little updates. Yeah.

(22m 18s) **Al:**

> I think more, I think more farming games need to do that.

(22m 20s)

> We, I think I talked about that a while ago.

(22m 22s)

> This might be the first time I've seen a game other than Stardew do the different

(22m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Mm. You're right. It is. It does. I agree. Like, mmm.

(22m 26s) **Al:**

> farm layouts and I don't understand why more haven't done it because that's

(22m 29s)

> a really good feature of Stardew.

(22m 31s)

> I love it makes it makes you want to replay it.

(22m 37s)

> Every time I reduce Stardew, I do a different farm layout because

(22m 41s)

> not done them all yet and it's interesting.

(22m 43s)

> It makes a different challenge and more, I like it.

(22m 46s)

> More games should do that, please.

(22m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, Firefly, you should do that too. Maybe I will play then. Maybe not.

(22m 52s) **Al:**

> I would, yeah.

(22m 53s)

> Yeah, if there was something, if something fundamental, I'd cry, because I mean,

(22m 56s)

> the game didn't take a humongous amount of time to finish.

(22m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, Dokod.

(22m 59s) **Al:**

> Next we have Sugar Jew Island.

(23m 1s)

> My favorite game ever sarcasm.

(23m 5s)

> They've released a Halloween costume DLC.

(23m 10s)

> so you can pay

(23m 11s)

> one dollar and get Halloween costume it's one costume

(23m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, just one.

(23m 20s) **Al:**

> Gothic outfit it's I mean it's Wednesday Adams, right? That's the outfit

(23m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(23m 25s)

> Yeah, oh yeah, it is, I just went there, hello.

(23m 29s) **Al:**

> So

(23m 29s) **Kevin:**

> There you go, game is saved.

(23m 33s) **Al:**

> The game is still bad

(23m 36s)

> This is bizarre. I don't okay. They yeah, whatever

(23m 42s)

> Do you want this is a bizarre game. This is a bizarre DLC added to a bizarre game

(23m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay, you know you said it, but I'm just I'm just thinking now of Adam's family farming game. That'd be sick

(23m 54s) **Al:**

> I think the best character to play as in that game would be things.

(23m 55s) **Kevin:**

> I'd love that that'd be awesome

(24m 3s)

> Yeah, you're super right. Oh, like I default to Uncle Fester, but no, I think is absolutely the one to go. Oh

(24m 12s) **Al:**

> But I also think just like thematically, he would make the most sense.

(24m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, because he does so much, you're

(24m 18s) **Al:**

> Does so much that like, why would, why would any of the others be like, you know,

(24m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(24m 24s) **Al:**

> tilling the land and like, come on, exactly. And, and, and Kevin, it would make it almost impossible.

(24m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, no thing is the one who gets gets stuff done in that family

(24m 30s)

> Sorry, Lurch, I'm sure you'd want to, but you're a little...

(24m 33s)

> a little sluggish there, buddy. Yes.

(24m 40s)

> I mean, I don't know how you could conceive of an Adam's family farming

(24m 48s)

> game and try to fit romance. I don't want to think about that, how you'd want.

(24m 52s) **Al:**

> You know they would try unless your character was thing.

(24m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Thank you. Yeah. Well, I mean, if they work cowards maybe.

(25m 3s)

> The... the...

(25m 4s) **Al:**

> But yeah, you know, it was all right.

(25m 6s)

> We've got the date and time for the wholesome snack

(25m 12s)

> in the 9th of December at 3 p.m. Eastern time

(25m 16s)

> in the US, 12 p.m. Pacific time,

(25m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Cool, a new harvest season episode has just been around.

(25m 20s) **Al:**

> which is 8 p.a. while yeah, 8 p.m. UTC.

(25m 29s)

> So there you go, a good time for me.

(25m 35s) **Kevin:**

> I hope there's good things in this thing.

(25m 39s) **Al:**

> I'm sure there will be. Is that a Saturday? It is a Tuesday. Oh, goodness.

(25m 44s)

> Oh, no, I'm going to have to do that thing. I did a few years ago where me and Cody watched it

(25m 53s)

> and recorded an episode straight away and then I edited it through the night and posted it the

(25m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Hm, you lunatic first. Oh my gosh, you're gonna do that. You crazy first. Can you at least delay? Okay, you know, no, do what you want. You know, the frantic energy

(25m 57s) **Al:**

> next day. Of course I'm going to do that. No, I'm not delaying the podcast. Are you mad?

(26m 8s) **Kevin:**

> But you know what now I take it back the the essays do at 9 a.m. Tomorrow at energy. That's it. That's a good energy to bring I

(26m 16s)

> Like it. I'm down with that

(26m 22s) **Al:**

> All right, I did to my list.

(26m 25s) **Kevin:**

> There we go

(26m 26s)

> I mean, we have to. It's our... Do we actually have to?

## New Games

(26m 34s) **Al:**

> All right, that's all of the game news.

(26m 35s) **Kevin:**

> We're tired of farmers in farming games, so let us replace it with this new game called the farmer

(26m 35s) **Al:**

> We also have a new game, which is the farm.

(26m 43s)

> The farmer was replaced.

(26m 44s) **Kevin:**

> game, which is a terrifying title, in my opinion.

(26m 49s) **Al:**

> Programming optimizer drone to automate a farm

(26m 52s)

> and watch it do the work for you.

(26m 54s)

> Collect resources to unlock better technology

(26m 56s)

> and become the world's most efficient farmer in the world.

(26m 59s)

> Improve your problem solving and coding skills

(27m 2s)

> and Kevin!

(27m 4s)

> Did somebody just make a game for me?

(27m 6s) **Kevin:**

> I think they did a holy miracle. I saw the premise. I didn't look at the thing, but all that is just coding. Wow. That's insane. I guess they did.

(27m 22s) **Al:**

> I don't know what to say!

(27m 22s) **Kevin:**

> It's not only is it like one of your favorite aspects automating and optimizing the farming, but it's actually your skill set.

(27m 36s)

> That is made directly for Al. That's incredible. Oh, man. Okay. It's all grid based and you're like farming everything. I do. This is wild. Oh, yeah. That's good. Yep. That's what I see.

(27m 48s) **Al:**

> I am very intrigued by this game and I will definitely need to try it out. It is out now.

(27m 57s)

> I presume it's $10 based on what I'm seeing.

(28m 2s)

> It looks like it... wait, no, no, no, no. I think it did an early access. Yeah, so early access came

(28m 8s)

> out in February 2023 and it's 1.0 came out in October, so yeah.

(28m 11s) **Kevin:**

> we missed it. Well there you go. We also know what was released last month. This game

(28m 19s) **Al:**

> Yes, that's a good point. I missed that off the list, isn't it? Yeah, cool.

(28m 25s) **Kevin:**

> code code and farm. That's our life. This game. That's fascinating. Are we here?

(28m 29s) **Al:**

> There we go. All right, Kevin. Shall we talk about Animal Crossing, New Horizons,

## ACNH Switch 2 Edition

(28m 40s) **Al:**

> Switch to Edition and 3.0 update?

(28m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay far okay before anything else because you know, we're gonna go over this trailer and go

(28m 49s)

> Chronologically we're just gonna kind of frame by from talk about it, but if

(28m 53s) **Al:**

> Maybe not frame by frame, but yeah.

(28m 54s) **Kevin:**

> what you don't be at yeah, yeah

(28m 57s)

> But I like the the the prelude how the last update said that was gonna be the last update

(29m 4s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, they don't mention this at all, right? But like, yeah, the last update, they were like,

(29m 6s) **Kevin:**

> and

(29m 10s) **Al:**

> this will be the last content update. And then it's now four years later, and they're obviously

(29m 15s)

> having trouble getting the new game done. So no, right. No. Okay. No, no, no. So here's, here's,

(29m 19s) **Kevin:**

> So they went that welcome amiibo route good stall for time

(29m 24s) **Al:**

> here's my theory. Here's my theory, Kevin. The next game is based on this game. Same engine,

(29m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Okay.

(29m 32s) **Al:**

> same graphics. Different sounds.

(29m 34s)

> We'll see if I'm writing.

(29m 36s)

> And they have kept as close as possible to the code when they're building the new game.

(29m 41s)

> So they could just copy and paste these features back into this game.

(29m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(29m 43s)

> Sure, okay, so this is their alpha their beta. Yeah

(29m 45s) **Al:**

> Give them self. Give them self more time.

(29m 49s)

> To get the new game out while giving us a bunch of stuff animal crossing wise.

(29m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(29m 53s)

> Okay, like what Pokemon does but they do it badly

(29m 59s)

> But yes, okay, I I get the logic. I buy it. Oh

(30m 2s) **Al:**

> We'll see if I'm right or not.

(30m 4s)

> But that's this is my theory.

(30m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I can see that yeah, okay

(30m 9s) **Al:**

> All right, so yeah, they are releasing a switch to edition and 3.0 update.

(30m 14s)

> Both of which are coming on the 15th of January next year.

(30m 18s)

> So this does not count as the for the update of the year in our game of the year episode this year.

(30m 24s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(30m 26s)

> No, but has it locked in for next year?

(30m 28s)

> Maybe.

(30m 29s) **Al:**

> You know, we'll see, we'll see.

(30m 32s)

> as Kevin said we're gonna go through

(30m 34s)

> the video and just talk about the things as they come up in the video. So I guess it starts

(30m 41s)

> off with the Switch 2 edition. Obviously Kevin presumably you don't care about buying this

(30m 43s) **Kevin:**

> which, sure, that makes sense.

(30m 50s) **Al:**

> one. [laughs]

(30m 51s) **Kevin:**

> I will not buy a Switch 2 for Animal Crossing Switch 2 edition.

(30m 57s)

> No, I would buy further games, but probably not this.

(31m 1s)

> Although, I don't think they talked about it on the video, or just mention it on the video,

(31m 5s)

> but $5 for the update.

(31m 7s)

> You know what?

(31m 8s)

> Hats off to them for that.

(31m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's not mentioned in the update, but yeah, it turns out it's $5, which is not bad not bad

(31m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Not the $30 breath of the wild update.

(31m 17s)

> of literally first switch game 30 bucks to play it again.

(31m 21s)

> And on your switch too, uh-huh.

(31m 23s) **Al:**

> Right so their first thing is enhanced revolution, enhanced resolution from improved graphics

(31m 30s) **Kevin:**

> which I did they even put in the work for that? Maybe not.

(31m 36s) **Al:**

> Yeah, who knows who knows what you know

(31m 38s)

> I actually I actually think they did this the wrong way right what they did is they show you the switch to footage and then put the switch footage next to it

(31m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(31m 44s) **Al:**

> I think they should have done the other way around because I kind of looked at it when oh

(31m 48s)

> Let's see how this improves because I thought we were looking at the old footage and then it shows them

(31m 53s)

> Which footage next time I go oh, no

(31m 58s)

> Because it's not like it's looked that looks bad, but like you're still seeing it some individual pixels and I'm like

(32m 3s)

> Okay, it's gonna look nicer then. No, no, this is the switch to version

(32m 10s)

> Because it does look much better next to it and you know, they've zoomed in so you're not really like noticing this if you're doing it

(32m 15s) **Kevin:**

> This is like the switch

(32m 19s)

> Screen shot is very very like it feels like it's on handheld mode because it's so bad like they try to

(32m 24s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks like you're seeing a 3DS to switch upgrade.

(32m 26s) **Kevin:**

> What's the opposite of optimizing me it is worse as possible to show the difference kids

(32m 33s)

> It looks so much like a 3DS for

(32m 39s)

> So I think they stretched it little I think they tried to make it as bad as possible

(32m 42s) **Al:**

> I love it. I love it. Yeah, yeah. So not not allowed to say about that. Good. Good high resins and great.

(32m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(32m 50s) **Al:**

> Joy can't do mouse controls.

(32m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, as someone who doesn't have a switch to have you ever use the mouse controls and anything ever

(32m 58s) **Al:**

> No

(33m) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's that's the answer. It's right

(33m) **Al:**

> but but

(33m 3s)

> But you know, I'm a handheld controller guy. I am not a sit at a table and play games kind of guy

(33m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(33m 9s) **Al:**

> So I'm realistically never gonna

(33m 12s)

> use mouse mode this was exactly why I was thinking when I was watching this is I'm not gonna do this right because yeah sure you can do it on your like sofa arm not gonna do that come on it's just annoying I get why they're doing this and I think that for some people it'll be really nice and when they shoot like they show you like you know grabbing a bunch of stuff and moving it all at once with the most mode it looks really nice but one I'm not gonna do that and two I would have to care about decorations to do that

(33m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(33m 42s)

> Yeah, yeah, there you go. That's exactly that's the the number one number two

(33m 47s)

> You know, just as a general thing

(33m 50s)

> Instead of doing like integrating into the joy chords or whatever. They should have just made and sold the different

(33m 56s)

> I think I would have preferred that just a separate mouse accessory

(34m)

> Or you know ideally connect your own mouse, but but I did it

(34m 3s) **Al:**

> You can yeah, you can use a USB mouse on your switch to

(34m 5s) **Kevin:**

> You can't oh never mind. Oh

(34m 8s)

> Oh, no. That's much better than okay. Well, well either

(34m 12s)

> but like is it and at least for this decorating application, I'm not like, you know, I'm not freaking out about it. So okay, it's fine

(34m 19s) **Al:**

> I definitely don't care. The other thing they show is using it for the art, the pixel art that you can do in the game.

(34m 24s) **Kevin:**

> That that's a little better, you know what? That's fine

(34m 27s) **Al:**

> Again, I get why people would do that. I'm not, I'm not doing that.

(34m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(34m 33s) **Al:**

> Actually, give me, I can't remember whether it has touch screen support for that. That's why I would prefer for that.

(34m 39s) **Kevin:**

> you're right you're super right about that um yeah that's I'm both I think it's cool and kind of

(34m 43s) **Al:**

> All right, the megaphone, the weirdest feature.

(34m 49s)

> Um, it is, yeah, it is cool, but also I'm never going to use it.

(34m 51s) **Kevin:**

> dumb so I don't know it's yeah that's correct

(34m 56s) **Al:**

> So like, you buy this megaphone, it's an item in the game.

(35m)

> And if you shout a villager's name at your console, then you, they'll shout back at you in the game and say, I'm over here.

(35m 8s)

> That's it. That's the entirety of this feature.

(35m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(35m 11s) **Al:**

> Like two things, two things. One, what an over complicated way to find out where your characters are.

(35m 18s)

> just in general, even if there was

(35m 19s)

> another way to know, really overcomplicated way to do it. Two. Two. You can see them on the map.

(35m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, are you who needs map icons? Oh, wait there on the map. I don't remember that are they?

(35m 28s) **Al:**

> They're on the map, I'm pretty sure.

(35m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, if they are well, that's hilarious. That's incredible. Oh

(35m 34s)

> Well, then in that case the only benefit is you you can just cuss out your neighbors finally

(35m 39s)

> Truthfully, they can hear yours.

(35m 41s)

> Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's incredible. That's pointless. Oh, that's great. Yeah.

(35m 42s) **Al:**

> So yeah, I double check so it shows you your list of villages at the left and when you go on to one of them

(35m 48s)

> It shows you where they are then

(35m 55s)

> I'm pretty sure that's how it works anyway. I I don't I

(35m 59s)

> Okay fine. I can see why this might be fun one or two times, but like it also feels so over complicated

(36m 8s)

> And the final Switch 2 edition feature is that.

(36m 12s)

> 12 player multiplayer game chat and the, you know, your camera floating heads thing.

(36m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Which is

(36m 18s)

> Like

(36m 20s)

> 12 is so much like and

(36m 23s) **Al:**

> Yes, 12 is so much, but also they all have to have Switch 2's.

(36m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's true. Oh my goodness, and like I

(36m 28s) **Al:**

> So you have to have, you have to have 11 friends who have Switch 2's.

(36m 33s)

> And animal crossing.

(36m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Just wish there was like

(36m 39s)

> The correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since I've played, but are there even

(36m 44s)

> to like newly fed many games, right? I just, because you know, and that's fine, the nature of the beast, that's always been that way. You know, Animal Crossing is primarily multiplayer has been primarily, hey, check out my stuff, or maybe I have different items in my shop, right? So, you know, like adding up to 12, it's cool, I don't know what the benefit is, and like you said, that's a lot of money to be spent to make that happen. But it's cool. And there's a lot of money to be spent to make that happen.

(37m 11s)

> but it's cool and there

(37m 14s)

> is the camera feature, look at each other's faces, I guess.

(37m 19s)

> The last thing I want is my case with people.

(37m 24s) **Al:**

> All right, so that's a switch to addition. They've confirmed it's coming on the 15th of January.

(37m 28s)

> There will be obviously the upgrade in the eShop, which is $5, or you can buy the physical switch to

(37m 35s)

> addition, which will work like all the other switch to additions. It has the switch game and the upgrade,

(37m 41s)

> and you can plug it into either. Next, we have the 3.0 update, which gives us some stuff.

## ACNH 3.0

(37m 48s) **Al:**

> So, first stop, it's for both switch and switch to, which is obviously nice.

(37m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Which super nice because they could lock all this blind switch to work something or make it paid or something, but they didn't good for them

(37m 54s) **Al:**

> They could. Yeah, well, that's the other thing. It's just an update. It's not a paid DLC. It's just a free update.

(38m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm. It's free

(38m 5s) **Al:**

> Coming the same day as the switch to addition, 15th of January. And the big feature

(38m 11s)

> is the resort hotel run by the Captain family.

(38m 16s) **Kevin:**

> They're back, baby, and that's cool. I'm excited by that. I like cappin and his family. It did a little girl has grown up. That's the doorable. I love that.

(38m 25s) **Al:**

> One thing I find really funny is they just like slap it on to the pier that captain has his bow on

(38m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. That is pretty funny. The pier just stretched out.

(38m 31s) **Al:**

> Okay

(38m 33s)

> fine

(38m 37s)

> I'm not sure I want a hotel like literally on the sea that feels dangerous to me

(38m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, from the most part, like, I mean, that, this is the thing out in the real world.

(38m 42s) **Al:**

> But I guess it is our pretty calm environment like I don't remember there being any storm

(38m 52s) **Kevin:**

> There are, there are definitely hotels hanging over the ocean, but, yeah, you know, that's fine.

(39m)

> I'm okay with it, but it's fine to be terrified.

(39m 1s) **Al:**

> So the point of this feature, the hotel is, well, it's basically a happy home designer, right?

(39m 3s) **Kevin:**

> That's understandable.

(39m 12s)

> it is it is just happy home designer yep yep and you can spend it yep like okay I'm not

(39m 15s) **Al:**

> You go in and there's either like, oh, we want to decorate this room in this theme and you

(39m 20s)

> go and decorate the room and then you get some currency and then people move in for temporarily.

(39m 29s) **Kevin:**

> wanting to complain about happy home designer because I love happy home designer but what is

(39m 38s)

> So odd to me, like, happy home designer was already at.

(39m 42s)

> In the game and the DLC, the paid one, but it's free now, which is cool.

(39m 47s)

> I'm just, uh, it's surprising me that I'd ever do that, but, but okay,

(39m 52s)

> how cool, make the thing you had behind paywall free and not like that.

(39m 57s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's all, I guess they kind of had to do it in this way where it was like a new version of it rather than just make the existing one free because they've obviously like sold it to lots of people and it would feel a little bit rubbish if you'd bought it and no, it's free.

(40m 12s)

> But yeah, interesting.

(40m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yep. Yep. Good.

(40m 16s) **Al:**

> I, I'm probably not going to do this much. I might try it once and then get bored because as I've mentioned, I'm not a big fan of the decorations.

(40m 25s)

> the possibly

(40m 27s)

> I might do it a couple of times so I can get some of the rewards, yeah.

(40m 30s) **Kevin:**

> the rewards and hey you know what like the well good it's a double-edged sword like for you it's a

(40m 39s)

> good thing the generally speaking unless they change it for this but happy home designer you can do

(40m 45s)

> you could just place like one thing call it a day maybe they'll have a list of like three items you

(40m 49s)

> have to put but you don't actually have to decorate the room so yeah but uh

(40m 55s) **Al:**

> And and the rewards the amount of currency you get and how much they cost seems not bad like you see them getting 200 of these tokens and things are costing like between 10 and 50 so it sounds like you could get like a you know decent amount without doing a humongous amount of work.

(41m 2s) **Kevin:**

> - Mm-hmm, yep.

(41m 16s)

> - Mm-hmm.

(41m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yes, yeah.

(41m 16s) **Kevin:**

> - No.

(41m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's a good point. So yeah, you can use a memo to summon villagers which I guess is cool because if you really care about some characters but you've already got your island fill you can interact with them in a different way rather than because obviously you could bring them to your campsite before but that feels presumably that that's just one night the campsite isn't it and they just kind of sit in the tent the whole time.

(41m 42s) **Kevin:**

> yeah yeah yeah well can't they move from the camps I don't remember or can they do that to

(41m 52s) **Al:**

> I don't think they can.

(41m 54s) **Kevin:**

> DLC maybe they can't I just I genuinely don't remember

(41m 56s) **Al:**

> I honestly don't think they can because I remember always going into the tent talk to them.

(42m 3s)

> Whereas they do hear, they go out and we see them talking to the villagers out and about.

(42m 11s) **Kevin:**

> But you definitely could because wasn't that a big part of the initial release back when everyone was spending

(42m 18s)

> real world money on getting raim into whatever?

(42m 22s) **Al:**

> what do you mean? Oh, move into your town. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But when they're wet,

(42m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Like to move into your town, I'm talking about.

(42m 26s)

> Yes. Sorry. I wasn't clear. Yes.

(42m 27s) **Al:**

> but you had, so what, what happened is you, you would summon them to the campsite

(42m 31s)

> and then you would go into the tent and you would talk to them and you'd have a random chance

(42m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(42m 37s) **Al:**

> of them agreeing to come and stay in your village, but they don't venture out of the tent while

(42m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, yeah, you're right.

(42m 43s) **Al:**

> they're there. I'm pretty sure correct me from wrong listeners, but I'm pretty sure they stay

(42m 47s) **Kevin:**

> No, I believe you're right.

(42m 48s) **Al:**

> in the 10th of the whole time. What is here, they are going out.

(42m 52s)

> the hotel and they are venturing around the island, which fuels much, we are going to talk about this later obviously, but one of the big problems that we have had with this game is that it fuels much less like people have agency and are doing things.

(43m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(43m 10s) **Al:**

> And the campsite felt like a big thing. Part of that, they would come and sit in their tent front of the day.

(43m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(43m 17s) **Al:**

> whereas they're actually coming to this hotel and going around the island actually feels like their day

(43m 22s)

> on holiday, rather than just there because you want to see them.

(43m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, it's true.

(43m 25s)

> All right, it's true.

(43m 28s)

> OK, that's good, you're right.

(43m 31s)

> I wonder if that works for the special characters,

(43m 34s)

> like the shop keeps or whatever.

(43m 36s)

> I'm going to guess no, but it'd be interesting.

(43m 40s) **Al:**

> there's also there's also special crafting that you can you can get so they will ask for specific

(43m 40s) **Kevin:**

> OK, well, hey, that's it.

(43m 42s)

> That's the hotel.

(43m 44s)

> Well, not nearly.

(43m 44s)

> No, there's more.

(43m 53s) **Al:**

> things and then it will give you a new crafting recipe I think is how it works

(43m 57s)

> or is it oh no it's not it's not it's yes yeah it's it's asking you to craft a certain

(43m 57s) **Kevin:**

> It's for expanding the hotels, suppose it gives you tickets.

(44m 5s) **Al:**

> number of an item and they'll give you the tickets so it means you can get the special stuff from

(44m 10s)

> tell without designing the rooms and I like that the other thing we note it the other thing

(44m 11s) **Kevin:**

> There you go that is good that not way to get the stuff that you're right that is great

(44m 20s) **Al:**

> I noticed or some people noticed and I saw their comments about it is that in this section they

(44m 26s)

> very quietly just mention sure on the UI that you've got multi crafting bulk crafting now wow

(44m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, nope. Okay. Okay. Look, I'm this is a stretch

(44m 34s) **Al:**

> There you go!

(44m 37s) **Kevin:**

> I don't want to be a day to be down here, but it would be the most

(44m 41s)

> Nintendo slash animal crossing thing ever if you could only multi craft on the target items

(44m 48s) **Al:**

> I would hate it.

(44m 50s)

> I can't or imagine, I can't, I can't imagine them actually.

(44m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Love it just doesn't be wild

(44m 56s)

> Look you'd think but they have gone out of their way to do especially in this game

(45m 2s)

> To do some like just unfathomable nonsense. Well, I just not forget. This is the game where they introduced the feature to

(45m 12s)

> Just transfer, you know when you go to those islands on those random islands

(45m 17s)

> You could store stuff, but only at harves Island

(45m 23s) **Al:**

> Kevin, I hate that you brought this into the world.

(45m 25s)

> So let's just assume that you're wrong

(45m 27s)

> and multi-crafting just exists.

(45m 29s) **Kevin:**

> I'm not a man of festive. (laughs)

(45m 32s)

> Ah, I'm... okay. (laughs)

(45m 34s) **Al:**

> Anyway, cool, you can do this.

(45m 36s)

> You can get the tickets without designing

(45m 37s)

> the building, the rooms.

(45m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Ignoring me. Cool. (laughs)

(45m 43s) **Al:**

> It's quite fine 'cause what it seems like

(45m 45s)

> Captain has like orders to deliver these things to people.

(45m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(45m 48s) **Al:**

> And so you go and you craft it

(45m 49s)

> and you're essentially giving them to Captain to go in

(45m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

(45m 51s) **Al:**

> deliver and you get some tokens.

(45m 53s)

> It's an exchange for that. It's a fun little additional thing.

(45m 54s) **Kevin:**

> I like cabin. Yep, yep.

(45m 57s)

> storge almost doubled that that's a good that's a good one

(45m 57s) **Al:**

> Yes, so yes, I agree with that, but here's my question. Why almost doubled?

(46m 2s) **Kevin:**

> any animal causing game. [laughs]

(46m 7s) **Al:**

> Why does it go from 5,000 to 9,000? Why?

(46m 11s) **Kevin:**

> They didn't have the game doesn't have enough storage, don't you know, well?

(46m 14s) **Al:**

> No, no, let's not do that. Let's not do that. That's not how these things work anymore, right?

(46m 19s) **Kevin:**

> There's physically not enough bits in the switch to cart to handle, don't they?

(46m 20s) **Al:**

> They would...

(46m 24s)

> That's not how this works.

(46m 28s)

> 9,000 is not a special number that they use some stupid way of storing how much they have

(46m 33s) **Kevin:**

[laughter]

(46m 35s) **Al:**

> and that they can't do more than 9,000. That's not how this works.

(46m 38s)

> Just give us 10,000 already.

(46m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you're right.

(46m 42s) **Al:**

> Or better yet, give us infinite.

(46m 43s) **Kevin:**

> You're right.

(46m 45s) **Al:**

> Theoretically infinite.

(46m 47s) **Kevin:**

> You're right, actually.

(46m 48s)

> Yeah, but you're well.

(46m 50s)

> Let's not forget one of the earliest updates

(46m 53s)

> in New Horizons specifically.

(46m 55s)

> It was nerfing the turnip market in the single player

(46m 59s)

[laughs]

(47m 3s)

[laughs]

(47m 6s)

> Oh, yeah.

(47m 7s) **Al:**

> But also, in storage, you can now store trees and shrubs and flowers.

(47m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Plants?

(47m 12s)

> You know what? That's a great one. I like that.

(47m 14s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but you're going to fill your entire storage with trees and shrubs and flowers.

(47m 19s) **Kevin:**

> I guess, 'cause I mean, I don't see the introduced flowers dying, so that means infinite flowers keep popular things, so yeah.

(47m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, especially with the next feature, which is

(47m 29s)

> Rosetti

(47m 30s) **Kevin:**

> - Risk setting!

(47m 31s) **Al:**

> Which by the way, I have only ever heard people call them Rosetti before I didn't realize it was

(47m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(47m 36s) **Al:**

> Rosetti as in like reset, but that makes sense. I just like I heard them talk about it in the video

(47m 42s)

> So Rosetti I really like what they've done with him here he resets areas

(47m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yep. That.

(47m 48s) **Al:**

> That's quite cool

(47m 50s)

> So you can basically say I would like you to clear an area

(47m 55s)

> The options you've got are

(47m 57s)

> I'll pick the area so you can like choose an area that he will take everything and put it into your storage

(48m 3s)

> You can say just the beach so you can be like oh

(48m 7s)

> That's a really nice feature. You can be like I'm bored of grabbing things from the beach every day

(48m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm

(48m 11s) **Al:**

> I'll just go get Rosetti to do instead or you can get the entire island. You can get recetti to reset your island

(48m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yep

(48m 21s)

> yep. Yep. Yeah. That's, it's pretty cool. Um, that extra 4000 storage can be good for

(48m 21s) **Al:**

> and pick everything up and put it all in your storage, including fl--

(48m 25s)

> flowers. This is mad.

(48m 34s) **Kevin:**

> this. It's good. Uh, that that is a great feature. Andrew said he like he hasn't been

(48m 39s)

> able to, you know, do his reset thing in a while. So good, good for, good for them for

(48m 44s)

> giving us in. Uh, my only small asterisk, I'm upset they, he's still nerfed. Um, he's not named

(48m 51s)

> angry boy. Um, I guess so, but it was really funny to see how mad he got. I liked the

(48m 52s) **Al:**

> Well, no, I think this is nice to get to do something positive for one.

(49m)

> also really nice is if you ask him to cover an idea that has flowers he will ask you whether

(49m 6s)

> he want you want to keep the flowers or get rid of them which might solve the infinite flower problem

(49m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Oh my gosh you're right. Oh, I didn't think about that. That's good

(49m 18s) **Al:**

> throw all my flowers in the bin please Rosetti

(49m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, does dawn show up? Where are you dawn? He has a brother

(49m 23s) **Al:**

> oh no anyway

(49m 30s)

> nice I love this I love this feature this is a great feature speaking of things that they're doing

(49m 35s)

> after i've already spent all the time to clear my island and do an interesting thing with my island

(49m 42s)

> they've added slumber island which is basically exactly it's creative mode I love that they've done

(49m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Creative mode, it is

(49m 51s) **Al:**

> this I also hate that they took so long to do this because how many times have I reset my island to

(49m 57s)

> to do something interesting and then I've been like,

(49m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(50m) **Al:**

> I want whereas I could have done it in the dream world, I could have done it with my slumber islands,

(50m 5s)

> I could have done them all at the same time because you get three save files which is fantastic.

(50m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(50m 12s) **Al:**

> So two things about this just in general, one, this is their way of being able to give you multiple

(50m 17s)

> islands per switch, right? Very clever, right? Good idea. Go for it.

(50m 18s) **Kevin:**

> No

(50m 20s)

> Well, I'll actually question about this because because maybe I'm a little into it, but can you build a house on this island?

(50m 28s) **Al:**

> So, I don't think--

(50m 30s)

> You can run it like a normal island. It is essentially creative mode. You can build--there is a house. You can build buildings, but I don't know if you can live in that.

(50m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Yeah, cuz

(50m 38s)

> No

(50m 41s)

> Enter and decorate it. Yeah

(50m 43s) **Al:**

> Well, I think you can go in and decorate it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(50m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Can you you're okay? Let it I'll be watching the trailer by

(50m 48s)

> Okay, always go ahead can see talking.

(50m 51s) **Al:**

> Because the whole point is it's creative mode, right? So, it's like do everything you can normally do in the island, but without limitations, right?

(51m)

> It comes from a menu rather than having to craft them or buy them. So, I would be weird if you couldn't go in and design.

(51m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know cuz I I'm looking at this section like and I just don't see like them actually going inside a house

(51m 16s) **Al:**

> I know that up at the house is there. Why would they have the house if you couldn't go in the house? What would be the point?

(51m 20s) **Kevin:**

> I that's like I'm thinking it might just be decorative or the mental basically

(51m 24s) **Al:**

> No. No, there's no way.

(51m 27s) **Kevin:**

> I'm gonna say I don't see you going into a house. That's all I'm saying, but okay, we'll see

(51m 31s) **Al:**

> I would be so shocked.

(51m 34s) **Kevin:**

> like not even just a house like I think maybe you can introduce

(51m 38s)

> villagers and that might be a villagers house like you know neighbors they're the animals you have your house

(51m 42s) **Al:**

> Sure, but you'd still be able to go in there.

(51m 45s)

> I don't think it matters, right?

(51m 47s)

> What is your house compared to other people's faces?

(51m 49s) **Kevin:**

> well I mean you get bigger more rooms and you can decorate it or whatever right like we don't know

(51m 52s) **Al:**

> Sure, but it's creative mode.

(51m 53s)

> You can just add more houses.

(51m 54s) **Kevin:**

> okay all right we'll see we'll see uh

(51m 57s) **Al:**

> You're right, there are still questions.

(51m 59s)

> You're right, absolutely right.

(52m 2s)

> Okay, yeah, so as you pointed out,

(52m 4s)

> you can bring your islanders, which is cool.

(52m 7s)

> I don't wanna think about the lore there.

(52m 10s) **Kevin:**

> It's you're just dreaming about your neighbors that's all there you go

(52m 13s) **Al:**

> Okay, sure, let's go with that.

(52m 16s)

> You can add, there are three different island sizes.

(52m 18s)

> It looks like the largest one is just the standard island size,

(52m 21s)

> I think, but it's hard to know from just what

(52m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, it is, but that is kind of fun. Different. I don't know, that's pretty cool.

(52m 30s) **Al:**

> What I really like as well is the co-op terraforming, right?

(52m 34s)

> So you can still invite your friends over to this island and they can all terraform.

(52m 38s) **Kevin:**

> That's, you know what? You know what? That's actually, I talked to complain about like,

(52m 43s)

> you know, is there enough to do with the multivolt. This, this is which enough for 12 people.

(52m 48s)

> That that is a cool thing. And honestly, I'm kind of surprised like that. This feels like they

(52m 51s)

> they want an extra step.

(52m 53s)

> to have online co-op for creative mode.

(52m 57s)

> So that is cool.

(52m 57s) **Al:**

> I mean, this just sounds madness, right? Like it sounds like chaos.

(52m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(53m 1s)

> I know. I love it. It's great. I can't wait.

(53m 4s) **Al:**

> The other thing as well, in this section we notice, there is sidestepping and back and forward

(53m 11s)

> stepping, which is mostly useful for terraforming, where, you know, how many times have you done

(53m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

(53m 17s) **Al:**

> the terraforming and you've like had to run backwards and then turn around and you accidentally

(53m 21s)

> face the wrong direction and you terraform the wrong bit, whereas this you can like just

(53m 25s)

> backstep and keep going.

(53m 27s)

> And I'm intrigued as to how like what the control is going to be, like how you're going to

(53m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Look forward to the harvest season dream island adventure where Aubrey Os hops on and we we've been open island and and fight

(53m 55s) **Al:**

> I love how like there are so many of these little features that they just kind of show in passing in the thing because they know they don't need to point out. They know that people will notice it.

(54m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(54m 9s)

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's cover because that way they don't have to admit they should it should have been there in the first place

(54m 10s) **Al:**

> You know, the multi crafting and the side stepping and the most, you know, these sorts of things is very fun.

(54m 21s)

> Yeah, that's a good point, it's a good point.

(54m 25s)

> I'm intrigued to see what that that will be like fun.

(54m 29s) **Kevin:**

> You know what else is fun?

(54m 30s) **Al:**

> There's a few other things.

(54m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Nintendo gaming is fun.

(54m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so we've got some collaborations and new start, new items. First stop.

(54m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Finally, Nintendo cross animal crossing.

(54m 42s)

[laughing]

(54m 44s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, they called this section collaboration, various collaborations, right? It's not me that made that up. You can, well, to be fair, they did originally, you could buy a switch.

(54m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(54m 55s) **Al:**

> For you for your house, but you can now also buy a switch to a Famicom, a NAS, a Famicom disk system, a Gameboy, a Super Famicom and presumably more, but they don't show any more in the video.

(55m 6s) **Kevin:**

> and maybe others

(55m 10s)

> Nope, oh my gosh

(55m 11s) **Al:**

> I'd be surprised if they didn't have all the standard Nintendo consoles.

(55m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, okay, all right, you know hold that thought hold that thought

(55m 16s) **Al:**

> Wait a minute, wait a way to wait a minute. Did you just notice why I noticed?

(55m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Well, I don't know what you notice but

(55m 23s)

> Okay, let me say okay, first of all so it's not just the consoles you can actually play emulators on them, right?

(55m 29s) **Al:**

> That's what I just noticed. How did I not, how did I not notice that till this moment that you can play, you can play some games from these consoles?

(55m 31s) **Kevin:**

> You know, yeah, you didn't notice that. Oh my goodness. Oh

(55m 37s)

> Yes, which is not unheard of the original animal crossing had this feature

(55m 42s) **Al:**

> Did it? There's, but what, okay, is it, you can play ice climber, you can play Doctor Mario?

(55m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yes

(55m 44s)

> The exact same thing you get the consoles and you can play the games

(55m 49s)

> Yeah, you can play a bunch of games

(55m 52s)

> Yeah, you could play Wario Woods or Wario. Oh, yeah, really it's something like you're worried as woods

(55m 56s)

> I think there was a bunch of games in the original animal crossing

(56m) **Al:**

> you think you'll have multiplayer for Dr. Murray.

(56m 2s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know about that, but okay, but here's the thing

(56m 6s)

> All right, let's tie this together. Oh, what did we just say? We see we up to super family comment nothing after that, right?

(56m 14s)

> You just said and I agree they're gonna have all the standard consoles, right?

(56m 15s) **Al:**

> No game by

(56m 19s)

> How far are they gonna go with with ma with games?

(56m 19s) **Kevin:**

> What game

(56m 21s)

> What game are they gonna emulate on on the GameCube, Calvin or oh my god? I just called you Calvin my brother

(56m 25s) **Al:**

> Oh no, I'm not Calvin, but yeah, and no they wouldn't surely they wouldn't

(56m 29s) **Kevin:**

> This is discussion

(56m 32s)

> No, they wouldn't but I'm gonna put the idea. What if we could

(56m 34s) **Al:**

> I'll be amazing

(56m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Emulate the original animal crossing in our animal crossing

(56m 43s) **Al:**

> Amazing

(56m 44s) **Kevin:**

> That'd be incredible. It's not gonna happen. In fact, I don't think those games. I don't think the 64 will emulate like I think

(56m 46s) **Al:**

> No

(56m 49s)

> No, I think you're right. I think I think oh just yeah, yeah, I don't think they'll go as far as that

(56m 54s) **Kevin:**

> I think they'll be in there purely ornamental, but yeah, there's no one earth. We're gonna get a 64 game

(57m)

> Emulating on this thing

(57m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think it might just be the NES, maybe the SNES.

(57m 5s)

> I think it might even just be the NES though.

(57m 7s) **Kevin:**

> We might get a game boy

(57m 9s) **Al:**

> Maybe, but also like, a lot of Game by Games

(57m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Something simple

(57m 12s) **Al:**

> were just like NES games, but on handheld, right?

(57m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(57m 16s) **Al:**

> I don't know.

(57m 18s)

> Look, if this is how we get Pokemon Red on Switch.

(57m 24s) **Kevin:**

> This is the way

(57m 26s) **Al:**

> I'm all for it.

(57m 27s)

[laughing]

(57m 31s) **Kevin:**

> The 4.0 update includes connect connectivity to the Pokemon home

(57m 35s) **Al:**

> you know that's where people would be asking for it as well

(57m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(57m 41s) **Al:**

> I want my Animal Crossing Charizard to be able to go into Pokemon Home

(57m 41s) **Kevin:**

> My goodness

(57m 48s)

> Okay

(57m 50s)

> So there are certain online communities of of games like a more traditional games like I think Shogi is one of them

(57m 58s)

> Where they don't have like a de facto online simulator, whatever

(58m 2s) **Al:**

> Ah. Okay. Yeah.

(58m 2s) **Kevin:**

> So a lot of people actually default to Final Fantasy 14

(58m 6s)

> because Final Fantasy 14 has an arcade essentially section area

(58m 12s)

> With many games including like real games like Chewy and stuff like that

(58m 16s)

> And so there's there's like weird niche groups playing Final Fantasy 14 just to play the simulators and emulators

(58m 21s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(58m 23s)

> - Why am I not surprised?

(58m 23s) **Kevin:**

> I want that to happen in animal crossing

(58m 25s) **Al:**

> That's amazing.

(58m 27s)

> - Yeah, fantastic.

(58m 30s)

> All right, more collaborations.

(58m 30s) **Kevin:**

> All right

(58m 34s) **Al:**

> We've got Lego, Lego furniture.

(58m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Lego!

(58m 36s)

> Okay.

(58m 37s)

> So, when I heard Lego furniture, I just assumed I meant block furniture, like yeah, sure.

(58m 41s) **Al:**

> No, Lego, yeah.

(58m 42s) **Kevin:**

> But then I saw, like, no, that is Lego copyright R, not TM, but Lego brand.

(58m 46s) **Al:**

> So, yeah.

(58m 49s)

> So, and I feel like this.

(58m 51s)

> So, this goes further than I think I first initially realized, right?

(58m 54s)

> So, there's some Lego clothes, there's things like a sofa, an a table, and a partition.

(58m 59s) **Kevin:**

> a full room. There's a flower. That's pretty cool. There's a Lego. It's a world you

(59m) **Al:**

> There is also a bed, which is cool, and there's a DIY workbench.

(59m 7s)

> You can make a Lego workbench, and there's an arcade game.

(59m 12s)

> I wonder if that'll have it.

(59m 13s)

> Well, that have a game that you can play in it, like these new ones.

(59m 19s) **Kevin:**

> never known now. Who knows? Oh, yeah.

(59m 21s) **Al:**

> The game does show space invaders on the screen.

(59m 24s)

> I don't know, look, I wouldn't, at this point, I wouldn't bet against being able to play space invaders on the Lego arcade car.

(59m 29s) **Kevin:**

> You know what? You're, you're right. You're not wrong. I wouldn't put a pass. I wouldn't be

(59m 33s) **Al:**

> In fact, oh wait, no, oh no, I just realized what's going to happen.

(59m 37s)

> So, you know how they do this thing, where they have some furniture that has like, you know, eight different versions of it.

(59m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that'd be cool. Yeah. They are right. You're super right. And we already

(59m 44s) **Al:**

> And though just every day it'll be a different one, there's going to be a whole load of these Lego arcade games

(59m 55s) **Kevin:**

> see that there's at least one or two variants of the Lego furniture at least the pink and those

(1h) **Al:**

> the workbench looks really cool and I'm hoping it's like actual functional in the game like

(1h 1s) **Kevin:**

> like a brown one. Yeah. You're right. Um, that'll be interesting to see.

(1h 12s)

> Oh, and for sure is, it has to be, it's the DS, DIY workbench, it looks like the other one, it's going to be fun.

(1h 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well exactly. The partition is so funny because it's literally just some blocks of leg or

(1h 25s) **Kevin:**

> I like the flower pot, like it's, you know, it's like an actual like Lego like one of the set you'd build. That's fun.

(1h 30s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(1h 34s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, the partition is funny.

(1h 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, these all look like things you could actually build with pieces. I'm pretty sure you could and I'm gonna

(1h 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure.

(1h 38s) **Al:**

> See you're gonna see people on doing it online. I'll be surprised if someone hasn't already done all these one

(1h 42s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah, it's a good point. All that'll be cool. That'll be cool to see.

(1h 45s) **Al:**

> And then the clothes look pretty generic it generically Lego clothes, but wherever, you know each to their own

(1h 48s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and then it's the slap the logo on. Well, each

(1h 55s)

> here's to my own. I like Zelda, and I like this breath a while and tears the kingdom and and now we put it in my animal crossing. So I like that.

(1h 1m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's very cool. So you've got again some furniture. You've got some essentially cosplay. You've got you can dress up as link or Zelda

(1h 1m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yup, yup, here's the kingdom Zalva.

(1h 1m 20s)

> The two, the two.

(1h 1m 20s) **Al:**

> And the furniture seems to be pretty

(1h 1m 24s)

> You know

(1h 1m 25s)

> Quite a lot of it and it's it's really nice looking. There's also

(1h 1m 29s) **Kevin:**

> one complaint is it's it's one of those sets that's not actually like a furniture set. There's not a bed. It's like, it's just decorative stuff, which isn't bad because you can use that on the outside. You can have, you know, you're broken down guardian outside. That's cool. But like, you know, it'd be nice to have a bed.

(1h 1m 36s) **Al:**

> It's just decoration stuff. Yeah.

(1h 1m 42s)

> Yeah.

(1h 1m 53s)

> There's also a wand, which is in the style of Zelda, and it makes the little interface that

(1h 1m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like that.

(1h 1m 59s) **Al:**

> comes up when you change your outfit. It makes it Zelda-e, which is very cool.

(1h 2m 6s)

> You've got your gems and heart containers and stuff like that. Yeah.

(1h 2m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Rupies that flowers all the likes the master sword. Oh, all your stuff. It's all. Oh,

(1h 2m 15s) **Al:**

> It's very cool. But then you also have two new characters,

(1h 2m 16s) **Kevin:**

> the acarina's there.

(1h 2m 20s)

> That school, I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get

(1h 2m 21s) **Al:**

> "Minera Antulin"

(1h 2m 27s) **Kevin:**

> on the other characters, like Epona and Ganon. But I'm not joking.

(1h 2m 28s) **Al:**

> So well, I mean, I know you're joking, but just to make a point, they had to they had to use characters that still use the like base model animal models, right?

(1h 2m 40s)

> Like they couldn't get who was Ganon who was Ganon going to be what which of the standard villager types was he going to be.

(1h 2m 41s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, no, those dang.

(1h 2m 44s)

> No, ow, ow, those characters were already a new leaf.

(1h 2m 46s) **Al:**

> Were they?

(1h 2m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, they had Zelda cross silver characters.

(1h 2m 49s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1h 2m 52s) **Kevin:**

> I wasn't joking.

(1h 2m 53s)

> They had Ganon was a pig.

(1h 2m 56s) **Al:**

> Are there even pigs in new horizons?

(1h 2m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yeah.

(1h 2m 58s) **Al:**

> Oh, I don't remember the pigs. Okay, fair enough.

(1h 3m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, they're pigs, yeah.

(1h 3m 2s)

> No, the Epona wolf link, Ganon,

(1h 3m 5s)

> I can't remember who else,

(1h 3m 6s)

> but there were previous Zelda crossover characters

(1h 3m 9s)

> And they're not returning.

(1h 3m 11s)

> That's a Monero and Tulen are fun picks for the new ones.

(1h 3m 16s)

> I'm not complaining about them, they look great, although Monero is even as little goggles

(1h 3m 21s)

> on her head, but I do limit the loss of the other ones.

(1h 3m 27s) **Al:**

> And then we have Splatoon, which again has furniture and cosplay, and also brings CC and VJ, who are-

(1h 3m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, ma-

(1h 3m 35s)

> Okay, so, well, CC and V each are actually returning characters.

(1h 3m 39s) **Al:**

> Oh, are they?

(1h 3m 39s) **Kevin:**

> They were also in new leaf, but they were cosplaying the squid sisters, the difference

(1h 3m 42s) **Al:**

> Okay.

(1h 3m 46s)

> Yes. Yeah.

(1h 3m 46s) **Kevin:**

> between characters basically.

(1h 3m 48s)

> This time they're, they're, I forget their name, the new one, the new band.

(1h 3m 52s) **Al:**

> Oh, I can't remember their names either, but-

(1h 3m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah, I can't wrap them in, but yeah, they're just, it's fun because their cosplayers

(1h 3m 57s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(1h 3m 57s) **Kevin:**

> basically and now they're cosplaying the other, the new, the new idols.

(1h 4m 2s)

> The furniture set is nice because there are...

(1h 4m 5s)

> at least a sofa.

(1h 4m 7s)

> I don't know if I see a bed, but there is a sofa and a tape where they might be a generic table.

(1h 4m 12s)

> But there's a lot of furniture items, like clothes and stuff like that.

(1h 4m 18s)

> Because they introduce shoes and hats from the Splatoon series, so there's a lot you can hang.

(1h 4m 24s)

> The crab bot is pretty cool.

(1h 4m 26s)

> The television looks nice.

(1h 4m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. So I think that's pretty much it. That's, I mean, there's a lot of a lot

(1h 4m 28s) **Kevin:**

> I like it.

(1h 4m 29s)

> There's a jukebox that I think.

(1h 4m 31s)

> Squid jukebox.

(1h 4m 33s)

> soon. Yeah.

(1h 4m 38s) **Al:**

> of extra content. I did see one thing where someone online was claiming that the crafting

(1h 4m 43s)

> no use is your storage as well as what you have on you, but I've not actually seen any evidence

(1h 4m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I heard that I

(1h 4m 48s) **Al:**

> of that, but that would be nice if that was the case.

(1h 4m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Don't

(1h 4m 50s)

> Yeah, I'm I also forgot that they didn't add that in already. Yeah

(1h 4m 56s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well, yeah. Okay. So now that we've gone everything in detail, Kevin, what are your thoughts?

(1h 5m 3s) **Kevin:**

> I hate it. No. Okay. So. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. The update on that song, what it actually

(1h 5m 6s) **Al:**

> Well, well, okay. So I, I mean, I guess by that, I mean, it's not solving the core issues you have

(1h 5m 18s) **Kevin:**

> was presented. I think it's cool. It's all good stuff. I like happy on designer, so the hotel is

(1h 5m 23s)

> nice. I like that bit. The crossover stuff on the sucker for that, I love it. The creative mode,

(1h 5m 30s)

> I'm not as big on it.

(1h 5m 33s)

> But it's a big sell for the game and a lot of people do like it, so I'd recognize that as a cool thing to add, especially like the multiplayer thing, that might be cool to do an island with your friends.

(1h 5m 43s)

> So, you know, the update is good, but you're right, it doesn't add the things I want to solve or fix the game.

(1h 5m 55s)

> Well, the fix says if they were broken, to change the game how I want it to be, let's say that. Right.

(1h 6m 1s)

> Are the neighbors going to be...

(1h 6m 3s)

> a little more interactive. I mean, maybe sometimes they add a lot of stealth updates and these things. So, you know, maybe there's more dialogue.

(1h 6m 9s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, we already know that the stuff that they've not talked about, right?

(1h 6m 12s)

> Like the about grafting and the strafing and stuff like that.

(1h 6m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.

(1h 6m 15s) **Al:**

> They didn't talk about it.

(1h 6m 16s)

> They just showed it.

(1h 6m 17s)

> So there's no way that there is other stuff that they've not talked about.

(1h 6m 21s)

> I don't think it will be completely overhauling how the villages live and talk,

(1h 6m 25s) **Kevin:**

> No. No. If they at least add dialogue, I'd probably...

(1h 6m 33s)

> I'd probably want a significant amount, but at least some dialogue, more dialogue options for the villagers. That would be nice.

(1h 6m 41s)

> Yeah. Like, I mean, overall, like it's direction of the game, it's not going to change or whatever, so I'm still going to have issues.

(1h 6m 48s)

> But we'll see. Like I said, what is actually here is nice. Is it going to fix the game for me? I don't know, probably not.

(1h 6m 56s)

> Okay. So, one thing that's not clear to me, like some people say there are, but...

(1h 7m 3s)

> And they're probably will, but I just haven't seen it highlighted. Are they going to be adding more base furniture, you know, just regular furniture, not the colab or the hotel stuff, right?

(1h 7m 14s)

> And I say that because one of the other big issues I had with the game was a lot of the aesthetics of the game became a lot more grounded.

(1h 7m 24s)

> Like, are you feeling out of the Robo Series, the, of furniture, the Robo Series furniture from previous? Okay.

(1h 7m 33s)

> So, you don't hear, I'll send you a link or whatever, but in previous animal crossings, but my all-time favorite set of furniture in animal crossings is called the Robo Series.

(1h 7m 46s)

> It's just a furniture series of, you know, bad and table and all that stuff, but they all look like little robots. They all have little faces and light up and it's very cute. I love it.

(1h 7m 59s)

> My favorite set, and I think it represents what I like about Amazon.

(1h 8m 3s)

> And I don't know what Carson said, some that are kind of over the top and just fun, but not very practical or realistic as furniture sets.

(1h 8m 14s)

> And they kind of straight away from that in New Horizons.

(1h 8m 18s)

> Could they add that back in maybe? And like I said, we just said there's stealth stuff, so maybe they'll add that in.

(1h 8m 26s)

> That would be nice, but I'll just see if it happens.

(1h 8m 31s)

> Yeah, so, you know, I'm still...

(1h 8m 33s)

> I'm upset, I had to go back to this game, but I will do it, and I will enjoy some parts, like I said, I do like a beyond design, I'll enjoy the hotel.

(1h 8m 43s)

> What about you, Al? Tell me your highlights.

(1h 8m 48s) **Al:**

> And yeah, I mean, I've always had a complicated relationship with this game and I'm never quite sure whether I like it or not, but I will say the creative mode gets me very excited.

(1h 9m)

> A lot of what I did in this game was like completely demolished my island and do something interesting like I made a water world, a water island, for example, it was basically like an atoll, right, it was just a tiny bit of land around the side.

(1h 9m 15s)

> side. I find it fun to do that sort of stuff.

(1h 9m 18s)

> And this just allows me to do more of that without kind of demolishing my main island without having to reset it every time.

(1h 9m 25s)

> I'm guessing at some point you can like, you can just delete one and create a new one if you want rather than having to clean it all up.

(1h 9m 34s)

> And again, recetti as well is a nice thing that I'm really looking forward to.

(1h 9m 39s)

> Will I spend a lot more time in the game? I don't know. I kind of worry that maybe this came too late for me.

(1h 9m 46s)

> I don't know, we'll see.

(1h 9m 48s)

> I first of all need to figure out which switch my save files on.

(1h 9m 52s)

> So that's a problem for me.

(1h 9m 52s) **Kevin:**

> oh man oh man I already saw some talk about that how do you transfer from

(1h 9m 59s)

> switch one to switch to yeah wasn't it wasn't it already weird like that was

(1h 10m 2s) **Al:**

> Presumably, just the same way you'd transfer from one switch to another, the switch.

(1h 10m 8s) **Kevin:**

> different wasn't it like you had to have a separate like app or something okay

(1h 10m 11s) **Al:**

> It is, yes, it's weird, but it's easy.

(1h 10m 14s) **Kevin:**

> well hopefully it is just that but Nintendo being Nintendo I wouldn't be

(1h 10m 19s)

> surprise if it's not.

(1h 10m 22s)

> Yeah.

(1h 10m 23s) **Al:**

> I just need to figure out where it is because I have too many switches but yeah I think

(1h 10m 31s)

> it's fun I'm gonna find it sometime in the next couple of weeks and kind of tidy up my

(1h 10m 39s) **Kevin:**

> I'm not. I'm just going to have resetty. You know what? That might be actually fine.

(1h 10m 42s)

> And if I just start up and resetty, just do the thing. Just wipe it. Let's start over.

(1h 10m 47s) **Al:**

> I need to see what I need to at least see what state my island is in before I decide what to do, right?

(1h 10m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Ah, that's a good point. That's a good point.

(1h 10m 54s) **Al:**

> So yeah, I I agree with you

(1h 10m 56s)

> It's not gonna solve some of the underlying issues that some people have with the game

(1h 11m)

> But that's not something that has ever been my issue with the game

(1h 11m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 11m 5s) **Al:**

> So, you know the stuff that I like about the game. It's improving

(1h 11m 9s) **Kevin:**

> It is it it is improving the game. Yeah, yeah

(1h 11m 10s) **Al:**

> And I'm gonna go buy all that Lego furniture

(1h 11m 14s) **Kevin:**

> I'm I'm all excited to see the the real the real people then all the people building the real Lego sets of that stuff

(1h 11m 21s)

> I'd be cool

(1h 11m 22s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Correct. And you put the Lego sets and yeah, yeah, yeah, you could do that.

(1h 11m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Wait, can we get oh?

(1h 11m 25s)

> There's a there is animal crossing leg go the other way

(1h 11m 29s)

> What if we dig we just go full circle and just get sets of this furniture?

(1h 11m 34s)

> Yeah, oh

(1h 11m 36s) **Al:**

> Because these are very simple sets as well. You could absolutely just

(1h 11m 37s) **Kevin:**

> They are oh

(1h 11m 41s)

> That'd be good. They charge so much money for it, but it'd be good

(1h 11m 47s)

> Why the leg is so expensive?

(1h 11m 50s)

> Well, but because everything's imported at least for me. That's why

(1h 11m 57s)

> Animal cross

(1h 11m 59s) **Al:**

> All right. Well, I think that's everything then. We will obviously talk about this when if we learn more and presumably

(1h 12m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Or when it comes out

(1h 12m 8s) **Al:**
