<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oooh.

<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Hello, has it been now? I guess it has been a little bit, huh?

8
00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.760
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: For me. I mean, you- you- you- are we? No. We did one. We did one at the beginning of this month. Never mind.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I was like, "Who do we record?" Like, "Lause?"

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: "Lause?"

11
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's the one where it'd be no way.

12
00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It feels like it's been...

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, that was it.

14
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, it feels like it's been an eternity.

15
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What has October being even, right?

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I went...

17
00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.560
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I... Yeah, it's been like, I feel like I've been through hell and back.

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: A WOOO!

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Whoo!

20
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, welcome back, Aislin.

21
00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.439
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: What is this?

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's not been a while.

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Whoo!

24
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.680
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: In fact, I've only been on one more episode since that episode.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's, that's, that's where my brain is at.

26
00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.079
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I love the way that this is starting.

27
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So let's keep going.

28
00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:37.959
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: This is...

29
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: This episode, we are going to talk about why we like farming/caughticle games.

30
00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:53.239
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: This was a topic suggested by Clem, one of our patrons and my friend.

31
00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.879
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So we are going to talk about that, thought it was an interesting topic.

32
00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I don't think we've ever actually properly discussed

33
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: why it is that we like farming/caughticle games.

34
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.760
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I thought a good person to talk about that would be aisling.

35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So that's why we're here.

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.860
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I appreciate it.

37
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And before that, we obviously have some news.

38
00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.360
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And first of all, Aisling, what have you been up to?

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.259
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I have been up to, now that I finish my work recurrent test and everything, I've been trying

40
00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:31.659
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: to work my way back into gaming, very, very light though still primarily still slowly working

41
00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.219
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: my way through persona and I read all of all that, that extra information in the slack and

42
00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:43.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: everything about why you may or may not like persona, which was very interesting to read,

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.879
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Have you been playing it like a little chunks here and there?

44
00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.280
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like really slowly sort of thing.

45
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:57.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, I primarily have been playing it before bed whenever I have the energy and I have some time before I have to go to sleep, so I'll play it for like 30, 45 minutes.

46
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:07.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I've just been doing a lot of dungeon crawling, I guess you could say, is the best way to explain it, or I guess Tartarus progress and whatnot, which makes me very relaxed.

47
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I've been enjoying it in that sense, which in theory doesn't make sense because it's like strategy thinking because of the Tartarus.

48
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:30.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I've been doing that, and then obviously Pokemon Legends EA, and then also, yeah, I won't ramble about that just yet.

49
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Which we're gonna talk about in a minute.

50
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But then also, I've been really, really, really, really itching to get back to Outer Wilds.

51
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.560
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Is that the one where it's it's a roguelike and like the sun's exploding or something? Is that that one?

52
00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.120
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Or is that different? Is that game?

53
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.699
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yes. I love the way that you, I just, I guess, technically it is a roguelike, I guess you could say.

54
00:03:51.699 --> 00:04:00.259
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I just, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I, you're not wrong, you're definitely not wrong.

55
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Is that not how you would describe it?

56
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I mean, it was around before like the roguelike term like became in everybody's vernacular, so maybe that's what?

57
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.780
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I guess so. I just, because it is technically a roguelike, it does keep repeating itself over and over,

58
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but the thing is it's like, I guess I hesitate to say it.

59
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:23.339
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Because it's time-based rather than, like, a rogue, like, you keep going until, like, you die.

60
00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:31.740
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But this while, eh, each, you know, yeah, but, like, it's, like, under your control.

61
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.360
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, yeah, but you are doing that. You're dying when the sun explodes, right? Like

62
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.660
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I also don't know if it, I haven't finished the game, so I'm, like, it's out of my control.

63
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I have no idea. I'm still working on the game to figure out what is happening.

64
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.040
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, that also feels like an arbitrary restriction to the like I feel like the point of

65
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.120
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: roguelikes is it's it's it's when you die you go back to the waiting and it doesn't matter

66
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.839
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: whether the dying is in your control or not right like to me the point is you are replaying

68
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: something and that's the primary kind of way how the game progresses is by replaying things

69
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: over and over.

70
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I guess I'm like comparing like the thing that I'm struggling with is comparing like Hades

71
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mhm.

72
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.120
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: versus Outer Wilds and they feel like two entirely different games in my head, but

73
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.920
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I Outer Wilds is like a broke leg. I agree with everything that you just said. I do a

74
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I

75
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mean they don't have to be like combat folk combat focus that's your issue, right?

76
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.160
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, no, that's fair. That's fair bird. I think I think that's what it is in my head

77
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.220
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's combat focused, but obviously it's not that case and outer wilds outer wilds. It's just all exploration

78
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.040
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, no

79
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:43.019
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But yeah, great game. Great game though. I just I want more time to be able to sink in to be able to like fully

80
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.779
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Explore everything properly and understand all the research notes and whatnot, but that's like a that's been like

81
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: If that came out this year so far, I'll be my like my game of the year outer wilds is amazing so far

82
00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.259
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Otherwise, that's pretty much it!

83
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's been it. Yeah, it's been it.

84
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: No one seems it seems like looking on the internet nobody seems to actually really consider a roguelike but nobody seems to have a good reason why.

85
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.459
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That might be the point of the game!

86
00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:20.660
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Potentially, there's a whole- it's- it's- apparently it's such an impactful game for like

87
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.220
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: me and so-or not for me, for so many of my friends, and my husband included, he already

88
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: finished the game, he beat the game, but he loved the game so much as one of the favorite

89
00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:34.699
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: games of all time now, so much so that he's going to get two tattoos, most likely, of

90
00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:39.459
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: the- from like the game, so that maybe could be a reason why people don't really have

91
00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:40.360
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: much of an explanation.

92
00:06:40.500 --> 00:07:01.279
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: There's some tags on games on Steam that I look at it, and I'm like, "That doesn't

93
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.660
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughs]

94
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.600
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: My favorite discussion--

95
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.800
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Game genres.

96
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughs]

97
00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.819
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: make sense."

98
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:20.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Yeah, interesting. Yeah, well, all right. Yeah, before we go down that rabbit hole,

99
00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:09.060
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But to some people that game genre is correct, but other people, it's like, "Nope, that's

100
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.899
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - Not it.

101
00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:14.319
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - That could be another podcast topic, maybe.

102
00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.800
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughs]

103
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.560
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But anyways, what have you been up to?

104
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.379
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughs]

105
00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:21.220
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - Yeah.

106
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: we do not have time for that. Um, I played a, since my last episode, I played a bit more wonderstop.

107
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.959
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I forget. Had I been playing that when we did our last episode, I think I'd maybe just started it.

108
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.899
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - Woo-hoo!

109
00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:34.740
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - I feel like timeline wise you may have just started it.

110
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.740
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think you were, I remember when we last spoke you were,

111
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.339
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: you were talking about starting it.

112
00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:40.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't think you have started it.

113
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.819
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, it's, yeah, it looks, yeah,

114
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But then for shortly after you did start it.

115
00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:45.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: looking at the show notes from that episode.

116
00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:46.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I had not started at that point,

117
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.899
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but yeah, maybe I mentioned that I was going to.

118
00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:51.100
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I have not finished it.

119
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.540
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: My plan was to try and finish it

120
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.620
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: before the agency came out.

121
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I think what I said to Kevin was,

122
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: if I don't do that, it's probably because it's not hooked me

123
00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:04.740
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: as much as it has other people.

124
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.420
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I have not finished it.

125
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.339
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and I...

126
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:18.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes, that's basically what it is, right? I don't feel the draw to go back to it, like I do with most games that I kind of like throw loads of time into.

127
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:26.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And it's not that it's a bad game, none of the individual elements I dislike.

128
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But there's nothing about the game that's making me go, I really want to experience this.

129
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I think part of the problem is, this is going to sound silly from someone who runs a podcast about cottagecore games.

130
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:46.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay. Okay.

131
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It feels slow and rambling.

132
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:53.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And the characters are clearly like, you know, trying to do something, and there's clearly a story that is wanting to do.

133
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I get what it's trying to do. I do. I'll tell you what's funny.

134
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:05.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So, the night who's one of the first two characters you experience.

135
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But the main character's reaction to that night was exactly my...

136
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:25.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: reaction just like you know rolling your eyes and going I can't believe I'm having to deal with this idiot and I feel like the game wants me to soften to these characters a little bit and be like oh they actually like there's a reason why you should like them or ever and I've just not felt that.

137
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughs]

138
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Uh huh.

139
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:38.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And clearly that's where it's going to be going with the story overall but I just yeah I just I'm sitting there playing the going going okay fine right time to go make some more tea.

140
00:09:39.500 --> 00:10:09.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like let's continue playing this game it's like I guess I need to go do this sort of thing and I'm not because I'm not like bought into the story as much I think if if I was finding the story more engaging I would probably kind of push through those bits like the team making is very involved and involves a lot of processes that involves a lot of walking over the map and I don't particularly find that

141
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.279
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay, that's fair. That's fair. I will just add on that I do think that even if you didn't

143
00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:22.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: soften, like you were saying to the characters and kind of find like a soft spot for them,

144
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:29.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think you could still enjoy the game because I think the game kind of wants you to feel that way,

145
00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.559
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but also if you don't, I think you can still enjoy the game.

146
00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:39.919
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I do see where you're going with how you're feeling. If you don't,

147
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like the characters that kind of is half the game, but I see where you're going. I'm trying to

148
00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:50.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like not ramble too much about it because I also don't know where you are exactly in the game

149
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I think I've, I think I've experienced four different characters and I've, all of them have annoyed me in a different way.

150
00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.679
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: at this moment.

151
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:15.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Um, yeah, well, that's the thing that's exactly it, but, but, but, but, but I'm get a bit like it's clearly right the game is clearly setting up the fact that she's then going to care about this right. She doesn't care. She doesn't want to be there.

152
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.080
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay, so you're just Ulta.

153
00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:05.759
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

154
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: she wants to go do something else but she's clearly going

155
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:34.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: to learn that she actually does need to be there and wants to be there and cares about these people despite trying so hard not to and maybe if I continued playing I would do the same I don't know but like I mean you can't say anything really to react to this because you'll just spoil the game for people who haven't played it.

156
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Uh, uh, yeah.

157
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I know, yeah.

158
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:47.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So I understand I understand that frustration but we are probably going to get you and Kevin to do a spoiler episode on it where you can then and obviously I will listen to that whether I finish the game or not.

159
00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:36.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm like, ah.

160
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, yeah.

161
00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:47.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay.

162
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Let's let's I guess put a pin in that and we'll see what comes out of that. Sorry.

163
00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:54.399
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, yeah.

164
00:11:55.399 --> 00:12:00.899
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I already know in the Kevin dedicated thread, there's going to be some heated words from him.

165
00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:03.700
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: He's going to be whoosh.

166
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But yeah, I will, I will, I will abstain any additional comments.

167
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Uh...

168
00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:12.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I will just hold it to myself because I do, I do understand.

169
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.100
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I, I will admit that initially playing the game.

170
00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:19.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I did feel a sense of frustration because I didn't know what to do, but

171
00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:23.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: without spoiling the game, I feel like I could safely say that that was

172
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: kind of half the point of the game.

173
00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:27.899
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: is that it's okay if you don't know what to do.

174
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I know. Well, this is the, this is the thing. I get that as a concept, right? And in real life,

175
00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:30.100
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That sounds crazy.

176
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It doesn't make the game sound appealing at all, but I, it, it makes the game

177
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: all the more appealing.

178
00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:50.840
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: yes, but also that's not what I want out of playing games. You know, it's, it's, it's one of

179
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Uh-huh.

180
00:12:44.299 --> 00:12:45.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And that, that is fair.

181
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That is, that is completely valid.

182
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: these things where it's like I totally have, you know, grace for people and think that, you know,

183
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: mistakes. You make mistakes.

184
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:08.120
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Don't be yourself up, but me. I will be myself up.

185
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.240
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

186
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:17.379
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's like grace for you and not for me, and that is, you know, and with games like, I, it's

187
00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:21.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: not like, I'm not trying, I don't want it to sound like I don't want any kind of deep things

188
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: in my games. I obviously do. I like deep stuff, some of the best things in Stardew or

189
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.899
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: like the deep characters

190
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: are really really moved me. But that night as the demon hunter, like they're just such stupid characters.

191
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:47.320
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think I also, to be fair, I also like the silliness, but that's a personal preference.

192
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:59.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. I like, yeah, I like some silliness. There's something particular about this silliness that just makes me go, I think it's because of how sincere they are in their silliness.

193
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.019
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I totally recognize it's personal preference.

194
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

195
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:12.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I don't know. It's hard. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not saying I won't go back to it. I probably will, but obviously I'm not going to not going to do it just now because I am busy with something else.

196
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.360
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Sit on it sit on that see if you continue to progress with the game, you know

197
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But before we get to that, I do want to talk about it, I did buy the Xbox

198
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.600
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Alliex, that's the new handheld, the ROG Xbox console, to replace my Steam Deck,

199
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.399
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: because it's the most Steam decks filling a little bit, it's a little bit old,

200
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:38.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: so the original Steam Deck and I got the smallest storage, etc, etc, 64 gigabytes, not a lot of gigabytes.

201
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.799
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So I bought this because mainly because I really like the fact that it has integration with Game Pass,

202
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.799
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: it's kind of built in and obviously it's one of the newer faster chips as well.

203
00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:57.799
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And thought it would be interesting to use that.

204
00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:04.799
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's obviously not cheap and the part of the problem is I have not played with it very much,

205
00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:08.600
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: because it came out on the same day as Pokemon did.

206
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.320
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm K-A-D-E.

207
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.399
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So I will probably have more to talk about it in the future.

208
00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's interesting, I like it.

209
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.200
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Ergonomics are very nice, it's really nice to hold, it's nicer than the Steam deck to hold, which is good.

210
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.799
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's very chunky, it's very thick, but it does mean that it's battery is better as well.

211
00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:36.399
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It does have like a streamed down Windows interface, but let me tell you, they have a lot of bugs with that.

212
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:42.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: A lot of times, random windows will pop up and you're just like, "Oh, here's this random window,"

213
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and it doesn't fit the scheming at all, the theme and stuff like that.

214
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.399
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And then suddenly this random window is window pops up and you're like, "Oh, what are you doing there?"

215
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.240
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

216
00:15:53.399 --> 00:16:00.159
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So it feels a little bit like the hardware was ready, but the software was not quite there yet,

217
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay. Okay.

218
00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:04.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and they're hopefully going to be updating it over the next couple of months, and it will get nicer.

219
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:15.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It doesn't have as good sleep and quick resume as the Steam Deck does,

220
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but it's not.

221
00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:23.639
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: terrible and it seems to hibernate after a certain amount of time of the screen being off which means that it's

222
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: standby battery is very good. It's been you know over a week since I put it in the box at

223
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:39.080
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: like 90% charge and it's now sitting at 70% so it's it's dropped 20% in a week which is not bad at all

224
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay.

225
00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:46.919
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: um so hopefully I will actually be playing at some point but you know I've got another

226
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: 100 hours of Pokémon to play before.

227
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I'm definitely curious to hear more about what you think about it because I was talking

228
00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:59.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: to a co-worker recently that was contemplating on getting like a handheld gaming system

229
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.839
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: to bring with him to work for, you know, overnights and stuff.

230
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mm-hmm

231
00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:11.160
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I was like, "I really like my steam deck," but I know that there's the new Xbox

232
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.319
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: ally thing that came out and I was starting to read up on it.

233
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.759
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And it seemed like there was one article that I read specifically,

234
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:24.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: from where that was comparing the Xbox console to the Steam deck to the Nintendo Switch 2,

235
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

236
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.079
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and actually the Switch 2 won out of all three, which I thought was interesting.

237
00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:33.160
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I didn't get to read through the nitty-gritty of like all the details of why,

238
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: so I am curious just in general how the Xbox compares,

239
00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:41.079
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: 'cause while maybe the Nintendo Switch is the best overall console,

240
00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:45.160
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I still would rather play on my Steam deck or my...

241
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.839
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: or an Xbox Alode down the line because of the fact

242
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:57.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Nintendo is still technically limited in games. So I am curious to hear more about your experience.

243
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think that's the thing is that I think the experience on Switch is the nicest because it's

244
00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:07.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: built from the ground up as a console and everything was built. It's Nintendo, they've been building

245
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:14.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:13.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: consoles for decades. They know what they want to do and they do it and you either like it or

247
00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:18.559
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you don't, but I generally do. Sure, it would be nice if you could get some more customizability,

248
00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:23.759
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but like, you know, if you've got generally, if you've got a Switch game, you know, it's going to run. And

249
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, and generally the games that are available on Switch very generally speaking are supposed to be

250
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:46.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: No, you don't have to worry about that. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well, the thing is that

251
00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:37.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: optimized for the Switch. So that also is like a plus in that sense. Like the game that you get on

252
00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:40.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Steam, you don't know if it's optimized for the Steam Deck or not. You don't know if it's optimized

253
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: for the Xbox ally, but when it's on the Switch store, it's supposed to be optimized for the Switch.

254
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: actually, well, and here's the thing, generally, if the only games that I am aware of that don't run

255
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: well on the switch despite being

256
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: on the switch or either like the really big budget studios that don't care and they're

257
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

258
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: just like oh people want switch that's fine let's throw it on switch or like the really tiny

259
00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:02.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah

260
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:14.400
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: indie games that pay for a bad porting company to do it but those ones tend to get fixed

261
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and so yeah generally if something isn't running well on the switch it will generally

262
00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:22.839
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: get fixed book a month scarlet and violet excluded I guess.

263
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah

264
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.160
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but we don't we don't talk about that one you want to fix you you want the game fixed

265
00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:28.319
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, we don't talk about that

266
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:48.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: by a switch to you don't like interesting interesting yeah that's interesting okay

267
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.759
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You want to be slightly nauseous by the switch to

268
00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:38.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: The frame rates make me nauseous like legitimately

269
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.640
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: No, it like I just have to get used to it, but it's so fast that I just like turning around. I'm like, oh

270
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Also like a few.

271
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeses make me nauseous, so that's probably all tied together.

272
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.920
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So yeah, the software is definitely the biggest issue for this and hopefully that will be improved at some point

273
00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:08.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But I've not really spent much time playing actual games I booted up the demo for skate story and it was

274
00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:11.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: working

275
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay, all right. We'll take, you know what? We'll take working that work.

276
00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:16.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But yeah, we'll see how it goes

277
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:23.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I like how it integrate you if you install something on steam or on geog or itch.io adds all into the base launcher

278
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.339
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Nice. Nice. Okay, cool.

279
00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:26.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So

280
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.740
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: We'll see how that goes and finally I mean what what I've actually been spending my time playing is of course Pokemon legends Z a so

281
00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:40.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Just a little thing for listeners and we are not going to talk about story spoilers

282
00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:43.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Because neither of us have finished the game

283
00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:44.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but

284
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Obviously if you don't want to be spoiled at all

285
00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:52.200
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Then we're obviously going to talk about the game and so we might say something that you think is a spoiler

286
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.839
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So in that case,

287
00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:56.839
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: feel free to skip the chapter and go on to the news.

288
00:20:57.319 --> 00:21:00.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: This is all that's left in the what we've been up to section.

289
00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:04.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So go there's timestamps in the in your podcast app.

290
00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:07.200
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I love this game.

291
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.359
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

292
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:12.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Same.

293
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That's it, done.

294
00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:14.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

295
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, I mean, yeah, so yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

296
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

297
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I there are, okay, there are some things that they don't have in this game.

298
00:21:24.079 --> 00:21:26.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: that they had in legends are case that I'm very sad about.

299
00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:33.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I'm for example, the biggest one is in legends are case if you

300
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: released a box of Pokemon, you got a bunch of the, um, the stuff for

301
00:21:38.119 --> 00:21:39.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: peroting them up in that game.

302
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.359
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And then you could either use it or you could sell it and you, if you sold it,

303
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, yeah.

304
00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:46.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you got more money and then you could buy more balls to catch more Pokemon.

305
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I really liked that loop that loop felt perfect to me.

306
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.920
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: If you, if you caught lots of Pokemon, you could then buy lots of balls.

307
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:58.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And catch lots of Pokemon and it felt like a really nice loop of catching.

308
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Um, and that doesn't exist in this game.

309
00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:02.839
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: If you released them, you just released them.

310
00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:04.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I'm really sad about that.

311
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:09.180
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, I didn't know that, see, I haven't filled my boxes yet to know, so that's good to know.

312
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.359
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mm hmm.

313
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.740
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That sucks that they got rid of that. I don't like that either.

314
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah.

315
00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:16.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like I get that there are, there are more ways to get money now, right?

316
00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:19.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like the weren't really battles in legends are case.

317
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And obviously the whole point of this game is at night you go battle, right?

318
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.160
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and you can make a decent amount of money.

319
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:37.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's fine. But I really like having the choice of being able to focus on catching for a chunk of time and not run out of money, which is what happens.

320
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And yeah, people say, "Oh, you know, you get so much money playing at night that you'll never run out of money."

322
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I'm like, "Well, I've run out of money." So I don't know what to tell you. I literally have $500 right now, right? Like, come on, let's...

323
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

324
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh my god.

325
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Uh, I, I, I think you underestimate.

326
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: How much I want to catch Pokemon.

327
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

328
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So yeah, I can go in battle and make money that way. That's fine. I just, it's, it's an annoyance for me. I wish it weren't the case.

329
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:12.980
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. No, I mean, yeah, I can, I can, I haven't hit that point in that game in the game yet,

330
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's a big one.

331
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.619
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: where I like run out of money and everything and I'm not catching like a whole lot just yet,

332
00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:22.980
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but I can definitely see that I can, I can definitely see that issue being the case.

333
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.259
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I'm surprised, again, I'm surprised they got rid of the box feature in that sense.

334
00:23:28.819 --> 00:23:34.740
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I guess maybe to be fair, they did advertise this game.

335
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:41.940
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: With a lot of battling aspects, so like it is a battle heavy game, but yeah.

336
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Sure, sure, but it's also a catching focus, it's also a catching focus game, right? Like you can

337
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:53.160
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: ignore the fact that the core loop of catching Pokemon is almost identical, slightly improved or

338
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: get to that. I'm going to, but almost identical to how Legends are kissed is. Yeah, sure, there's

339
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah

340
00:23:57.079 --> 00:24:01.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: battling. I knew that would be battling. I don't dislike the battling. I just, I like being able to

341
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: any particular day of having the choice, but there comes a point where I can no longer continue to

342
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: catch and a half to go battle, because I run out of money and that, that's, it is what

343
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

344
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:26.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: it is, but that is a disappointment.

345
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.339
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, no, that's fair.

346
00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:18.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Definitely not saying that as a defense of the game or anything like that.

347
00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:23.819
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's just like, ah, it's just, I'm trying to sort of rationalize in my head, but I also understand.

348
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.339
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Yeah.

349
00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.779
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

350
00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:28.160
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's like, yeah, it is still a catching game, but there's a reason that you can kind of tumble for one

351
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.859
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: bush to the next and sneak up on Backstrike Pokémon and be able to do that as much as you want,

352
00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:35.819
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't know if it was speaking, but...

353
00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:37.740
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Well, and the way that you get most XP

354
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: is by knocking them out and then catching.

355
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

356
00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:41.339
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So right, they do actually encourage you

357
00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:43.059
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: to catch every single Pokemon.

358
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

359
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Well, maybe in the DLC.

360
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

361
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - But let me, let me, let go, I doubt it.

362
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.859
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I, I, what I love how they've done

363
00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:55.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: is what they have improved in that process

364
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.140
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: is the battling and to knock them out.

365
00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So then you can catch them.

366
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Because in Legends Arceus, you either through bowls at them

367
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.420
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: or you engage them in battle.

368
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

369
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Whereas here you can do both, right?

370
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: You can, you can try and catch them.

371
00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:09.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I love it

372
00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:13.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And then if it doesn't succeed, then you can like,

373
00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:15.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: just do a move, right?

374
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.059
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: You don't have to like move into battle mode.

375
00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:19.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: your already in battle mode.

376
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I really like that.

377
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:29.779
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Also, I noticed that I find it a little bit annoying, so there's so many thoughts.

378
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:33.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I like how you can knock it out and then catch it.

379
00:25:33.619 --> 00:25:34.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's a really nice addition.

380
00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:38.940
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I've always found it weird in Pokemon games where you knock out a Pokemon and suddenly

381
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you can't catch it.

382
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.259
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I'm like, "What happened to it?

383
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

384
00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:42.259
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I knocked out.

385
00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:43.220
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It should be lying there.

386
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughter]

387
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Let me catch it."

388
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.660
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So I like that.

389
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:50.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It is a bit annoying that you only get one chance of that and if it doesn't stay in the

390
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.559
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yes, I agree.

391
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.220
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: ball, then it's gone.

392
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.140
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But what I have found is that you can, obviously, you can throw a couple of balls at it

393
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and then it stops being able to stay in balls against angry, right?

394
00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:03.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Then you have to engage it in battle.

395
00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:07.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I've noticed that if you attack it, then you can throw balls again before it's knocked

396
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:08.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: out.

397
00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:15.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Actually, I think that increases the chance in a standard Pokemon game with your turn-based

398
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: battles.

399
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.240
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is, yeah.

400
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.779
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: If it's lower health, it's more likely to catch it.

401
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.779
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So you can actually knock it, hit it with a move and then try and catch it again and then

402
00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:29.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: hit it with another move and try and catch it again and that gives you more tries.

403
00:26:29.019 --> 00:26:32.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I just like how they've integrated all that together into one seamless experience.

404
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

405
00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:35.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I 1,000% agree as well

406
00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:38.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I I've had to use that method to

407
00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:43.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: To try and catch some like bigger Pokemon and I would just throw ball. Okay, it didn't work

408
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Let's hit a moon hit it with a move. Okay, it's HP's lower throw ball again

409
00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:53.759
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I do also agree like to like if you do end up knocking it out like if you hit use one move and you accidentally knock it out

410
00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:59.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You have one chance to catch it and that's it and that's that's all it hurts

411
00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:02.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, it's, especially when you have, you've spent ages knocking out an alpha, right?

412
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It hurts.

413
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:30.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I wish they gave at least one more chance, because like you said, you knocked it out, it's not like it's buried into the ground after you knock it out, you know, it's not like it's in the ground forever, it's not that it's not like the snap of the finger it's gone, situation like it's, you know, you knocked it out, it's just laying there on the ground.

414
00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:07.660
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: You're like, I've gone through all this effort and I've got this alpha and I throw one ball and nope, it's not caught.

415
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's really annoying.

416
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.299
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Yeah, crumbles to dust.

417
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like if anything, you should be able to pick it up and bring it to the Pokémon sending yourself.

419
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah

420
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: If we want to be a little more realistic.

421
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Although I'm not really think sure I'm going to be able to pick up that alpha

422
00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Obama snow and

423
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Ahhh!

424
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Drag it to the Pokemon Center

425
00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:51.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: If you, you, if you try, you know what?

426
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: If your Rotom phone can hold you as you're falling off a building,

427
00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:58.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: why can't your Rotom phone help you carry the big Obama Snowden, you know?

428
00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:02.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Funny

429
00:28:02.599 --> 00:28:04.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What's your favorite thing about this game so far?

430
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:33.619
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, man. That's a loaded question. I, I actually, so I've really, even though I don't look like I'm enjoying it, I have been really enjoying the rogue mega battles. I, I, as, as much as it stresses me out, I do enjoy that experience. It's really fun. It's really fun. Like, I think I would like a game like Elton ring down the line. I just, I think as I just don't like the aesthetics of Elton ring, but I like the aesthetics of Pokemon. So like,

431
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.180
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: You want to poke him on, Elton Ring is what you're saying.

432
00:28:35.559 --> 00:29:04.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, that, I'd be so on that so fast. I would be so stressed playing it, but man, I would be having a great time because it's satisfying to like watch its movements figure it out and then be able to defeat it. So I, I've, I've been really enjoying that. I've really enjoyed the side quests. Side quests are so, so, so, so, so much fun. Like, I've really been enjoying the loop of continuing the main story for a little bit.

433
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:35.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Unlocking wild areas and 100% each wild area, and then afterwards doing all the side quests. I've been really, really, really enjoying it. I also, I feel like it's been like a 50/50, but I've been really enjoying like a lot. I actually know, I think majority people really like the outfits too. Like the customization is, is that all the outfits are so cute. And I have like, I feel like some of the outfits I literally have like, I URL some of the outfits and it's so fun, I can actually dress as my character.

434
00:29:35.000 --> 00:30:05.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: if I want to, and it's so, so, so cute. So I, I, I am curious to learn. I think this is the first time I want to shiny hunt again in a Pokemon game in a really long time, but I just have to learn more about what the shiny hunting process is because it's just, it's just fun to catch Pokemon. So I feel like I would enjoy shiny hunting as well at some point down the line, but that's, that's kind of where I'm at at the moment. I, I, I am enjoying the story too overall so far.

435
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.839
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Yeah.

436
00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Yeah, it's interesting.

437
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I look forward to seeing where it goes.

438
00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:09.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: They hooked me when you start up the game

439
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.259
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and the very first thing is you are as I guard sell.

440
00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:16.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

441
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.680
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

442
00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.779
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

443
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.839
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - I'm in, I'm in, yes I am, I guard right now.

444
00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:27.079
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That was, I am curious to see if that pans out more

445
00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:28.859
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: 'cause I thought it was very interesting

446
00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:31.700
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: that they, that's how the game starts.

447
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I don't know if that's going to actually

448
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.539
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: be a part in the story, but I am curious nonetheless.

449
00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:39.940
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I have no idea where this story is going.

450
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.859
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: All I know is I mostly ready to crash out at any point

451
00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:45.859
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: character in particular.

452
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That is your favorite character so far.

453
00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Ooh, ah, yee, um, I mean, honestly, I,

454
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.819
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: so I picked the girl character,

455
00:30:55.819 --> 00:30:58.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: so I have really been enjoying,

456
00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:00.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: all right, I guess like quote unquote rival,

457
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: so for me it's urban.

458
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I really enjoy their personality,

459
00:31:06.579 --> 00:31:10.259
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but I also, I also just like light a lot too.

460
00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:11.980
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Lita, light a, I still haven't figured out

461
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: how to pronounce her name,

462
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughter]

463
00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:14.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but I like it.

464
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I like her character a lot, too, so much so that I would like it would be fun to cosplay her at some point.

465
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:27.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Not sure how I figure her leggings, but that's a future me problem, but I really like light out a lot so far.

466
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

467
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: How about you?

468
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Fair enough.

469
00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:33.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Look, I always want more easy, right?

470
00:31:33.119 --> 00:31:36.140
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like, he's such a fascinating character.

471
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.920
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I mean, I'm enjoying his like random,

472
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.339
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

473
00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:44.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: random butting into conversations

474
00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:47.400
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and telling you things and it turns out

475
00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:47.099
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

476
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.680
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: that maybe he's like running the entire city, maybe?

477
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.240
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I'm not sure, (laughing)

478
00:31:51.819 --> 00:31:53.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm not sure either.

479
00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:56.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: like he seems to be doing more than it seems,

480
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: so I'm very intrigued just to where that goes.

481
00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.680
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I do love how, and this is obviously very early game,

482
00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I love how powerful his Flouette is.

483
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.319
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I know, yeah. So cool.

484
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.559
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So, yeah.

485
00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:13.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: All right, wow, we could probably talk about this forever,

486
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but we probably shouldn't

487
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: 'cause it's not a Pokemon podcast.

488
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

489
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.839
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I know.

490
00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:21.319
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Aw man, we gotta do an episode at some point.

491
00:32:21.319 --> 00:32:23.200
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Someone's gonna talk about this game at some point.

492
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:33.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, we're probably doing greenhouse episode on it. I'm more detailed one, but we'll see I was gonna say we'll see who gets that, but I mean Kevin and Cody don't have the game. So

493
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.299
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think it'd be fun.

494
00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:27.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yay!

495
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:46.220
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, let the, let the game

496
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Probably me and you unless Johnny wants to come on. I can't tell if he likes the game or not

497
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like ride out more and like I, I feel like I don't have too many complaints about the game

498
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes Oh, for sure, like I wouldn't even consider doing a greenhouse episode until we're until

499
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.740
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: because I'm still in like the honeymoon phase of the game.

500
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:58.180
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So, yeah, yeah.

501
00:32:55.599 --> 00:33:02.400
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: we're at least finished the main story. Nevermind more, but we'll see where it goes after that,

502
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: although we need to do it pre DLC obviously. All right. Well, that's what we've been up to

503
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.839
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

504
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:15.680
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and also all the Pokemon. Let's talk about some news. A few pieces of news this episode,

505
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:11.799
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yay!

506
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: so first up, gocho on the grassline.

507
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:32.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's not true. The game the Kevin has played has announced that they're going to release on mobile platforms.

508
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

509
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's it. That's it. That's the news. They don't say when they don't specify which platforms, but I'm presuming they mean iOS and Android.

510
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's it. So if you like the look of this game, but you don't have a switch or a PC or an Xbox or a PlayStation.

511
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: If you want to play it on mobile, there you go.

512
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.079
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, it's nice.

513
00:33:53.079 --> 00:34:02.339
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I like the article mentions that this is part of an investment to boost studios from

514
00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:04.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: specifically Latin America.

515
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I love that.

516
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I love that.

517
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I love that.

518
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:13.059
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And the fact that it's successful to be able to play on more platforms is great.

519
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:24.420
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes, always good, I'm sure you could if you tried.

520
00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:16.320
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Really no complaints about that.

521
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.019
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Ah, I mean I could play that.

522
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I have mobile games in general, but that's a whole other topic in itself.

523
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I have such mixed feelings about touchscreen as an input device for games.

524
00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:36.340
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It really depends on the game whether I think it's a good thing.

525
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:47.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. I wish my mobile games allowed me to hook up my controller to my device,

526
00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:50.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: whatever it may be, whether it's an iPad or phone or whatever it may be.

527
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:57.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Let me tell you when harvest moon homesweet home added controller support. It went from being a terrible game to an okay game

528
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:03.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, that's a big jump in itself.

529
00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:05.059
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, yeah

530
00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:08.400
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It went from not bad, terrible game to "okay."

531
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:14.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I actually had some fun playing that game after the added controller support. I know right?

532
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That's pretty good.

533
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.019
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Wow.

534
00:35:12.019 --> 00:35:19.139
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But yeah, no, just again, it all comes down to accessibility.

535
00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:23.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: The fact that there is something that's more accessible for more people to be able to experience

536
00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: this game.

537
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Well, they like the game when I was a different story, whether they like the...

538
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:43.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: control system on a mobile device is a different story, but the fact that you can play it on more platforms so that it's available to more people that are interested in the game is a good thing, whether it's good on mobile, I don't know, we'll see.

539
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah.

540
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Hmm, that's a whole different question.

541
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Next, we have Spritit D have announced their 2.0 update is coming out on the 4th of December.

542
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:04.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So they seem to have taken my advice and bundled together a bunch of updates rather than releasing the smaller ones because I felt like they were releasing too many small updates

543
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.920
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and it's the sort of game that feels like you want to jump in for a bunch of times.

544
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:20.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So it's the last update was in February, so they've taken a whole bunch and put it together in one update, which is good.

545
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:33.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So there's a bunch of new stuff. I don't think I'll talk about much of this because it's really just for people who've played the game like none of this will mean much to people, but there's a bunch of new content and new customization and stuff like that.

546
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: that. So, if you have been enjoying

547
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Spiritity and is a

548
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.719
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: good game, it just wasn't for me, but if you've been enjoying it, then go grab that update in December.

549
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, it looks like this at minimum, like category-wise, nine new updates, and I seem pretty big too,

550
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:59.159
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: from what I saw on everything, pretty good updates, so I hope it continues to help the game flourish.

551
00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:06.920
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I know nothing about this game to be fair, but I hope people enjoy it, because it seems like it's a lot.

552
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:07.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Is that UK type game?

553
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So, like if you're an idea.

554
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: All right.

555
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:20.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Speaking of updates to games, cult of the lamb have announced DLC called Will Haven.

556
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:28.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: This is coming early next year and it is a DLC.

557
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: There seems to be quite a lot in this.

558
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I've heard a lot of buzz around it. I've heard good thing people are excited about it

559
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:50.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It looks interesting. It looks like it expands a bunch of areas and new areas for exploring, also ranching, and obviously a bunch of story stuff as well, so that's cool.

560
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.840
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm, the ranching is the most interesting part.

561
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.559
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughter]

562
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, certainly for this podcast.

563
00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:57.360
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Exactly.

564
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That's what I'm saying.

565
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I really hope they have

566
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:12.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: a lot of weird animals, like don't just give us a cow give us a demon cow give us something weird like mishmash of animals or so I don't know I don't know I'm not the game designer give me weird stuff

567
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:19.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, it says ranching will allow for you to carry and breed care for and breed rare creatures.

568
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:28.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So it's kind of giving, it's giving weird creatures.

569
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:25.059
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes, there we go. I want creatures. I don't want animals. I want creatures.

570
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:36.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes. Yes. I want, I want something that there's mysterious legends about from hundreds of years ago.

571
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I think you'll get your wish.

572
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:40.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, isn't that like half the essence of the game?

573
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: another game I also haven't played to be fair but it's been

588
00:39:57.519 --> 00:39:58.559
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: They do keep going.

589
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:06.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: just the thing for me that like kind of puts me on like like not still picking it up is I'm

590
00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Three years, sorry, no.

591
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.539

592
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:19.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Disney person. I think that's what it comes down to. I like Disney. Don't get me wrong. But also, Disney is like a whole other conversation in itself too, that I'm not going to go into.

593
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: shocking

594
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.920
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What isn't Disney now that's the question I

595
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You know, it's a good point. I do love Star Wars.

596
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Don't think they're gonna add Star Wars into this. I mean maybe though who knows that

597
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That, you know what? That might be it. That might be it if I do it. You heard it here first.

598
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I will pick the game up immediately.

599
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.719
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I mean what well no, I actually don't think they should do that

600
00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:39.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think what they should do is use the game

601
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: game base and release a new game, which is about Star Wars, and a new game that's about Marvel, there you go

602
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh!

603
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:53.400
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Keep keep the universe a separate but have different games because I think part of the problem is if you go hey

604
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.679
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Star Wars is now in Disney's dream like Valley you suddenly go oh

605
00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Okay, but if I care about Star Wars, and I don't care about goofy, right?

606
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

607
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:05.679
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I don't want to be booting up a game and have to go learn how to fish from goofy

608
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: just so I can go and see, you know,

609
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm just feeling like I can't just,

611
00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I can't just imagine just goofy walking around

612
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.139
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: unlike in the Star Wars universe is crazy.

613
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughs]

614
00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:26.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

615
00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:31.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mickey Mouse, oh man, oh my god.

616
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: "Girphy" means "Dark Vader", right? Like...

617
00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Donald Duck and Darth Vader going at it would be crazy.

618
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Okay, I've changed my mind. You need to have them in one game.

619
00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But you know what?

620
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I thought this, yeah, I kind of want this now.

621
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.940
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, that'd be so funny.

622
00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I would, you know what, whichever one you want to give me,

623
00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:51.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'll be there first in line.

624
00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:55.719
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I logistically separate games makes the most sense.

625
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I do think I do think that would work well. I think

626
00:41:55.719 --> 00:42:00.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But like humor-wise, oh, it'd be so good together.

627
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:06.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think this is the thing. I think the game loop could work well in games for Star Wars and Marvel as well

628
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think it works nicely

629
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

630
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.280
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: just with different aesthetics

631
00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:15.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, oh, I'd be so in though either way count me in

632
00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:22.320
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Did you see that just on the business side of things? Do you see that Warner Brothers discovery have said they're up for they're gonna put themselves up for sale

633
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:24.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: We really?

634
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.659
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And they're the yeah, and they own DC and obviously

635
00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:29.920
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh my god.

636
00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:31.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: This is bad for everybody

637
00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:38.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But I I would absolutely find it hilarious if Disney bought them because then they would own Marvel and DC now

638
00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:42.960
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Obviously objectively bad for everybody do not let this happen, but

639
00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:48.679
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Just funny so so funny if that were to happen

640
00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:00.840
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: oh man oh man yeah that that I I hope it doesn't happen that way but if it did that be crazy

641
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but oh I I had this is something I'll be reading about later I did not know about this at all

642
00:43:06.039 --> 00:43:11.719
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: so thank you for informing me and that will be my reading for a later point

643
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: You're welcome.

644
00:43:12.099 --> 00:43:13.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: All right.

645
00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:15.739
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's the news.

646
00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:19.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: We are now going to talk about why we like cottage core games.

647
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Woo!

648
00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.940
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's funny, I sat down a couple of days ago to be like,

649
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: "Well, let me actually try and put some words onto this."

650
00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I was like, "Why do I like these games?"

651
00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:36.340
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I said, "I have a really hard question

652
00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: to start with, right?"

653
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.599
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

654
00:43:39.099 --> 00:43:41.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: because it's not a good idea.

655
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: They are weird games, right?

656
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:48.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like you are creating a life for yourself

657
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and like bettering this fake version of yourself

658
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: or of someone else if you want to role play in that way.

659
00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And it's like, sometimes I feel a little bit silly

660
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: because it's like I am harvesting my crops here.

661
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I'm planting, blah, blah, blah, blah.

662
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I could be tidying and making my real life better.

663
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but I do

664
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:27.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: know, it doesn't work that way. I don't... I almost wonder whether part of the games actually my brain wants to do them to distract myself from the things that you could be doing in real life.

665
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:36.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I think I think that's definitely an aspect. I would I would agree. I mean we do weeding for example

666
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Cool. Job done.

667
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.619
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Do you weeding for example like I or real is not good for the back

668
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:48.019
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But deweeding in animal crossing is great for the back when I'm sitting on the couch, you know

669
00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:53.860
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And me deweeding is not as cute as deweeding an animal crossing, you know

670
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's getting, it gets a little sweaty, it's dirty.

671
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:03.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's like, my hair is all over the place, it's not cute, but in animal crossing, it's so cute.

672
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:10.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Can't stream real life de-weeding, you know, you got to try

673
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:14.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, you could, but it's an interesting, you know what, you could make it interesting, it's possible for it to be interesting.

674
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:20.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: If you're not talking, maybe not, but if you're having a conversation, maybe, but it's still not cute.

675
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.400
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Look, people watch all sorts of weird things on the internet.

676
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I'm sure they'd watch that, but oh, surely surely.

677
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Are there farmers that stream?

678
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's gotta be right.

679
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm looking it up right now.

680
00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:33.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Farmer John.

681
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You're not farming.

682
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.219
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You are not farming.

683
00:45:36.219 --> 00:45:37.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You're playing Dead by Daylight.

684
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm done.

685
00:45:38.179 --> 00:45:39.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I quit, never mind.

686
00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.219
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That's a disappointment.

687
00:45:41.219 --> 00:45:44.619
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You can't be farmer John and not be farming.

688
00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:49.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But yeah, no, I, I, I, yeah.

689
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I've seen a bunch of TikToks from Farmers,

690
00:45:49.699 --> 00:45:53.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but it seemed to be harder to find actual streaming.

691
00:45:53.579 --> 00:45:56.659
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Because me, it's just not as interesting as farming in Stardew.

692
00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.659
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's not as cute.

693
00:45:58.659 --> 00:46:00.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's not as aesthetic, you know?

694
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.719
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, yeah.

695
00:46:01.719 --> 00:46:03.679
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I mean, the aesthetic is a big part of it, right?

696
00:46:03.679 --> 00:46:06.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like real life is messy.

697
00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.800
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And you don't get away from that completely in games, right?

698
00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.159
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like that's one of the things that we like about Stardew

699
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

700
00:46:13.159 --> 00:46:15.840
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: is the messiness of the characters, right?

701
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: We all we all love to hear.

702
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:46.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Clint. Yeah, okay. So getting down to like actual reasons of why I thought. So my first one is I like the repetition of it. There's something, particularly where a big part of how I play games is on a handheld device. You know, either my switch or my, well, now my ROG ally X. But previously my steam deck. You know, sitting next to my wife while we watch TV or we do something else.

703
00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:17.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's kind of like how I like to play most of my games. And because of that, obviously, I don't play a lot of like story heavy games. So I like the kind of repetition and like almost kind of background brain stuff. If that makes sense. I don't know whether that's something you experience or not.

704
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:33.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, that is I would say that is definitely something that I do like but I would say that it's not like the main part of why I like farming or cottagecore games or anything like I just like for example not the person is a cottagecore game but in most recent memory like I enjoy doing the Tartarus stuff in Persona 3 because it is like a brain turn off thing.

705
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:53.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: The repetitious movement or motion to like grind or in the case of like playing Stardew tending to your farm tending to your animals it is nice to kind of put that at the forefront of my brain and focus on that so I'm not thinking about anything else and I can just like kind of just look at that just focus on that and that's it.

706
00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:03.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I just distract myself from anything that is going on in the world so I do enjoy that but only up to a certain point because then for me it gets.

707
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:24.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: To repetitive and that's where the conversation of like for me personally I can only have too I can only have so many farming games in the rotation because I can only do that repetition so much before I feel like I need I need to see more growth over time.

708
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:30.059
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes, absolutely. I 100% agree that's that's that's one of the reasons that I didn't like

709
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:36.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Sugar du Island is that there was no growth aspect to it. Right and growth can look different in different games, right?

710
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

711
00:48:36.699 --> 00:48:38.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like in in stardew

712
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.260
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's very much like I want to build this really big efficient farm that means that I don't have to do much

713
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:45.780
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but

714
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.860
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like different games can do it in different ways. I doesn't have to be that right

715
00:48:51.579 --> 00:48:53.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: like it wasn't that in

716
00:48:54.699 --> 00:49:01.659
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I didn't have a big autonomous farm. I was still using my water watching can by the end of that by the time I finished that game

717
00:49:02.219 --> 00:49:07.900
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But I still really liked it because I felt like I was building up the bizarre instead, right? That was my progress

718
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:16.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I just, I like to see, I just want to see progress that feels like fulfilling in the sense

719
00:49:16.199 --> 00:49:21.719
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: that if I'm doing it over, if I'm building up of the same farm, but in different aesthetics

720
00:49:21.719 --> 00:49:25.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: or different slightly different formats over and over in different farming games, I'm

721
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: eventually going to like burn myself out from it.

722
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's why I can't play like, for example, Animal Crossing Happy Home Paradise and House

723
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.760
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: flipper at the same time because it's both decorating.

724
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I can only decorate so much.

725
00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:53.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like I like it, I like the repetition of doing this decorating, whether it could be completely different decorations that I'm doing in both games or whatever, but there's I can only do it up to a certain point before the burnout hits.

726
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. That makes sense.

727
00:49:53.500 --> 00:50:01.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But for the time that I am doing it, I, it is something that I just focus on decorating and I focus on nothing else and it's really nice.

728
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.300
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I think that's true for me as well. It's just that like once I hit that point

729
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I then just switched to a different game that does the same thing

730
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.239
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

731
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:16.300
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: in a different way, right? Like if you play stardew for a hundred hours, and then you switch to

732
00:50:16.739 --> 00:50:18.059
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: grand bazaar

733
00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:23.300
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like in a way, it's it's the same but in a way, it's different, right?

734
00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And and that's why I keep going back to them, right? Like I've now been

735
00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:30.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Doing this podcast or anything

736
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:44.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you know there's always something new and interesting, even with the things at the same.

737
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah.

738
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:56.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean, for me, I guess you know what to be fair. I feel like I've only been getting into farming games this past maybe three years and that

739
00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:03.539
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Is even maybe just a little bit of a stretch because there's just for me. It's like it it is to be fair

740
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Three years is still a long time to do anything, though.

741
00:51:04.099 --> 00:51:10.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like I've been playing more and more Stardew as a recently finally. I have not still made any progress and I still don't know

742
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:24.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Cavan was laughing when he's listening.

743
00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: 90% of the world of stardew to be

744
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:31.780
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: completely honest. Yeah, because I don't know what that means. I have no idea and it's crazy that I have no idea what that means, but like the the fun that I've been

745
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:42.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: having with managing my farm thus far in stardew has been really nice. And for the time that I was playing like feels

746
00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: mystery. It was also very

747
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:50.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: nice, but I think for me, the reason that I like the core, one of the core reasons I like,

748
00:51:51.539 --> 00:51:59.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: farming games is more so just to be immersed in the world, which is getting to know the characters,

749
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:05.699
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and then also farming is a fun thing. But the primary thing is I like to see progress,

750
00:52:05.699 --> 00:52:10.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and I especially like to see progress in the sense of for me getting to know the characters in the game.

751
00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:14.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and also just like the music and the aesthetics.

752
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:25.800
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like if I don't like how the game looks and for me personally the music like I when I when I play a game I like to listen to the music in the game.

753
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:34.800
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I know like for example for you you often will have like a podcast running as you're playing a game for me I like to just have the I like to just just play the game.

754
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:44.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So maybe if I played like I actually bought I completely forgot the name of the game what was the episode?

755
00:52:45.500 --> 00:53:14.099
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I bought the game too and I completely forgot cuz it was on a good sale that farming game firefly firefly village yes I know I know so much I know we gotta we gotta stand out a little bit more but.

756
00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:55.940
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: uh, oh, yes. It was Ashwood Valley. No, that's the one I've not done, uh, Firefly Village.

757
00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:00.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Sorry. There's too many, there's too many of these small new, because there's, there's

758
00:53:00.659 --> 00:53:04.260
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Firefly Village, there's Ashwood Valley. There was another one that me and Kevin have done.

759
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:10.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What was that with? Sunset Island. They're, I gotta get better names for these games, man.

760
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:43.800
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah so I ended up buying firefly village I haven't had a chance to pick it up yet cuz I've been still slowly working my way into games but maybe I should while I'm playing that game catch up on my very very big backlog of podcasts while I play the game the thing is I enjoy playing like a cottage core game to be able to just disassociate and just play the game and not be connected in any of any sort of way with the rest of the world like I just want to just exist in that world.

761
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:56.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So that is a big thing for me that I like is that is I that's what I like when I'm looking for a good farming game is can I just turn everything off and just exist in the world.

762
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Hmm, what?

763
00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I feel like so far I could do that for a start, do I feel like I can so far do that for feels

764
00:54:00.619 --> 00:54:06.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What would you say percentage of your gaming time is on your streams versus not on?

765
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:12.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I would argue probably 75% is on stream and 25% is off stream.

766
00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:22.400
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I would love for it to be 50/50,

767
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:40.659
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Yeah. The reason. Yeah. So the reason I ask is I feel like that changes how you play,

768
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.400
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but I have too many other projects that I like to do

769
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.920
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: outside of streaming, so it's hard for me

770
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.679
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: to bump that off stream number up.

771
00:54:33.679 --> 00:54:36.639
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like a lot of my dedicated gaming time is on stream.

772
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [soft music]

773
00:54:40.659 --> 00:54:47.539
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: right? Because you're not going to, you know, sit down and listen to a podcast while you're

774
00:54:47.539 --> 00:54:52.179
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: gaming because you're streaming, right? Like, it's just, it's not something you can realistically

775
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.900
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

776
00:54:52.900 --> 00:55:00.019
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: that makes gaming a, you know, a joint experience most of the time rather than a solo experience,

777
00:55:00.019 --> 00:55:07.219
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: right? And whereas a lot of most of my gaming is a solo experience, you know, other than I always

778
00:55:07.219 --> 00:55:12.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: find it funny when a new game, a new big game that a lot of my friends play comes out. And I like,

779
00:55:12.099 --> 00:55:16.420
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you jump on the switch and you look at your friends list and everybody's playing the same game.

780
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah

781
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.179
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And that feels cumulative, even though you're not actually playing together, it's like,

782
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, it's so cute. Yeah

783
00:55:20.179 --> 00:55:22.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: We're all playing this thing together is quite...

784
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:29.139
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I noticed that I had like 12 people online yesterday and every single one of them was playing Pokemon

785
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.360
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I love that

786
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So I feel like that massively changes things, right?

787
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like I... 'cause I'm doing things solo most of the time, right?

788
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.780
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like I'm just playing. Yeah, sure. I'm with my wife, but she's not experiencing the game, right?

789
00:55:39.500 --> 00:56:00.059
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

790
00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:48.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like she doesn't care about the game. That's fine. We are together in a different way.

791
00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:52.260
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: we're together watching something and I'm playing this thing on the side like that.

792
00:55:52.500 --> 00:56:10.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It changes what I want from it and I think that's quite often why I'm less story focused because you know you can't have that whereas I guess the advantage of the way you're doing it is that you can be like really focus on the story where you're doing that because that's the point of what you're doing.

793
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

794
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:20.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Which doesn't you don't have to be streaming to do that obviously. I'm not I'm not trying to say that you have some unique situation where where you can do this and most people can't do that.

795
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.699
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I suspect most people play a game.

797
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And don't do other things at the same time.

798
00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I don't know. I'm just making the op.

799
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.360
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think it's a pretty, probably a pretty high percentage of people are playing a game

800
00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: while, like, for example, watching a YouTube video, like, my husband does that all the time

801
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:43.440
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: where he's playing. He plays, I would say, his version of a lot of cottagecore games,

802
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.400
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: where they're games that he can pick up and put down very casually, and he can watch a bunch

803
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:54.320
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: of YouTube videos simultaneously. Um, like, for example, power wash simulator just two just came

804
00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.679
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: out pretty recently. I think that's all I've been seeing him playing recently besides

805
00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:04.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: he's just been power washing, and he's just sitting there having a good time making the progress

806
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:12.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: in the game and catching up in a whole lot of, like, bots on YouTube, for example. Um, and power wash

807
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:17.760
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: simulator too is, or just power wash sim in general is a very repetitive game. Looking at your notes,

808
00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:24.800
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: the number goes up in the sense that the percentage goes up, and, um, it's just nice to turn the brain off.

809
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:27.760
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah. Well, yeah. So, I mean, that's, so that's an interesting thing because, um, like obviously

810
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: the repetitive nature we talked about it. And as you say, obviously, one of the things I'd put

811
00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:37.599
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: down is I like the number go up, right? Like I like seeing in Stardew, you're, you're, you're,

812
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:41.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: the amount of money that you have go up, the number of plots you have go up, all these things

813
00:57:41.519 --> 00:57:47.440
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: are going up. I like that. That's satisfying. Um, I have never ever,

814
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: once even considered playing power war simulator. Uh, but you would think that it would be

815
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Really?

816
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.320
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: something that would be interesting based on all these things I've mentioned so far. And,

817
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

818
00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:09.519
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and I don't know what it is, but it just to me sounds incredibly boring. I think the reason is,

819
00:58:10.639 --> 00:58:14.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: it's not, it's not about what you do in game. It's about what you're doing with your hands.

820
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.480
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I think there's a funny

821
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:47.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: fundamental difference between farming games and power war simulator in how you play it physically. So power war simulator you've got your power washer and you are essentially very slowly moving across this big building or small building or the point is right you're you are moving methodically I mean you don't have to you can do whatever you want but like the ideal way of doing it is you methodically go from left to right up to down whatever and you clean this thing.

822
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:56.519
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. True. Yeah.

823
00:58:48.000 --> 00:59:09.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And how farming games work farming games is a lot of movement it's a lot of doing things and it's repetitive but it's like my hands do a lot of stuff but I don't think power was simulator would work in that way and I think that's one of the ways that I physically find it satisfying is because I am doing a lot with my hands.

824
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm yeah, I think

825
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:39.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's like we had this we had this conversation about in our last episode about when I was talking about asking about persona because I was asking about whether it's

826
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:48.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: the conversations whether they were automatic and I could just like put the console down and listen and watch the conversation and do something else with my hands because that's the thing is that my hands want to do something.

827
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:40.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I guess because for me, I do enjoy the aspect of power wash simulator to be able to

828
00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:48.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: just do that repetitive task and I don't mind that it's not. I definitely know what you mean with

829
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:54.139
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like you're able to do more with your hands and I think if we're talking just strictly, strictly

830
00:59:54.139 --> 00:59:59.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: managing a farm versus strictly just power.

831
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:27.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think I would prefer power washing just a little bit more because for me it requires a little bit less thought in the sense that if I also have commitment issues in the sense that like when I'm building up a farm like I'm afraid to commit like this section is going to be the farm and this is this is it like I'm like what if I want to move the farm like it requires a little bit more thought that sometimes I'm not. But it's just then it's like also like a lot of work but also like that's kind of what I just.

832
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:29.840
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What if you want to move it? You move it. Yeah, more stuff to do. That's the beauty of it.

833
01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:57.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and maybe that's my but I that's that's what can get overwhelming for me is that it is so much to do and sometimes not always sometimes it's not what I want but when I do want that it's really really really really satisfying but sometimes all I want to do is come just the bare minimum and just clean a wall.

834
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.719
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: You know, and here's here's an intro. I totally get that. I I get the overwhelm. I absolutely do

835
01:00:58.719 --> 01:01:03.719
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I do think that sometimes farming games can be a little bit like there's so much you can do

836
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.280
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: but I think

837
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.280
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: one of the ways that I

838
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: would think about farming games is

839
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.840
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Don't think about what you can do

840
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.719
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Think about what you want to do. Think about what you have to do and actually what you have to do in these games is very little and

841
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm

842
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Often the things you have to do.

843
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: A very limited in how long you have to do them for.

844
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:35.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So if you think about it, what you have to do in a farming game is you have to water your crops that you have.

845
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Once you've watered those crops, six days in a row, and you've harvested them, you no longer have to water your crops anymore.

846
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: If you don't want to water your crops anymore, don't plant any more crops.

847
01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm.

848
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Do you have to go into the mine? No, you don't have to go in the mine if you don't want to.

849
01:01:51.179 --> 01:01:52.940
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, I love going in the mine, though.

850
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:55.820
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughter]

851
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I know. And that's fine. If you want to do that, absolutely. I love it as well.

852
01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.059
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

853
01:01:57.059 --> 01:01:57.559
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

854
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's one of the things that I really enjoy in star juice going into the mine and mining a bunch.

855
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:15.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: One of the things we did very early on in the podcast was did a mining challenge where played a star juice save where all we were allowed to do was mine and see how much money you could make.

856
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:23.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, that sounds great. I should do that challenge. That sounds awesome. That is a good point.

857
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It was actually really fun to do. I need to go back and do some more of these challenges, but it's been a while.

858
01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:27.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I put too much of an expectation on myself. I think it is a problem.

859
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:48.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think that's pretty common with farming games because you're like, "Oh, there's these things I can do. I can talk to people. I can farm. I can ranch. I can explore the mine. I can meet more people. There's a festival. There's so many things, but none of them you have to do.

860
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you really got it. Look, look after it. But if you really don't want to, you can go sell the

861
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.480
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

862
01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:10.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: level. Don't buy the animal in the first place, right? Like there's, you don't have to go fishing. You don't have to go exploring. There's none of these things you have to do. And I think that this is the trap that people fall into so often is going, I have to do these things and actually, no, focus on what you're enjoying.

863
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:22.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And then you might experience more of the things at some point and enjoy them and then continue on them. Like I quite often in my, I've talked about on this podcast, how when I start a new farming game,

864
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:39.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: often speedrun spring, because to me spring is quite boring. There's not a lot you can do. And so I will do as much as I can in terms of farming for my stamina. And I will focus on a couple of characters to talk to every day.

865
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:53.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And other than that, I won't do much. I'll go in, I'll talk to the people I'll do the farming and I'll do what I need to do. And then I'll go to bed and I'm quite often going to bed, you know, early afternoon, because there's nothing else to do. There's no stamina for me to do. And that's fine.

866
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Right. Like he says, you have to do all these things in a specific order at a specific time. That's why I love a bit.

867
01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:04.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. That's, that's very true. That's very, very true. And I definitely recognize that I put

868
01:04:04.179 --> 01:04:12.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: that expectation on myself. But the other thing is I also want to do all of those things is also

869
01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:18.179
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: have my problem too, because I do, that's definitely, and this definitely actually all these

870
01:04:18.179 --> 01:04:24.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: to burn out, essentially. But I do like to do all of those things. So like I somewhat recently,

871
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:29.699
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: installed like mods on my Stardew, so that I can pause time whenever I want. If I want to have

872
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:39.059
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: unlimited stamina, because I want to mine for however long on endlessly, I can do that. But I haven't

873
01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:43.539
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: fully taken advantage of those mods, because I also am trying to like find a balance of like,

874
01:04:44.099 --> 01:04:49.780
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: just whatever I feel like doing that day in Stardew, just do that and just don't worry about

875
01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: everything else and trying to like I guess essentially like give myself grace because I

876
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, absolutely.

877
01:04:54.500 --> 01:05:00.699
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like doing all the farming. I like doing all the mining. I like talking to all

878
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:26.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mm hmm. Well, well, look is I can't I can't I can help you there like if you you don't have to do everything but if you want to do everything then that's own that's all on you. I get that.

879
01:05:00.699 --> 01:05:04.340
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: the characters and when I say all the characters I mean all love the

880
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:12.219
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: characters because I like I love to get to know the characters in the game so it's a

881
01:05:12.219 --> 01:05:19.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: lot that's and that's totally I totally recognize that's on me but that is why I

882
01:05:19.579 --> 01:05:22.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I like that is the core, I know.

883
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:39.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But that's the core of the cottage core games as a whole, is that I can do all those things if I want to, and it's awesome that there's so much to do that I do like to do to be able to just immerse myself in that world.

884
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes.

885
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:54.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I feel like it's you don't get that from a like for example triple a game like I don't know why it's spider man was the first thing that came to mind, but you can't do that with spider man like yeah, there are a number of things that you can do like side quests and stuff to do enjoy.

887
01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:19.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But like the primary focus of the game is to progress the main storyline and sometimes I'm just not feeling that like yes, I'm still immersed in a world and immersed in like the story of the characters and everything, but sometimes I just want to hang out on a farm and slowly gets another characters while I decorate and take care of my plants and just.

888
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:24.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: cord endless stones from the minds because I really like to

889
01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:31.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: remind. [laughs]

890
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:34.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, no, I think you're totally right. I just think that the biggest thing that people have prop the biggest problem people have with these games is

891
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:43.639
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: They don't think of them as being choices. They think of them as being everything. I have to do everything and actually I think that Stardew and other games like it feels

892
01:06:43.639 --> 01:06:48.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Mystery or whatever. I know not everybody is the biggest fan of of any individual farming game

893
01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:52.280
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But I think they're all the same in that they give you

894
01:06:53.079 --> 01:06:55.639
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So many choices of things to do and that's what I mean.

895
01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:10.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: When I was thinking of life as hard to control sometimes, life can be difficult.

896
01:07:10.619 --> 01:07:16.179
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Sometimes it's better than others and different people have better or worse lives, but everybody

897
01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:21.980
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: goes through hardships and sometimes you just want to forget about the hardships and focus

898
01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.539
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: on something else and the good thing about cottage cooking.

899
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:52.099
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I don't need to go exploring the mines, I mean you probably want to at least do some of it to get stuff to upgrade your tools, but you don't need to.

900
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.840
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

901
01:07:52.099 --> 01:07:55.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And if I just want to have a chill casual

902
01:07:55.500 --> 01:08:17.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: life building up a big farm, I can do that. And nothing technically would ever go bad for you, your life in that. And that's not something you can ever have in real life, right? Like everybody, every person in the world, no matter who you are, will have bad stuff happen to you. But you can have a game where that's not the case and that's really nice.

903
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah. Yeah.

904
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I definitely agree and I guess also to add on to that as well is that farming games are

905
01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:35.359
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: relatively new in the landscape of games existing as a whole and I feel like there is this

906
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.840
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like it's difficult to be able to understand that you can play a game and

907
01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:48.239
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: you can play a farming sim and you don't have to do everything because the

908
01:08:48.000 --> 01:09:05.840
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: gaming environment for what feels like a long time is kind of like yeah you're supposed to do everything, you're supposed to do all these side quests, you're supposed to do this main story and it's like no you can just you don't have to talk to a single person in this game if you don't want to and that's okay you can just exist on the farm by yourself and...

909
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: that would that would be an interesting challenge to do is see how much you can do without talking to

910
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.479
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: anybody. The the uh, the Hermit, Hermit run.

911
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You didn't know I heard it, right?

912
01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Because you couldn't upgrade, you couldn't upgrade any tools. You wouldn't be able to buy

913
01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I'm sure you can do that.

914
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: To it, it can, to an extent.

915
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

916
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: anything so you'd have to get everything from the mines, I feel like, but you could still,

917
01:09:28.079 --> 01:09:28.920
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah.

918
01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.680
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you would still get seats that way. What would be the most efficient way to get seats in that?

919
01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I'm going to have to think through so I think this could be interesting.

920
01:09:36.199 --> 01:09:38.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Ah, well, but that's like the thing,

921
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.520
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: is that you could up to a certain extent, of course,

922
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: play the game that way.

923
01:09:43.039 --> 01:09:47.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and because the genre is still relatively so new.

924
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.439
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's not on everyone's scope or in everyone's radar that they have the option.

925
01:09:52.439 --> 01:10:03.399
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So someone like me that I would say only within the past maybe 10 years has been able to fully dedicate more time to gaming.

926
01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:16.760
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And because I struggled for a while, going from high school into college, where I was not gaming as much as I used to as a kid and really wanted to because I was so focused on my studies that I felt guilty for gaming.

927
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:27.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I fell out of gaming for a while, and then ever since pretty much like the last like 10 years is when I kind of started to like reclaim that for myself.

928
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:35.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And again, the farming game world is relatively within that 10 years is when it started to come up.

929
01:10:35.199 --> 01:10:44.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I came from an era of playing games where you had an objective, you had a main objective and you have to do that main objective in order to be able to progress the game.

930
01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and that's pretty much it.

931
01:10:47.000 --> 01:11:01.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: when I'm presented with all these options, I'm like in my head, I'm like this is the main objective, but again, the beauty of these games is that you don't, that is not the main objective, the main objective is just to do whatever you want and that is wonderful for these games.

932
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:15.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, so your flaw with your studies is what I did is I just stayed up all night and got no sleep and played lots of games and then regretted it in the morning and then continued that cycle over and over again.

933
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:24.779
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think I think if I was taking classes that didn't require my physical ability, I would

934
01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:33.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: probably do the same thing, realistically, but I think if I would not be smart of me to not

935
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.899
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, that's that's that's that. Yeah. Yeah. That's fair.

936
01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:43.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: get sleep prior to a flight lesson, I think that's definitely what it was.

937
01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:42.399
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I accept that. That is fair for the record for the record just in case it wasn't clear. I was joking.

938
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:59.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You can't tell me that wasn't sometimes though, but it's okay if you do some time.

939
01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:46.800
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But no, yeah, that

940
01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:54.399
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: No, no, I wasn't joking about doing it. I definitely did it. I was joking about suggesting that it's something anybody should do.

941
01:11:55.500 --> 01:12:23.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's not. I I look I when I was in university, that was when Minecraft came out and so that was I spent so like I have no idea how long right because it was before I was tracking any sort of gaming time and you know Minecraft was just standalone executable file. I don't think it tracked time.

942
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, no.

943
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Absolutely no idea how long I...

944
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:33.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I actually had played in Minecraft, but there were, you know, it was multiple days a week I would stay up to like 4am playing.

945
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, consistently.

946
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

947
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And it's very funny because now my youngest is playing Minecraft.

948
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Awwwwwwww.

949
01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:49.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And it's very funny that he's now doing that. I spent so long doing in university, he's now playing.

950
01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:52.100
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Aww. That's cute. That's really, really cute.

951
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Completely independent from me. I never mentioned the game to him. He's just like

952
01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:01.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: found it through like watching you know YouTubers and stuff.

953
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: -Mm-hmm. -No, I love that.

954
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Runs in Minecraft, runs in the DNA confirmed.

955
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, so she gets started on farming games, shouldn't I?

956
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [Laughter]

957
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't think you have to. It's in the DNA.

958
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [Laughter]

959
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm convinced that whatever games you've sunk,

960
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: now I've convinced myself whatever games you've sunk,

961
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: the most time into during your formative years

962
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and just growing up in general.

963
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.180
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's in the DNA, is it?

964
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:36.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It sounds like I wouldn't be surprised either.

965
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I mean I wouldn't be surprised.

966
01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: If he's on, if he's on the path of Minecraft,

967
01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: then I think it's only natural that farming games are only coming.

968
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Or what's going to be coming next?

969
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:58.939
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, yeah, well, we'll see, right are there any of your points that you haven't discussed maybe that one

970
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Only time can tell.

971
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Um, let's see.

972
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:11.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean, I do I, yeah, I was going to say I do definitely enjoy because I also have a hard time like trying to set to decide what I want to do because again, I want to do everything.

973
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:17.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So when I'm given a request to be able to focus on that request, I do really like that.

974
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:25.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I really, really, really enjoy that about farming games is that they gave me a very small specific objective and I can complete that objective.

975
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.479
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I get some extra money, I can use that money to do whatever I want.

976
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm that point. I enjoyed that. I enjoyed that loop a lot.

977
01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, that's fair it's almost like that's the same as what you were talking about with Pokemon as well

978
01:14:39.000 --> 01:15:00.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, there's a trend. There's a trend. I love side quests in general. It's something there's something about side quests that I just really, I enjoy that those little mini, I think that's just another like little mini storyline that I enjoy and I just enjoy little storylines, which is what ties back into like I enjoy getting to know the characters within farming games.

979
01:14:39.659 --> 01:14:41.659
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: doing all the side quests and

980
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.899
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, it's also the progress thing as well, right?

981
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like I don't.

982
01:15:01.899 --> 01:15:03.899
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like you very quickly see progress that way.

983
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, yeah, it feels it feels like a good a good way to to me.

984
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:27.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: How do I like I mean, I don't getting more money. I don't know if that's necessarily like a significance way to see progress versus like seeing my farm grow over time. I enjoy both of those to be fair. I do enjoy both of those. So.

985
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.359
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I mean they're heavily tied together right if you're playing in the traditional you farm to get money sort of way

986
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:38.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I like just hoarding things like I like hoarding money. I like hoarding items. I like to organize those items.

987
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:49.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And then taking all those things that I've hoarded and then putting them into like my farm. I that that loop. I really enjoy being able to.

988
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.939
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: born to be a billionaire

989
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't think that's ever going to happen. I really don't think that's ever going to happen.

990
01:15:52.899 --> 01:16:02.340
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: no I do I i I find really funny is when people are like oh if I was a billionaire I would do all these things to help people and i'm like and that's why you'll never be a billionaire

991
01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.140
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: well not the only reason but one of the reasons

992
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.479
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

993
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:07.319
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - Yeah, that's true.

994
01:16:07.319 --> 01:16:09.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I always say to myself,

995
01:16:09.119 --> 01:16:12.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm like, if I were to ever win the lottery,

996
01:16:12.579 --> 01:16:15.079
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't need all of that money.

997
01:16:15.079 --> 01:16:16.680
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I really don't need all of that money.

998
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.180
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I just need enough money to be able to get my own little,

999
01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.899
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like, log cabin in the middle of the woods.

1000
01:16:24.119 --> 01:16:28.880
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And that's really it's with a great internet connection,

1001
01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.020
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: with a good internet connection.

1002
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: the best internet connection.

1003
01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And that's really it.

1004
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.119
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't, I don't need.

1005
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:44.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I'm like, yeah, I would not be a billionaire because I would just be giving all that money to everyone else that does need it. So everyone else can do the same thing that they want to do. I don't need all that money.

1006
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:50.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I just need enough to be able to sustain myself and do the, the, whatever I want to do.

1007
01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughter]

1008
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And then I would never work a day in my life and I would probably just play a lot of more, I would probably play a lot more farming games.

1009
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.859
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

1010
01:16:58.859 --> 01:16:59.979
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And a lot more persona.

1011
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: A lot more persona. I would eventually finish persona.

1012
01:17:02.979 --> 01:17:05.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

1013
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: One day that'll happen.

1014
01:17:05.619 --> 01:17:07.180
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Maybe you'll be finished persona three

1015
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: We'll see.

1016
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: We got persona three, not persona three, persona four remakes coming.

1017
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Maybe I'll finish it in time for that, but probably not.

1018
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Depends what you define as finished, right?

1019
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I think once you finish persona, it's like it, but also I don't know because I never played a persona game before. I think because it's all story based.

1020
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Right, okay, fair enough.

1021
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I also like persona because I also like getting to know like the little side, like the side story lines with all the characters. So it's all coming together.

1022
01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.260
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Side quests all the way down.

1023
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:51.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Side quest, yeah, side quest all the way down, getting to know characters all the way down, being able to just turn the brain off all the way down.

1024
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But turn it all the way down, and I just turn my brain off.

1025
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Those are some of the core, all of it just turn all of it, all of it.

1026
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It's all I've asked me for.

1027
01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.899
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I want to be an immersive world to turn my brain off.

1028
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.979
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: The real world's I'm trying to think of this anything else.

1029
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.859
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

1030
01:18:05.859 --> 01:18:06.699
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think we're done.

1031
01:18:08.979 --> 01:18:12.680
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I'm like, are there any other other points?

1032
01:18:11.979 --> 01:18:13.100
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's okay to be done.

1033
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.640
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, man.

1034
01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.920
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Well, actually, no, I have I do have a question.

1035
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.800
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I have a question for you because I have I have a point of like decorating.

1036
01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:18.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Go for it.

1037
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.359
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I like decorating a lot too.

1038
01:18:22.359 --> 01:18:26.279
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: As evident by the fact that I like games like house flipper as well.

1039
01:18:26.279 --> 01:18:29.520
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: How do you feel about decorating within really?

1040
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:35.100
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Oh I hate it. It's not that I have anything against it, right? Like I love that people can do that

1041
01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:40.939
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and have, you know, I just don't have that creativity in me, the creativity for design.

1042
01:18:42.699 --> 01:18:49.659
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I don't care. What I do like is like laying out my farm in a particular way to make it the most

1043
01:18:49.659 --> 01:18:55.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: efficient for what I want to do. I like that. It's kind of a similar sort of thing, I guess.

1044
01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:02.520
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Hmm. Yeah, I think so. I think for me, I like how my farm looks. I think I'm definitely a static

1045
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:08.140
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like, yeah, I know my absolutely not for me, but like my house is like every single time,

1046
01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:14.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: if I can move the bed, I will move the bed to the next to the door. So I can walk in the house

1047
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.180
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughter]

1048
01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:23.579
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and beds there, right? You immediately can fall asleep. It's purely a place to keep the stuff that

1049
01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, no, that's--

1050
01:19:23.579 --> 01:19:27.460
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: that I need to keep and nothing else. I don't care about

1051
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:33.619
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: it like making it look fancy. I will, which is funny because like I will obviously expand my home because you know to finish

1052
01:19:34.579 --> 01:19:41.020
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: some of the storylines in these games you need to expand your home, but I'm like expanding my home and putting nothing in it, because I don't care about it.

1053
01:19:41.539 --> 01:19:43.539
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's just like this big, empty space.

1054
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.279
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [both laughing]

1055
01:19:45.279 --> 01:19:48.479
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: How do you feel in regards to getting to know the characters?

1056
01:19:48.479 --> 01:19:50.279
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I assume you liked that too, right?

1057
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.720
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes, yeah. Yeah, no, definitely. I think it does, it takes a lot for me to cater about the characters.

1058
01:19:50.279 --> 01:19:52.159
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: 'Cause you were making the joke about Clint.

1059
01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:53.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Okay.

1060
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.359
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: There is, you know, maybe a, a hand fill that I could tell you about in story season's grand desire.

1061
01:20:03.359 --> 01:20:08.159
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Most of them don't really care about. Stardew, I think, is unique in how many characters are

1062
01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:14.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: feel like well-rounded people and I could actually talk about. So it just, yeah, it depends on the

1063
01:20:14.319 --> 01:20:18.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: farming game and who they are. I think they have to have something about them that makes them

1064
01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.939
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: interesting for me to care.

1065
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I don't automatically care about learning about people, they have to hug me.

1066
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:31.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That's fair. I'm like, just thinking on it. I think I, because I think they don't have to

1067
01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:37.579
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: automatically hook me, because I know they probably will eventually have some,

1068
01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:46.380
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: get some reaction out of me, whether it's me liking them, or feeling indifferent about them,

1069
01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:52.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: or not liking them. I think all of those reactions still all interest me in one sense or another,

1070
01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:55.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I think that also stems from the fact that I just like meeting new people.

1071
01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:01.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And whether I get along with them or not is a up for debate, but it's just interesting to meet new people.

1072
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:56.840
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Oh yeah.

1073
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:07.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So having that experience within games kind of feels somewhat akin to meeting a new person.

1074
01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:20.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I do enjoy that. But it's funny because I also don't like people, but I also just think it's people are just interesting, which makes sense why I have like a general interest in psychology.

1075
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.140
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: What does I hate people so?

1076
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:24.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Because I think people are just interesting in general.

1077
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.439
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I do think people are interesting, but from afar, so I like to people watch if I'm somewhere

1078
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: It ties into it as well.

1079
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:34.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: There.

1080
01:21:32.439 --> 01:21:35.479
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: in public, but I'm never going to go talk to any of them.

1081
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:39.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I guess for me to I'm also forced to talk to new people, whether I like it or not.

1082
01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:44.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Because I meet new people almost every day with my job.

1083
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.060
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, yeah, that's

1084
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:51.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I, and I'm stuck with this person, but whether it's one day or five days, I'm stuck with this person.

1085
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:55.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So I have to get to know them whether I like it or not.

1086
01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:03.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So maybe that is an aspect too, but it's always, I always come away with something and I like learn something about myself too, which is always very interesting to me.

1087
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:23.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But I think a big difference between you and I when it comes to cottagecore games is one of the things that we like is creating an efficient system versus creating an aesthetic system and those are both things that you can achieve within a farming game that I think is cool.

1088
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:23.340
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: - Choice.

1089
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yes.

1090
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:32.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Having that choice is very nice to be able to, like you said, like, live the life that you want to live within the game.

1091
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:39.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: For me, I want to be somewhat efficient, but I want to also like what I'm looking at.

1092
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:46.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Like, I think I already said this, but just in case I didn't, if I don't like how a game looks, it's hard for me to play the game.

1093
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:55.119
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: That's fair I don't personally have that but I get why you would I think turn extreme obviously like there's some games where I look and go

1094
01:22:55.119 --> 01:22:59.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I just can't imagine like do you know the one that I find fascinating as vampire survivors I

1095
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:22.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh my god. My. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:23:01.159 --> 01:23:06.560
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Do not understand why anybody likes to play that game because it just looks so bad

1097
01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:13.319
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like it doesn't even look it doesn't even look like it was you know a good looking game in the 90s or I know it's a new game

1098
01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:15.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And I'm not trying to say, but like you know how so

1099
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.840
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: you're looking at a game and it's from the 90 like oh boy, this looks dreadful, but I can understand why people liked it at the time

1100
01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:25.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And vampires the fibers if it was around the 90s would have looked like a bad game at that time as well

1101
01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's just it just ugly ugly game

1102
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:35.979
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, man, you were speaking to my heart right now, because my husband loves vampire survivors.

1103
01:23:35.979 --> 01:23:41.659
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And I might like vampire survivors, but the aesthetics of that game, like the cover for

1104
01:23:41.659 --> 01:23:48.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: the game in itself and just like, oh, and then I just, I, I also am not a fan of the aesthetics

1105
01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:55.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: of that game, but, um, my husband is convinced that I would like the game so much so that

1106
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: the first.

1107
01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.260
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: and he bought it for me and then it became

1108
01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:05.020
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: on my stream and then the sub go was met and now I have to play vampires if I was at some point on my stream and I'm looking forward to it

1109
01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:08.020
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But also dreading it because I don't like how the game looks aesthetically

1110
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.819
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I just I mean, I don't understand the concept of why you would enjoy the game full-stop either, right? Like it's just like

1111
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't know.

1112
01:24:14.659 --> 01:24:21.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It's it doesn't feel to me like there's any skill or any actual thing you can do other than just like it just

1113
01:24:21.399 --> 01:24:26.859
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: The whole point is to feel powerful, but like you don't actually have to do anything to get to that point

1114
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:32.060
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But the first time I saw a screenshot of it because like I'd heard about it so much and like what people really love this

1115
01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:36.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Doesn't sound like the sorry game. I'd play a bit fine. Whatever. I get it like people like different things

1116
01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and then I saw a screenshot, I'm like,

1117
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.439
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: this is the game they've been talking about, this looks dreadful.

1118
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.439
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: [laughing]

1119
01:24:41.439 --> 01:24:42.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: - What it did, ah!

1120
01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: So the one podcast you did, what, what,

1121
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.720
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I do you remember what it was?

1122
01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:50.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: 'Cause remember how like Stardew became

1123
01:24:50.199 --> 01:24:52.640
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: like the most positively rated?

1124
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.479
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Vampire Survivor is like top 10 in that list, right?

1125
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yes, yeah, we did, I think we mentioned that in passing, yeah, I can't.

1126
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't remember what it was to,

1127
01:25:01.199 --> 01:25:05.159
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: but it's one of the most highly rated games in Steam.

1128
01:25:05.159 --> 01:25:07.159
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And also again, my husband loves it.

1129
01:25:07.159 --> 01:25:09.039
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: as one of his favorite games to like put on.

1130
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:32.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And watch YouTube videos to and just turn his brain off to and I just do not understand it because I look at it and I'm like, I'm stressed. There's so much stimulus happening. There's so much going on. It's not even cute looking, but like it's highly rated for a reason and I just don't know what that is. So I feel like I should try it and I am going to try it eventually. So maybe I'll keep you posted on that. I'll let you know.

1131
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.079
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: [laughing]

1132
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:38.300
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, look, I mean, different people like different things and I'm not saying that, you know,

1133
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.220
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: one should like or dislike. I just, I just don't get it.

1134
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:49.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I mean to, but I do have that curiosity to try to understand why. And if I don't, that's okay.

1135
01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:57.020
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Fair enough. I know there are so many more games that I would actually enjoy so I'm not going to play a game that I am pretty sure I'm not going to enjoy

1136
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: And that's fair. That's totally fair.

1137
01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: It was the Tamagotji Plaza if

1138
01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:05.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh, my God. Oh, man.

1139
01:26:05.699 --> 01:26:08.939
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That was one of the, that was one of the podcasts that I, I didn't, uh,

1140
01:26:08.939 --> 01:26:12.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I was able to catch up with them and listen to. Oh, that made me so sad.

1141
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.279
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, the lice said about it the best the better

1142
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.739
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, I think it's that I didn't look at, to be fair, I didn't look at the,

1143
01:26:24.739 --> 01:26:26.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't remember the aesthetics of the game.

1144
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.420
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Negostatically without the--

1145
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:35.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: game, everything else. As much as I'm into this, that exhibit game, I don't--nothing could say that game from what it sounds like. I just don't care. I just don't care.

1146
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.420
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: down Paris survivors is number six, by the way.

1147
01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:41.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: So there you go.

1148
01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:43.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Number six. Yeah, I don't know.

1149
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.239
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Number six, it goes.

1150
01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:44.520
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Stardew Valley portal to Teraria,

1151
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.640
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: people playground, left for dead two,

1152
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.239
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: and then down Paris survivors.

1153
01:26:48.239 --> 01:26:50.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: And then Util truck simulator two,

1154
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.439
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Ooh, I remember I used to not like the aesthetics of Hades, and then all of a sudden I did.

1155
01:26:56.439 --> 01:26:59.300
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I don't know what happened.

1156
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.479
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I, I mean, I think it looks gorgeous. It's a really, the looks of it is definitely not the issue that I ever had with that game.

1157
01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:04.680
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, it's wonderful.

1158
01:27:05.479 --> 01:27:08.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: There were many edges I had with that game that was not it.

1159
01:27:09.079 --> 01:27:11.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: That is fair, that is fair.

1160
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.600
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: For whatever reason, I used to not like the aesthetics of the game at all, then all of a sudden something flipped and I like the aesthetics now, and I think they're awesome, but

1161
01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.960
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Vampire survivor says not done that, but I am very happy to get a stone.

1162
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:47.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Give it a chance, and it must be highly rated for a reason for most people, so I'm curious to see what it is, but if I don't like it, that's okay too, because you know you know you're not going to like it, and that's fine, but also just goes to show that aesthetics also don't mean everything, but it's something that I like to prioritize when it comes to games. Oh my God, yeah.

1163
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.800
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Look, I, we both, we both have played Pokemon for so many years, right?

1164
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.439
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Like, if if aesthetics was everything, we would have been turned off at some point.

1165
01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:14.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: You're telling me red and blue is not aesthetic. True. Yeah, I agree, but in this modern day.

1166
01:27:55.039 --> 01:28:03.680
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I I mean, at the time, it was amazing, right? That that that it ran like there are so

1167
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: many bugs with it. It's it's a miracle that I game works at all. But in terms of how it looks,

1168
01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I like to add the--.

1169
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:25.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I'm so glad we're back to people complaining about how the game looks rather than people complaining about how the game runs terribly. I'm just so glad we're back.

1170
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:38.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I work back the-- the-- the, um, sword and shield day days. People hate how the game looks, but it runs well. Yay. We're back to status for it with what?

1171
01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.199
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah! Yeah!

1172
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.640
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, we're back to equilibrium.

1173
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I could time.

1174
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:47.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I can I go I like I get why people care I do not care. Let's keep going.

1175
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Oh man.

1176
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: All right.

1177
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Joining me for this fun discussion.

1178
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Why would like.

1179
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Of course, not even game.

1180
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I still say which one it was.

1181
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: But you may be both.

1182
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:07.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Depending on where you look at this episode and in our back end for where I put the shorts and stuff.

1183
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.039
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: or not and stuff. Sometimes it's called "Why do we let?"

1184
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.239
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: like farming games, sometimes it's cottagecore.

1185
01:29:12.239 --> 01:29:18.880
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: I think maybe on one I actually wrote a farming/cottagecore, I lose track, but I could not decide

1186
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:26.979
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I I think I remember I like that the Google Drive folder is just why we like them

1187
01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.439
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: what the name of this episode was.

1188
01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.100
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Yeah, I'd given up by that point.

1189
01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.460
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: that should be the title of just this episode alone it's just why we like them that's it

1190
01:29:33.619 --> 01:29:34.220
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Right. Wait, like.

1191
01:29:37.579 --> 01:29:38.380
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Oh, dear.

1192
01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.619
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: no context why we like them

1193
01:29:40.699 --> 01:29:42.539
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Well, anyway, thank you for joining me.

1194
01:29:42.539 --> 01:29:44.500
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: Uh, is there anything you would like to share with?

1195
01:29:45.500 --> 01:30:08.000
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Um, well first of all, thank you again for having me. This was a fun discussion and I have learned many wonderful things about myself and you and farming slash cottage core games at a whole as a whole, um, as for me, I guess you can find me just about anywhere as per usual.

1196
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Um, I should have, after this episode comes out, our next episode.

1197
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:36.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: A episode of Moo and Coo, our podcast out, um, spoilers for what we're talking about. I don't have them because we were supposed to have one guest and scheduling fell through then we were supposed to have another guest and then scheduling fell through. So now it's just going to be Chris and I and we have no idea what to talk about. So, stay tuned.

1198
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:45.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: But otherwise, you can find me at some point on Twitch playing.

1199
01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:59.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Legends EA at the moment and hopefully outer wilds again. Ais trainer and you can find me on all all other socials when I am off of my social media hiatus at the same place.

1200
01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:12.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: I am just really trying to avoid spoilers because the internet sucks and I'm a really slow gamer and spoilers are everywhere so I'm just taking a break from social media as a whole for now.

1201
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
<v B3088873-8810-4C87-B21B-BD94F0547680>Al: The only thing I've had spoil farming is a few of the mega-designs, but not all of them.

1202
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:25.500
<v 5F50222A-FE2D-46AF-994C-32CB54757CB0>Aislinn: Yeah, me too, thankfully, but it's the one, one of them that I got spoiled before was like one of my favorites that I was curious to see.

1203
