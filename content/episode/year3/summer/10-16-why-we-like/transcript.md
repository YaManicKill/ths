## Intro

(30s) **Al:**

> Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al.

(35s) **Aislinn:**

> And my name is Aslan.

(36s) **Al:**

> And we are here today to talk about cartridge go games.

(39s) **Aislinn:**

> Oooh.

(41s) **Al:**

> Welcome back, Aslan. Spinowile.

(44s) **Aislinn:**

> Hello, has it been now? I guess it has been a little bit, huh?

(48s) **Al:**

> For me. I mean, you- you- you- are we? No. We did one. We did one at the beginning of this month. Never mind.

(51s) **Aislinn:**

> I was like, "Who do we record?" Like, "Lause?"

(55s)

> "Lause?"

(58s) **Al:**

> That's the one where it'd be no way.

(58s) **Aislinn:**

> It feels like it's been...

(1m) **Al:**

> Well, that was it.

(1m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, it feels like it's been an eternity.

(1m 4s) **Al:**

> What has October being even, right?

(1m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> I went...

(1m 7s)

> I... Yeah, it's been like, I feel like I've been through hell and back.

(1m 14s) **Al:**

> A WOOO!

(1m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> Whoo!

(1m 19s) **Al:**

> Well, welcome back, Aislin.

(1m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> What is this?

(1m 21s) **Al:**

> It's not been a while.

(1m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> Whoo!

(1m 25s) **Al:**

> In fact, I've only been on one more episode since that episode.

(1m 30s)

> That's, that's, that's where my brain is at.

(1m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I love the way that this is starting.

(1m 34s) **Al:**

> So let's keep going.

(1m 35s) **Aislinn:**

> This is...

(1m 36s) **Al:**

> This episode, we are going to talk about why we like farming/caughticle games.

(1m 43s)

> This was a topic suggested by Clem, one of our patrons and my friend.

(1m 53s)

> So we are going to talk about that, thought it was an interesting topic.

(1m 56s)

> I don't think we've ever actually properly discussed

(2m)

> why it is that we like farming/caughticle games.

(2m 3s)

> And I thought a good person to talk about that would be aisling.

(2m 5s)

> So that's why we're here.

(2m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> I appreciate it.

(2m 9s) **Al:**

> And before that, we obviously have some news.

## What Have We Been Up To

(2m 13s) **Al:**

> And first of all, Aisling, what have you been up to?

(2m 15s) **Aislinn:**

> I have been up to, now that I finish my work recurrent test and everything, I've been trying

(2m 23s)

> to work my way back into gaming, very, very light though still primarily still slowly working

(2m 31s)

> my way through persona and I read all of all that, that extra information in the slack and

(2m 37s)

> everything about why you may or may not like persona, which was very interesting to read,

(2m 40s) **Al:**

> - Have you been playing it like a little chunks here and there?

(2m 45s)

> Like really slowly sort of thing.

(2m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, yeah, I primarily have been playing it before bed whenever I have the energy and I have some time before I have to go to sleep, so I'll play it for like 30, 45 minutes.

(2m 57s)

> I've just been doing a lot of dungeon crawling, I guess you could say, is the best way to explain it, or I guess Tartarus progress and whatnot, which makes me very relaxed.

(3m 7s)

> So I've been enjoying it in that sense, which in theory doesn't make sense because it's like strategy thinking because of the Tartarus.

(3m 15s)

> I've been doing that, and then obviously Pokemon Legends EA, and then also, yeah, I won't ramble about that just yet.

(3m 25s) **Al:**

> Which we're gonna talk about in a minute.

(3m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> But then also, I've been really, really, really, really itching to get back to Outer Wilds.

(3m 37s) **Al:**

> Is that the one where it's it's a roguelike and like the sun's exploding or something? Is that that one?

(3m 44s)

> Or is that different? Is that game?

(3m 44s) **Aislinn:**

> Yes. I love the way that you, I just, I guess, technically it is a roguelike, I guess you could say.

(3m 51s)

> I just, it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I, you're not wrong, you're definitely not wrong.

(3m 55s) **Al:**

> Is that not how you would describe it?

(3m 58s)

> I mean, it was around before like the roguelike term like became in everybody's vernacular, so maybe that's what?

(4m 6s) **Aislinn:**

> I guess so. I just, because it is technically a roguelike, it does keep repeating itself over and over,

(4m 11s)

> but the thing is it's like, I guess I hesitate to say it.

(4m 14s)

> Because it's time-based rather than, like, a rogue, like, you keep going until, like, you die.

(4m 23s)

> But this while, eh, each, you know, yeah, but, like, it's, like, under your control.

(4m 23s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, but you are doing that. You're dying when the sun explodes, right? Like

(4m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> But I also don't know if it, I haven't finished the game, so I'm, like, it's out of my control.

(4m 35s)

> I have no idea. I'm still working on the game to figure out what is happening.

(4m 39s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that also feels like an arbitrary restriction to the like I feel like the point of

(4m 46s)

> roguelikes is it's it's it's when you die you go back to the waiting and it doesn't matter

(4m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> - Mm-hmm.

(4m 51s) **Al:**

> whether the dying is in your control or not right like to me the point is you are replaying

(4m 57s)

> something and that's the primary kind of way how the game progresses is by replaying things

(5m 5s)

> over and over.

(5m 6s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I guess I'm like comparing like the thing that I'm struggling with is comparing like Hades

(5m 9s) **Al:**

> Mhm.

(5m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> versus Outer Wilds and they feel like two entirely different games in my head, but

(5m 17s)

> I Outer Wilds is like a broke leg. I agree with everything that you just said. I do a

(5m 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I

(5m 24s)

> Mean they don't have to be like combat folk combat focus that's your issue, right?

(5m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, no, that's fair. That's fair bird. I think I think that's what it is in my head

(5m 31s)

> It's combat focused, but obviously it's not that case and outer wilds outer wilds. It's just all exploration

(5m 32s) **Al:**

> Yeah, no

(5m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> But yeah, great game. Great game though. I just I want more time to be able to sink in to be able to like fully

(5m 43s)

> Explore everything properly and understand all the research notes and whatnot, but that's like a that's been like

(5m 49s)

> If that came out this year so far, I'll be my like my game of the year outer wilds is amazing so far

(5m 56s)

> Otherwise, that's pretty much it!

(5m 57s)

> It's been it. Yeah, it's been it.

(6m 2s) **Al:**

> No one seems it seems like looking on the internet nobody seems to actually really consider a roguelike but nobody seems to have a good reason why.

(6m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> That might be the point of the game!

(6m 13s)

> Potentially, there's a whole- it's- it's- apparently it's such an impactful game for like

(6m 20s)

> me and so-or not for me, for so many of my friends, and my husband included, he already

(6m 26s)

> finished the game, he beat the game, but he loved the game so much as one of the favorite

(6m 29s)

> games of all time now, so much so that he's going to get two tattoos, most likely, of

(6m 34s)

> the- from like the game, so that maybe could be a reason why people don't really have

(6m 39s)

> much of an explanation.

(6m 40s)

> There's some tags on games on Steam that I look at it, and I'm like, "That doesn't

(6m 47s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(6m 49s)

> My favorite discussion--

(6m 51s)

> Game genres.

(6m 52s)

[laughs]

(7m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> make sense."

(7m 2s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, interesting. Yeah, well, all right. Yeah, before we go down that rabbit hole,

(7m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> But to some people that game genre is correct, but other people, it's like, "Nope, that's

(7m 9s)

> - Not it.

(7m 11s)

> - That could be another podcast topic, maybe.

(7m 14s)

[laughs]

(7m 15s)

> But anyways, what have you been up to?

(7m 17s)

[laughs]

(7m 20s)

> - Yeah.

(7m 20s) **Al:**

> we do not have time for that. Um, I played a, since my last episode, I played a bit more wonderstop.

(7m 26s)

> I forget. Had I been playing that when we did our last episode, I think I'd maybe just started it.

(7m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> - Woo-hoo!

(7m 31s)

> - I feel like timeline wise you may have just started it.

(7m 34s)

> I think you were, I remember when we last spoke you were,

(7m 37s)

> you were talking about starting it.

(7m 39s)

> I don't think you have started it.

(7m 39s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's, yeah, it looks, yeah,

(7m 40s) **Aislinn:**

> But then for shortly after you did start it.

(7m 43s) **Al:**

> looking at the show notes from that episode.

(7m 45s)

> I had not started at that point,

(7m 46s)

> but yeah, maybe I mentioned that I was going to.

(7m 50s)

> I have not finished it.

(7m 51s)

> My plan was to try and finish it

(7m 53s)

> before the agency came out.

(7m 56s)

> And I think what I said to Kevin was,

(7m 58s)

> if I don't do that, it's probably because it's not hooked me

(8m 2s)

> as much as it has other people.

(8m 4s)

> I have not finished it.

(8m 6s)

> and I...

(8m 9s)

> Yes, that's basically what it is, right? I don't feel the draw to go back to it, like I do with most games that I kind of like throw loads of time into.

(8m 18s)

> And it's not that it's a bad game, none of the individual elements I dislike.

(8m 26s)

> But there's nothing about the game that's making me go, I really want to experience this.

(8m 32s)

> And I think part of the problem is, this is going to sound silly from someone who runs a podcast about cottagecore games.

(8m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay. Okay.

(8m 40s) **Al:**

> It feels slow and rambling.

(8m 45s)

> And the characters are clearly like, you know, trying to do something, and there's clearly a story that is wanting to do.

(8m 53s)

> I get what it's trying to do. I do. I'll tell you what's funny.

(8m 58s)

> So, the night who's one of the first two characters you experience.

(9m 5s)

> But the main character's reaction to that night was exactly my...

(9m 9s)

> reaction just like you know rolling your eyes and going I can't believe I'm having to deal with this idiot and I feel like the game wants me to soften to these characters a little bit and be like oh they actually like there's a reason why you should like them or ever and I've just not felt that.

(9m 10s) **Aislinn:**

[laughs]

(9m 24s)

> Uh huh.

(9m 25s) **Al:**

> And clearly that's where it's going to be going with the story overall but I just yeah I just I'm sitting there playing the going going okay fine right time to go make some more tea.

(9m 39s)

> Like let's continue playing this game it's like I guess I need to go do this sort of thing and I'm not because I'm not like bought into the story as much I think if if I was finding the story more engaging I would probably kind of push through those bits like the team making is very involved and involves a lot of processes that involves a lot of walking over the map and I don't particularly find that

(9m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(10m 10s)

> Okay, that's fair. That's fair. I will just add on that I do think that even if you didn't

(10m 17s)

> soften, like you were saying to the characters and kind of find like a soft spot for them,

(10m 23s)

> I think you could still enjoy the game because I think the game kind of wants you to feel that way,

(10m 29s)

> but also if you don't, I think you can still enjoy the game.

(10m 34s)

> But I do see where you're going with how you're feeling. If you don't,

(10m 40s)

> like the characters that kind of is half the game, but I see where you're going. I'm trying to

(10m 47s)

> like not ramble too much about it because I also don't know where you are exactly in the game

(10m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think I've, I think I've experienced four different characters and I've, all of them have annoyed me in a different way.

(10m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> at this moment.

(10m 59s) **Al:**

> Um, yeah, well, that's the thing that's exactly it, but, but, but, but, but I'm get a bit like it's clearly right the game is clearly setting up the fact that she's then going to care about this right. She doesn't care. She doesn't want to be there.

(11m) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, so you're just Ulta.

(11m 5s)

> Yeah.

(11m 15s) **Al:**

> she wants to go do something else but she's clearly going

(11m 18s)

> to learn that she actually does need to be there and wants to be there and cares about these people despite trying so hard not to and maybe if I continued playing I would do the same I don't know but like I mean you can't say anything really to react to this because you'll just spoil the game for people who haven't played it.

(11m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> Uh, uh, yeah.

(11m 32s)

> I know, yeah.

(11m 34s) **Al:**

> So I understand I understand that frustration but we are probably going to get you and Kevin to do a spoiler episode on it where you can then and obviously I will listen to that whether I finish the game or not.

(11m 34s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm like, ah.

(11m 42s)

> Oh, yeah.

(11m 47s)

> Okay.

(11m 48s) **Al:**

> Let's let's I guess put a pin in that and we'll see what comes out of that. Sorry.

(11m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, yeah.

(11m 55s)

> I already know in the Kevin dedicated thread, there's going to be some heated words from him.

(12m)

> He's going to be whoosh.

(12m 3s)

> But yeah, I will, I will, I will abstain any additional comments.

(12m 4s) **Al:**

> Uh...

(12m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> I will just hold it to myself because I do, I do understand.

(12m 12s)

> I, I will admit that initially playing the game.

(12m 15s)

> I did feel a sense of frustration because I didn't know what to do, but

(12m 19s)

> without spoiling the game, I feel like I could safely say that that was

(12m 23s)

> kind of half the point of the game.

(12m 25s)

> is that it's okay if you don't know what to do.

(12m 29s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I know. Well, this is the, this is the thing. I get that as a concept, right? And in real life,

(12m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> That sounds crazy.

(12m 30s)

> It doesn't make the game sound appealing at all, but I, it, it makes the game

(12m 33s)

> all the more appealing.

(12m 38s) **Al:**

> yes, but also that's not what I want out of playing games. You know, it's, it's, it's one of

(12m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Uh-huh.

(12m 44s)

> And that, that is fair.

(12m 45s)

> That is, that is completely valid.

(12m 50s) **Al:**

> these things where it's like I totally have, you know, grace for people and think that, you know,

(12m 57s)

> mistakes. You make mistakes.

(12m 59s)

> Don't be yourself up, but me. I will be myself up.

(13m 6s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(13m 8s) **Al:**

> It's like grace for you and not for me, and that is, you know, and with games like, I, it's

(13m 17s)

> not like, I'm not trying, I don't want it to sound like I don't want any kind of deep things

(13m 21s)

> in my games. I obviously do. I like deep stuff, some of the best things in Stardew or

(13m 26s)

> like the deep characters

(13m 29s)

> are really really moved me. But that night as the demon hunter, like they're just such stupid characters.

(13m 30s) **Aislinn:**

> I think I also, to be fair, I also like the silliness, but that's a personal preference.

(13m 47s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I like, yeah, I like some silliness. There's something particular about this silliness that just makes me go, I think it's because of how sincere they are in their silliness.

(13m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> And I totally recognize it's personal preference.

(13m 59s)

> Mm-hmm

(13m 59s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know. It's hard. Anyway. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not saying I won't go back to it. I probably will, but obviously I'm not going to not going to do it just now because I am busy with something else.

(14m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> Sit on it sit on that see if you continue to progress with the game, you know

(14m 12s) **Al:**

> But before we get to that, I do want to talk about it, I did buy the Xbox

(14m 17s)

> Alliex, that's the new handheld, the ROG Xbox console, to replace my Steam Deck,

(14m 27s)

> because it's the most Steam decks filling a little bit, it's a little bit old,

(14m 30s)

> so the original Steam Deck and I got the smallest storage, etc, etc, 64 gigabytes, not a lot of gigabytes.

(14m 38s)

> So I bought this because mainly because I really like the fact that it has integration with Game Pass,

(14m 47s)

> it's kind of built in and obviously it's one of the newer faster chips as well.

(14m 53s)

> And thought it would be interesting to use that.

(14m 57s)

> It's obviously not cheap and the part of the problem is I have not played with it very much,

(15m 4s)

> because it came out on the same day as Pokemon did.

(15m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm K-A-D-E.

(15m 8s) **Al:**

> So I will probably have more to talk about it in the future.

(15m 14s)

> It's interesting, I like it.

(15m 17s)

> Ergonomics are very nice, it's really nice to hold, it's nicer than the Steam deck to hold, which is good.

(15m 23s)

> It's very chunky, it's very thick, but it does mean that it's battery is better as well.

(15m 29s)

> It does have like a streamed down Windows interface, but let me tell you, they have a lot of bugs with that.

(15m 36s)

> A lot of times, random windows will pop up and you're just like, "Oh, here's this random window,"

(15m 42s)

> and it doesn't fit the scheming at all, the theme and stuff like that.

(15m 47s)

> And then suddenly this random window is window pops up and you're like, "Oh, what are you doing there?"

(15m 51s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(15m 53s) **Al:**

> So it feels a little bit like the hardware was ready, but the software was not quite there yet,

(16m) **Aislinn:**

> Okay. Okay.

(16m) **Al:**

> and they're hopefully going to be updating it over the next couple of months, and it will get nicer.

(16m 4s)

> It doesn't have as good sleep and quick resume as the Steam Deck does,

(16m 15s)

> but it's not.

(16m 17s)

> terrible and it seems to hibernate after a certain amount of time of the screen being off which means that it's

(16m 24s)

> standby battery is very good. It's been you know over a week since I put it in the box at

(16m 31s)

> like 90% charge and it's now sitting at 70% so it's it's dropped 20% in a week which is not bad at all

(16m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay.

(16m 40s) **Al:**

> um so hopefully I will actually be playing at some point but you know I've got another

(16m 47s)

> 100 hours of Pokémon to play before.

(16m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> And I'm definitely curious to hear more about what you think about it because I was talking

(16m 53s)

> to a co-worker recently that was contemplating on getting like a handheld gaming system

(16m 59s)

> to bring with him to work for, you know, overnights and stuff.

(16m 59s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm

(17m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> And I was like, "I really like my steam deck," but I know that there's the new Xbox

(17m 11s)

> ally thing that came out and I was starting to read up on it.

(17m 15s)

> And it seemed like there was one article that I read specifically,

(17m 19s)

> from where that was comparing the Xbox console to the Steam deck to the Nintendo Switch 2,

(17m 24s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah.

(17m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> and actually the Switch 2 won out of all three, which I thought was interesting.

(17m 29s)

> But I didn't get to read through the nitty-gritty of like all the details of why,

(17m 33s)

> so I am curious just in general how the Xbox compares,

(17m 38s)

> 'cause while maybe the Nintendo Switch is the best overall console,

(17m 41s)

> I still would rather play on my Steam deck or my...

(17m 45s)

> or an Xbox Alode down the line because of the fact

(17m 49s)

> Nintendo is still technically limited in games. So I am curious to hear more about your experience.

(17m 54s) **Al:**

> I think that's the thing is that I think the experience on Switch is the nicest because it's

(18m 3s)

> built from the ground up as a console and everything was built. It's Nintendo, they've been building

(18m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(18m 7s) **Al:**

> consoles for decades. They know what they want to do and they do it and you either like it or

(18m 13s)

> you don't, but I generally do. Sure, it would be nice if you could get some more customizability,

(18m 18s)

> but like, you know, if you've got generally, if you've got a Switch game, you know, it's going to run. And

(18m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, and generally the games that are available on Switch very generally speaking are supposed to be

(18m 24s) **Al:**

> No, you don't have to worry about that. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Well, the thing is that

(18m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> optimized for the Switch. So that also is like a plus in that sense. Like the game that you get on

(18m 37s)

> Steam, you don't know if it's optimized for the Steam Deck or not. You don't know if it's optimized

(18m 40s)

> for the Xbox ally, but when it's on the Switch store, it's supposed to be optimized for the Switch.

(18m 46s) **Al:**

> actually, well, and here's the thing, generally, if the only games that I am aware of that don't run

(18m 52s)

> well on the switch despite being

(18m 54s)

> on the switch or either like the really big budget studios that don't care and they're

(18m 57s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(18m 59s) **Al:**

> just like oh people want switch that's fine let's throw it on switch or like the really tiny

(19m) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, yeah

(19m 5s) **Al:**

> indie games that pay for a bad porting company to do it but those ones tend to get fixed

(19m 14s)

> and so yeah generally if something isn't running well on the switch it will generally

(19m 18s)

> get fixed book a month scarlet and violet excluded I guess.

(19m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah

(19m 24s) **Al:**

> but we don't we don't talk about that one you want to fix you you want the game fixed

(19m 26s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, we don't talk about that

(19m 29s) **Al:**

> by a switch to you don't like interesting interesting yeah that's interesting okay

(19m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> You want to be slightly nauseous by the switch to

(19m 36s)

> The frame rates make me nauseous like legitimately

(19m 40s)

> No, it like I just have to get used to it, but it's so fast that I just like turning around. I'm like, oh

(19m 47s)

> Also like a few.

(19m 49s)

> Yeses make me nauseous, so that's probably all tied together.

(19m 54s) **Al:**

> So yeah, the software is definitely the biggest issue for this and hopefully that will be improved at some point

(20m 2s)

> But I've not really spent much time playing actual games I booted up the demo for skate story and it was

(20m 9s)

> working

(20m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> Okay, all right. We'll take, you know what? We'll take working that work.

(20m 15s) **Al:**

> But yeah, we'll see how it goes

(20m 16s)

> I like how it integrate you if you install something on steam or on geog or itch.io adds all into the base launcher

(20m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> Nice. Nice. Okay, cool.

(20m 24s) **Al:**

> So

(20m 26s)

> We'll see how that goes and finally I mean what what I've actually been spending my time playing is of course Pokemon legends Z a so

## Pokémon Legends Z-A

(20m 36s) **Al:**

> Just a little thing for listeners and we are not going to talk about story spoilers

(20m 41s)

> Because neither of us have finished the game

(20m 43s)

> but

(20m 44s)

> Obviously if you don't want to be spoiled at all

(20m 47s)

> Then we're obviously going to talk about the game and so we might say something that you think is a spoiler

(20m 52s)

> So in that case,

(20m 54s)

> feel free to skip the chapter and go on to the news.

(20m 57s)

> This is all that's left in the what we've been up to section.

(21m)

> So go there's timestamps in the in your podcast app.

(21m 6s)

> I love this game.

(21m 9s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(21m 11s)

> Same.

(21m 12s)

> That's it, done.

(21m 13s)

[laughing]

(21m 13s) **Al:**

> Well, I mean, yeah, so yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

(21m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

(21m 18s) **Al:**

> I there are, okay, there are some things that they don't have in this game.

(21m 24s)

> that they had in legends are case that I'm very sad about.

(21m 27s)

> And I'm for example, the biggest one is in legends are case if you

(21m 33s)

> released a box of Pokemon, you got a bunch of the, um, the stuff for

(21m 38s)

> peroting them up in that game.

(21m 39s)

> And then you could either use it or you could sell it and you, if you sold it,

(21m 40s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, yeah.

(21m 43s) **Al:**

> you got more money and then you could buy more balls to catch more Pokemon.

(21m 46s)

> I really liked that loop that loop felt perfect to me.

(21m 49s)

> If you, if you caught lots of Pokemon, you could then buy lots of balls.

(21m 54s)

> And catch lots of Pokemon and it felt like a really nice loop of catching.

(21m 58s)

> Um, and that doesn't exist in this game.

(22m 1s)

> If you released them, you just released them.

(22m 2s)

> And I'm really sad about that.

(22m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, I didn't know that, see, I haven't filled my boxes yet to know, so that's good to know.

(22m 7s) **Al:**

> Mm hmm.

(22m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> That sucks that they got rid of that. I don't like that either.

(22m 10s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(22m 12s)

> Like I get that there are, there are more ways to get money now, right?

(22m 16s)

> Like the weren't really battles in legends are case.

(22m 19s)

> And obviously the whole point of this game is at night you go battle, right?

(22m 22s)

> and you can make a decent amount of money.

(22m 24s)

> That's fine. But I really like having the choice of being able to focus on catching for a chunk of time and not run out of money, which is what happens.

(22m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(22m 37s) **Al:**

> And yeah, people say, "Oh, you know, you get so much money playing at night that you'll never run out of money."

(22m 44s)

> And I'm like, "Well, I've run out of money." So I don't know what to tell you. I literally have $500 right now, right? Like, come on, let's...

(22m 46s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(22m 51s)

> Oh my god.

(22m 52s) **Al:**

> Uh, I, I, I think you underestimate.

(22m 54s)

> How much I want to catch Pokemon.

(22m 55s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(22m 58s) **Al:**

> So yeah, I can go in battle and make money that way. That's fine. I just, it's, it's an annoyance for me. I wish it weren't the case.

(23m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. No, I mean, yeah, I can, I can, I haven't hit that point in that game in the game yet,

(23m 7s) **Al:**

> That's a big one.

(23m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> where I like run out of money and everything and I'm not catching like a whole lot just yet,

(23m 17s)

> but I can definitely see that I can, I can definitely see that issue being the case.

(23m 24s)

> And I'm surprised, again, I'm surprised they got rid of the box feature in that sense.

(23m 28s)

> And I guess maybe to be fair, they did advertise this game.

(23m 34s)

> With a lot of battling aspects, so like it is a battle heavy game, but yeah.

(23m 41s) **Al:**

> Sure, sure, but it's also a catching focus, it's also a catching focus game, right? Like you can

(23m 47s)

> ignore the fact that the core loop of catching Pokemon is almost identical, slightly improved or

(23m 53s)

> get to that. I'm going to, but almost identical to how Legends are kissed is. Yeah, sure, there's

(23m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm Yeah, no, I agree. Yeah

(23m 57s) **Al:**

> battling. I knew that would be battling. I don't dislike the battling. I just, I like being able to

(24m 1s)

> any particular day of having the choice, but there comes a point where I can no longer continue to

(24m 5s)

> catch and a half to go battle, because I run out of money and that, that's, it is what

(24m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(24m 11s) **Al:**

> it is, but that is a disappointment.

(24m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, no, that's fair.

(24m 14s)

> Definitely not saying that as a defense of the game or anything like that.

(24m 18s)

> It's just like, ah, it's just, I'm trying to sort of rationalize in my head, but I also understand.

(24m 20s) **Al:**

> - Yeah.

(24m 23s)

[laughing]

(24m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> It's like, yeah, it is still a catching game, but there's a reason that you can kind of tumble for one

(24m 28s)

> bush to the next and sneak up on Backstrike Pokémon and be able to do that as much as you want,

(24m 33s)

> I don't know if it was speaking, but...

(24m 34s) **Al:**

> - Well, and the way that you get most XP

(24m 37s)

> is by knocking them out and then catching.

(24m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(24m 39s) **Al:**

> So right, they do actually encourage you

(24m 41s)

> to catch every single Pokemon.

(24m 43s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(24m 44s)

> Well, maybe in the DLC.

(24m 44s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(24m 48s)

> - But let me, let me, let go, I doubt it.

(24m 50s)

> I, I, what I love how they've done

(24m 52s)

> is what they have improved in that process

(24m 55s)

> is the battling and to knock them out.

(24m 58s)

> So then you can catch them.

(24m 59s)

> Because in Legends Arceus, you either through bowls at them

(25m 3s)

> or you engage them in battle.

(25m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(25m 5s) **Al:**

> Whereas here you can do both, right?

(25m 7s)

> You can, you can try and catch them.

(25m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I love it

(25m 11s) **Al:**

> And then if it doesn't succeed, then you can like,

(25m 13s)

> just do a move, right?

(25m 15s)

> You don't have to like move into battle mode.

(25m 18s)

> your already in battle mode.

(25m 20s)

> I really like that.

(25m 21s)

> Also, I noticed that I find it a little bit annoying, so there's so many thoughts.

(25m 29s)

> I like how you can knock it out and then catch it.

(25m 33s)

> That's a really nice addition.

(25m 34s)

> I've always found it weird in Pokemon games where you knock out a Pokemon and suddenly

(25m 38s)

> you can't catch it.

(25m 39s)

> I'm like, "What happened to it?

(25m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(25m 41s) **Al:**

> I knocked out.

(25m 42s)

> It should be lying there.

(25m 42s) **Aislinn:**

[laughter]

(25m 43s) **Al:**

> Let me catch it."

(25m 44s)

> So I like that.

(25m 45s)

> It is a bit annoying that you only get one chance of that and if it doesn't stay in the

(25m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> Yes, I agree.

(25m 50s) **Al:**

> ball, then it's gone.

(25m 53s)

> But what I have found is that you can, obviously, you can throw a couple of balls at it

(25m 58s)

> and then it stops being able to stay in balls against angry, right?

(26m 1s)

> Then you have to engage it in battle.

(26m 3s)

> I've noticed that if you attack it, then you can throw balls again before it's knocked

(26m 7s)

> out.

(26m 8s)

> Actually, I think that increases the chance in a standard Pokemon game with your turn-based

(26m 15s)

> battles.

(26m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is, yeah.

(26m 16s) **Al:**

> If it's lower health, it's more likely to catch it.

(26m 21s)

> So you can actually knock it, hit it with a move and then try and catch it again and then

(26m 25s)

> hit it with another move and try and catch it again and that gives you more tries.

(26m 29s)

> I just like how they've integrated all that together into one seamless experience.

(26m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(26m 33s)

> Yeah, I 1,000% agree as well

(26m 35s)

> I I've had to use that method to

(26m 38s)

> To try and catch some like bigger Pokemon and I would just throw ball. Okay, it didn't work

(26m 43s)

> Let's hit a moon hit it with a move. Okay, it's HP's lower throw ball again

(26m 48s)

> But I do also agree like to like if you do end up knocking it out like if you hit use one move and you accidentally knock it out

(26m 53s)

> You have one chance to catch it and that's it and that's that's all it hurts

(26m 55s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's, especially when you have, you've spent ages knocking out an alpha, right?

(26m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> It hurts.

(27m 2s)

> I wish they gave at least one more chance, because like you said, you knocked it out, it's not like it's buried into the ground after you knock it out, you know, it's not like it's in the ground forever, it's not that it's not like the snap of the finger it's gone, situation like it's, you know, you knocked it out, it's just laying there on the ground.

(27m 2s) **Al:**

> You're like, I've gone through all this effort and I've got this alpha and I throw one ball and nope, it's not caught.

(27m 8s)

> That's really annoying.

(27m 17s)

> Yeah. Yeah, crumbles to dust.

(27m 26s)

> Yeah. Yeah.

(27m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> Like if anything, you should be able to pick it up and bring it to the Pokémon sending yourself.

(27m 36s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(27m 37s) **Aislinn:**

> If we want to be a little more realistic.

(27m 39s) **Al:**

> Although I'm not really think sure I'm going to be able to pick up that alpha

(27m 43s)

> Obama snow and

(27m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> Ahhh!

(27m 45s) **Al:**

> Drag it to the Pokemon Center

(27m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> If you, you, if you try, you know what?

(27m 51s)

> If your Rotom phone can hold you as you're falling off a building,

(27m 54s)

> why can't your Rotom phone help you carry the big Obama Snowden, you know?

(28m) **Al:**

> Funny

(28m 2s)

> What's your favorite thing about this game so far?

(28m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, man. That's a loaded question. I, I actually, so I've really, even though I don't look like I'm enjoying it, I have been really enjoying the rogue mega battles. I, I, as, as much as it stresses me out, I do enjoy that experience. It's really fun. It's really fun. Like, I think I would like a game like Elton ring down the line. I just, I think as I just don't like the aesthetics of Elton ring, but I like the aesthetics of Pokemon. So like,

(28m 33s) **Al:**

> You want to poke him on, Elton Ring is what you're saying.

(28m 35s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, that, I'd be so on that so fast. I would be so stressed playing it, but man, I would be having a great time because it's satisfying to like watch its movements figure it out and then be able to defeat it. So I, I've, I've been really enjoying that. I've really enjoyed the side quests. Side quests are so, so, so, so, so much fun. Like, I've really been enjoying the loop of continuing the main story for a little bit.

(29m 5s)

> Unlocking wild areas and 100% each wild area, and then afterwards doing all the side quests. I've been really, really, really enjoying it. I also, I feel like it's been like a 50/50, but I've been really enjoying like a lot. I actually know, I think majority people really like the outfits too. Like the customization is, is that all the outfits are so cute. And I have like, I feel like some of the outfits I literally have like, I URL some of the outfits and it's so fun, I can actually dress as my character.

(29m 35s)

> if I want to, and it's so, so, so cute. So I, I, I am curious to learn. I think this is the first time I want to shiny hunt again in a Pokemon game in a really long time, but I just have to learn more about what the shiny hunting process is because it's just, it's just fun to catch Pokemon. So I feel like I would enjoy shiny hunting as well at some point down the line, but that's, that's kind of where I'm at at the moment. I, I, I am enjoying the story too overall so far.

(29m 57s) **Al:**

> - Yeah.

(30m 1s)

> - Yeah, it's interesting.

(30m 3s)

> I look forward to seeing where it goes.

(30m 6s)

> They hooked me when you start up the game

(30m 9s)

> and the very first thing is you are as I guard sell.

(30m 14s)

[laughing]

(30m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(30m 15s)

[laughing]

(30m 16s) **Al:**

> - I'm in, I'm in, yes I am, I guard right now.

(30m 22s) **Aislinn:**

> That was, I am curious to see if that pans out more

(30m 27s)

> 'cause I thought it was very interesting

(30m 28s)

> that they, that's how the game starts.

(30m 31s)

> So I don't know if that's going to actually

(30m 34s)

> be a part in the story, but I am curious nonetheless.

(30m 37s)

> I have no idea where this story is going.

(30m 39s)

> All I know is I mostly ready to crash out at any point

(30m 44s)

> character in particular.

(30m 47s) **Al:**

> That is your favorite character so far.

(30m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> Ooh, ah, yee, um, I mean, honestly, I,

(30m 54s)

> so I picked the girl character,

(30m 55s)

> so I have really been enjoying,

(30m 59s)

> all right, I guess like quote unquote rival,

(31m)

> so for me it's urban.

(31m 3s)

> I really enjoy their personality,

(31m 6s)

> but I also, I also just like light a lot too.

(31m 10s)

> Lita, light a, I still haven't figured out

(31m 11s)

> how to pronounce her name,

(31m 13s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(31m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> but I like it.

(31m 14s)

> I like her character a lot, too, so much so that I would like it would be fun to cosplay her at some point.

(31m 20s)

> Not sure how I figure her leggings, but that's a future me problem, but I really like light out a lot so far.

(31m 24s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(31m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> How about you?

(31m 28s) **Al:**

> Fair enough.

(31m 30s)

> Look, I always want more easy, right?

(31m 33s)

> Like, he's such a fascinating character.

(31m 37s)

> Yeah, I mean, I'm enjoying his like random,

(31m 40s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(31m 42s) **Al:**

> random butting into conversations

(31m 44s)

> and telling you things and it turns out

(31m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(31m 47s) **Al:**

> that maybe he's like running the entire city, maybe?

(31m 50s)

> I'm not sure, (laughing)

(31m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm not sure either.

(31m 54s) **Al:**

> like he seems to be doing more than it seems,

(31m 56s)

> so I'm very intrigued just to where that goes.

(31m 59s)

> I do love how, and this is obviously very early game,

(32m 2s)

> I love how powerful his Flouette is.

(32m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> I know, yeah. So cool.

(32m 9s) **Al:**

> So, yeah.

(32m 11s)

> All right, wow, we could probably talk about this forever,

(32m 13s)

> but we probably shouldn't

(32m 14s)

> 'cause it's not a Pokemon podcast.

(32m 15s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(32m 16s)

> I know.

(32m 17s)

> Aw man, we gotta do an episode at some point.

(32m 21s)

> Someone's gonna talk about this game at some point.

(32m 22s) **Al:**

> Yeah, we're probably doing greenhouse episode on it. I'm more detailed one, but we'll see I was gonna say we'll see who gets that, but I mean Kevin and Cody don't have the game. So

(32m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> I think it'd be fun.

(32m 26s)

> Yay!

(32m 35s)

> I mean, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, let the, let the game

(32m 35s) **Al:**

> Probably me and you unless Johnny wants to come on. I can't tell if he likes the game or not

(32m 46s) **Aislinn:**

> like ride out more and like I, I feel like I don't have too many complaints about the game

(32m 48s) **Al:**

> Yes Oh, for sure, like I wouldn't even consider doing a greenhouse episode until we're until

(32m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> because I'm still in like the honeymoon phase of the game.

(32m 52s)

> So, yeah, yeah.

(32m 55s) **Al:**

> we're at least finished the main story. Nevermind more, but we'll see where it goes after that,

(33m 2s)

> although we need to do it pre DLC obviously. All right. Well, that's what we've been up to

(33m 5s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(33m 8s) **Al:**

> and also all the Pokemon. Let's talk about some news. A few pieces of news this episode,

## Game News

(33m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> Yay!

(33m 15s) **Al:**

> so first up, gocho on the grassline.

(33m 18s)

> It's not true. The game the Kevin has played has announced that they're going to release on mobile platforms.

(33m 23s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(33m 32s) **Al:**

> That's it. That's it. That's the news. They don't say when they don't specify which platforms, but I'm presuming they mean iOS and Android.

(33m 40s)

> That's it. So if you like the look of this game, but you don't have a switch or a PC or an Xbox or a PlayStation.

(33m 48s)

> If you want to play it on mobile, there you go.

(33m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean, it's nice.

(33m 53s)

> And I like the article mentions that this is part of an investment to boost studios from

(34m 2s)

> specifically Latin America.

(34m 4s)

> I love that.

(34m 5s)

> I love that.

(34m 6s)

> I love that.

(34m 7s)

> And the fact that it's successful to be able to play on more platforms is great.

(34m 10s) **Al:**

> Yes, always good, I'm sure you could if you tried.

(34m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> Really no complaints about that.

(34m 16s)

> Ah, I mean I could play that.

(34m 19s)

> I have mobile games in general, but that's a whole other topic in itself.

(34m 26s) **Al:**

> I have such mixed feelings about touchscreen as an input device for games.

(34m 34s)

> It really depends on the game whether I think it's a good thing.

(34m 38s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. I wish my mobile games allowed me to hook up my controller to my device,

(34m 47s)

> whatever it may be, whether it's an iPad or phone or whatever it may be.

(34m 51s) **Al:**

> Let me tell you when harvest moon homesweet home added controller support. It went from being a terrible game to an okay game

(34m 57s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean, that's a big jump in itself.

(35m 3s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah

(35m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> It went from not bad, terrible game to "okay."

(35m 7s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I actually had some fun playing that game after the added controller support. I know right?

(35m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> That's pretty good.

(35m 10s)

> Wow.

(35m 12s)

> But yeah, no, just again, it all comes down to accessibility.

(35m 19s)

> The fact that there is something that's more accessible for more people to be able to experience

(35m 23s)

> this game.

(35m 24s)

> Well, they like the game when I was a different story, whether they like the...

(35m 27s)

> control system on a mobile device is a different story, but the fact that you can play it on more platforms so that it's available to more people that are interested in the game is a good thing, whether it's good on mobile, I don't know, we'll see.

(35m 38s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(35m 43s)

> Hmm, that's a whole different question.

(35m 47s)

> Next, we have Spritit D have announced their 2.0 update is coming out on the 4th of December.

(35m 54s)

> So they seem to have taken my advice and bundled together a bunch of updates rather than releasing the smaller ones because I felt like they were releasing too many small updates

(36m 4s)

> and it's the sort of game that feels like you want to jump in for a bunch of times.

(36m 8s)

> So it's the last update was in February, so they've taken a whole bunch and put it together in one update, which is good.

(36m 20s)

> So there's a bunch of new stuff. I don't think I'll talk about much of this because it's really just for people who've played the game like none of this will mean much to people, but there's a bunch of new content and new customization and stuff like that.

(36m 33s)

> that. So, if you have been enjoying

(36m 35s)

> Spiritity and is a

(36m 38s)

> good game, it just wasn't for me, but if you've been enjoying it, then go grab that update in December.

(36m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, it looks like this at minimum, like category-wise, nine new updates, and I seem pretty big too,

(36m 51s)

> from what I saw on everything, pretty good updates, so I hope it continues to help the game flourish.

(36m 59s)

> I know nothing about this game to be fair, but I hope people enjoy it, because it seems like it's a lot.

(37m) **Al:**

> Is that UK type game?

(37m 7s)

> So, like if you're an idea.

(37m 10s)

> All right.

(37m 11s)

> Speaking of updates to games, cult of the lamb have announced DLC called Will Haven.

(37m 20s)

> This is coming early next year and it is a DLC.

(37m 28s)

> There seems to be quite a lot in this.

(37m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I've heard a lot of buzz around it. I've heard good thing people are excited about it

(37m 30s) **Al:**

> It looks interesting. It looks like it expands a bunch of areas and new areas for exploring, also ranching, and obviously a bunch of story stuff as well, so that's cool.

(37m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm, the ranching is the most interesting part.

(37m 52s)

[laughter]

(37m 53s) **Al:**

> Well, certainly for this podcast.

(37m 56s) **Aislinn:**

> Exactly.

(37m 57s)

> That's what I'm saying.

(37m 58s) **Al:**

> I really hope they have

(38m)

> a lot of weird animals, like don't just give us a cow give us a demon cow give us something weird like mishmash of animals or so I don't know I don't know I'm not the game designer give me weird stuff

(38m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean, it says ranching will allow for you to carry and breed care for and breed rare creatures.

(38m 19s)

> So it's kind of giving, it's giving weird creatures.

(38m 20s) **Al:**

> Yes, there we go. I want creatures. I don't want animals. I want creatures.

(38m 27s)

> Yes. Yes. I want, I want something that there's mysterious legends about from hundreds of years ago.

(38m 28s) **Aislinn:**

> So I think you'll get your wish.

(38m 31s)

> I mean, isn't that like half the essence of the game?

(38m 40s)

> another game I also haven't played to be fair but it's been

(38m 42s)

> like my radar for like a while I just never worked my way around to it but yeah I feel like that's half the essence of it right so it's got to happen you're gonna get your sheep cow sheep cow I don't know

(38m 51s) **Al:**

> yep it's got to all right finally we have Disney Dreamlight Valley they have

(39m 2s)

> announced the Haunted Floating Festival which is their Halloween event from the

(39m 9s)

> 22nd of October which is in the past to the 11th of November so that's three

(39m 15s)

> weeks I think yeah just just under three weeks so when this episode comes out

(39m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> Yes. Yeah.

(39m 21s) **Al:**

> just under two weeks to experience the event and you can get a bunch of

(39m 26s)

> weird furniture and stuff like that yeah you know it's a start it's a Disney

(39m 34s)

> Dreamlight Valley event go get your creepy

(39m 37s) **Aislinn:**

> also another game that I have been curious to check out at some point but still have

(39m 42s)

> not worked my way around and I know I know I was like I can already hear Cody just just

(39m 44s) **Al:**

> Oh man, there's so much stuff in this game now. Goodness me.

(39m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> behind me just screaming I know that's crazy that's awesome I think the thing that that I think

(39m 51s) **Al:**

> There's like five years of content updates in this game so far.

(39m 57s)

> They do keep going.

(39m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> just the thing for me that like kind of puts me on like like not still picking it up is I'm

(40m 2s) **Al:**

> Three years, sorry, no.

(40m 6s) **Aislinn:**

> And I'm just not a huge-

(40m 7s)

> Disney person. I think that's what it comes down to. I like Disney. Don't get me wrong. But also, Disney is like a whole other conversation in itself too, that I'm not going to go into.

(40m 10s) **Al:**

> shocking

(40m 17s)

> What isn't Disney now that's the question I

(40m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> You know, it's a good point. I do love Star Wars.

(40m 24s) **Al:**

> Don't think they're gonna add Star Wars into this. I mean maybe though who knows that

(40m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> That, you know what? That might be it. That might be it if I do it. You heard it here first.

(40m 33s)

> I will pick the game up immediately.

(40m 33s) **Al:**

> I mean what well no, I actually don't think they should do that

(40m 37s)

> I think what they should do is use the game

(40m 40s)

> game base and release a new game, which is about Star Wars, and a new game that's about Marvel, there you go

(40m 42s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh!

(40m 47s) **Al:**

> Keep keep the universe a separate but have different games because I think part of the problem is if you go hey

(40m 53s)

> Star Wars is now in Disney's dream like Valley you suddenly go oh

(40m 57s)

> Okay, but if I care about Star Wars, and I don't care about goofy, right?

(40m 59s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(41m 2s) **Al:**

> I don't want to be booting up a game and have to go learn how to fish from goofy

(41m 6s)

> just so I can go and see, you know,

(41m 11s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(41m 13s)

> I'm just feeling like I can't just,

(41m 16s)

> I can't just imagine just goofy walking around

(41m 20s)

> unlike in the Star Wars universe is crazy.

(41m 23s) **Al:**

[laughs]

(41m 25s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(41m 26s)

> Mickey Mouse, oh man, oh my god.

(41m 28s) **Al:**

> "Girphy" means "Dark Vader", right? Like...

(41m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> Donald Duck and Darth Vader going at it would be crazy.

(41m 38s) **Al:**

> Okay, I've changed my mind. You need to have them in one game.

(41m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> But you know what?

(41m 41s)

> I thought this, yeah, I kind of want this now.

(41m 44s)

> Oh, that'd be so funny.

(41m 45s)

> I would, you know what, whichever one you want to give me,

(41m 49s)

> I'll be there first in line.

(41m 51s)

> But I logistically separate games makes the most sense.

(41m 54s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I do think I do think that would work well. I think

(41m 55s) **Aislinn:**

> But like humor-wise, oh, it'd be so good together.

(42m) **Al:**

> I think this is the thing. I think the game loop could work well in games for Star Wars and Marvel as well

(42m 6s)

> I think it works nicely

(42m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(42m 9s) **Al:**

> just with different aesthetics

(42m 11s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, oh, I'd be so in though either way count me in

(42m 15s) **Al:**

> Did you see that just on the business side of things? Do you see that Warner Brothers discovery have said they're up for they're gonna put themselves up for sale

(42m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> We really?

(42m 24s) **Al:**

> And they're the yeah, and they own DC and obviously

(42m 28s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh my god.

(42m 29s) **Al:**

> This is bad for everybody

(42m 31s)

> But I I would absolutely find it hilarious if Disney bought them because then they would own Marvel and DC now

(42m 38s)

> Obviously objectively bad for everybody do not let this happen, but

(42m 44s)

> Just funny so so funny if that were to happen

(42m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> oh man oh man yeah that that I I hope it doesn't happen that way but if it did that be crazy

(43m)

> but oh I I had this is something I'll be reading about later I did not know about this at all

(43m 6s)

> so thank you for informing me and that will be my reading for a later point

(43m 10s) **Al:**

> You're welcome.

(43m 12s)

> All right.

(43m 13s)

> That's the news.

## Why We Like Farming Games

(43m 15s) **Al:**

> We are now going to talk about why we like cottage core games.

(43m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> Woo!

(43m 23s) **Al:**

> It's funny, I sat down a couple of days ago to be like,

(43m 27s)

> "Well, let me actually try and put some words onto this."

(43m 31s)

> And I was like, "Why do I like these games?"

(43m 34s)

> And I said, "I have a really hard question

(43m 36s)

> to start with, right?"

(43m 38s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(43m 39s) **Al:**

> because it's not a good idea.

(43m 41s)

> They are weird games, right?

(43m 43s)

> Like you are creating a life for yourself

(43m 48s)

> and like bettering this fake version of yourself

(43m 52s)

> or of someone else if you want to role play in that way.

(43m 56s)

> And it's like, sometimes I feel a little bit silly

(44m)

> because it's like I am harvesting my crops here.

(44m 3s)

> I'm planting, blah, blah, blah, blah.

(44m 5s)

> I could be tidying and making my real life better.

(44m 8s)

> but I do

(44m 10s)

> know, it doesn't work that way. I don't... I almost wonder whether part of the games actually my brain wants to do them to distract myself from the things that you could be doing in real life.

(44m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I think I think that's definitely an aspect. I would I would agree. I mean we do weeding for example

(44m 33s) **Al:**

> Cool. Job done.

(44m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> Do you weeding for example like I or real is not good for the back

(44m 41s)

> But deweeding in animal crossing is great for the back when I'm sitting on the couch, you know

(44m 49s)

> And me deweeding is not as cute as deweeding an animal crossing, you know

(44m 53s)

> It's getting, it gets a little sweaty, it's dirty.

(44m 57s)

> It's like, my hair is all over the place, it's not cute, but in animal crossing, it's so cute.

(45m 4s) **Al:**

> Can't stream real life de-weeding, you know, you got to try

(45m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean, you could, but it's an interesting, you know what, you could make it interesting, it's possible for it to be interesting.

(45m 15s)

> If you're not talking, maybe not, but if you're having a conversation, maybe, but it's still not cute.

(45m 20s) **Al:**

> Look, people watch all sorts of weird things on the internet.

(45m 22s)

> I'm sure they'd watch that, but oh, surely surely.

(45m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> Are there farmers that stream?

(45m 25s)

> It's gotta be right.

(45m 28s)

> I'm looking it up right now.

(45m 32s)

> Farmer John.

(45m 33s)

> You're not farming.

(45m 35s)

> You are not farming.

(45m 36s)

> You're playing Dead by Daylight.

(45m 37s)

> I'm done.

(45m 38s)

> I quit, never mind.

(45m 40s)

> That's a disappointment.

(45m 41s)

> You can't be farmer John and not be farming.

(45m 46s)

> But yeah, no, I, I, I, yeah.

(45m 47s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I've seen a bunch of TikToks from Farmers,

(45m 49s)

> but it seemed to be harder to find actual streaming.

(45m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> Because me, it's just not as interesting as farming in Stardew.

(45m 57s)

> It's not as cute.

(45m 58s)

> It's not as aesthetic, you know?

(46m) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(46m 1s)

> I mean, the aesthetic is a big part of it, right?

(46m 3s)

> Like real life is messy.

(46m 6s)

> And you don't get away from that completely in games, right?

(46m 9s)

> Like that's one of the things that we like about Stardew

(46m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(46m 13s) **Al:**

> is the messiness of the characters, right?

(46m 15s)

> We all we all love to hear.

(46m 17s)

> Clint. Yeah, okay. So getting down to like actual reasons of why I thought. So my first one is I like the repetition of it. There's something, particularly where a big part of how I play games is on a handheld device. You know, either my switch or my, well, now my ROG ally X. But previously my steam deck. You know, sitting next to my wife while we watch TV or we do something else.

(46m 47s)

> That's kind of like how I like to play most of my games. And because of that, obviously, I don't play a lot of like story heavy games. So I like the kind of repetition and like almost kind of background brain stuff. If that makes sense. I don't know whether that's something you experience or not.

(47m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, that is I would say that is definitely something that I do like but I would say that it's not like the main part of why I like farming or cottagecore games or anything like I just like for example not the person is a cottagecore game but in most recent memory like I enjoy doing the Tartarus stuff in Persona 3 because it is like a brain turn off thing.

(47m 33s)

> The repetitious movement or motion to like grind or in the case of like playing Stardew tending to your farm tending to your animals it is nice to kind of put that at the forefront of my brain and focus on that so I'm not thinking about anything else and I can just like kind of just look at that just focus on that and that's it.

(47m 53s)

> I just distract myself from anything that is going on in the world so I do enjoy that but only up to a certain point because then for me it gets.

(48m 3s)

> To repetitive and that's where the conversation of like for me personally I can only have too I can only have so many farming games in the rotation because I can only do that repetition so much before I feel like I need I need to see more growth over time.

(48m 24s) **Al:**

> Yes, absolutely. I 100% agree that's that's that's one of the reasons that I didn't like

(48m 30s)

> Sugar du Island is that there was no growth aspect to it. Right and growth can look different in different games, right?

(48m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(48m 36s) **Al:**

> Like in in stardew

(48m 38s)

> It's very much like I want to build this really big efficient farm that means that I don't have to do much

(48m 44s)

> but

(48m 45s)

> Like different games can do it in different ways. I doesn't have to be that right

(48m 51s)

> like it wasn't that in

(48m 54s)

> I didn't have a big autonomous farm. I was still using my water watching can by the end of that by the time I finished that game

(49m 2s)

> But I still really liked it because I felt like I was building up the bizarre instead, right? That was my progress

(49m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> I just, I like to see, I just want to see progress that feels like fulfilling in the sense

(49m 16s)

> that if I'm doing it over, if I'm building up of the same farm, but in different aesthetics

(49m 21s)

> or different slightly different formats over and over in different farming games, I'm

(49m 25s)

> eventually going to like burn myself out from it.

(49m 29s)

> It's why I can't play like, for example, Animal Crossing Happy Home Paradise and House

(49m 33s)

> flipper at the same time because it's both decorating.

(49m 37s)

> And I can only decorate so much.

(49m 39s)

> Like I like it, I like the repetition of doing this decorating, whether it could be completely different decorations that I'm doing in both games or whatever, but there's I can only do it up to a certain point before the burnout hits.

(49m 51s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. That makes sense.

(49m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> But for the time that I am doing it, I, it is something that I just focus on decorating and I focus on nothing else and it's really nice.

(50m) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think that's true for me as well. It's just that like once I hit that point

(50m 6s)

> I then just switched to a different game that does the same thing

(50m 9s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(50m 10s) **Al:**

> in a different way, right? Like if you play stardew for a hundred hours, and then you switch to

(50m 16s)

> grand bazaar

(50m 18s)

> Like in a way, it's it's the same but in a way, it's different, right?

(50m 23s)

> And and that's why I keep going back to them, right? Like I've now been

(50m 28s)

> Doing this podcast or anything

(50m 30s)

> you know there's always something new and interesting, even with the things at the same.

(50m 44s)

> Yeah.

(50m 44s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean, for me, I guess you know what to be fair. I feel like I've only been getting into farming games this past maybe three years and that

(50m 56s)

> Is even maybe just a little bit of a stretch because there's just for me. It's like it it is to be fair

(51m) **Al:**

> Three years is still a long time to do anything, though.

(51m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> Like I've been playing more and more Stardew as a recently finally. I have not still made any progress and I still don't know

(51m 11s) **Al:**

> Cavan was laughing when he's listening.

(51m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> 90% of the world of stardew to be

(51m 14s)

> completely honest. Yeah, because I don't know what that means. I have no idea and it's crazy that I have no idea what that means, but like the the fun that I've been

(51m 31s)

> having with managing my farm thus far in stardew has been really nice. And for the time that I was playing like feels

(51m 42s)

> mystery. It was also very

(51m 44s)

> nice, but I think for me, the reason that I like the core, one of the core reasons I like,

(51m 51s)

> farming games is more so just to be immersed in the world, which is getting to know the characters,

(51m 59s)

> and then also farming is a fun thing. But the primary thing is I like to see progress,

(52m 5s)

> and I especially like to see progress in the sense of for me getting to know the characters in the game.

(52m 11s)

> and also just like the music and the aesthetics.

(52m 14s)

> Like if I don't like how the game looks and for me personally the music like I when I when I play a game I like to listen to the music in the game.

(52m 25s)

> I know like for example for you you often will have like a podcast running as you're playing a game for me I like to just have the I like to just just play the game.

(52m 34s)

> So maybe if I played like I actually bought I completely forgot the name of the game what was the episode?

(52m 45s)

> I bought the game too and I completely forgot cuz it was on a good sale that farming game firefly firefly village yes I know I know so much I know we gotta we gotta stand out a little bit more but.

(52m 48s) **Al:**

> uh, oh, yes. It was Ashwood Valley. No, that's the one I've not done, uh, Firefly Village.

(52m 55s)

> Yeah. Sorry. There's too many, there's too many of these small new, because there's, there's

(53m)

> Firefly Village, there's Ashwood Valley. There was another one that me and Kevin have done.

(53m 4s)

> What was that with? Sunset Island. They're, I gotta get better names for these games, man.

(53m 14s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah so I ended up buying firefly village I haven't had a chance to pick it up yet cuz I've been still slowly working my way into games but maybe I should while I'm playing that game catch up on my very very big backlog of podcasts while I play the game the thing is I enjoy playing like a cottage core game to be able to just disassociate and just play the game and not be connected in any of any sort of way with the rest of the world like I just want to just exist in that world.

(53m 44s)

> So that is a big thing for me that I like is that is I that's what I like when I'm looking for a good farming game is can I just turn everything off and just exist in the world.

(53m 55s) **Al:**

> Hmm, what?

(53m 56s) **Aislinn:**

> And I feel like so far I could do that for a start, do I feel like I can so far do that for feels

(54m) **Al:**

> What would you say percentage of your gaming time is on your streams versus not on?

(54m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> I would argue probably 75% is on stream and 25% is off stream.

(54m 20s)

> I would love for it to be 50/50,

(54m 22s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Yeah. The reason. Yeah. So the reason I ask is I feel like that changes how you play,

(54m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> but I have too many other projects that I like to do

(54m 27s)

> outside of streaming, so it's hard for me

(54m 29s)

> to bump that off stream number up.

(54m 33s)

> Like a lot of my dedicated gaming time is on stream.

(54m 37s)

[soft music]

(54m 40s) **Al:**

> right? Because you're not going to, you know, sit down and listen to a podcast while you're

(54m 47s)

> gaming because you're streaming, right? Like, it's just, it's not something you can realistically

(54m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(54m 52s) **Al:**

> that makes gaming a, you know, a joint experience most of the time rather than a solo experience,

(55m)

> right? And whereas a lot of most of my gaming is a solo experience, you know, other than I always

(55m 7s)

> find it funny when a new game, a new big game that a lot of my friends play comes out. And I like,

(55m 12s)

> you jump on the switch and you look at your friends list and everybody's playing the same game.

(55m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah

(55m 16s) **Al:**

> And that feels cumulative, even though you're not actually playing together, it's like,

(55m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, it's so cute. Yeah

(55m 20s) **Al:**

> We're all playing this thing together is quite...

(55m 22s)

> I noticed that I had like 12 people online yesterday and every single one of them was playing Pokemon

(55m 29s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I love that

(55m 31s) **Al:**

> So I feel like that massively changes things, right?

(55m 35s)

> Like I... 'cause I'm doing things solo most of the time, right?

(55m 39s)

> Like I'm just playing. Yeah, sure. I'm with my wife, but she's not experiencing the game, right?

(55m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

(55m 43s) **Al:**

> Like she doesn't care about the game. That's fine. We are together in a different way.

(55m 48s)

> we're together watching something and I'm playing this thing on the side like that.

(55m 52s)

> It changes what I want from it and I think that's quite often why I'm less story focused because you know you can't have that whereas I guess the advantage of the way you're doing it is that you can be like really focus on the story where you're doing that because that's the point of what you're doing.

(56m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(56m 10s) **Al:**

> Which doesn't you don't have to be streaming to do that obviously. I'm not I'm not trying to say that you have some unique situation where where you can do this and most people can't do that.

(56m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(56m 20s) **Al:**

> I suspect most people play a game.

(56m 22s)

> And don't do other things at the same time.

(56m 24s)

> I don't know. I'm just making the op.

(56m 28s) **Aislinn:**

> I think it's a pretty, probably a pretty high percentage of people are playing a game

(56m 33s)

> while, like, for example, watching a YouTube video, like, my husband does that all the time

(56m 36s)

> where he's playing. He plays, I would say, his version of a lot of cottagecore games,

(56m 43s)

> where they're games that he can pick up and put down very casually, and he can watch a bunch

(56m 48s)

> of YouTube videos simultaneously. Um, like, for example, power wash simulator just two just came

(56m 54s)

> out pretty recently. I think that's all I've been seeing him playing recently besides

(56m 58s)

> he's just been power washing, and he's just sitting there having a good time making the progress

(57m 4s)

> in the game and catching up in a whole lot of, like, bots on YouTube, for example. Um, and power wash

(57m 12s)

> simulator too is, or just power wash sim in general is a very repetitive game. Looking at your notes,

(57m 17s)

> the number goes up in the sense that the percentage goes up, and, um, it's just nice to turn the brain off.

(57m 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Well, yeah. So, I mean, that's, so that's an interesting thing because, um, like obviously

(57m 27s)

> the repetitive nature we talked about it. And as you say, obviously, one of the things I'd put

(57m 31s)

> down is I like the number go up, right? Like I like seeing in Stardew, you're, you're, you're,

(57m 37s)

> the amount of money that you have go up, the number of plots you have go up, all these things

(57m 41s)

> are going up. I like that. That's satisfying. Um, I have never ever,

(57m 48s)

> once even considered playing power war simulator. Uh, but you would think that it would be

(57m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> Really?

(57m 54s) **Al:**

> something that would be interesting based on all these things I've mentioned so far. And,

(57m 57s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(57m 58s) **Al:**

> and I don't know what it is, but it just to me sounds incredibly boring. I think the reason is,

(58m 10s)

> it's not, it's not about what you do in game. It's about what you're doing with your hands.

(58m 16s)

> And I think there's a funny

(58m 18s)

> fundamental difference between farming games and power war simulator in how you play it physically. So power war simulator you've got your power washer and you are essentially very slowly moving across this big building or small building or the point is right you're you are moving methodically I mean you don't have to you can do whatever you want but like the ideal way of doing it is you methodically go from left to right up to down whatever and you clean this thing.

(58m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. True. Yeah.

(58m 48s) **Al:**

> And how farming games work farming games is a lot of movement it's a lot of doing things and it's repetitive but it's like my hands do a lot of stuff but I don't think power was simulator would work in that way and I think that's one of the ways that I physically find it satisfying is because I am doing a lot with my hands.

(59m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm yeah, I think

(59m 9s) **Al:**

> It's like we had this we had this conversation about in our last episode about when I was talking about asking about persona because I was asking about whether it's

(59m 18s)

> the conversations whether they were automatic and I could just like put the console down and listen and watch the conversation and do something else with my hands because that's the thing is that my hands want to do something.

(59m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> I guess because for me, I do enjoy the aspect of power wash simulator to be able to

(59m 41s)

> just do that repetitive task and I don't mind that it's not. I definitely know what you mean with

(59m 48s)

> like you're able to do more with your hands and I think if we're talking just strictly, strictly

(59m 54s)

> managing a farm versus strictly just power.

(59m 57s)

> I think I would prefer power washing just a little bit more because for me it requires a little bit less thought in the sense that if I also have commitment issues in the sense that like when I'm building up a farm like I'm afraid to commit like this section is going to be the farm and this is this is it like I'm like what if I want to move the farm like it requires a little bit more thought that sometimes I'm not. But it's just then it's like also like a lot of work but also like that's kind of what I just.

(1h 20s) **Al:**

> What if you want to move it? You move it. Yeah, more stuff to do. That's the beauty of it.

(1h 27s) **Aislinn:**

> and maybe that's my but I that's that's what can get overwhelming for me is that it is so much to do and sometimes not always sometimes it's not what I want but when I do want that it's really really really really satisfying but sometimes all I want to do is come just the bare minimum and just clean a wall.

(1h 53s) **Al:**

> You know, and here's here's an intro. I totally get that. I I get the overwhelm. I absolutely do

(1h 58s)

> I do think that sometimes farming games can be a little bit like there's so much you can do

(1h 1m 3s)

> but I think

(1h 1m 5s)

> one of the ways that I

(1h 1m 7s)

> would think about farming games is

(1h 1m 10s)

> Don't think about what you can do

(1h 1m 13s)

> Think about what you want to do. Think about what you have to do and actually what you have to do in these games is very little and

(1h 1m 15s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 1m 21s) **Al:**

> Often the things you have to do.

(1h 1m 23s)

> A very limited in how long you have to do them for.

(1h 1m 27s)

> So if you think about it, what you have to do in a farming game is you have to water your crops that you have.

(1h 1m 35s)

> Once you've watered those crops, six days in a row, and you've harvested them, you no longer have to water your crops anymore.

(1h 1m 42s)

> If you don't want to water your crops anymore, don't plant any more crops.

(1h 1m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm.

(1h 1m 46s) **Al:**

> Do you have to go into the mine? No, you don't have to go in the mine if you don't want to.

(1h 1m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, I love going in the mine, though.

(1h 1m 52s)

[laughter]

(1h 1m 54s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I know. And that's fine. If you want to do that, absolutely. I love it as well.

(1h 1m 55s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

(1h 1m 57s)

> Yeah.

(1h 1m 58s) **Al:**

> That's one of the things that I really enjoy in star juice going into the mine and mining a bunch.

(1h 2m 3s)

> One of the things we did very early on in the podcast was did a mining challenge where played a star juice save where all we were allowed to do was mine and see how much money you could make.

(1h 2m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, that sounds great. I should do that challenge. That sounds awesome. That is a good point.

(1h 2m 15s) **Al:**

> It was actually really fun to do. I need to go back and do some more of these challenges, but it's been a while.

(1h 2m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> I put too much of an expectation on myself. I think it is a problem.

(1h 2m 24s) **Al:**

> I think that's pretty common with farming games because you're like, "Oh, there's these things I can do. I can talk to people. I can farm. I can ranch. I can explore the mine. I can meet more people. There's a festival. There's so many things, but none of them you have to do.

(1h 2m 48s)

> you really got it. Look, look after it. But if you really don't want to, you can go sell the

(1h 2m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 2m 53s) **Al:**

> level. Don't buy the animal in the first place, right? Like there's, you don't have to go fishing. You don't have to go exploring. There's none of these things you have to do. And I think that this is the trap that people fall into so often is going, I have to do these things and actually, no, focus on what you're enjoying.

(1h 3m 10s)

> And then you might experience more of the things at some point and enjoy them and then continue on them. Like I quite often in my, I've talked about on this podcast, how when I start a new farming game,

(1h 3m 23s)

> often speedrun spring, because to me spring is quite boring. There's not a lot you can do. And so I will do as much as I can in terms of farming for my stamina. And I will focus on a couple of characters to talk to every day.

(1h 3m 39s)

> And other than that, I won't do much. I'll go in, I'll talk to the people I'll do the farming and I'll do what I need to do. And then I'll go to bed and I'm quite often going to bed, you know, early afternoon, because there's nothing else to do. There's no stamina for me to do. And that's fine.

(1h 3m 53s)

> Right. Like he says, you have to do all these things in a specific order at a specific time. That's why I love a bit.

(1h 3m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. That's, that's very true. That's very, very true. And I definitely recognize that I put

(1h 4m 4s)

> that expectation on myself. But the other thing is I also want to do all of those things is also

(1h 4m 12s)

> have my problem too, because I do, that's definitely, and this definitely actually all these

(1h 4m 18s)

> to burn out, essentially. But I do like to do all of those things. So like I somewhat recently,

(1h 4m 24s)

> installed like mods on my Stardew, so that I can pause time whenever I want. If I want to have

(1h 4m 29s)

> unlimited stamina, because I want to mine for however long on endlessly, I can do that. But I haven't

(1h 4m 39s)

> fully taken advantage of those mods, because I also am trying to like find a balance of like,

(1h 4m 44s)

> just whatever I feel like doing that day in Stardew, just do that and just don't worry about

(1h 4m 49s)

> everything else and trying to like I guess essentially like give myself grace because I

(1h 4m 50s) **Al:**

> Yeah, absolutely.

(1h 4m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> like doing all the farming. I like doing all the mining. I like talking to all

(1h 4m 58s) **Al:**

> Mm hmm. Well, well, look is I can't I can't I can help you there like if you you don't have to do everything but if you want to do everything then that's own that's all on you. I get that.

(1h 5m) **Aislinn:**

> the characters and when I say all the characters I mean all love the

(1h 5m 4s)

> characters because I like I love to get to know the characters in the game so it's a

(1h 5m 12s)

> lot that's and that's totally I totally recognize that's on me but that is why I

(1h 5m 19s)

> I like that is the core, I know.

(1h 5m 24s)

> But that's the core of the cottage core games as a whole, is that I can do all those things if I want to, and it's awesome that there's so much to do that I do like to do to be able to just immerse myself in that world.

(1h 5m 29s) **Al:**

> Yes.

(1h 5m 36s)

> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(1h 5m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> And I feel like it's you don't get that from a like for example triple a game like I don't know why it's spider man was the first thing that came to mind, but you can't do that with spider man like yeah, there are a number of things that you can do like side quests and stuff to do enjoy.

(1h 5m 54s)

> But like the primary focus of the game is to progress the main storyline and sometimes I'm just not feeling that like yes, I'm still immersed in a world and immersed in like the story of the characters and everything, but sometimes I just want to hang out on a farm and slowly gets another characters while I decorate and take care of my plants and just.

(1h 6m 19s)

> cord endless stones from the minds because I really like to

(1h 6m 24s)

> remind. [laughs]

(1h 6m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, no, I think you're totally right. I just think that the biggest thing that people have prop the biggest problem people have with these games is

(1h 6m 34s)

> They don't think of them as being choices. They think of them as being everything. I have to do everything and actually I think that Stardew and other games like it feels

(1h 6m 43s)

> Mystery or whatever. I know not everybody is the biggest fan of of any individual farming game

(1h 6m 48s)

> But I think they're all the same in that they give you

(1h 6m 53s)

> So many choices of things to do and that's what I mean.

(1h 6m 55s)

> When I was thinking of life as hard to control sometimes, life can be difficult.

(1h 7m 10s)

> Sometimes it's better than others and different people have better or worse lives, but everybody

(1h 7m 16s)

> goes through hardships and sometimes you just want to forget about the hardships and focus

(1h 7m 21s)

> on something else and the good thing about cottage cooking.

(1h 7m 25s)

> I don't need to go exploring the mines, I mean you probably want to at least do some of it to get stuff to upgrade your tools, but you don't need to.

(1h 7m 35s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(1h 7m 52s) **Al:**

> And if I just want to have a chill casual

(1h 7m 55s)

> life building up a big farm, I can do that. And nothing technically would ever go bad for you, your life in that. And that's not something you can ever have in real life, right? Like everybody, every person in the world, no matter who you are, will have bad stuff happen to you. But you can have a game where that's not the case and that's really nice.

(1h 8m 3s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 8m 18s)

> I definitely agree and I guess also to add on to that as well is that farming games are

(1h 8m 26s)

> relatively new in the landscape of games existing as a whole and I feel like there is this

(1h 8m 36s)

> like it's difficult to be able to understand that you can play a game and

(1h 8m 42s)

> you can play a farming sim and you don't have to do everything because the

(1h 8m 48s)

> gaming environment for what feels like a long time is kind of like yeah you're supposed to do everything, you're supposed to do all these side quests, you're supposed to do this main story and it's like no you can just you don't have to talk to a single person in this game if you don't want to and that's okay you can just exist on the farm by yourself and...

(1h 9m 6s) **Al:**

> that would that would be an interesting challenge to do is see how much you can do without talking to

(1h 9m 12s)

> anybody. The the uh, the Hermit, Hermit run.

(1h 9m 17s) **Aislinn:**

> You didn't know I heard it, right?

(1h 9m 19s) **Al:**

> Because you couldn't upgrade, you couldn't upgrade any tools. You wouldn't be able to buy

(1h 9m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> But I'm sure you can do that.

(1h 9m 22s)

> To it, it can, to an extent.

(1h 9m 24s)

> Yeah.

(1h 9m 24s) **Al:**

> anything so you'd have to get everything from the mines, I feel like, but you could still,

(1h 9m 28s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah.

(1h 9m 28s) **Al:**

> you would still get seats that way. What would be the most efficient way to get seats in that?

(1h 9m 33s)

> I'm going to have to think through so I think this could be interesting.

(1h 9m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> Ah, well, but that's like the thing,

(1h 9m 38s)

> is that you could up to a certain extent, of course,

(1h 9m 41s)

> play the game that way.

(1h 9m 43s)

> and because the genre is still relatively so new.

(1h 9m 47s)

> It's not on everyone's scope or in everyone's radar that they have the option.

(1h 9m 52s)

> So someone like me that I would say only within the past maybe 10 years has been able to fully dedicate more time to gaming.

(1h 10m 3s)

> And because I struggled for a while, going from high school into college, where I was not gaming as much as I used to as a kid and really wanted to because I was so focused on my studies that I felt guilty for gaming.

(1h 10m 17s)

> So I fell out of gaming for a while, and then ever since pretty much like the last like 10 years is when I kind of started to like reclaim that for myself.

(1h 10m 27s)

> And again, the farming game world is relatively within that 10 years is when it started to come up.

(1h 10m 35s)

> But I came from an era of playing games where you had an objective, you had a main objective and you have to do that main objective in order to be able to progress the game.

(1h 10m 44s)

> and that's pretty much it.

(1h 10m 47s)

> when I'm presented with all these options, I'm like in my head, I'm like this is the main objective, but again, the beauty of these games is that you don't, that is not the main objective, the main objective is just to do whatever you want and that is wonderful for these games.

(1h 11m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so your flaw with your studies is what I did is I just stayed up all night and got no sleep and played lots of games and then regretted it in the morning and then continued that cycle over and over again.

(1h 11m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> I think I think if I was taking classes that didn't require my physical ability, I would

(1h 11m 24s)

> probably do the same thing, realistically, but I think if I would not be smart of me to not

(1h 11m 25s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's that's that's that. Yeah. Yeah. That's fair.

(1h 11m 33s) **Aislinn:**

> get sleep prior to a flight lesson, I think that's definitely what it was.

(1h 11m 35s) **Al:**

> I accept that. That is fair for the record for the record just in case it wasn't clear. I was joking.

(1h 11m 43s) **Aislinn:**

> You can't tell me that wasn't sometimes though, but it's okay if you do some time.

(1h 11m 45s) **Al:**

> But no, yeah, that

(1h 11m 48s)

> No, no, I wasn't joking about doing it. I definitely did it. I was joking about suggesting that it's something anybody should do.

(1h 11m 55s)

> That's not. I I look I when I was in university, that was when Minecraft came out and so that was I spent so like I have no idea how long right because it was before I was tracking any sort of gaming time and you know Minecraft was just standalone executable file. I don't think it tracked time.

(1h 12m 7s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, no.

(1h 12m 23s) **Al:**

> Absolutely no idea how long I...

(1h 12m 25s)

> I actually had played in Minecraft, but there were, you know, it was multiple days a week I would stay up to like 4am playing.

(1h 12m 34s)

> Yeah, consistently.

(1h 12m 37s) **Aislinn:**

> Mm-hmm. Yeah.

(1h 12m 37s) **Al:**

> And it's very funny because now my youngest is playing Minecraft.

(1h 12m 42s) **Aislinn:**

> Awwwwwwww.

(1h 12m 43s) **Al:**

> And it's very funny that he's now doing that. I spent so long doing in university, he's now playing.

(1h 12m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> Aww. That's cute. That's really, really cute.

(1h 12m 51s) **Al:**

> Completely independent from me. I never mentioned the game to him. He's just like

(1h 12m 55s)

> found it through like watching you know YouTubers and stuff.

(1h 12m 59s) **Aislinn:**

> -Mm-hmm. -No, I love that.

(1h 13m 2s)

> Runs in Minecraft, runs in the DNA confirmed.

(1h 13m 5s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so she gets started on farming games, shouldn't I?

(1h 13m 5s) **Aislinn:**

[Laughter]

(1h 13m 11s)

> I don't think you have to. It's in the DNA.

(1h 13m 14s)

[Laughter]

(1h 13m 16s)

> I'm convinced that whatever games you've sunk,

(1h 13m 19s)

> now I've convinced myself whatever games you've sunk,

(1h 13m 22s)

> the most time into during your formative years

(1h 13m 25s)

> and just growing up in general.

(1h 13m 27s)

> It's in the DNA, is it?

(1h 13m 29s)

> It sounds like I wouldn't be surprised either.

(1h 13m 31s) **Al:**

> I mean I wouldn't be surprised.

(1h 13m 36s) **Aislinn:**

> If he's on, if he's on the path of Minecraft,

(1h 13m 39s)

> then I think it's only natural that farming games are only coming.

(1h 13m 43s)

> Or what's going to be coming next?

(1h 13m 45s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, well, we'll see, right are there any of your points that you haven't discussed maybe that one

(1h 13m 48s) **Aislinn:**

> Only time can tell.

(1h 13m 55s)

> Um, let's see.

(1h 13m 59s)

> I mean, I do I, yeah, I was going to say I do definitely enjoy because I also have a hard time like trying to set to decide what I want to do because again, I want to do everything.

(1h 14m 11s)

> So when I'm given a request to be able to focus on that request, I do really like that.

(1h 14m 17s)

> I really, really, really enjoy that about farming games is that they gave me a very small specific objective and I can complete that objective.

(1h 14m 25s)

> I get some extra money, I can use that money to do whatever I want.

(1h 14m 29s)

> I'm that point. I enjoyed that. I enjoyed that loop a lot.

(1h 14m 34s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's fair it's almost like that's the same as what you were talking about with Pokemon as well

(1h 14m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, there's a trend. There's a trend. I love side quests in general. It's something there's something about side quests that I just really, I enjoy that those little mini, I think that's just another like little mini storyline that I enjoy and I just enjoy little storylines, which is what ties back into like I enjoy getting to know the characters within farming games.

(1h 14m 39s) **Al:**

> doing all the side quests and

(1h 15m)

> Well, it's also the progress thing as well, right?

(1h 15m) **Aislinn:**

> Like I don't.

(1h 15m 1s) **Al:**

> Like you very quickly see progress that way.

(1h 15m 2s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, yeah, it feels it feels like a good a good way to to me.

(1h 15m 10s)

> How do I like I mean, I don't getting more money. I don't know if that's necessarily like a significance way to see progress versus like seeing my farm grow over time. I enjoy both of those to be fair. I do enjoy both of those. So.

(1h 15m 25s) **Al:**

> I mean they're heavily tied together right if you're playing in the traditional you farm to get money sort of way

(1h 15m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> I like just hoarding things like I like hoarding money. I like hoarding items. I like to organize those items.

(1h 15m 39s)

> And then taking all those things that I've hoarded and then putting them into like my farm. I that that loop. I really enjoy being able to.

(1h 15m 46s) **Al:**

> born to be a billionaire

(1h 15m 49s) **Aislinn:**

> I don't think that's ever going to happen. I really don't think that's ever going to happen.

(1h 15m 52s) **Al:**

> no I do I i I find really funny is when people are like oh if I was a billionaire I would do all these things to help people and i'm like and that's why you'll never be a billionaire

(1h 16m 2s)

> well not the only reason but one of the reasons

(1h 16m 4s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(1h 16m 6s)

> - Yeah, that's true.

(1h 16m 7s)

> I always say to myself,

(1h 16m 9s)

> I'm like, if I were to ever win the lottery,

(1h 16m 12s)

> I don't need all of that money.

(1h 16m 15s)

> I really don't need all of that money.

(1h 16m 16s)

> I just need enough money to be able to get my own little,

(1h 16m 19s)

> like, log cabin in the middle of the woods.

(1h 16m 24s)

> And that's really it's with a great internet connection,

(1h 16m 25s) **Al:**

> with a good internet connection.

(1h 16m 28s) **Aislinn:**

> the best internet connection.

(1h 16m 31s)

> And that's really it.

(1h 16m 32s)

> I don't, I don't need.

(1h 16m 35s)

> So I'm like, yeah, I would not be a billionaire because I would just be giving all that money to everyone else that does need it. So everyone else can do the same thing that they want to do. I don't need all that money.

(1h 16m 44s)

> I just need enough to be able to sustain myself and do the, the, whatever I want to do.

(1h 16m 49s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 16m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> And then I would never work a day in my life and I would probably just play a lot of more, I would probably play a lot more farming games.

(1h 16m 56s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 16m 58s)

> And a lot more persona.

(1h 17m) **Aislinn:**

> A lot more persona. I would eventually finish persona.

(1h 17m 2s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 17m 4s) **Aislinn:**

> One day that'll happen.

(1h 17m 5s) **Al:**

> Maybe you'll be finished persona three

(1h 17m 10s) **Aislinn:**

> We'll see.

(1h 17m 12s)

> We got persona three, not persona three, persona four remakes coming.

(1h 17m 17s)

> Maybe I'll finish it in time for that, but probably not.

(1h 17m 21s) **Al:**

> Depends what you define as finished, right?

(1h 17m 24s) **Aislinn:**

> I think once you finish persona, it's like it, but also I don't know because I never played a persona game before. I think because it's all story based.

(1h 17m 31s) **Al:**

> Right, okay, fair enough.

(1h 17m 34s) **Aislinn:**

> I also like persona because I also like getting to know like the little side, like the side story lines with all the characters. So it's all coming together.

(1h 17m 39s) **Al:**

> Side quests all the way down.

(1h 17m 41s) **Aislinn:**

> Side quest, yeah, side quest all the way down, getting to know characters all the way down, being able to just turn the brain off all the way down.

(1h 17m 53s) **Al:**

> But turn it all the way down, and I just turn my brain off.

(1h 17m 54s) **Aislinn:**

> Those are some of the core, all of it just turn all of it, all of it.

(1h 18m)

> It's all I've asked me for.

(1h 18m 1s)

> I want to be an immersive world to turn my brain off.

(1h 18m 4s)

> The real world's I'm trying to think of this anything else.

(1h 18m 4s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 18m 5s)

> I think we're done.

(1h 18m 8s) **Aislinn:**

> I'm like, are there any other other points?

(1h 18m 11s) **Al:**

> It's okay to be done.

(1h 18m 12s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, man.

(1h 18m 14s)

> Well, actually, no, I have I do have a question.

(1h 18m 16s)

> I have a question for you because I have I have a point of like decorating.

(1h 18m 17s) **Al:**

> Go for it.

(1h 18m 19s) **Aislinn:**

> I like decorating a lot too.

(1h 18m 22s)

> As evident by the fact that I like games like house flipper as well.

(1h 18m 26s)

> How do you feel about decorating within really?

(1h 18m 27s) **Al:**

> Oh I hate it. It's not that I have anything against it, right? Like I love that people can do that

(1h 18m 35s)

> and have, you know, I just don't have that creativity in me, the creativity for design.

(1h 18m 42s)

> I don't care. What I do like is like laying out my farm in a particular way to make it the most

(1h 18m 49s)

> efficient for what I want to do. I like that. It's kind of a similar sort of thing, I guess.

(1h 18m 53s) **Aislinn:**

> Hmm. Yeah, I think so. I think for me, I like how my farm looks. I think I'm definitely a static

(1h 18m 57s) **Al:**

> Like, yeah, I know my absolutely not for me, but like my house is like every single time,

(1h 19m 8s)

> if I can move the bed, I will move the bed to the next to the door. So I can walk in the house

(1h 19m 13s) **Aislinn:**

[laughter]

(1h 19m 14s) **Al:**

> and beds there, right? You immediately can fall asleep. It's purely a place to keep the stuff that

(1h 19m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, no, that's--

(1h 19m 23s) **Al:**

> that I need to keep and nothing else. I don't care about

(1h 19m 27s)

> it like making it look fancy. I will, which is funny because like I will obviously expand my home because you know to finish

(1h 19m 34s)

> some of the storylines in these games you need to expand your home, but I'm like expanding my home and putting nothing in it, because I don't care about it.

(1h 19m 41s)

> It's just like this big, empty space.

(1h 19m 42s) **Aislinn:**

[both laughing]

(1h 19m 45s)

> How do you feel in regards to getting to know the characters?

(1h 19m 48s)

> I assume you liked that too, right?

(1h 19m 50s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah. Yeah, no, definitely. I think it does, it takes a lot for me to cater about the characters.

(1h 19m 50s) **Aislinn:**

> 'Cause you were making the joke about Clint.

(1h 19m 52s)

> Okay.

(1h 19m 58s) **Al:**

> There is, you know, maybe a, a hand fill that I could tell you about in story season's grand desire.

(1h 20m 3s)

> Most of them don't really care about. Stardew, I think, is unique in how many characters are

(1h 20m 8s)

> feel like well-rounded people and I could actually talk about. So it just, yeah, it depends on the

(1h 20m 14s)

> farming game and who they are. I think they have to have something about them that makes them

(1h 20m 18s)

> interesting for me to care.

(1h 20m 20s)

> I don't automatically care about learning about people, they have to hug me.

(1h 20m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> That's fair. I'm like, just thinking on it. I think I, because I think they don't have to

(1h 20m 32s)

> automatically hook me, because I know they probably will eventually have some,

(1h 20m 38s)

> get some reaction out of me, whether it's me liking them, or feeling indifferent about them,

(1h 20m 46s)

> or not liking them. I think all of those reactions still all interest me in one sense or another,

(1h 20m 52s)

> But I think that also stems from the fact that I just like meeting new people.

(1h 20m 55s)

> And whether I get along with them or not is a up for debate, but it's just interesting to meet new people.

(1h 20m 56s) **Al:**

> - Oh yeah.

(1h 21m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> So having that experience within games kind of feels somewhat akin to meeting a new person.

(1h 21m 7s)

> So I do enjoy that. But it's funny because I also don't like people, but I also just think it's people are just interesting, which makes sense why I have like a general interest in psychology.

(1h 21m 9s) **Al:**

> What does I hate people so?

(1h 21m 20s) **Aislinn:**

> Because I think people are just interesting in general.

(1h 21m 24s) **Al:**

> I do think people are interesting, but from afar, so I like to people watch if I'm somewhere

(1h 21m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> It ties into it as well.

(1h 21m 29s)

> There.

(1h 21m 32s) **Al:**

> in public, but I'm never going to go talk to any of them.

(1h 21m 34s) **Aislinn:**

> I guess for me to I'm also forced to talk to new people, whether I like it or not.

(1h 21m 39s)

> Because I meet new people almost every day with my job.

(1h 21m 41s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's

(1h 21m 44s) **Aislinn:**

> So I, and I'm stuck with this person, but whether it's one day or five days, I'm stuck with this person.

(1h 21m 51s)

> So I have to get to know them whether I like it or not.

(1h 21m 55s)

> So maybe that is an aspect too, but it's always, I always come away with something and I like learn something about myself too, which is always very interesting to me.

(1h 22m 3s)

> But I think a big difference between you and I when it comes to cottagecore games is one of the things that we like is creating an efficient system versus creating an aesthetic system and those are both things that you can achieve within a farming game that I think is cool.

(1h 22m 22s) **Al:**

> - Choice.

(1h 22m 23s) **Aislinn:**

> Yes.

(1h 22m 25s)

> Having that choice is very nice to be able to, like you said, like, live the life that you want to live within the game.

(1h 22m 32s)

> For me, I want to be somewhat efficient, but I want to also like what I'm looking at.

(1h 22m 39s)

> Like, I think I already said this, but just in case I didn't, if I don't like how a game looks, it's hard for me to play the game.

(1h 22m 45s) **Al:**

> That's fair I don't personally have that but I get why you would I think turn extreme obviously like there's some games where I look and go

(1h 22m 55s)

> I just can't imagine like do you know the one that I find fascinating as vampire survivors I

(1h 22m 56s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh my god. My. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 23m 1s) **Al:**

> Do not understand why anybody likes to play that game because it just looks so bad

(1h 23m 6s)

> Like it doesn't even look it doesn't even look like it was you know a good looking game in the 90s or I know it's a new game

(1h 23m 13s)

> And I'm not trying to say, but like you know how so

(1h 23m 15s)

> you're looking at a game and it's from the 90 like oh boy, this looks dreadful, but I can understand why people liked it at the time

(1h 23m 21s)

> And vampires the fibers if it was around the 90s would have looked like a bad game at that time as well

(1h 23m 25s)

> It's just it just ugly ugly game

(1h 23m 27s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, man, you were speaking to my heart right now, because my husband loves vampire survivors.

(1h 23m 35s)

> And I might like vampire survivors, but the aesthetics of that game, like the cover for

(1h 23m 41s)

> the game in itself and just like, oh, and then I just, I, I also am not a fan of the aesthetics

(1h 23m 48s)

> of that game, but, um, my husband is convinced that I would like the game so much so that

(1h 23m 54s) **Al:**

> the first.

(1h 23m 55s) **Aislinn:**

> and he bought it for me and then it became

(1h 23m 57s)

> on my stream and then the sub go was met and now I have to play vampires if I was at some point on my stream and I'm looking forward to it

(1h 24m 5s)

> But also dreading it because I don't like how the game looks aesthetically

(1h 24m 8s) **Al:**

> I just I mean, I don't understand the concept of why you would enjoy the game full-stop either, right? Like it's just like

(1h 24m 13s) **Aislinn:**

> I don't know.

(1h 24m 14s) **Al:**

> It's it doesn't feel to me like there's any skill or any actual thing you can do other than just like it just

(1h 24m 21s)

> The whole point is to feel powerful, but like you don't actually have to do anything to get to that point

(1h 24m 27s)

> But the first time I saw a screenshot of it because like I'd heard about it so much and like what people really love this

(1h 24m 32s)

> Doesn't sound like the sorry game. I'd play a bit fine. Whatever. I get it like people like different things

(1h 24m 36s)

> and then I saw a screenshot, I'm like,

(1h 24m 38s)

> this is the game they've been talking about, this looks dreadful.

(1h 24m 39s) **Aislinn:**

[laughing]

(1h 24m 41s)

> - What it did, ah!

(1h 24m 43s)

> So the one podcast you did, what, what,

(1h 24m 46s)

> I do you remember what it was?

(1h 24m 48s)

> 'Cause remember how like Stardew became

(1h 24m 50s)

> like the most positively rated?

(1h 24m 52s)

> Vampire Survivor is like top 10 in that list, right?

(1h 24m 55s) **Al:**

> Yes, yeah, we did, I think we mentioned that in passing, yeah, I can't.

(1h 25m) **Aislinn:**

> I don't remember what it was to,

(1h 25m 1s)

> but it's one of the most highly rated games in Steam.

(1h 25m 5s)

> And also again, my husband loves it.

(1h 25m 7s)

> as one of his favorite games to like put on.

(1h 25m 9s)

> And watch YouTube videos to and just turn his brain off to and I just do not understand it because I look at it and I'm like, I'm stressed. There's so much stimulus happening. There's so much going on. It's not even cute looking, but like it's highly rated for a reason and I just don't know what that is. So I feel like I should try it and I am going to try it eventually. So maybe I'll keep you posted on that. I'll let you know.

(1h 25m 25s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 25m 33s)

> Yeah, look, I mean, different people like different things and I'm not saying that, you know,

(1h 25m 38s)

> one should like or dislike. I just, I just don't get it.

(1h 25m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> I mean to, but I do have that curiosity to try to understand why. And if I don't, that's okay.

(1h 25m 49s) **Al:**

> Fair enough. I know there are so many more games that I would actually enjoy so I'm not going to play a game that I am pretty sure I'm not going to enjoy

(1h 25m 57s) **Aislinn:**

> And that's fair. That's totally fair.

(1h 25m 59s) **Al:**

> It was the Tamagotji Plaza if

(1h 26m 2s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh, my God. Oh, man.

(1h 26m 5s)

> That was one of the, that was one of the podcasts that I, I didn't, uh,

(1h 26m 8s)

> I was able to catch up with them and listen to. Oh, that made me so sad.

(1h 26m 16s) **Al:**

> Yeah, the lice said about it the best the better

(1h 26m 21s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, I think it's that I didn't look at, to be fair, I didn't look at the,

(1h 26m 24s)

> I don't remember the aesthetics of the game.

(1h 26m 26s)

> Negostatically without the--

(1h 26m 27s)

> game, everything else. As much as I'm into this, that exhibit game, I don't--nothing could say that game from what it sounds like. I just don't care. I just don't care.

(1h 26m 37s) **Al:**

> down Paris survivors is number six, by the way.

(1h 26m 39s)

> So there you go.

(1h 26m 39s) **Aislinn:**

> Number six. Yeah, I don't know.

(1h 26m 41s) **Al:**

> Number six, it goes.

(1h 26m 42s)

> Stardew Valley portal to Teraria,

(1h 26m 44s)

> people playground, left for dead two,

(1h 26m 46s)

> and then down Paris survivors.

(1h 26m 48s)

> And then Util truck simulator two,

(1h 26m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> Ooh, I remember I used to not like the aesthetics of Hades, and then all of a sudden I did.

(1h 26m 56s)

> I don't know what happened.

(1h 26m 57s) **Al:**

> I, I mean, I think it looks gorgeous. It's a really, the looks of it is definitely not the issue that I ever had with that game.

(1h 27m 1s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, it's wonderful.

(1h 27m 5s) **Al:**

> There were many edges I had with that game that was not it.

(1h 27m 9s) **Aislinn:**

> That is fair, that is fair.

(1h 27m 11s)

> For whatever reason, I used to not like the aesthetics of the game at all, then all of a sudden something flipped and I like the aesthetics now, and I think they're awesome, but

(1h 27m 17s)

> Vampire survivor says not done that, but I am very happy to get a stone.

(1h 27m 21s)

> Give it a chance, and it must be highly rated for a reason for most people, so I'm curious to see what it is, but if I don't like it, that's okay too, because you know you know you're not going to like it, and that's fine, but also just goes to show that aesthetics also don't mean everything, but it's something that I like to prioritize when it comes to games. Oh my God, yeah.

(1h 27m 40s) **Al:**

> Look, I, we both, we both have played Pokemon for so many years, right?

(1h 27m 46s)

> Like, if if aesthetics was everything, we would have been turned off at some point.

(1h 27m 51s) **Aislinn:**

> You're telling me red and blue is not aesthetic. True. Yeah, I agree, but in this modern day.

(1h 27m 55s) **Al:**

> I I mean, at the time, it was amazing, right? That that that it ran like there are so

(1h 28m 3s)

> many bugs with it. It's it's a miracle that I game works at all. But in terms of how it looks,

(1h 28m 8s)

> I like to add the--.

(1h 28m 10s)

> I'm so glad we're back to people complaining about how the game looks rather than people complaining about how the game runs terribly. I'm just so glad we're back.

(1h 28m 25s)

> I work back the-- the-- the, um, sword and shield day days. People hate how the game looks, but it runs well. Yay. We're back to status for it with what?

(1h 28m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah! Yeah!

(1h 28m 34s)

> Yeah, we're back to equilibrium.

(1h 28m 38s) **Al:**

> I could time.

(1h 28m 40s)

> I can I go I like I get why people care I do not care. Let's keep going.

(1h 28m 47s) **Aislinn:**

> Oh man.

(1h 28m 47s) **Al:**

> All right.

## Outro

(1h 28m 50s) **Al:**

> Joining me for this fun discussion.

(1h 28m 53s)

> Why would like.

(1h 28m 54s)

> Of course, not even game.

(1h 28m 55s)

> I still say which one it was.

(1h 28m 57s)

> But you may be both.

(1h 28m 59s)

> Depending on where you look at this episode and in our back end for where I put the shorts and stuff.

(1h 29m 7s)

> or not and stuff. Sometimes it's called "Why do we let?"

(1h 29m 10s)

> like farming games, sometimes it's cottagecore.

(1h 29m 12s)

> I think maybe on one I actually wrote a farming/cottagecore, I lose track, but I could not decide

(1h 29m 18s) **Aislinn:**

> I I think I remember I like that the Google Drive folder is just why we like them

(1h 29m 18s) **Al:**

> what the name of this episode was.

(1h 29m 27s)

> Yeah, I'd given up by that point.

(1h 29m 31s) **Aislinn:**

> that should be the title of just this episode alone it's just why we like them that's it

(1h 29m 33s) **Al:**

> Right. Wait, like.

(1h 29m 37s)

> Oh, dear.

(1h 29m 38s) **Aislinn:**

> no context why we like them

(1h 29m 40s) **Al:**

> Well, anyway, thank you for joining me.

(1h 29m 42s)

> Uh, is there anything you would like to share with?

(1h 29m 45s) **Aislinn:**

> Um, well first of all, thank you again for having me. This was a fun discussion and I have learned many wonderful things about myself and you and farming slash cottage core games at a whole as a whole, um, as for me, I guess you can find me just about anywhere as per usual.

(1h 30m 8s)

> Um, I should have, after this episode comes out, our next episode.

(1h 30m 15s)

> A episode of Moo and Coo, our podcast out, um, spoilers for what we're talking about. I don't have them because we were supposed to have one guest and scheduling fell through then we were supposed to have another guest and then scheduling fell through. So now it's just going to be Chris and I and we have no idea what to talk about. So, stay tuned.

(1h 30m 36s)

> But otherwise, you can find me at some point on Twitch playing.

(1h 30m 45s)

> Legends EA at the moment and hopefully outer wilds again. Ais trainer and you can find me on all all other socials when I am off of my social media hiatus at the same place.

(1h 30m 59s)

> I am just really trying to avoid spoilers because the internet sucks and I'm a really slow gamer and spoilers are everywhere so I'm just taking a break from social media as a whole for now.

(1h 31m 13s) **Al:**

> The only thing I've had spoil farming is a few of the mega-designs, but not all of them.

(1h 31m 16s) **Aislinn:**

> Yeah, me too, thankfully, but it's the one, one of them that I got spoiled before was like one of my favorites that I was curious to see.

(1h 31m 22s) **Al:**

> - Yes, same, same.

(1h 31m 24s)

[laughs]

(1h 31m 25s) **Aislinn:**

> So I, but I haven't seen it in motion yet so I'm like, hoping that will be enjoyable if anything, but I've seen like the artwork for it and I'm like, aha.

(1h 31m 37s) **Al:**

> All right, you can find the podcast on Tumblr and blue sky at THS pod, you can send us feedback

(1h 31m 44s)

> on our website harvestseason.club, tell us why you like farming or cottagecore games if we've missed

(1h 31m 52s)
