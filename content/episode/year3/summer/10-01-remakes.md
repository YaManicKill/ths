## Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al.
(0:00:34) Kev: My name is Kevin
(0:00:36) Al: And we're here today to talk about Cottagecore games.
(0:00:39) Kev: You woo supposedly the word on the street is it says on the box
(0:00:46) Al: Does it?
(0:00:47) Kev: That's odd, yeah, it does it what does the websites I'm assuming it does
(0:00:51) Al: I don't know. This is a good question. What does it say on the website?
(0:00:54) Kev: You know, we've never done
(0:00:55) Al: It says farming. It says a podcast about farming simulators.
(0:00:58) Kev: Well, there you go, I guess we were lying somewhere, you know one of these days
(0:01:00) Al: Yeah, classic.
(0:01:04) Kev: Not days we should do in April fools and switch it up
(0:01:07) Kev: Or we talk about I don't know something else. I guess we kind of do that sometimes but you know something really different
(0:01:12) Al: Something, something else.
(0:01:14) Kev: Yeah
(0:01:16) Kev: We talk about gotcha games, I mean I already do but you know all in oh
(0:01:23) Kev: Yeah
(0:01:24) Al: Hello. We are going to talk this episode about, I want to have a discussion about remakes.
(0:01:25) Kev: Hello listener
(0:01:34) Kev: We don't oh
(0:01:34) Al: Specifically remakes of farming games.
(0:01:38) Kev: Oh, that's well hmm. I mean it's still in the neighborhood like there's stuff to be discussed for sure
(0:01:47) Al: Well, that's why we're doing it.
(0:01:51) Al: I don't tend to have topics that I don't think I'll have much discussion.
(0:01:55) Kev: That is died and I believe that's factually not true
(0:02:00) Al: Wow, how dare, how dare you, how very dare you.
(0:02:04) Kev: Oh
(0:02:06) Al: Before that, we have a bunch of news, but first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:02:13) Kev: Okay, let's see here when I wrote things down
(0:02:16) Kev: Okay, Marvel snap. Okay, I should have talked about this earlier because it ended this week, but I mean all snap goes
(0:02:22) Kev: It's good the the new Fantastic Four
(0:02:27) Kev: Season with cards based off the movies coming up
(0:02:30) Kev: They're just doing a whole new season like first step family
(0:02:34) Kev: First steps whatever but but that's coming so you know and that looks good
(0:02:38) Kev: But I didn't talk about maximum voltage overdrive or whatever that thing was called
(0:02:45) Kev: You played snap outs been a minute. Did you play maximum voltage?
(0:02:49) Kev: Do you remember that mode at all?
(0:02:50) Al: I think it was around when I was playing, but I don't think I played it.
(0:02:54) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:02:56) Al: I did the Deadpool Diner and I did.
(0:02:59) Kev: Yeah
(0:03:00) Al: There was one other one that I did, but I don't think I did maximum.
(0:03:02) Kev: Okay, so
(0:03:04) Kev: So yeah, every once in a while snap introduces these like alternate modes with different rules or different words or whatever
(0:03:12) Kev: And so one that they've done is called maximum voltage
(0:03:16) Kev: and previously maximum voltage was a three-turn game instead of six turns and
(0:03:20) Kev: They would give you a random amount like two to four energy every turn like extra so it was you know
(0:03:27) Kev: Not just the one two three four
(0:03:29) Kev: So you had you could play cards quickly and you had to do on three turns
(0:03:34) Kev: It's a it's a different pace a game. It's fun even shorter. I liked it
(0:03:41) Kev: Well this past week or two they did maximum voltage overdrive or overcharge whatever's over something
(0:03:50) Kev: Where it was a four-turn game
(0:03:53) Kev: The same rules of okay, you get random two to four energy every turn
(0:03:59) Kev: on top of what you already have
(0:04:02) Kev: But they
(0:04:04) Kev: Also filled your deck out with like was it eight or twelve extra random cards in your deck
(0:04:10) Kev: Those extra cards had lower costs and higher power
(0:04:15) Kev: So it was it was a wild ride because it was a lot of like kind of RNG really right what you get
(0:04:22) Kev: It's hard to build around like, you know real strategy around it
(0:04:26) Kev: and you know, I
(0:04:28) Kev: I enjoyed it enough. It was fine enough. You know a lot of people don't like RNG sort of
(0:04:34) Kev: modes or strategy so you know I don't think as popular as other ones but at
(0:04:40) Kev: least they tried something right like I always did they say hey try it and then
(0:04:43) Kev: we'll see how it goes but the bigger fiasco was the rewards because when they
(0:04:52) Kev: have these side missions they'll give you usually like a sort of bonus currency
(0:04:56) Kev: or side currency or whatever specific for that mode with a shop or reward tier
(0:05:01) Kev: or something like that.
(0:05:04) Kev: In this case they gave you a shop, you could earn let's just call them vault points or whatever they were called.
(0:05:08) Kev: And so there was a new card in the shop.
(0:05:12) Kev: Kid Omega, I don't know who that character is but they had a decent enough ability.
(0:05:16) Kev: But regardless, so yeah, it was a new card and very cool and all.
(0:05:24) Kev: But here's the thing, for the first time ever in one of these side modes, you could not earn the card for free.
(0:05:32) Kev: Um...
(0:05:34) Kev: Well, I guess you technically could, but...
(0:05:36) Kev: So how it works is every eight hours you get a set of three missions, and you get X number of points for it, right?
(0:05:44) Kev: Well, people did the math.
(0:05:46) Kev: If you did all the missions, every single set of three for every eight hours for the entire duration of the thing,
(0:05:52) Kev: you would still have to win 500 games, I think it was, to earn enough points to earn the new card.
(0:05:57) Al: That is so many games.
(0:06:04) Kev: But...
(0:06:04) Al: I don't think I've ever won 500 games combined in the, like, what, combined what, six months
(0:06:06) Kev: Yeah, totally.
(0:06:14) Kev: I mean, I might be there with you.
(0:06:18) Kev: But yeah, so that was wild.
(0:06:24) Kev: And a lot of people were up in arms about it, as you can imagine, and I think understandably so.
(0:06:30) Kev: Also, because Marvel Snap, traditionally, has been...
(0:06:34) Kev: Play-ish where or at least you if you played enough you could get a decent pool of cards or you could get work
(0:06:40) Kev: You know the new cards they were releasing if you kept up you could
(0:06:45) Kev: You could you could play for free
(0:06:48) Kev: the boat the money was either spent on generally speaking on
(0:06:55) Kev: Cosmetics, you know variants and bundles
(0:06:57) Kev: I guess the season passed you could unlock a new card and that's ten bucks a month and like that
(0:07:02) Kev: But they would drop for free later
(0:07:04) Kev: So you didn't have to do it. But anyways
(0:07:08) Kev: Point is that a lot of players feel like the the snap devs are kind of leaning a little more into
(0:07:15) Kev: You know pay to win or pay to get the new cards
(0:07:19) Kev: So that was a big
(0:07:20) Kev: Yeah, big big bit a little bit of fiasco
(0:07:25) Kev: and
(0:07:26) Kev: Yeah, it's over now. We went to another mode called sanctum showdown, which is but it's much slower paced modes fun
(0:07:35) Kev: They're playing it safe. No crazy
(0:07:38) Kev: Expensive card or whatever but
(0:07:40) Kev: It's interesting to see
(0:07:43) Kev: kind of a shame that they you know, they're a little money hungry, but
(0:07:48) Kev: Cuz though otherwise the game I think is in still in a decent shape
(0:07:52) Kev: They've released so many cards like I think it's almost in a state of we can play whatever you want more or less
(0:07:59) Kev: But yeah, I mean I'm still playing it. I'm still enjoying it. I did not get the kiddo-megan card
(0:08:05) Kev: You know, it's wild. I saw somebody with that card on day one
(0:08:08) Kev: Which means they must have put a lot of money or gold or whatever. Yeah, there's always an I found the whale. Oh
(0:08:08) Al: Hmm there's always one. There's always one. Yeah
(0:08:16) Kev: Speaking of not having money or wanting money
(0:08:20) Kev: Yes, let's talk about unicorn overlord. So I reached the end of what's called best stories. That's the beast land
(0:08:30) Kev: Campaign area there's basically like five countries in the game or whatever and each one is kind of
(0:08:34) Kev: Its own little chapter if you will write its own little story and arc and so I reached the end of the best stories chapter
(0:08:41) Kev: Which is fine and all the villain was a rat man a rat where rat I guess. I don't I don't know how to describe it
(0:08:50) Kev: You know, I'll show you a picture
(0:08:52) Kev: but
(0:08:53) Kev: And so I enjoyed it. It was a fun chapter. I think the Beast people were cool, but what is funny and
(0:09:00) Kev: I can feel it. I learned about this
(0:09:04) Kev: When I went online because it felt something felt like it was changing the writing in unicorn overlord who was pretty alright
(0:09:12) Kev: Up until around now because they really just kind of did not give the the rat man's name
(0:09:19) Kev: His name was Elgore and he kind of had an interesting story
(0:09:23) Kev: The rats were generally oppressed people and he wanted to rise up and then you know, he became a general
(0:09:29) Kev: So it's kind of an interesting story and there was some evil the evil bad guy team
(0:09:34) Kev: We're doing experiments on him yada yada
(0:09:38) Kev: But it was really really rushed. And so I kind of looked into it and it turns out
(0:09:45) Kev: That oh
(0:09:47) Kev: Hold on one second now
(0:09:49) Kev: my mic
(0:09:51) Kev: Sorry, there we go. Sorry. My mic had a hiccup and I think we're good now while checking
(0:09:57) Kev: double-checking
(0:09:58) Al: Sounds fine to me.
(0:09:59) Kev: Yes, okay. I lost a few seconds of the recording, but okay. I'm okay
(0:10:03) Kev: I don't know, at least the--
(0:10:03) Al: It's fine now.
(0:10:05) Al: Zoom is pretty good at like starting out.
(0:10:05) Kev: Yeah, all right
(0:10:09) Kev: Well, anyways, so I looked up that why it started feel rushed and turns out that the unicorn
(0:10:15) Kev: Overlord development ran out of money and basically the director producer they started funding it out of their own pocket
(0:10:22) Kev: so apparently this last
(0:10:25) Kev: quarter or so of the the game is gonna feel very rushed and
(0:10:30) Kev: There's no time for story anymore. Which is sad but
(0:10:34) Kev: That said the game is still
(0:10:38) Kev: Entertaining. I like it. It's fun. Yeah, like unicorn overlord to two thumbs up from me
(0:10:45) Kev: Let's see
(0:10:47) Kev: So yeah, so that's good. Um, oh, okay follow up from last week
(0:10:50) Kev: So we spent a little time having a fun little chat about magic the gathering and capitalism and the $1,000
(0:10:58) Al: Like 20 minutes.
(0:10:59) Kev: pack of set of four packs
(0:11:02) Kev: and it was all started as you may recall because
(0:11:04) Kev: I was looking at the, or you know, the Final Fantasy set of Magic the Gathering cards came out,
(0:11:12) Kev: and I did not want to buy them because I didn't want to spend them, or spend the money for them.
(0:11:17) Kev: Well, this week I bought the Final Fantasy card set from Magic the Gathering, virtually, virtually, there's my caveat, haha.
(0:11:26) Kev: Uh, no, I did not spend money, but... yeah, haha, virtual versions of my cardboard.
(0:11:27) Al: Oh, wait, that's that's even that's even all right.
(0:11:30) Al: I was going to say that's even worse if you bought digital cards.
(0:11:35) Kev: No, no money spent. So I've been, I've played Magic the Gathering Arena, though that's the online client. I fired it up to get in there and try.
(0:11:43) Al: Good game. I've not played in a long time, but when I was playing, I was doing a lot of arenas.
(0:11:49) Kev: Alright, it's good. It feels comparable, I think, to, you know, Pokemon TCG live.
(0:11:54) Al: Oh, I think it's way better.
(0:11:56) Al: I think it's way, way better.
(0:11:57) Al: I think the I mean, it's been a while since I played it.
(0:12:00) Al: But in my experience, the app was much less slow in menus and the effects were much better.
(0:12:05) Kev: Yeah.
(0:12:08) Kev: I agree with that. It is much, much more polished, right, overall. A little fancier. And you're right, a little less laggy.
(0:12:17) Kev: But, yeah, but I mean, the point is, it serves as a decent online, you know, substitute for the paper game.
(0:12:26) Kev: So I got some, yeah, Final Fantasy cards there and played a little, doing a choco bow deck.
(0:12:33) Kev: I'm really upset
(0:12:35) Kev: Those cards are really good, art-wise and gameplay-wise
(0:12:42) Kev: They have, because I mentioned I was playing Final Fantasy, the proper FFTCG
(0:12:49) Kev: That game doesn't have equipment cards
(0:12:51) Kev: Magic the Gathering does, so Magic the Gathering can include iconic items and weapons
(0:12:57) Kev: Like the Buster Sword, or a cup of instant noodles from Final Fantasy XV
(0:13:04) Kev: So I'm more...a little...
(0:13:05) Kev: I'm jealous that Magic did it so well.
(0:13:07) Kev: Whoever...the people working on the Final Fantasy set, they really love Final Fantasy.
(0:13:13) Kev: They have Souplex the Train as a card.
(0:13:17) Kev: People who know FF5 understand that reference.
(0:13:25) Kev: But yeah, I mean, I try to...
(0:13:27) Kev: I'm still thinking about it. I'm looking at it.
(0:13:31) Kev: The card's proper. I'm not gonna buy it yet.
(0:13:35) Kev: Oh, it's been...I've been craving it. It's a siren song.
(0:13:38) Kev: So I had to...you know...I had to at least do it virtually to enjoy it a little.
(0:13:46) Kev: But I digress. That's what I've been up to this week.
(0:13:50) Kev: What about you, Al? What's going on?
(0:13:52) Al: Well, let's see, what have I been up to?
(0:13:56) Al: Shock surprise.
(0:13:58) Al: I have been playing some Mario Kart World up.
(0:14:00) Kev: Yeah, you're going for it, man. Getting all those knockouts here. I've seen your progress.
(0:14:04) Al: Yes, so update on that.
(0:14:07) Al: I have done all of the Grand Prix's 150, three stars and all of the knockout
(0:14:13) Al: all of the knockout tours, 150, three stars.
(0:14:19) Al: and I have done enough in free.
(0:14:22) Al: Rome to unlock mirror mode.
(0:14:25) Kev: Okay.
(0:14:27) Al: And I have unlocked all of the costumes.
(0:14:30) Kev: Oh, you're- you've done it all almost pretty much at this point.
(0:14:33) Al: I am still missing three characters.
(0:14:36) Kev: Wait, wha- oh. How d- uh- uh-huh.
(0:14:38) Al: But that's because they are the Kamek characters,
(0:14:43) Al: so you have to be on a specific course
(0:14:47) Al: and someone use the Kamek behind you on that specific course.
(0:14:50) Kev: Uh, okay, I did notice that I got some kamiks and I think I got kamiks characters out of that.
(0:14:53) Al: There's a chance that you get one that character, so.
(0:15:00) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:15:01) Al: So I've got most of them, but I'm still missing three of them.
(0:15:04) Al: And it's like they are dreadful to try and force like the bet.
(0:15:08) Kev: Yeah, who are they?
(0:15:10) Al: How who am I missing?
(0:15:12) Al: Let me check my spreadsheet.
(0:15:14) Al: I am missing Rocky, wrench.
(0:15:18) Al: Peepa and Swoop.
(0:15:20) Kev: Oof, oof, oh man, I like swoop.
(0:15:21) Al: I have the rest of them.
(0:15:22) Al: So that's I have that's 15 out of 18 characters unlocked
(0:15:26) Al: and 103 out of 103 costumes unlocked.
(0:15:31) Al: So, yeah, and I've got all the vehicles as well.
(0:15:36) Al: All 40 of them.
(0:15:37) Al: So I am going to I'm definitely going to do.
(0:15:40) Al: I'm definitely going to start doing mirror modes.
(0:15:42) Al: I really want to restart all the mirror modes
(0:15:45) Al: before I get too much muscle memory for specific courses.
(0:15:46) Kev: Yeah.
(0:15:49) Kev: Mmm.
(0:15:50) Al: Right, because that that's when it becomes really hard.
(0:15:52) Kev: Yeah, you're right.
(0:15:53) Kev: That's an excellent point.
(0:15:53) Al: But I'd love I'd love to three star mirror mode
(0:15:56) Al: because I've never restarted every mirror mode in a Mario cart.
(0:16:00) Kev: I mean you're like there, you're wide as well, right? You've gone the 90%?
(0:16:06) Al: Yeah, it's I guess the thing is it's just about like time now, right?
(0:16:10) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:16:10) Al: Like we've got two and a bit weeks until Donkey Kong comes out.
(0:16:15) Al: That's basically my deadline, right?
(0:16:15) Kev: I was about to say, that's the deadline, right?
(0:16:17) Al: Like if it's if I've not done it by
(0:16:20) Al: Donkey Kong coming out, it's probably never happening.
(0:16:23) Kev: Yeah, well, maybe they'll release some DLC, but I understand what you generally say.
(0:16:28) Al: Yeah, but at that point, I don't I think at that point I'll play the DLC,
(0:16:31) Al: but I don't think I'll go back and try and do the other mirror modes.
(0:16:31) Kev: Yeah, it'll be out of your system, I get it.
(0:16:34) Al: Right.
(0:16:36) Al: So we'll see. We'll see how I feel.
(0:16:38) Al: But I'm going to I'm going to at least try and see how far I get.
(0:16:42) Al: But obviously it's quite few and, you know, I can see I should be able to do them.
(0:16:47) Al: Right. Because I've done one hundred and fifty.
(0:16:49) Al: I should be able to do mirror mode.
(0:16:50) Al: I don't think I'm in use to them enough that I will cause problems.
(0:16:53) Al: Although maybe there's a couple of courses that are recreations of previous ones,
(0:16:58) Al: like the Mario Bros circuit, which is just like the continuation from the one
(0:17:00) Kev: Yeah
(0:17:03) Al: and since the sna is-
(0:17:06) Al: right? That one might be trouble because I suspect I'll have muscle memory for that course
(0:17:06) Kev: Yeah
(0:17:12) Kev: Sure sure
(0:17:12) Al: but we'll see, we'll see. I'm gonna try and we'll see how I go
(0:17:17) Al: and I think that's all I was considering. So have you done much free roam?
(0:17:22) Kev: Not too much myself now
(0:17:25) Al: So you've got the P switches, you've got peach medallions and you've got the question mark blocks.
(0:17:27) Kev: Yeah
(0:17:29) Kev: Yeah
(0:17:32) Al: the only one that's actually like shown on the map.
(0:17:36) Al: The P switches where each course has a certain number of P switches and it shows you how
(0:17:38) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:17:40) Al: many you've got. So I'm considering doing the P switches, but there's no way I'm going
(0:17:47) Al: to look for all of the peach medallions and all not not P switches sorry the question mark blocks.
(0:17:52) Al: It's not the P switches the question mark blocks. There's no way I'm going for the piece all the
(0:17:56) Al: P switches and all the peach medallions. I'll probably do some more just playing around in
(0:18:00) Al: free roam and if I see some I will do some, but I'm not going to go out my way to get
(0:18:04) Al: every day because it's like
(0:18:06) Al: 300 P switches or something it's mad how many there are I'm not going to do
(0:18:08) Kev: Yeah, you don't want to collect all the Koroks?
(0:18:12) Al: all of them definitely not but I can see myself doing all the question mark
(0:18:17) Al: blocks just because they're like clearly like there's six on this course six on
(0:18:22) Al: this course six on this course I could see myself doing that but I'm not I'm
(0:18:28) Al: not going all in on that at this point right like we will see
(0:18:31) Kev: man. I gotta say the free roam is a little disappointing from what I've experienced and
(0:18:39) Kev: seen. I was really hoping for, for lack of a better word, secrets, right? Little nooks
(0:18:47) Kev: and crannies you could explore that, you know, you wouldn't experience on a race or whatever,
(0:18:52) Al: - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:18:53) Kev: right? Like in, you know, shooting for the stars, like even a handful of courses not in any of the
(0:19:01) Kev: pre-write, you know, unofficially labeled, like you enter a cave and all of a sudden
(0:19:06) Kev: there's this little racetrack down there. Stuff like that, but anyways, yeah, there's not much
(0:19:12) Kev: going on other than unlocking mirror mode, I guess, on free roam. Although I do like the
(0:19:20) Kev: Princess Peach Castle, the window easter egg, that's fun.
(0:19:23) Al: Yeah, yeah, it's I will agree that I think free roam is a little bit of a disappointment, but yeah, I am still very much having fun.
(0:19:35) Al: And I will definitely be playing this with people in person a lot.
(0:19:40) Kev: I'm sure. I mean, it's Mario Kart. It's built for that.
(0:19:41) Al: No, it's 100% worth.
(0:19:44) Al: Yeah, it's 100% worth it, especially as, you know, it was what, like 30 quid in the bundle, right?
(0:19:49) Kev: Yep.
(0:19:50) Kev: Exactly.
(0:19:50) Al: Like it was very much worth that.
(0:19:53) Al: And just, it is, I still stand by it's the most fun to control the, with the new physics reactions. Like I feel like all the other ones will feel quite stiff going back to them.
(0:20:04) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think
(0:20:10) Kev: Yeah, I yeah, I don't think a lot of people are gonna push back on that it does feel very good to control
(0:20:16) Kev: I agree
(0:20:19) Kev: Yeah, it's it's I mean it's Mario Kart right like it's still gonna be good
(0:20:22) Kev: It's a but it is funny though that you know insert the the Simpsons sheep gif when Donkey Kong bonanza comes out
(0:20:28) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely. That is going to be like a couple of weeks of just
(0:20:34) Kev: Yeah
(0:20:37) Al: like that's the only thing I'm playing. Yeah. And we, has the direct been since we recorded
(0:20:39) Kev: It looks so good, I only more
(0:20:44) Al: our last episode? I can't remember. Super fun. I'm so excited for this. I think it's
(0:20:44) Kev: I I can't remember. We haven't talked about it either way, but that's uh
(0:20:51) Kev: that's a
(0:20:52) Kev: good looking direct
(0:20:53) Al: really, yeah, I think they, that was a great direct because it shows
(0:20:58) Al: it kind of confirmed a bunch of the stuff we already knew while also giving us enough
(0:21:03) Al: to be like, oh, there's more. Right. And, and I think it's really, I think it's really
(0:21:09) Al: good looking. Like I love the different effects that you get in transforming into other animals
(0:21:16) Al: and also having Pauline basically be like a parrot on your shoulder. Right. It's really
(0:21:22) Kev: yep it's it's so good I i love the online reaction that we the internet gave of like you
(0:21:23) Al: fun.
(0:21:30) Kev: know the trifecta of uh was it ralph and vanellope uh sully and boo and now we've got dk and pauline
(0:21:38) Kev: you know big guy and then little girl um it's it's fun
(0:21:38) Al: Look, it works, right? Like why, why break it? Why try and fix it if it's not broken,
(0:21:47) Kev: Exactly. It's great. Um, yeah, I'm I'm very pumped. Uh,
(0:21:52) Kev: for uh uh the the game or general, I guess. Um, it's I'm a
(0:21:59) Kev: little disappointed that we don't get the animal buddies
(0:22:02) Kev: per se. I mean, I know Rambi's in there and and it's kind of
(0:22:06) Kev: in there, but you know, it's it's the functions been replaced
(0:22:09) Kev: by your transformations and the transformations are cool. I
(0:22:12) Kev: won't lie. Um but uh I don't know. I'm a guy who likes Rambi.
(0:22:17) Al: Well, look, I don't have any real history with the previous DK games other than trying them and not enjoying them.
(0:22:23) Al: So I don't particularly mind.
(0:22:27) Al: I'm not a lower muncher.
(0:22:30) Kev: Sure, I mean, it's not even like lore stuff because that's uh, that's just uh, you know, I guess mechanics or
(0:22:38) Kev: Gameplay traditions, whatever. But if you want to talk about lore, I mean we can get trying to you know
(0:22:43) Kev: We can try figure out why on earth
(0:22:48) Kev: Does how is Pauline hanging out a DK? How does that timeline work?
(0:22:52) Al: Well, I think everything lines up if you just ignore the original DK game. I don't think
(0:22:59) Al: anything else is a problem. I think it's only that. And I think that this ties in so much
(0:23:00) Kev: Yeah. Which...
(0:23:05) Al: better to Odyssey, because why would Pauline be the mayor of a city that's named after
(0:23:11) Al: her kidnapper? But she would be the mayor of a city that's named after her hero.
(0:23:12) Kev: Yeah, I like the way you think there that's a good point, yeah, but and also like this
(0:23:28) Kev: is even more so than Odyssey cuz I mean Paulina was in there was you know, she's first time
(0:23:32) Kev: back in forever or whatever but she's you know, she has a starring role finally, that's
(0:23:40) Al: Yeah, my I also I have another theory that it might be time
(0:23:47) Kev: All right, oh well there you are now we're talking let's get into that Zelda split timeline
(0:23:55) Al: Well, I don't even think it needs to be a split timeline, right?
(0:23:58) Al: Like, if something happens and she gets shot forward and then she goes back in time after this,
(0:24:04) Kev: Oh, I like it. I like.
(0:24:05) Al: you know, she could still go through the whole thing, because the thing is, right,
(0:24:09) Al: Pauline in Donkey Kong, that's not this Donkey Kong, that's Cranky Kong.
(0:24:14) Kev: that is cranky kong who does exist yeah oh I like that that's clever yeah there you go all right I like it
(0:24:15) Al: So, you know, she's obviously from the past.
(0:24:22) Al: Or, or, here's another suggestion.
(0:24:25) Al: If Donkey Kong, if Donkey Kong and Cranky Kong are both Donkey Kong, then maybe Pauline.
(0:24:32) Al: This could be a different Pauline. Maybe this is Pauline's daughter.
(0:24:35) Kev: You know, I mean, that's well established, right? Bowser Jr. looks just like Bowser when he's a baby, I guess, so you know.
(0:24:45) Al: Pauline Jr.
(0:24:46) Kev: Pauline Jr. could be!
(0:24:49) Kev: Although, okay, you know what? You know what? I'll even point the bat at the stands here.
(0:24:54) Kev: I bet we get little Pauline here as a character in Mario Kart World War 2.
(0:24:58) Al: I hope so. I do hope there is some stuff coming, so I saw someone note that some of the characters
(0:25:06) Al: have lots of costumes, and some of them have almost none. In fact, some of them have none.
(0:25:11) Al: And the interesting thing is, one of the characters that has almost none is Donkey Kong. He only
(0:25:12) Kev: Yeah.
(0:25:16) Al: has one costume. Just before a Donkey Kong game comes out, suspicious. So are we interested
(0:25:17) Kev: It is very strange considering, you know, he's...
(0:25:21) Kev: Uh-oh, uh-oh!
(0:25:28) Al: in a Mario Kart World update coming with some Donkey Kong costumes to encourage you
(0:25:34) Kev: I mean
(0:25:36) Al: to be interested in the new game? Maybe. Yeah. And we obviously have all the baby characters,
(0:25:37) Kev: If if it feels like the most obvious dough in the world, right, um, so yeah
(0:25:46) Al: so would we get a young Pauline, as well as the babies that we've got of the other characters?
(0:25:48) Kev: I like it
(0:25:51) Kev: How cute
(0:25:51) Al: We don't have Pauline at all. Oh no, we do have Pauline. But also Pauline only has one
(0:25:53) Kev: We do it, Paul
(0:25:58) Kev: Like a generic racer costume, so there you go
(0:25:58) Al: costume. So, you know, the two of them, both in an upcoming game. You know, I will be very
(0:26:05) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:26:09) Al: disappointed if there's not. But this makes you wonder what else could be related to things,
(0:26:11) Kev: I you know that's I don't think you're being unreasonable
(0:26:16) Al: right? Birdo only has two costumes, so that's an interesting one. Could there be a Birdo
(0:26:22) Al: thing coming up? Who knows? Lakitu only has two costumes, and there is an update to...
(0:26:28) Al: Why can't I remember the name? Goodness me. Mario Party. Which Lakitu obviously has a
(0:26:34) Kev: Which Mario what okay?
(0:26:40) Al: big part in Mario Party. Maybe I'm stretching at this point. Who knows? But we'll see. I'm
(0:26:41) Kev: Yeah
(0:26:48) Kev: We we will see I think that's the end that's all we can kind of say really um
(0:26:54) Al: I'm sure we can say much more, but let's not.
(0:26:56) Kev: Well, well, okay, yeah, you know, I will say this like each his legs still make me very uncomfortable. I
(0:26:59) Al: Fair, very fair.
(0:27:03) Kev: Don't like it
(0:27:05) Kev: Get in the car. Don't look at those freak. Yeah, no, no, I don't like it. That's
(0:27:08) Al: Don't put him on a bike.
(0:27:15) Al: He should be in the cloud cart.
(0:27:19) Al: That's the only one he's allowed to be in.
(0:27:20) Kev: Yeah, you really or you know, I don't care I
(0:27:23) Al: No, I'm just saying.
(0:27:26) Kev: Look, I don't care if it's like
(0:27:29) Kev: Horrendous I don't care if it's horrendous like animation clipping just
(0:27:35) Kev: Just stick the the dang
(0:27:36) Al: The cloud around every cart you put them in.
(0:27:40) Kev: Yeah, yeah, when he's the bike it's just clipping right to the cloud
(0:27:45) Kev: Okay, you make it it's worth it
(0:27:50) Al: All right, so that's my car.
(0:27:52) Al: I've also I don't want to talk too much about this, but I do want to mention it.
(0:27:58) Al: I've opened Lens Island again and started playing that.
(0:28:02) Al: So for context, I originally backed on.
(0:28:06) Al: Kickstarter and I started playing it when it first came out, but it had no controller
(0:28:11) Al: support and basically was horrible to use on the steam deck.
(0:28:16) Al: So I have started playing it again, and it is less horrible to play on the steam deck.
(0:28:24) Kev: But that's always the bar we want less horrible
(0:28:25) Al: And I think that's as far as I'm going to go on this comp on it just now.
(0:28:33) Al: I will probably go into it a lot more in the next.
(0:28:36) Al: episode, probably, but no promises.
(0:28:38) Kev: Okay, fine. Okay.
(0:28:43) Al: So that is a thing that is currently happening that I am not going to give any opinions on right now.
(0:28:52) Al: But finally, we are recording this on Saturday, the 28th of June.
(0:28:57) Al: I have just finished the first day of Pokémon Go Fest 2025 Global.
(0:29:01) Kev: Oh, is that what's going on? Okay.
(0:29:03) Al: That's what's today.
(0:29:04) Al: Yeah. So, uh, I had.
(0:29:06) Al: Fun. I got a few hours where I was allowed to remove my
(0:29:14) Al: responsibilities from children and just go play Pokemon in Edinburgh.
(0:29:17) Al: And yeah, I got a good amount of stuff done and I enjoyed that.
(0:29:20) Kev: Cool. What is going on? What are they releasing?
(0:29:24) Al: This is the Crowned in Shield form Zacian and Zamazenta.
(0:29:30) Kev: Wait they weren't in there already that's weird, but okay
(0:29:32) Al: No, they had the base forms, but not this Crowned in Shield form.
(0:29:37) Al: Uh, because they've got to release them separately to make the most money, right?
(0:29:42) Kev: - Oh, yeah, yeah.
(0:29:46) Al: But yeah, so, uh, yeah, I think they did this one a lot better than the previous
(0:29:52) Al: other forms, because with Curum and with, uh, oh, what's the other one?
(0:29:59) Kev: Uh, uh, uh, Nick Asma.
(0:30:03) Al: Nick Rosma, thank you.
(0:30:05) Al: with both of them.
(0:30:06) Al: You have a certain amount of energy you need to get to fuse them, but if you separate
(0:30:15) Al: them, you have to use the same amount of energy again to fuse them again.
(0:30:21) Al: It's like a thousand-fuse energy, or whatever they call it.
(0:30:25) Al: I can't remember and I don't care.
(0:30:26) Kev: Yeah, that's correct
(0:30:29) Al: Once you fuse them, you use up that thousand, but you get like a hundred per raid that you
(0:30:33) Al: do.
(0:30:34) Al: raids to get enough defuse once
(0:30:35) Kev: Okay
(0:30:36) Al: set of them. And then if you're like, "Oh, I fused the wrong one", and you unfuse it,
(0:30:37) Kev: Yeah, oh
(0:30:42) Al: you then have to do another 10 raids to do it. But of course, those raids were only available
(0:30:45) Kev: It sounds like a lot
(0:30:48) Al: for one weekend. They've never been available again, so you can't get the energy anymore.
(0:30:55) Al: It's dreadful!
(0:30:56) Kev: That sounds like a lot.
(0:30:58) Al: Well, the good thing is that Zamasenta and Zacian, once you turn it into crown form,
(0:31:04) Al: If you revere its form, you can...
(0:31:06) Al: you can then do it again without using any energy.
(0:31:09) Kev: Sure, okay. Okay, I mean, that's that's definitely nice. I just, man, I just got to say I didn't go that long at all. But hearing how like, because I think Megas were kind of the first one where you had, you know, special mega energy or whatever. Like, it's, oh, it doesn't sound great. Just the oddest.
(0:31:33) Al: The the Megas actually I think is a lot better than it was when it first launched.
(0:31:38) Al: So like you you can get one free mega for each of your mega Pokemon once a week.
(0:31:45) Al: So once you've done the initial one, every week, you can do it once for free.
(0:31:49) Al: You only have to pay more energy after the first one
(0:31:53) Al: if you want to do it faster than that.
(0:31:55) Al: And as you get up the power, like once you can level up the mega and once you get
(0:32:00) Al: Mega level 3. It matters.
(0:32:04) Al: How much it costs so like every if you were to do it every single day, you wouldn't be using a huge amount of energy so it's it's not it's it's much better than it was initially launched and I get why you know it is a bit frustrating that you still have to use it energy at all but it's a lot less annoying you also get energy if you walk with them as a buddy and stuff like that so you know it's it's fine it's fine it's these fusing ones that are the most annoying because it's like.
(0:32:33) Al: I know have my necrosimas and my cutums fused and I can never unfuse them because I would never be able to fuse them again right like it's just that's it if you chose the wrong one tough and it's really annoying because one of them I did choose the wrong one and but there's nothing I can do about that I'm stuffed and that's just what I have to live with.
(0:32:40) Kev: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
(0:32:46) Kev: Oh, no!
(0:32:50) Kev: Ugh.
(0:32:52) Kev: Oh, that's rough. That's rough, buddy.
(0:32:53) Al: Still. Yeah, that is life but yeah so there's actions Amazon to was done much better and I got shiny.
(0:33:03) Al: And I got my energy and I've I've powered them up so nice powerful Pokemon looking looking great my shiny shield was it shield form kind of what it's called and they have new adventure effects so.
(0:33:04) Kev: Yeah!
(0:33:10) Kev: Yeah, that's the game!
(0:33:18) Kev: That's cool, that's good.
(0:33:19) Al: There we go.
(0:33:22) Al: And they can also be used because they're when they're in that form they can be used at power spots, which normally only dynamics Pokemon can be used a pair of spots, but of course you can't you can't.
(0:33:33) Al: And they can also be used in Dynamax session and Amazon to but when they're in that form you can use them a pair of spots so that's fun.
(0:33:44) Al: So yeah, I probably do a little bit tomorrow as well because it was Amazon to things action tomorrow, but which is a bit annoying, but if you got the ticket for go fest you do get enough energy to do one of one of the dogs, so I do have enough to do as action, but I probably want to get enough to do another one.
(0:34:02) Kev: Sure. Well, I am glad that you're enjoying it.
(0:34:03) Al: Continuing to enjoy Pokemon go despite everything.
(0:34:07) Kev: I don't...
(0:34:11) Kev: This, well, that's kind of, uh, I mean, that's just a blanket save these days.
(0:34:20) Al: They keep trying to ruin the game, but I still somehow enjoy it.
(0:34:24) Al: All right, let's talk about some game use a woo.
(0:34:31) Kev: Oh, wait, wait, back up.
(0:34:32) Kev: I'm sorry, I just--
(0:34:33) Kev: I don't know why you just clicked something in my mind.
(0:34:34) Kev: I forgot.
(0:34:35) Kev: I want to follow up my Magic the Gathering thing.
(0:34:39) Kev: So as I look, you know, I was dipping my toe in the MTG pool.
(0:34:44) Kev: Guess what's the next secret layer?
(0:34:45) Al: I don't know.
(0:34:46) Kev: You know me.
(0:34:48) Al: Ah, ah, ah, pressure, um, unicorn over the light!
(0:34:53) Kev: Haha, oh, oh, that'd be so
(0:34:54) Al: No, ah, no, um, let's see, so Kevin, something Kevin would like.
(0:34:59) Al: Well, it's not going to be like anything Nintendo.
(0:35:02) Kev: No, no it's just very funny hearing that.
(0:35:04) Al: Wait, is it?
(0:35:06) Al: No.
(0:35:08) Kev: I didn't intend, I didn't intend, life log Nintendo Pass.
(0:35:09) Al: Well.
(0:35:12) Kev: You don't like Nintendo things, um, but it won't, uh, MTG, I gotta say, it wouldn't be
(0:35:15) Al: I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's the opposite of what I thought, Kevin.
(0:35:19) Kev: in there.
(0:35:20) Kev: Yeah, okay.
(0:35:21) Kev: Yeah, okay, yes, yeah, I know what you're saying, but the way it came in my ears, it's
(0:35:21) Al: What I thought was, oh yeah, it could be, you know, you like Nintendo stuff.
(0:35:25) Al: And I was like, oh no, but they're not going to do something with Nintendo.
(0:35:27) Al: That was my point.
(0:35:30) Kev: It's not too funny.
(0:35:31) Al: Trying to accuse me.
(0:35:32) Al: Accuse me of not thinking you like Nintendo stuff.
(0:35:34) Al: Ah, no, I've not got anything.
(0:35:39) Al: Nothing's coming.
(0:35:40) Kev: Ow! The lowest hanging fruit! Gotta go fast!
(0:35:44) Al: Oh, Sonic.
(0:35:45) Al: What? They're doing Sonic, Magic the Gathering?
(0:35:47) Kev: They're doing- okay.
(0:35:49) Kev: Yeah! Dude, they already did SpongeBob! Who cares?
(0:35:53) Al: What? This is what one out all these cards look so good.
(0:35:54) Kev: Oh, you missed that! SpongeBob's in magic! Oh, yeah!
(0:36:02) Kev: Don't they?
(0:36:03) Al: Oh, no. Oh, no.
(0:36:04) Kev: They look- that's- that's the exact reaction.
(0:36:10) Al: I don't want this. Well, no, I do want this.
(0:36:14) Kev: And you- and- oh, my- like, Shadow-
(0:36:15) Al: I managed to not even look at the Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings ones somehow.
(0:36:18) Kev: Oh- oh, yeah.
(0:36:20) Kev: Shadow looks busted. It's insane.
(0:36:24) Kev: They're no big the cats, so point against them for that. No cream, either.
(0:36:28) Kev: But overall, it's- it's in their-
(0:36:31) Kev: Ugh, Sonic's ability, 'cause you know, when they have an ability, they have a little, like, name for it.
(0:36:36) Kev: It- it's literally "Gotta go fast."
(0:36:38) Kev: You know "Gotta go fast" isn't even from the games.
(0:36:40) Kev: It's just from the, uh, the- the dub intro of an anime. [Laughter]
(0:36:45) Al: Yeah, I'm not particularly surprised.
(0:36:48) Kev: Oh, yeah, Sonic's going to magic.
(0:36:50) Kev: It's- ugh. I don't like it. I'm- I'm- I'm- oh, dear. I'm cooked, as the children would say.
(0:36:58) Kev: You know, Unicorn Overlord, it- wild as it- it's not in Magic the Gathering, but in- they have one of those-
(0:37:04) Kev: What is it? I think it's, like, the Overlord edition. You know, one of the big fancy collector's editions.
(0:37:08) Kev: There's actually a whole
(0:37:10) Kev: building card game inside that it's wild
(0:37:16) Kev: Yeah, card games are my vice. They're my legal addiction. Sonic's coming to magic
(0:37:16) Al: And will this be coming and will this be coming to arenas?
(0:37:28) Kev: uh good question I don't know arena is very weird because arena has
(0:37:39) Kev: arena is kind of its own environment it has exclusive arena cards it has its own formats
(0:37:45) Kev: and i'll tell you the the bad ones we're getting a spider-man set in a few months
(0:37:51) Kev: that the spider-man set cards are coming to arena but not with spider-man full
(0:37:58) Kev: they're going to replace them with whatever generic magic card characters or whatever
(0:38:02) Al: What? What does that even mean then?
(0:38:05) Kev: it means they didn't get the license to use it digitally
(0:38:07) Al: What would be the point in adding the cards then, if they're not the cards?
(0:38:11) Al: So they're gonna have like the same effects, but not use any names for Spider-Man.
(0:38:14) Kev: yeah yeah you you get yeah you get pied or arachnid avatar I don't know
(0:38:18) Al: That's so stupid.
(0:38:20) Al: Just don't do it.
(0:38:28) Kev: uh good old magic together I i joined just this year what a good time to get into this game
(0:38:36) Al: Update, I have downloaded Magi the Gathering Eraser.
(0:38:39) Kev: yeah oh we gotta play some games um all right let's go to non sonic base oh or is there
(0:38:44) Al: Yes, yeah, news, game news. No, no, no, no, there's obviously not. Research story have
(0:38:47) Kev: is there sonic base news maybe not yet one day it's inevitable
(0:38:56) Al: announced that their 1.0 is coming the 21st of July, so it has been a long time coming.
(0:39:00) Kev: Okay
(0:39:02) Al: Let's see, when did this first come into Early Access? February 2023 was when this launched
(0:39:04) Kev: Yes, oh wait research, so I don't know I heard something else okay that that is exciting
(0:39:11) Al: in early access.
(0:39:12) Kev: Research work takes forever to ask Cody. That's why the 1.0. It's it's forever
(0:39:14) Al: So, maybe we need to get our second harvest on this after the 1.0 is out.
(0:39:18) Kev: It's the equivalent of getting their PhD congratulations research story
(0:39:23) Kev: I'm sure Cody isn't triggered by this at all
(0:39:31) Kev: Okay, so wait we got let's see what is the date on the oh July 21st there
(0:39:38) Kev: It is but it's available on the on a beta branch. That's weird. What do you mean?
(0:39:43) Kev: 1.0 will be available in beta before one point
(0:39:45) Al: No, no, that's so. So that's before launch, you'll be able to play the beta.
(0:39:48) Kev: Yeah, I know that that's very weird to me like
(0:39:52) Al: Well, OK, I see what you mean. I see what you mean. I see what you mean. So
(0:39:57) Al: it's not actually that uncommon in software development where you go, this is our beta for
(0:40:05) Al: 1.0 or 1.1 or whatever. That is not that uncommon, actually. I think it's less common in games,
(0:40:07) Kev: Sure. Yeah. Sure. And I mean, like, you know, public betas and test servers,
(0:40:12) Al: But it's definitely something that you see quite a lot.
(0:40:18) Kev: like they're common and I'm not saying it's unheard of, but I don't know.
(0:40:21) Kev: It just feels weird, especially in game dev, like the 1.0 is the big fitting, right?
(0:40:25) Kev: So, uh, I don't know, but whatever, um, but hey.
(0:40:28) Al: You still have to pop the game you can't just play it's not just anybody can play it like it's public
(0:40:33) Kev: Yeah.
(0:40:34) Al: But public for people who have paid for the game, right?
(0:40:37) Kev: That's true. Good point.
(0:40:40) Kev: All right. But hey, it's here.
(0:40:42) Al: Tiny garden the content the
(0:40:45) Al: Featured game of last week's episode have released a statement regarding the Nintendo switch version
(0:40:52) Kev: I didn't think I'd ever hear a statement from Tiny Garden.
(0:40:56) Al: This is this is great. I'm just
(0:40:58) Al: going to read some of the statement because I don't think I can really
(0:41:01) Al: summarize it better than they have done. "We wanted to clarify some questions
(0:41:06) Al: that have arisen regarding the Nintendo Switch version of Tiny Garden. We have
(0:41:09) Al: been vague and perhaps not communicated with you as well as we could have, for
(0:41:14) Al: which we apologize. We did not want to cause you unnecessary concern or bore
(0:41:18) Al: you with technical details. The truth is that the Switch version of Tiny Garden
(0:41:23) Al: will be ported by an external company. As we are such a small team it was very
(0:41:28) Al: hard for us to do everything in-house. The problem here is we've not yet found a
(0:41:32) Al: company that can port the game with the polish and quality that we feel
(0:41:35) Al: comfortable with. Both our publishers Super Rare Games and us want to deliver
(0:41:40) Al: the best possible version of Tiny Garden on Switch. However, we did not
(0:41:43) Al: anticipate that this porting would be so complicated." Hey, I could have told you.
(0:41:48) Al: We've seen this before.
(0:41:50) Kev: What are you talking about?
(0:41:52) Kev: It's katrossi katronfi, it's fuckies!
(0:41:56) Al: And then they go into details about complaining.
(0:41:58) Al: About their game engine and that's the reason.
(0:42:02) Al: Sure, fine.
(0:42:05) Al: It's funny because it's like, oh no, we didn't know it would be complicated to bring it to a
(0:42:10) Al: console. Like what did you expect? Like these things are always complicated.
(0:42:14) Kev: Well, yeah, I mean anything game dev is complicated pretty much anything dev software dev is always complicated
(0:42:19) Al: Yeah, exactly.
(0:42:21) Kev: Well, look here. Here's your free advice tiny garden people call biting studio
(0:42:27) Kev: Those are the guys who make cassette beasts that except beasts is on Godot. They brought it to switch
(0:42:32) Kev: It's awesome on switch. There you go
(0:42:33) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the thing. I suspect if you do it in Unity or Unreal, I suspect
(0:42:42) Al: it is slightly easier because they are obviously like larger companies use them and so therefore
(0:42:51) Kev: They're established.
(0:42:53) Al: need the console support to be as good as it can be, right? Because otherwise there
(0:43:00) Al: There would be big problems because Godot is.
(0:43:04) Al: open source and therefore more likely to be used by smaller teams, and they are less likely to be focusing on consoles at all more likely to be focusing on just PC because that is the easiest for.
(0:43:18) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:43:18) Al: I mean, it's just the easiest to develop for full stop right because there's no gatekeeper right like that has has been the case for a long, long time.
(0:43:20) Kev: Yeah, I mean yes, yes, that's correct
(0:43:26) Kev: And probably will always be the case because just the nature of the beast so yeah
(0:43:28) Al: Exactly.
(0:43:29) Al: Exactly.
(0:43:30) Al: Exactly.
(0:43:31) Al: So there's, they're probably simplifying.
(0:43:33) Al: Things in what they're saying, you know, these things happen.
(0:43:40) Al: I would like to clarify again, please, if you're backing a game on Kickstarter, if you
(0:43:47) Al: want it for console, don't back it on Kickstarter, right?
(0:43:50) Al: Like just, just like it's the console is always like, it is when the Kickstarter happens normally,
(0:43:59) Al: the way that it is happened is there is a working version of the game.
(0:44:03) Al: It may not be final.
(0:44:04) Al: It may not have all the content, but they have a game and it can run on PC.
(0:44:08) Al: There will be nothing running on console at that point.
(0:44:11) Al: And it's very likely, unless they are a team that have ported to console before, it's very
(0:44:16) Al: likely that they have no idea what they're doing with consoles at all, right?
(0:44:20) Kev: Yep.
(0:44:21) Al: And this, this isn't meant to be harsh on them.
(0:44:24) Al: This is just a fact that if you have, if you're not a console developer, you do not know how
(0:44:29) Al: complicated it is.
(0:44:30) Al: I am not a games developer, right?
(0:44:33) Al: I'm a web developer.
(0:44:34) Al: And even in web development, there are things that if you don't know how it works, it is
(0:44:38) Al: so much more complicated than you realize.
(0:44:42) Al: And there are just certain things that are more awkward.
(0:44:45) Al: And if you haven't started development on it, you don't know how complicated it is.
(0:44:49) Al: And it is likely not going to be done until the game is finished.
(0:44:52) Al: That's the other thing, right?
(0:44:55) Al: Even Stardew Valley still doesn't get updates out day and date on console, right?
(0:45:00) Kev: Yeah.
(0:45:01) Al: and stardew valley
(0:45:03) Al: is one of the biggest indie games, full stop.
(0:45:06) Kev: Yeah.
(0:45:07) Al: It's not like he's only on his own anyway. He has a team that he works with, he worked with
(0:45:12) Kev: Nice.
(0:45:12) Al: porting companies before, he has done many different things, and even he can't do it.
(0:45:20) Al: It takes so much work, even big companies struggle with that.
(0:45:26) Al: It is rare for a game to come out at the same time on PC and console unless you are one of
(0:45:31) Al: of the biggest games and they will.
(0:45:34) Al: Completely different teams working on the PC version, working on the switch version, working on the PlayStation version Xbox is different because they're like the Microsoft of well, pretty much Microsoft have done so much work and I, you know, I'm the first to jump on Microsoft a bad bandwagon, but Microsoft have done so much work to make putting games to Xbox so incredibly easy it's not. It's still not just as simple as click a button. It does.
(0:45:36) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:45:41) Kev: Yeah
(0:45:44) Kev: They are a PC
(0:46:03) Al: It does it, but it is so much easier than any other console. If you have an existing PC game, especially if you're using the tools that Microsoft give to make the game on PC.
(0:46:07) Kev: Sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, guess. Hi. Hey, I'm still holding out for mighty number nine
(0:46:15) Al: All that being said, all that being said, never back a Kickstarter for a switch game. Just don't do it, right?
(0:46:25) Kev: on the 3DS. Uh, but.
(0:46:31) Al: I have, I have, when I, when I bought my steam.
(0:46:33) Al: Dick, it was so good because it meant that I could go through and like change
(0:46:37) Al: all of my kickstarters to use to steam codes instead of switch get codes.
(0:46:41) Kev: Mmm, yeah, at least
(0:46:41) Al: And you get the game a year before, right?
(0:46:44) Al: It's just every, every, every single one is there's none of them.
(0:46:49) Al: Not a single game that I have backed on Kickstarter has released
(0:46:53) Al: on switch at the same time as steam.
(0:46:54) Kev: year you're not wrong not at all ah well you know what though in this
(0:47:03) Kev: particular case there's an easy way to fix this you know what you don't even
(0:47:07) Kev: have to release on the switch tiny garden just so you know what we're
(0:47:11) Kev: canceling it we're investing everything into the playdate port and we're all in
(0:47:12) Al: Honestly, a Playdate port would probably be quicker, because it would have to lose features,
(0:47:17) Kev: we're good all is forgiven
(0:47:24) Al: right? It's not going to be the same, the graphics are simpler, like honestly, if they started now
(0:47:31) Al: from scratch, they could probably get a Playdate version out before they could port their version
(0:47:34) Kev: Well, well there you go, Tiny Guard. The path is there.
(0:47:34) Al: to Switch. I'm not joking. They would of course get a fraction of the sales, right? There are
(0:47:42) Al: Playdates. Yes, it does. I love the Playdate, it's so good. I just wish I played it more.
(0:47:44) Kev: the dozens look I mean I might join the dozens I'll say that
(0:48:00) Kev: Yeah
(0:48:05) Al: As far as I can see, the only number I've seen on Playdate sales was in May of last year,
(0:48:10) Al: They said 70,000 have been sold
(0:48:12) Al: But that was one year into it, and we're now a year later, so who knows how much different that is?
(0:48:20) Al: Who knows?
(0:48:22) Al: But that's an absolutely tiny fraction, you know?
(0:48:26) Kev: - Yeah, yeah.
(0:48:26) Al: Like, the Switch has over a hundred million sales, right?
(0:48:32) Al: It's not even...
(0:48:34) Al: Like, if you were to take off...
(0:48:36) Al: If you take the number of Switches minus the number of Playdate sales,
(0:48:40) Al: sales. You have to be a salesperson.
(0:48:43) Al: You have to have the number of switches that were sold.
(0:48:45) Kev: Yeah
(0:48:45) Al: Right? It's the same number.
(0:48:47) Al: That's how small the number of playdays that sold are.
(0:48:51) Al: It's just a completely different world.
(0:48:53) Kev: Sony says they found more PlayStation 2 sold just this month in the playdate
(0:48:53) Al: Completely different world.
(0:49:06) Al: All right. Anyway, yeah.
(0:49:07) Kev: You're fine tiny garden
(0:49:12) Al: Go Go Town have announced they've got a new update coming on the 15th of July,
(0:49:17) Al: and this is the Tourist Trap update. This game adds a bunch of extra stuff to the tourism,
(0:49:23) Al: so it already had tourism, but this is updating a bunch of things. Tourists will do more stuff,
(0:49:27) Al: there's more stuff to give tourists, there's a new level of industry, and
(0:49:36) Al: lots of little things. Also, they're adding cliff terra farming, so woo!
(0:49:43) Kev: tourism that's pretty smart actually like thinking about like
(0:49:46) Kev: Animal crossing I guess because you know when I think of go-go town think of Animal Crossing
(0:49:50) Kev: There might be a way to go with Animal Crossing or you know
(0:49:54) Kev: little shops
(0:49:55) Al: Yeah. Yeah, that could be fun.
(0:49:55) Kev: Tourists visiting even it's just like a separate area, you know
(0:50:00) Kev: Yeah, that's fine, that's cool
(0:50:02) Al: It is. Yeah, the tourists is fun.
(0:50:04) Al: It does make it more of a management game than I would enjoy personally.
(0:50:12) Al: In my experience playing the game, I like the like the building and the terraforming.
(0:50:19) Al: And I like adding all that stuff in and making this village and, you know, hiring people.
(0:50:24) Al: and I like all of that.
(0:50:25) Al: And then the tourist stuff comes in and I go,
(0:50:28) Al: OK, this is getting a bit too management-y for me.
(0:50:35) Al: And our last piece of game update is APCO have announced a physical edition.
(0:50:42) Al: You can preorder it now.
(0:50:43) Al: It's thirty five dollars and that's for PS4, PS5 and Switch.
(0:50:50) Kev: the uh limited run games um yeah apparently a lot of people on the internet have turned against
(0:50:50) Al: Yeah.
(0:50:52) Al: A classic.
(0:50:55) Al: There was, yeah, there was some thing that happened that was a bit of a,
(0:50:57) Kev: lrg um
(0:51:05) Al: is it actually limited run games or was it something else?
(0:51:08) Al: It was a bit of a weird thing.
(0:51:10) Kev: I mean, I have two.
(0:51:10) Al: Personally, I've bought a few things from them and I've never been
(0:51:13) Al: disappointed with it.
(0:51:15) Kev: I just think people don't like the artificial quote unquote scarcity,
(0:51:19) Kev: which I, yeah, I was about to say, yeah.
(0:51:20) Al: Yeah, I don't think it's artificial though, right?
(0:51:23) Al: Because that, this is the point, right?
(0:51:25) Al: The point is, yeah, it's expensive to print physical games.
(0:51:31) Kev: And if this is
(0:51:31) Al: And if you do it in this limited way, it actually makes a change.
(0:51:36) Al: It's the opposite of artificial scarcity.
(0:51:37) Kev: Yes
(0:51:37) Al: It's we wouldn't be able to do this on a permanent basis.
(0:51:40) Kev: Yeah
(0:51:41) Al: Therefore, we're going to do it on a limited
(0:51:43) Al: run so you can get it if you want. It's this or nothing.
(0:51:43) Kev: It's
(0:51:45) Kev: Yeah, it is
(0:51:46) Kev: It is literally the name
(0:51:48) Kev: Okay. Oh, you know what it is. I think I remember I started hearing a lot of buzz about it
(0:51:53) Kev: Like there's a couple of company like big companies, you know, like triple-a publishers that he used LRG
(0:51:59) Kev: I think that's where it started bothering.
(0:52:01) Al: Fair. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fair. That's fair.
(0:52:01) Kev: But either way, Apico, that's a great choice for LRG.
(0:52:08) Kev: I'm a little disappointed.
(0:52:10) Kev: There's no big super collector edition with real life bees or whatever that'll come with it.
(0:52:16) Kev: But hey, I think this is a good thing.
(0:52:21) Kev: LRG does get sales.
(0:52:26) Al: Yeah. If you really, if you, if you are all in on physical media and you were like, I'm
(0:52:31) Al: not going to buy going until it's on physical media, here you go. You know, it's an interesting
(0:52:35) Al: thing that I was thinking about with the whole, with the whole people complaining about, you
(0:52:37) Kev: Yeah, what?
(0:52:41) Al: know, digital games and wanting physical media, that's dead in PC. That has been dead with
(0:52:47) Al: PC for like 20 years. But like, cause like, I remember having this
(0:52:48) Kev: That was dead almost on revival on arrival excuse me on PC. You're super right
(0:52:56) Al: Switch 2, and I still have not Switch 2, the Sims 2, goodness me, see where my brain's
(0:53:01) Al: at. I remember getting the Sims 2. I feel like that was probably my last physical PC
(0:53:08) Al: game. I still have it. But like, as soon as Steam launched, that was gone. Nobody bought
(0:53:14) Kev: Yeah, no. Well, what do you go? What physical is there now? Or I get one to steam launch. We're CD still around when steam launched.
(0:53:15) Al: any physical PC games.
(0:53:24) Al: Well, most most games were on DVD, but yeah.
(0:53:28) Kev: Or DVD, whatever. Was there disk trays of any kind when steam?
(0:53:32) Al: So Steam launched in 2003.
(0:53:34) Al: So yeah, the distros were still standard at that point.
(0:53:39) Al: But it was very fast after that, I feel that, yeah.
(0:53:42) Kev: They were on the way
(0:53:48) Al: So I just find it interesting because, like, I don't really
(0:53:50) Al: hear people complaining about it in the fit.
(0:53:52) Al: And maybe I'm just in the wrong areas on the internet.
(0:53:54) Kev: No, I, I, I've never heard it myself.
(0:53:55) Al: I don't really hear people clamoring for physical media in PC,
(0:53:59) Al: but they will take any opportunity to complain about Nintendo.
(0:53:59) Kev: I've never heard it.
(0:54:03) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:54:03) Al: Right.
(0:54:04) Al: I'm like, I am not a corporate shill, right?
(0:54:06) Al: I, there are legitimate complaints to have about Nintendo.
(0:54:09) Al: And the fact that your digital games can be taken from you is a
(0:54:12) Al: thing to be annoyed about.
(0:54:13) Al: And it's totally fair.
(0:54:14) Al: I get that.
(0:54:15) Al: Absolutely complain about that.
(0:54:16) Al: But I just feel like people complain about it only in relation to Nintendo
(0:54:21) Al: because they don't like Nintendo and anything they'll do is
(0:54:24) Al: just a way to complain about them, you know?
(0:54:27) Kev: you know it's yeah yeah I mean that's a deep rooted resentment slash discourse right back
(0:54:35) Kev: at the playground the console wars and all that stuff so what what can we say i'm looking at the
(0:54:42) Kev: lrg website right now there's shaunte yeah that that is correct
(0:54:44) Al: You're seeing if there's anything that catches your fancy.
(0:54:49) Al: Interestingly, the last thing that I bought from Limited Run Games was the Nitro Deck.
(0:54:58) Al: So that was the Nintendo Switch controller where you slot the Switch into it.
(0:55:03) Al: It's like a physical thing that you slot it into rather than controllers you put on the
(0:55:07) Al: side.
(0:55:09) Al: I really like that.
(0:55:10) Al: I really hopefully do one for the Switch too because I like having
(0:55:14) Al: like it feels more stable than having the controllers on the side.
(0:55:19) Al: But anyway, so I think they did a limited edition one for
(0:55:26) Al: with the like
(0:55:28) Al: see-through purple color that you got with like their original Gameboy and stuff like that.
(0:55:32) Kev: Atomic Purple, baby!
(0:55:33) Al: The Atomic Purple, that's what it is. Yes. So they did a limited edition Atomic Purple version. And so of course I bought that one.
(0:55:40) Kev: Yeah.
(0:55:41) Al: It was more expensive but it was only like 10 quid more.
(0:55:41) Kev: Oh no.
(0:55:44) Al: I'm more expensive and I'm like 10 quid for Atomic Purple. I will do that.
(0:55:47) Kev: Yeah, I would do that ALL DAY!
(0:55:50) Kev: All- I'm surprised they never released- Well, no, they haven't released any Potomac Purple in forever, but we didn't get Joy-Cons, I'm sad.
(0:55:56) Kev: Kelly modded her own. She- she did the atomic look green.
(0:56:00) Al: I have seen you can get shells. I have never felt the need to re-shell a Joy-Con personally,
(0:56:04) Kev: Yeah.
(0:56:10) Kev: I mean, I'm lazy, but making an Atomic Purple, or whatever atomic ollie you want, that's worth it. I get it.
(0:56:11) Al: but I can see why someone would want to.
(0:56:19) Al: There's also companies that would just sell you a joy con like that, but it's, they're
(0:56:22) Kev: And that.
(0:56:24) Al: like over a hundred quid.
(0:56:25) Kev: And that.
(0:56:28) Kev: Oh man.
(0:56:30) Kev: Man, I'm looking at the Sonic Crossworlds, the collector's editions on allergy.
(0:56:35) Kev: There's a King Boom Boom Keychain! That is the deepest cut!
(0:56:39) Al: I will say, although we were complaining about AAA companies using LRG, I will say I'm totally
(0:56:40) Kev: Oh my goodness, I will never see another piece of King Boom Boom merch as long as I live!
(0:56:51) Al: fine with them doing it for what is always going to be limited stuff. So these limited
(0:56:54) Kev: - Yep, I agree.
(0:56:56) Al: edition versions, like you can like in six months, you'll be able to go buy a physical
(0:57:01) Al: copy of Sonic Racing Cross Worlds. It's just that you won't be able to get the limited
(0:57:04) Kev: - Yeah, right, right, yeah.
(0:57:06) Al: edition version. I think that's totally fine.
(0:57:07) Kev: Yeah, I agree, that's fine.
(0:57:09) Al: If you are going to spend $150 on a limited edition version of Sonic,
(0:57:15) Al: you're going to buy it at launch. If you wait six months, you are your own special kind of idiot.
(0:57:18) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:57:21) Kev: Yeah
(0:57:23) Kev: That is correct
(0:57:25) Al: I mean, if you buy that, you're probably an idiot anyway, right?
(0:57:28) Kev: Hey you that is also correct as some
(0:57:31) Al: Having spent money on limited edition versions of games, I bought the limited edition version
(0:57:34) Kev: Same here
(0:57:36) Al: of Stardew and then sold the actual physical copy
(0:57:39) Al: of the game because I already had it digitally.
(0:57:43) Kev: You you bought the Mario cereal threw away the cereal
(0:57:43) Al: I am definitely one of those suckers.
(0:57:48) Kev: He's one of the amiibo box
(0:57:50) Al: Well, no, I sold the cereal, not threw it away.
(0:57:53) Kev: Hey, there you go a little credit
(0:57:54) Al: Come on, let's not.
(0:57:55) Al: I would not throw away a copy of Stardew Valley.
(0:57:57) Al: I just sold it on to someone else.
(0:58:02) Al: All right, so we also have two new games to talk about,
(0:58:05) Al: and these are both, I think, pretty interesting.
(0:58:08) Al: So we'll go for.
(0:58:09) Al: I have many questions about this that I haven't managed to find answers for yet,
(0:58:20) Al: but this is a.
(0:58:23) Al: So two things to talk about this one.
(0:58:25) Al: It is a 16 bit version of farming simulator.
(0:58:29) Al: I don't that's interesting.
(0:58:31) Al: I might be tempted to actually play this game.
(0:58:38) Al: That is one thing to talk about, right?
(0:58:39) Al: So that is a new game coming out.
(0:58:42) Al: I need to see if it's available digitally, if it's only...
(0:58:44) Al: Yeah, it does seem to be available.
(0:58:45) Al: It looks like 15 euros you can buy it for.
(0:58:49) Al: It looks like it's already out, only on PC, I think.
(0:58:55) Al: But you can buy it on there.
(0:58:57) Al: It looks like...
(0:58:59) Al: When did this come out?
(0:59:00) Al: It actually looks like it came out a couple of months ago, the 16-bit version.
(0:59:03) Al: I don't know whether we talked about it and I just forgot about it or whether we missed it.
(0:59:06) Kev: I don't think I don't I didn't hear about I don't remember hearing about it. This is news to me
(0:59:10) Al: But they've also announced this limited edition, speaking of limited edition, version of Farming Simulator 16-bit,
(0:59:19) Al: which is in a Sega Mega Drive cartridge case and includes a dummy cartridge.
(0:59:26) Kev: Yeah, one of those thick boys
(0:59:31) Kev: Yeah, I that's a common thing I think I have at least one of those the dummy cartridge probably
(0:59:38) Al: First of all, why Mega Drive?
(0:59:40) Al: That's a such-- or Genesis, if you will, if you're American.
(0:59:42) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:59:43) Al: Why that one specifically?
(0:59:46) Kev: That is
(0:59:46) Al: That's an interesting choice.
(0:59:48) Kev: Yeah, I am also a little perplexed by that. I guess I don't know like why not this mess
(0:59:54) Kev: I- I don't know, 'cause...
(0:59:56) Kev: You know, obviously, uh, some Sonic fan, right?
(0:59:58) Kev: So I got- I think the cartridge I have is like- is like the Sonic Mania, Mega Drive, Genesis, whatever, um, but...
(1:00:04) Al: That makes perfect sense.
(1:00:04) Al: That would not be on anything else, right?
(1:00:05) Kev: Yeah.
(1:00:06) Kev: Correct.
(1:00:06) Al: Like although Sonic was on other consoles, I think originally it was on the Master System.
(1:00:08) Kev: That's correct.
(1:00:11) Al: Like Mega Drive is the definitive version of Sonic, right?
(1:00:11) Kev: Yeah.
(1:00:16) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I agree.
(1:00:17) Kev: So that makes sense, but you're right, why is- who on the farming simulator team said, "It has to be on the GENESIS!"
(1:00:24) Kev: I DON'T WANT THAT!
(1:00:26) Kev: Stupid grey-purple cartridge, I want the nice black one!
(1:00:30) Al: Yeah, fascinating. It is literally just it is a dummy cartridge in a Mega Drive cartridge
(1:00:39) Al: case and you get the download key. That's it. And it's 50 pounds or 50 euros. I don't
(1:00:48) Al: know if it's on US. Most realistic. Yeah.
(1:00:50) Kev: I'm, I'm puzzled because this is farming simulator, you know, they always push in the graphics and the most accurate simulator and okay.
(1:00:59) Kev: I get the concept of going retro.
(1:01:00) Kev: That's a cutesy idea, but going all in like this, I'm also baffled.
(1:01:05) Al: It is in the US as well, it is 55.
(1:01:10) Kev: I'm kind of charmed by this, uh, this concept though, the, the 16 bit, forget the remake conversation.
(1:01:14) Al: But also bear in mind, bear in mind that this game costs 15 euros digitally, like that is
(1:01:16) Kev: Let's talk about Demakes, which--
(1:01:25) Al: quite a markup to get a dummy cartridge and a case, and a case with a key, like that is
(1:01:28) Kev: the empty well
(1:01:32) Kev: they're playing their learn
(1:01:32) Al: a lot of money.
(1:01:34) Kev: taking the play from the magic the gathering play book
(1:01:35) Al: Yeah, fascinating.
(1:01:39) Kev: uh...
(1:01:41) Al: I think I might need to buy this game and play it.
(1:01:41) Kev: I like
(1:01:43) Kev: that i'm tempted to
(1:01:45) Kev: uh... it's very like that sixteen-bit look it's it's it's speaks to me it's
(1:01:50) Kev: feels very runescape the almost
(1:01:52) Al: It doesn't look like it's on Steam.
(1:01:53) Al: It looks like you can only buy it on their website and then install it.
(1:01:59) Kev: No, which is extra weird when they're marketing with the Genesis, but you're super right.
(1:02:00) Al: I have a sneaking suspicion this is not going to have a controller support.
(1:02:10) Al: Yes. I need to find out, don't I? I need to buy this and find out. If this podcast exists
(1:02:16) Kev: There's so many questions.
(1:02:20) Al: for anything, it is to buy this game and see what it's
(1:02:24) Kev: there's only one left in stock go go go al on the amazon page
(1:02:28) Al: I'm not buying the physical version. Just to be completely clear, I'm talking about buying the
(1:02:35) Al: digital version. All right, the final new game to talk about is Roamstead, which is a fun pun,
(1:02:36) Kev: can't do things halfway dal gotta go all in
(1:02:48) Kev: Okay, first, well, yeah, let's say A+ name, incredible, good for them.
(1:02:50) Al: fantastic name. We complain about names all the time on this podcast, so we have to be clear when
(1:02:58) Al: a fantastic game. Roam, Roamstead, fantastic, lovely, it's so good on so many levels.
(1:03:00) Kev: - Yeah.
(1:03:02) Kev: Tear to my eye.
(1:03:08) Al: I agree. The blurb for this one is Roam has fallen, rebuild civilization in this action adventure
(1:03:15) Al: survival game for one to eight players, fight, build towns, and earn favor with the Roman gods,
(1:03:21) Al: or just farm your crops. Yeah, thoughts on this.
(1:03:23) Kev: Oh, okay, so okay on paper just the the the pitch a lot. I think it's a cool idea
(1:03:33) Kev: Like
(1:03:35) Kev: Yeah, I think so it's in the category of stardew likes right? I think of a
(1:03:42) Kev: Grave graveyard keeper, whatever that game was called. It looks very similar to that one
(1:03:46) Kev: But the Roman twist I think that could be a lot of fun, right?
(1:03:50) Kev: Because that's an aesthetic that's, you know, based off history.
(1:03:53) Kev: I think it's a cool idea.
(1:03:59) Kev: But when I watched the trailer, there's a few things like that puzzle.
(1:04:04) Kev: I don't know if puzzle me.
(1:04:04) Kev: I just, I guess I don't expect them.
(1:04:07) Kev: First of all, there's a shocking amount of blood, which is generally
(1:04:11) Kev: zero in these games, but there is blood.
(1:04:12) Al: Rome, Rome had a lot of death.
(1:04:14) Kev: Rome, there was a lot of death, I guess.
(1:04:19) Kev: There's zombies.
(1:04:20) Kev: I don't, I don't remember hearing too much about that in the Roman history.
(1:04:23) Kev: But there's waves of zombies that you fight against.
(1:04:27) Kev: You fight wolves and bears and other animals and okay.
(1:04:31) Kev: And I guess the, the, the thing I'm not seeing that I I'm a little surprised,
(1:04:37) Kev: especially with your pitch or with their pitch, excuse me.
(1:04:42) Kev: I, I don't see any interaction with any Roman deities or text box or anything
(1:04:48) Kev: like that with them, so I don't know how that's incorporated, but you know,
(1:04:53) Kev: I'm thinking of course, Hades, right?
(1:04:55) Kev: Hang out with all the, the deities.
(1:04:57) Kev: Where's the, where's the text box?
(1:04:59) Kev: Hang out with Dionysus or whatever, you know, it doesn't, okay.
(1:05:03) Al: You want Hades level stuff, don't you?
(1:05:06) Kev: It doesn't have to be Hades level.
(1:05:07) Kev: That's unfair.
(1:05:09) Kev: But at the harvest moon has the farming goddess sprites, whatever.
(1:05:14) Kev: Where's that at?
(1:05:15) Kev: Where's that in this?
(1:05:16) Kev: We already got zombies, so we're not trying to stay historical.
(1:05:20) Kev: But I mean, overall, it's I think it's cool.
(1:05:23) Al: I'm not I'm not really sure anyone would suggest that Hades is historical either, to be fair.
(1:05:23) Kev: That's a cool idea.
(1:05:33) Al: Yeah, I am intrigued.
(1:05:36) Al: The graphics is kind of giving Dragon Quest remake, Final Fantasy, is that fair?
(1:05:46) Kev: Sure, sure, the pixel one's not the 3D one, so yeah, I just gotta be clear, yeah, I see
(1:05:50) Al: Yeah, yeah, obviously. Yeah, I'm talking. Yeah, I'm talking about the the pig.
(1:05:52) Al: Yeah. Because, like, you could just go be lazy and say this looks like Stardew,
(1:05:55) Kev: what you're saying, I see, I get the vibes.
(1:06:01) Al: but it doesn't, right? Like, just because it picks a lot doesn't mean it looks like Stardew.
(1:06:04) Kev: Yeah, sure it's it is different enough from Stardew like visually whenever it's it's not the same aesthetic
(1:06:14) Al: Some of this is weird like the what are they called the wagons that they're pulling around
(1:06:20) Kev: Yeah
(1:06:21) Al: are really weird graphics wise they almost look like fully modelled 3D objects like it's
(1:06:29) Al: really weird they're so much higher quality than everything else and I don't like it.
(1:06:30) Kev: Have you seen
(1:06:34) Kev: Have you seen smiling friends yet Al
(1:06:37) Al: No it's on my list to watch at some point.
(1:06:38) Kev: No, I can't make the gwimbly references darn it but
(1:06:43) Kev: But yeah, I agree it is
(1:06:46) Kev: it's one of those things where they have so many like
(1:06:50) Kev: Assets like I think there's probably different people working on different ones and you can kind of tell it points
(1:06:56) Kev: The trees are quite nice
(1:06:58) Kev: Sometimes a little too nice compared to the ground tiles
(1:07:02) Al: Yeah, yeah.
(1:07:04) Al: It's weird 'cause they're just like,
(1:07:05) Al: they're turning in a way that I wouldn't expect
(1:07:07) Al: in a pixel art game.
(1:07:10) Kev: Yeah, I I am I
(1:07:15) Kev: Guess the biggest question is like are they integrating the Rome right? Like that's kind of what I was getting at with the DNA
(1:07:21) Kev: Because you could label this look if you didn't give me the name Rome stead and just play this video without any text or whatever
(1:07:29) Kev: It just looked like generic
(1:07:31) Kev: Village builder farm game. I mean it looks nice or whatever
(1:07:35) Kev: But the point is it doesn't the the Roman identity isn't being screamed out at me
(1:07:38) Al: I'm guessing the god-related stuff is around powers and stuff. I don't think you will actually see them.
(1:07:46) Kev: yeah that's my guess too but like it's weird because when you think of rome you think of the
(1:07:53) Kev: you know the the the high-end roman stuff right the the coliseum and the you know all all that
(1:08:00) Al: Yeah, well, so the point is, the point is, Rome has fallen, right? It literally starts with that
(1:08:01) Kev: stuff right the architecture um ah that's a good point that's a good point
(1:08:04) Al: Rome has fallen. You are not in Rome. You are, you are somewhere in the Roman Empire
(1:08:12) Al: rebuilding after Rome has fallen. I've just found a little bit where it says, "Choose your gods.
(1:08:14) Kev: That's a good point.
(1:08:18) Al: After the fall of Rome, the gods lost most of their worshippers and in turn their powers.
(1:08:24) Al: Perform offerings and sacrifices and then choose with your friends who to restore to glory.
(1:08:29) Al: each god has their own
(1:08:30) Al: set of buffs and technology to unlock in the process.
(1:08:33) Al: It's a skill tree.
(1:08:34) Kev: Okay, yeah
(1:08:35) Al: That's what it is, right?
(1:08:38) Kev: All right, well, I know it's it doesn't look all it doesn't bad just I didn't I don't know
(1:08:44) Kev: May it you know, I maybe this trailer just isn't doing it justice. That's what I'm leaning towards
(1:08:50) Kev: Like there's a lot here that intrigues me
(1:08:52) Al: The boss battles look interesting to me, I would say at this point I'm intrigued, but not necessarily willing to lay down money and hours into this as of yet, but I am willing to listen.
(1:08:55) Kev: They do
(1:08:59) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's pretty fair
(1:09:05) Kev: Yeah
(1:09:10) Kev: Yeah, it's not even like it's available there's you can request access to their beta playtest whatever but doing that somehow
(1:09:16) Kev: And hey swinging for multiplayer off the bat. Good. Cool. Good for them. That's a good good goal to aim for
(1:09:23) Al: I mean look, as with lots of things, if you build it in from the start it's so much easier.
(1:09:28) Kev: Yeah, exactly
(1:09:28) Al: Trying to retroactively add it is where most people go wrong.
(1:09:31) Kev: That's correct
(1:09:33) Al: It adds a little bit more work up front than you would otherwise have,
(1:09:35) Kev: Mm-hmm
(1:09:37) Al: but because you're then thinking about it with every decision you make,
(1:09:40) Kev: Yeah
(1:09:40) Al: you can't make a decision that makes it impossible to add multiplayer, which some games do.
(1:09:44) Kev: Yeah, or and it's balanced around here I you're designing some people could learn from that concerned a
(1:09:50) Al: I mean, look, I will never, yeah, I would never, I would never fault him for the multiplayer
(1:09:53) Kev: What are you gonna get good concern day such a massive success such a sucky developer
(1:10:01) Al: thing. I don't think most games should consider multiplayer upfront, but I think that if it's
(1:10:02) Kev: Yeah
(1:10:05) Kev: Oh, yeah
(1:10:07) Al: something you want to do, you should be thinking about it the entire time. And I suspect, and
(1:10:09) Kev: Yeah, I agree
(1:10:11) Al: I suspect the conservative didn't put a single thought into multiplayer until he launched
(1:10:14) Kev: Not not a thought
(1:10:15) Al: and it became successful and people said "I want multiplayer" and he went "uh oh".
(1:10:19) Kev: Yeah, it is these the exact events verbatim
(1:10:20) Al: Right?
(1:10:25) Al: Because like, farming games didn't have multiplayer until then, right?
(1:10:28) Kev: No, I'm pretty sure I was the first yeah, I can't
(1:10:31) Al: It's just not a thing that anybody would have considered until people did
(1:10:34) Al: consider it and then suddenly it becomes "everybody wants it" and everything.
(1:10:35) Kev: You know
(1:10:37) Kev: it that's it's such a weird concept to kind of right because like
(1:10:43) Kev: You know, that's part of the appeal that your farm like you it's your farm
(1:10:47) Kev: You're managing it building however you want right and now you got to share with people. What's wrong with you people?
(1:10:51) Al: makes a lot more sense when you're building a whole village rather than just one farm, certainly.
(1:10:55) Kev: Yeah
(1:10:57) Kev: Yeah, that's true
(1:11:00) Kev: But yeah, yeah, I mean yeah, I agree intrigued for sure keeping our eyes
(1:11:05) Kev: You know the next trailer maybe they can
(1:11:09) Al: We will see where we go with that.
(1:11:12) Al: All right, so I want to talk about remakes because in the last couple of years there have been quite a few remakes.
(1:11:18) Kev: okay farming game remakes other than story of seasons have we gotten any okay
(1:11:24) Al: Harvest season as well.
(1:11:26) Kev: sure oh that's right you didn't harvest moon yes that is around the corner or
(1:11:26) Al: Not harvest season, harvest moon as well.
(1:11:30) Al: And shut up.
(1:11:36) Kev: are we already there
(1:11:39) Al: No, and look, I think it's fair to say that, sure, no one else is remaking games,
(1:11:45) Al: but no one else has games to remake, right?
(1:11:48) Al: Like the farming game world is not big enough for long enough, right?
(1:11:53) Al: Like if we look.
(1:11:54) Kev: Yeah, it's- it's new. It's still too new.
(1:11:54) Al: Before 2000, there was only Harvest Moon.
(1:12:01) Kev: I did it before 2010!
(1:12:02) Al: There was.
(1:12:04) Al: Well, no, no, no, because Animal Crossing, I'm including Animal Crossing.
(1:12:08) Al: I do think it's interesting that we haven't had an Animal Crossing remake.
(1:12:08) Kev: Oh, fine, honey, cool.
(1:12:10) Al: And I wouldn't be surprised if we're going to get one the next year or two.
(1:12:15) Kev: Oh, do you think we're gonna get it on the GameCube expansion pass thing?
(1:12:20) Al: I don't think so. I think they would rather go with a
(1:12:24) Al: remake in the New Horizons engine and sell that rather than put it in.
(1:12:29) Kev: Mmm, yeah, that would be a Nintendo move.
(1:12:31) Kev: So anyways, sorry, go ahead, I just thought of that a bit.
(1:12:34) Al: But yeah, so 2001 we get Animal Crossing. Up to that point, it has only been Harvest Moon.
(1:12:39) Al: And then we get Rune Factory, which is kind of the same thing,
(1:12:43) Al: just it's Harvest Moon, but also Swords. And then 2008 we get Farming Simulator. Do we count
(1:12:50) Kev: Okay. No, that's a demake. That's what that is. I don't know. You know what? I'll tell you what every. Yeah, that's what I assumed. Yeah, I'll tell you. Every farming simulator release is a remake of the previous.
(1:12:52) Al: the new Farming Simulator 16-bit as a remake.
(1:12:54) Al: It's something.
(1:12:57) Al: Well, what was the original Farming Simulator?
(1:13:04) Al: OK, the original farming simulator was 3D, OK, fair enough.
(1:13:10) Al: I was just checking, I was just checking, you never know.
(1:13:21) Al: So, yeah, sure, we've only had Harvest Moon and Surya Seasons remakes,
(1:13:24) Al: but we've had quite a lot of them, right?
(1:13:27) Al: Like this year, we're getting three.
(1:13:30) Kev: That is a wild number
(1:13:30) Al: We've got two Harvest Moon and one Surya Seasons.
(1:13:35) Al: Last year, I think, did we get only two or did we only get one last year?
(1:13:35) Kev: Yeah
(1:13:39) Kev: I I don't remember
(1:13:40) Al: I think we, oh, did we not even get Surya, what was it, Surya Seasons?
(1:13:45) Al: What was the one you like, what's it called?
(1:13:48) Kev: A wonderful life. Yeah. Yeah.
(1:13:50) Al: A Wonderful Life, that was 2003, apparently.
(1:13:52) Al: So, and then 2002, we had, no, 2001, we had, no, not 2001 either.
(1:14:05) Al: 2000? When was the one, the other one, this Friends of Mineral Town?
(1:14:09) Al: That was 2019. No, it was 2019.
(1:14:09) Kev: That's after you're going the wrong direction.
(1:14:13) Kev: Wait, what?
(1:14:13) Kev: Oh, oh, sorry.
(1:14:14) Kev: Sorry.
(1:14:15) Kev: I thought you meant the original.
(1:14:16) Kev: Okay.
(1:14:16) Kev: No, no, yes, you're right.
(1:14:17) Kev: Then, then yes, runs a mineral town.
(1:14:20) Al: was apparently 2019. So it's not a lot. We're not talking about hundreds of them,
(1:14:26) Al: but we are getting through this year. That feels like a lot, right?
(1:14:28) Kev: That is a big number for this space, absolutely, yes.
(1:14:32) Al: Considering that until 15 years ago, there was basically nobody else in the game.
(1:14:39) Kev: - Yep.
(1:14:40) Al: And I find that interesting, first of all, that this is starting to become a thing. There's
(1:14:45) Al: obviously some level of interest in that, enough to keep
(1:14:50) Al: it going. Two, I've lost my page of questions. So why? Yeah, so yeah, here's a question. Why is
(1:14:59) Al: that? And my first thought is people are getting into the games now when they hadn't before,
(1:15:06) Kev: Mm-hmm
(1:15:07) Al: and interested in the older games in theory, and so they see an area for more sales.
(1:15:11) Kev: Mm-hmm. Absolutely
(1:15:16) Kev: Absolutely, it's it's two things
(1:15:18) Kev: one
(1:15:20) Kev: remake for a big company like
(1:15:22) Kev: Whatever their name is. I forget their name the story seasons people right remakes are an easy safe play
(1:15:28) Kev: Because you you have the skeleton you build off it and you release and you make money, right? Well to
(1:15:35) Kev: to some degree
(1:15:36) Kev: it's always easier than a new game
(1:15:38) Kev: or, you know, less investment, less cost
(1:15:42) Kev: right
(1:15:44) Al: until people have their opinions on it and get annoyed.
(1:15:44) Kev: until that
(1:15:48) Kev: I don't say they'll make it
(1:15:50) Kev: it's less cost, I didn't say it'll make more
(1:15:52) Kev: but
(1:15:54) Kev: so, you know, from that standpoint
(1:15:58) Kev: it's obvious why you make a remake
(1:16:00) Kev: but the question is when is there interest for a remake
(1:16:02) Kev: well, like you said
(1:16:04) Kev: Like you said, now there's
(1:16:06) Kev: Interest and it's funny because we got it's really it's also it comes back to stardew of course right stardew came out kicked off
(1:16:12) Kev: This whole era of the cozy games and despite all you know every all these games we cover everything that comes out
(1:16:19) Kev: It's still pretty much all on the shoulders of story of seasons and and and the company right the big three story of seasons
(1:16:26) Kev: Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing if you want to conclude them, I guess
(1:16:31) Kev: So yeah, they're the of course. Yeah, they're gonna be the ones to remake because yes now there's some attention
(1:16:36) Kev: There that's it's a space now. There's a whole you know it's a sector of gaming now for sure and yeah, all right
(1:16:42) Kev: That's it makes sense to me. That's it's there's a time and in particular
(1:16:46) Kev: I'm you know though games that they have been picking wonderful life friends of mineral town those
(1:16:52) Kev: Had the added bonus of you know being the first out in this still may not the first out and that's not true at all
(1:16:58) Kev: but you know
(1:16:59) Kev: One of the popular ones out in the states right when it was still niche
(1:17:02) Kev: but had enough attention that people would pay attention when it comes out.
(1:17:06) Kev: It makes sense to me why we're seeing them.
(1:17:12) Kev: Okay, how so?
(1:17:14) Al: You know what I find interesting is the ones they've chosen to remake.
(1:17:19) Al: Like, well, we haven't had a remake of the original.
(1:17:20) Kev: That's true, that's a good point. That's a very good point.
(1:17:24) Kev: You know, oh, yup, the N64 one, you're right, that would be...
(1:17:25) Al: We haven't had we haven't had a make of the first 3D one.
(1:17:31) Al: We haven't had a remake of the first mobile one.
(1:17:36) Kev: The G.P.A.
(1:17:37) Al: We had a remake of Friends of Mineral Town, which was just a random one that came out in 2003.
(1:17:44) Al: And a wonderful life I kind of get, right, because it was big and it was GameCube.
(1:17:44) Kev: Yeah, I mean Friends of Mineral Time.
(1:17:50) Al: Like, was there anything else to buy on the GameCube?
(1:17:52) Kev: Friends of Mineral Time kind of was writing Wonderful Life's coattails.
(1:18:00) Kev: It was very much linked to that. Actually, you could link it.
(1:18:04) Al: He might be for A Wonderful Life. Yep. Same year, they both came out in 2003,
(1:18:04) Kev: was it?
(1:18:06) Kev: But it's still linked to Wonderful Life.
(1:18:10) Kev: Yeah.
(1:18:12) Kev: Wonderful Life wasn't first?
(1:18:12) Al: but Friends of Minirtown came out in April and A Wonderful Life came out.
(1:18:16) Kev: I'm crazy then. Ignore me. I don't know.
(1:18:18) Kev: That is wild.
(1:18:21) Al: It looks like they both came out in the same day in Europe.
(1:18:24) Kev: Oh, that's funny. That's all that's...
(1:18:26) Kev: Ooh, I like that actually. That's...
(1:18:28) Kev: That's dastardly.
(1:18:32) Al: You still got a gap.
(1:18:33) Al: They came out later in America than they did in Japan, but you still got the gap between
(1:18:37) Al: them.
(1:18:38) Al: But in Europe, you didn't get any gap between them.
(1:18:41) Al: OK, so that's your theory then.
(1:18:44) Al: It's related to the fact that the people like a wonderful life.
(1:18:48) Al: Yeah.
(1:18:49) Al: I just think it's interesting.
(1:18:51) Al: We haven't had an original remake.
(1:18:53) Al: Why have we not had a remake of 64?
(1:18:55) Al: Like those feel like theoretically the most nostalgia worthy ones, right?
(1:19:01) Al: Like play the original farming.
(1:19:03) Kev: Yeah, you're well, you know what this is raises
(1:19:07) Kev: I think an interesting question when in the general idea of remakes do you remake the ones?
(1:19:15) Kev: That have the love or the ones that need the love
(1:19:18) Al: Well, yeah, so this is because this is one of the Yahtzee Croshaw, one of he's the guy
(1:19:27) Al: who does it did zero punctuation and does what is called something different now because
(1:19:33) Al: complicated things around companies. He says you should remake bad games, not good games
(1:19:40) Al: and make them good games. And I understand that. But that's not what makes money. Right.
(1:19:46) Kev: Exactly.
(1:19:49) Al: If you remake something that people like, because then you get the money and in our
(1:19:56) Al: non-capitalist world, absolutely, I agree with that. I think I think we should remake
(1:20:02) Al: bad games, not good games. You could argue that Pokemon has been remaking bad games the
(1:20:06) Al: whole time. Look, I love the original Pokemon games, but they were bad games, terrible games.
(1:20:06) Kev: Hahahahaha!
(1:20:12) Kev: Oh yeah.
(1:20:15) Kev: Oh, go, go play and...
(1:20:16) Al: When a game nearly bankrupts a company, you know it's bad.
(1:20:18) Kev: Go play and change the box. See how much fun you have with that. Hahahaha!
(1:20:18) Al: Uh. Oh, I can't I can't every so often I I'm like, oh, let me go play the original games. I love them so much. And I'm like, no, I don't. I hate them. They're terrible. Why would I anybody play these ever? It's horrific.
(1:20:33) Kev: so
(1:20:35) Kev: Every now like I've had it pretty much since it came out, but I have been working on my yellow playthrough
(1:20:40) Kev: I'm grinding for the leap for
(1:20:42) Al: Like, when you've got to the Elite Four, you've passed all the bad parts of the gameplay,
(1:20:42) Kev: It's a you know it's a thing that'll just pop. I got I don't know I'm gonna fire it up, but
(1:20:51) Al: right?
(1:20:52) Al: You're just, because like the, if you've got powered up Pokémon, the battles are the good
(1:20:57) Al: bit.
(1:20:58) Kev: Well, here's the thing though, right?
(1:20:59) Al: Oh no.
(1:21:00) Kev: It depends, 'cause I made a mistake in this playthrough.
(1:21:04) Kev: 'Cause I said, okay, I'm older, I'm wiser.
(1:21:06) Kev: I know that it's better to have a few different Pokemon.
(1:21:10) Kev: Here's the whatever, Jim.
(1:21:12) Kev: I'll bring this Pokemon for that.
(1:21:13) Al: Oh, no
(1:21:14) Kev: Well, when you do that,
(1:21:15) Kev: that's a mistake in the original games
(1:21:16) Al: Yeah, mm-hmm
(1:21:17) Kev: because eventually you're gonna hit the brick wall
(1:21:22) Kev: as the Elite Four and now you gotta grind.
(1:21:24) Al: Yeah, absolutely. In those games, the absolutely best way to do it is choose Bulbasaur and
(1:21:24) Kev: 'Cause your Pokemon are too underleveled.
(1:21:32) Al: only use Bulbasaur, and never use any other Pokémon, and you overlevel so fast.
(1:21:34) Kev: yep that is and that's all you need yeah
(1:21:40) Al: And even if you choose Charmander, the hard one to start with, yeah, it's only hard for two
(1:21:47) Kev: three gyms whatever oh yeah no it is two yeah yeah yeah yeah you're right you're right
(1:21:47) Al: gyms. Not even three gyms, because the third one's electric, right? Like, it's not... Once you're past
(1:21:54) Al: the first two gyms, you are overleveled and you're fine. Especially as you probably had to grind a
(1:21:57) Kev: yeah yeah yeah
(1:22:01) Al: little bit to get those first two gyms done, right? So yeah, yes, that is a very good point.
(1:22:10) Al: I think also people generally don't want you to remake bad games, because they don't care about
(1:22:16) Al: about those games, they don't really care about playing new stuff.
(1:22:19) Kev: Yeah, that, ah, see, you know, going back to the context here, farming games,
(1:22:26) Kev: like original horror smooth, that's, that's the one that I, that we got to
(1:22:32) Kev: think about, right?
(1:22:33) Kev: Cause that would be the one to make sense.
(1:22:36) Kev: But that's also the one a lot of people don't care about because they didn't
(1:22:39) Kev: play it because it was back in, or at least, you know, out West or whatever.
(1:22:43) Kev: It wasn't popular on a global stage.
(1:22:45) Kev: It wasn't as popular as the other ones.
(1:22:47) Kev: Right.
(1:22:48) Al: Yeah, yeah. But you're right. It's dreadful. Did you go back and play it? Because they've
(1:22:53) Al: got it on Nintendo Switch Online. Did you play it at all? I couldn't remember whether
(1:22:55) Kev: Yeah, we did the episode. Remember?
(1:22:58) Al: you'd done it or not, but yes, absolutely. It's horrific. It's worse than Pokemon in
(1:22:58) Kev: Yeah, we did an episode on it.
(1:23:00) Kev: It's it's it's bad.
(1:23:03) Kev: Two item inventory, baby.
(1:23:04) Al: its quality of life. Yeah, exactly. It's absolutely dreadful. It is. I don't know how they managed
(1:23:12) Al: to make a second game. How did they sell enough to make a second game? I don't. It was like
(1:23:14) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(1:23:16) Al: Like when I watched, so I've been watching through the James
(1:23:18) Al: Bond films in order, and it's like, after the first one, I'm like, how did anybody
(1:23:23) Al: enjoy this enough that they got greenlit for a second film? I do not understand. It was terrible.
(1:23:30) Kev: You could get hitched in Harvest Moon.
(1:23:32) Kev: That's the entire franchise leaned on that.
(1:23:37) Al: So here's, right, okay, so that aside, I have been thinking about this because I'm gonna
(1:23:42) Al: preface this question, a few questions and a few points that I want to bring up before you
(1:23:48) Al: counteract what I'm saying. And I'm gonna start off by saying, I don't think we need farming game
(1:23:54) Al: remakes. And this is coming from someone who has pre-ordered Grand Bazaar and will be playing it.
(1:24:05) Al: But I think the weird thing about farming games in particular is they are very much tied into their
(1:24:14) Al: characters, especially now, they're very much tied into their characters.
(1:24:18) Al: Um, probably not for the first Harvest Moon, but certainly even by the time you get to
(1:24:23) Al: Friends of Mineral Town and A Wonderful Life, they are very much tied into their characters
(1:24:27) Al: and the stories and your relationships with them.
(1:24:30) Al: And everything else is quality of life.
(1:24:36) Al: Everything else in a farming game is about, is generally improved over time, right?
(1:24:42) Al: And so the, I think the first, that's why they think about remaking farming games, because
(1:24:46) Al: physical. Here's a game that we have.
(1:24:48) Al: Okay, fine. But if the point is the characters and the stories, just taking that and putting
(1:25:07) Al: that into a new game doesn't make a good game. Because I think that if you've played the
(1:25:15) Al: the original, you're coming to this game.
(1:25:18) Al: Having already interacted with the characters and the stories, and that is everything that matters in this game.
(1:25:24) Kev: okay
(1:25:26) Kev: okay well let me ask you this
(1:25:29) Kev: would you play stardew valley 3d
(1:25:32) Kev: you know full 3d models
(1:25:34) Al: No. But I don't think that's it. No, I don't. I don't think... I don't... I...
(1:25:35) Kev: no you wouldn't you wouldn't
(1:25:41) Al: OK, so here, I guess it depends on what you mean by that. Do you mean in terms of, like,
(1:25:47) Al: you're still going to be in the same camera angle type thing? It's more like Cuddle Island,
(1:25:52) Kev: No, no, no, it doesn't have to be overview. I'm talking like full 3d you can rotate the camera full 360 degrees
(1:25:52) Al: right? So it's... or do you mean it's...
(1:25:56) Al: No. No, no. No, I don't want that.
(1:26:01) Kev: You don't want that
(1:26:02) Al: I mean, mainly because I don't like-
(1:26:04) Al: like that style of game for farming games.
(1:26:05) Kev: Okay, well, all right, I'm using
(1:26:06) Al: I just- I- I don't enjoy playing games like that, farming games.
(1:26:10) Kev: Okay, okay, I'm using that as an example, but okay, let's just say brilliant diamond shining pearl root
(1:26:16) Kev: Let's say, you know, it's still the overhead isometric kind of view
(1:26:20) Kev: But it's not three
(1:26:22) Kev: D different art style or legend of you know
(1:26:22) Al: Okay. Would I play it? Yes. Do I think it should exist? No. Those are two different things.
(1:26:30) Kev: Okay. Okay, fair enough.
(1:26:33) Al: I mean, obviously we are in a unique position where we are on a podcast about farming games.
(1:26:36) Kev: Well, okay, yeah, that's a good point.
(1:26:37) Al: So particularly I, sometimes you guys as well, there is an element of this, but particularly
(1:26:45) Al: me, I will play things that I would never in a million years play if I wasn't on a podcast,
(1:26:50) Kev: That's a very good counterpoint!
(1:26:52) Al: so there is that. But no, I don't think, what would that add, right? Because if I once,
(1:27:01) Al: I mean, Stardew is a particularly bad example to use because the game is only eight years old.
(1:27:05) Al: And let's ignore the fact that Harvest Moon are remaking games younger than that this year.
(1:27:12) Al: I know I'm not doing the debate on what is a remake, what is a port, we're not doing that.
(1:27:19) Kev: That's about to say but what about Stardew Valley remastered?
(1:27:22) Al: I don't know what that adds. If you're keeping the same characters and the same stories,
(1:27:31) Al: we just, I think just play the original, right? Because I think the thing is, if you remake a
(1:27:38) Al: farming game and it has all the same characters and all the same stories, but you update the
(1:27:43) Al: gameplay, it's not the same game as it was. And if you remake it with all its flaws,
(1:27:48) Al: There's no point in it existing, just go back and play it.
(1:27:52) Al: But if you don't remake it with all its flaws, I don't know what it's doing, it's a new game, but with all the stories and people you already know.
(1:28:02) Al: I think that if you're going to do that and you want, like, here's what I think they should do, set it in the same place, have different or have progressed characters and stories.
(1:28:15) Kev: Ah, so you want to go to the Final Fantasy route, and I'll talk about the Pixel remasters.
(1:28:18) Al: Absolutely. Let's know, absolutely.
(1:28:20) Kev: I'm talking about FF7 Remake, where it's called Remake, but secretly a sequel!
(1:28:22) Al: Absolutely. Let's go back.
(1:28:26) Al: Let's go back to Friends of-- Let's go back to Mineral Town,
(1:28:29) Al: but we're now our child, and our child is taking over our farm,
(1:28:33) Al: and now we are interacting with the characters that we interacted with as,
(1:28:38) Al: as, you know, new-- No, I know, and I'm saying we don't do remakes for farming games.
(1:28:38) Kev: It's not a remake though!
(1:28:44) Al: If you want to create that sense of nostalgia, you can do that with this aspect of things.
(1:28:50) Al: You're going back to the region, you're going back.
(1:28:52) Al: to the place, but it's both new characters and old characters, because you've got the old
(1:28:57) Al: characters who are now older and are different people now, because we don't stay the same as
(1:29:02) Al: we age. So they have new stories, they have new personalities, and you also have their children
(1:29:07) Al: who are completely new people as well. I think that that is the thing. I know, and I'm saying
(1:29:10) Kev: That's not a remake!
(1:29:13) Al: don't do remakes. Come on, Kevin. I think my point is you can I know, but I think my point
(1:29:16) Kev: I know, look, I get it, so you want sequels or remakes, and that's fine, that's fair.
(1:29:20) Kev: I get it.
(1:29:22) Al: is the reason to do a remake is for the nostalgia. You can get the nostalgia in a different way
(1:29:26) Kev: Well.
(1:29:29) Al: that actually gives you something. I'm saying I don't know what farming game remakes give you.
(1:29:30) Kev: I...
(1:29:32) Kev: I don't think...
(1:29:34) Kev: I'm okay.
(1:29:36) Kev: Okay, there's an other is an important factor here that I
(1:29:40) Kev: think remakes do offer in a lot of cases. And it's the fact
(1:29:44) Kev: that you can actually play the day because I don't I don't
(1:29:46) Al: Oh, you're just going into the game preservation discussion, oh goodness sake.
(1:29:52) Kev: have to doesn't have to be game like, I don't want to get too
(1:29:55) Kev: deep into that. But there is a genuine like, let's just, okay,
(1:30:00) Kev: let's use a wonderful life. Let's just use that example
(1:30:02) Kev: right there, right? And a number of other ones, right? It's a good
(1:30:06) Kev: game people enjoyed it right and you know there are there have been
(1:30:10) Kev: it's been what 20 years that's a whole generation of kids and people who grew
(1:30:15) Kev: up people don't have game cubes these days people who have game cubes will not
(1:30:20) Kev: pull out their game cube to play it releasing it for a new generation of
(1:30:25) Kev: people it was successful in the past it was popular there's a good chance people
(1:30:30) Kev: will like even new people haven't heard of it they will hear about it because
(1:30:34) Kev: people who've liked in the past are gonna get excited about it and yada yada
(1:30:38) Kev: And it comes out and there's a whole new
(1:30:40) Kev: Generation of people to enjoy and experience it. I think that's a that is to some degree a legitimate reason to
(1:30:47) Kev: Develop a remake right even if it's just from a very practical money-hungry like there's a whole new market. We can capture that
(1:30:52) Al: So I don't think there is a new market, so that's my first point, right?
(1:30:54) Kev: but
(1:30:57) Kev: Well, yeah that well that that's what it's about to say right like that's that's the challenge here though right post stardew farming game
(1:31:05) Kev: world
(1:31:07) Kev: It's it's two things. First of all, it's two new we have not had
(1:31:10) Kev: 20 years to have a whole generation of people. And
(1:31:13) Kev: second of all, every like every single game we talk about here,
(1:31:18) Kev: virtually every game, I'm gonna call it the ones that aren't
(1:31:20) Kev: statistical outliers. They're all on Steam. Steam is eternal
(1:31:25) Kev: and ever present. In 2030 years, you know, assuming that Steam is
(1:31:29) Kev: alive and we are too, you will be able to go on Steam and play
(1:31:34) Kev: Stardew Valley like that's Yeah, you
(1:31:38) Al: Yeah, that's a fair point. But what I will say is, I don't think there is, I don't think in general, I think there are outliers, I don't think in general remakes add new people.
(1:31:52) Al: I think they pander to existing nostalgia. And I think my proof for this is Pokémon.
(1:31:55) Kev: Really? You think? Well, here's
(1:32:00) Al: Look at Pokémon sales. Do Pokémon remakes, do they sell? The answer is no.
(1:32:08) Kev: Yeah, you know what good point good counterpoint
(1:32:08) Al: No, they do not. And this is Pokémon. Pokémon is the outlier. Games do not sell like Pokémon.
(1:32:18) Al: There are a handful of games that have sold more copies than basically any of the original Pokémon games.
(1:32:26) Al: And by original, I mean like a new generation with new Pokémon, blah blah blah blah blah. Those are the ones that matter, those are the ones that normies buy.
(1:32:32) Al: Nothing else matters with Pokémon, except Pokémon Go, I guess, right?
(1:32:38) Al: The other Pokémon game sells basically nothing for Pokémon. Now, obviously, it is, if any, if an indie game developer sold as many as the lowest selling main series Pokémon game, they would be rich, right?
(1:32:50) Al: But we're talking in terms of Pokémon, right? They just do not sell. Every single remake has sold less than every single original Pokémon game. That's just how it works.
(1:33:04) Al: Um, so how many of
(1:33:08) Al: those people have, I think, excluding, let's exclude Pokemon, let's go Pikachu and Eevee.
(1:33:15) Al: I think those ones are different, and I'll explain why in a minute.
(1:33:20) Kev: I'm not sure. I mean it's all
(1:33:20) Al: But putting them aside for a minute, how many of those people that have bought those remakes
(1:33:26) Al: didn't play the original? I don't think it's zero, but I think it's statistically zero. I think it's
(1:33:36) Kev: I saw okay you you you raise a good point this make me question ally of what are the numbers for.
(1:33:44) Kev: The the remakes of the wonderful life of the sales numbers and i'm not looking at yours.
(1:33:48) Al: They I don't I don't think they I've tried to find harvest moon numbers.
(1:33:53) Al: They don't really seem to be doing much
(1:33:56) Al: Harvest Moon, our story of seasons,
(1:33:58) Kev: You know
(1:33:59) Al: sales numbers basically don't seem to exist.
(1:34:01) Kev: I'm it
(1:34:02) Al: There's there's a there's a sales wiki that has some numbers for some of the games,
(1:34:08) Al: but they stop at trio of towns.
(1:34:10) Kev: Yeah, they don't do the remakes.
(1:34:10) Al: They don't have anything later than that.
(1:34:12) Al: And I it's not even just they don't do the
(1:34:14) Al: it's just they haven't done anything since 2016.
(1:34:16) Kev: Oh, oh.
(1:34:18) Al: There have been many games since trio of towns, they haven't got any of them, it's not just the
(1:34:22) Al: remakes. So they just don't seem to talk about them. But I can't imagine it would be particularly
(1:34:23) Kev: Yeah, that's a good point.
(1:34:32) Al: different from how Pokemon works. Like I think if you with the consistency of Pokemon games,
(1:34:39) Al: it's not like, oh, you know, oh, this, this Pokemon game sold less than this Pokemon game,
(1:34:46) Al: but there's like...
(1:34:48) Al: The lowest selling games are all the remakes.
(1:34:52) Kev: That, yeah, that's correct.
(1:34:55) Al: There is one exception to this in the Pokémon Legends Arceus is sold less than Let's Go
(1:35:02) Al: Pikachu and Eevee and Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. So that is the one exception,
(1:35:06) Al: but the bottom one... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
(1:35:13) Al: The bottom 12 games, except Legends Arceus, are all of the remakes.
(1:35:18) Al: There's not a remake above that.
(1:35:20) Al: And then you have the third games and then you have the main games, right?
(1:35:26) Al: Like that is how it works.
(1:35:29) Al: And the consistency of that leads me to believe that that must be what other
(1:35:34) Al: games do as well, just on a smaller scale, right?
(1:35:38) Kev: Mmm. I'm I am curious. I
(1:35:39) Al: I just, I can't imagine it would be any other way.
(1:35:42) Kev: Yeah, you raise
(1:35:45) Kev: Yeah, you're probably right like I think about this and I'd love to look at numbers of other games and remakes and other stuff
(1:35:52) Al: I'd love to as well, yeah.
(1:35:52) Kev: every all the I never really thought about that, you know non because you're right we lived in the Pokemon we live in the
(1:35:57) Kev: Pokemon world you and I and we
(1:36:00) Kev: We know that as a fact, but I wonder if it holds true outside the Pokemon world
(1:36:04) Kev: Because Pokémon's kinda weird too, right? Because, uh, it's also been cons--
(1:36:08) Kev: Not many other series released a game almost annually for a good while, right?
(1:36:12) Kev: And, you know, that factors into stuff, but...
(1:36:14) Al: Fair. That that is that is totally fair.
(1:36:17) Kev: Yeah, but that--but, you know, we'd have to dig into numbers, and obviously we don't have time for that, but, um...
(1:36:22) Al: We don't have time for it and we don't know whether they exist.
(1:36:25) Kev: Do we--or that!
(1:36:28) Al: As far as I can see, they do have some sales on the charts in Japan specifically that they release.
(1:36:36) Al: So we could theoretically, if we had enough time, go through the Japan specific sales numbers.
(1:36:45) Al: But we definitely don't have time for that.
(1:36:46) Kev: But indeed, okay. All right. Well look all this back and forth, but at the end of the day like it's not the right place
(1:36:53) Kev: or time
(1:36:54) Kev: Farming games aside from the big three which they are remaking at least harvest moon story seasons are
(1:37:00) Kev: You know all these other farming games we talk about on the show everything post stardew
(1:37:05) Kev: It's it's too new like it's it's I don't think remakes are a question for anyone or like is anyone considering?
(1:37:13) Kev: You're thinking about them
(1:37:14) Kev: Like I think we can agree on that
(1:37:16) Kev: It's just too new, right?
(1:37:18) Kev: Let's have this conversation in another 10 years.
(1:37:20) Kev: Maybe then we can...
(1:37:22) Kev: I don't know.
(1:37:23) Kev: Maybe then we'll think different.
(1:37:25) Kev: Will you be craving Glen's Island Remake in 20 years?
(1:37:29) Kev: Well, you're barely craving it now!
(1:37:30) Al: Well, I was going to say the exact same thing.
(1:37:34) Al: I have one other point, because I think there's one other point that you said that I didn't
(1:37:39) Al: respond to, and that is that let's assume that there is a market for people wanting
(1:37:46) Al: to play older games who can't.
(1:37:49) Al: We have a solution to that, which is so much easier than a remake, and that's ports.
(1:37:54) Kev: Yeah, I I know.
(1:37:55) Al: We have Nintendo Switch online, they did that with the original Harvest Moon.
(1:38:00) Kev: That's yeah, that you.
(1:38:00) Al: We have GameCube now, we can add a wonderful life to it.
(1:38:05) Kev: That's a good point.
(1:38:05) Kev: That's a good point.
(1:38:07) Kev: Um, I mean, yeah, that is a good point,
(1:38:11) Kev: but I don't know, still a remake.
(1:38:12) Al: So let's let's go back to let's go back to Pokemon, right?
(1:38:14) Kev: Well, here's the thing.
(1:38:15) Kev: OK, I think.
(1:38:15) Al: What do you think is what do you think is is better for to exist?
(1:38:19) Al: The original Pokemon games on 3DS, as in red and blue on 3DS, or
(1:38:27) Al: the remakes that is FireRed and LeafGreen on Game Boy Advance.
(1:38:30) Kev: Oh, fire, red, leaf, green, for sure.
(1:38:33) Al: You think you think that's better, right?
(1:38:33) Kev: Um.
(1:38:35) Al: I know they're better games.
(1:38:36) Al: I'm not saying they're not better games, but which is better to exist?
(1:38:37) Kev: Oh, okay.
(1:38:38) Kev: Okay.
(1:38:38) Kev: Wait.
(1:38:38) Kev: Okay.
(1:38:39) Kev: No.
(1:38:41) Kev: Which is better too.
(1:38:41) Kev: Ooh.
(1:38:42) Kev: All right.
(1:38:43) Kev: So if I had to choose one to exist, right?
(1:38:45) Kev: You know, I want to erase one from the reality.
(1:38:48) Al: Yep. And don't and don't and do not lean on I can just hack my 3DS and play Gameboy games on it.
(1:38:49) Kev: Like, oh, that's a hard one.
(1:38:51) Kev: Oh, I had to think of it.
(1:38:57) Kev: Yeah, no, of course.
(1:38:57) Al: That doesn't let's we're not using we're not using get it clauses. If you delete one you
(1:38:58) Kev: Right.
(1:39:01) Kev: Yeah.
(1:39:01) Kev: I'm just saying like, yeah, yeah, of course.
(1:39:02) Al: cannot play the other one in any way shape or form.
(1:39:05) Kev: Yeah.
(1:39:05) Kev: The other one's being wiped from existence.
(1:39:07) Kev: I get you.
(1:39:07) Kev: Um, Oh, this is tough because, uh, see this is another element to the equation.
(1:39:16) Kev: Right.
(1:39:17) Kev: If you gave me a different choice, right?
(1:39:18) Kev: Like let's say diamond and Pearl, if you asked me, should diamond and Pearl
(1:39:23) Kev: be ported versus brilliant shine and diamond Pearl, that's an easy one.
(1:39:26) Kev: Just port the original.
(1:39:28) Kev: Who cares if that is shining Pearl, like you can wipe the.
(1:39:31) Kev: Oh, um, or you can go either way.
(1:39:33) Kev: It's not that hard because they're that close.
(1:39:35) Kev: Right.
(1:39:36) Kev: Fire and leave green versus original port, like being ported.
(1:39:40) Kev: That's a lot harder because I think there's a place for the originals.
(1:39:45) Kev: And I think it's goods being ported, but fire at leaf green is so much
(1:39:50) Kev: better has so much more, um, Oh, I don't know.
(1:39:58) Al: I mean, the good thing is you don't need to make a decision, right? But here's my thing, right? Like,
(1:39:58) Kev: Oh, I'm gonna.
(1:40:01) Kev: Yeah.
(1:40:03) Al: I think that you... I think a remake needs to do something. And actually with Pokémon,
(1:40:13) Al: I don't think... I think that the Pokémon remakes are all... I like that they all exist
(1:40:20) Kev: Think fire red fire red leaf cream. I think it well I think hgss I think
(1:40:26) Kev: No, I think some of the early Pokemon remakes
(1:40:29) Kev: I think most of the Pokemon remakes do a good I think those are good examples of remakes. I'm good
(1:40:32) Al: Well that's what I'm trying to say, I actually think they are the exception that proves the rule,
(1:40:38) Kev: Okay, okay
(1:40:40) Al: because I think that they do, every single one of them does something that the original did not.
(1:40:45) Kev: You know what this is a good point
(1:40:48) Al: So the Fire, Red and Leaf game made the original games playable.
(1:40:50) Kev: Mm-hmm
(1:40:53) Kev: First of all a lot more, but that was the big one
(1:40:57) Al: Hargrodon, so silver, played around with a lot of ideas on the DS that other games didn't.
(1:41:03) Al: And also I think, yeah you can argue about how good the games are in general, but yeah definitely I agree with that.
(1:41:04) Kev: Dell the best UI.
(1:41:13) Al: Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire fundamentally changed what people thought Pokemon could be, I think.
(1:41:16) Kev: It's a lot.
(1:41:30) Al: XY were good, but also fundamentally were the same as the 2D games. They just had 3D models.
(1:41:40) Al: Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire added in Soaring, which it was just so fundamentally different
(1:41:48) Al: to anything that had ever existed in a main series Pokémon game.
(1:41:51) Kev: Mean yeah, well, I think you're under selling xy little but okay, but yeah the point is okay back to the main idea
(1:41:57) Al: I like X and Y, but fundamentally calling them a 3D game is only true because it uses
(1:41:58) Kev: Or s added a lot a lot a lot more than the rich
(1:42:09) Al: models rather than sprites.
(1:42:10) Kev: Yes, that was a big jump for the game
(1:42:11) Al: It is, I agree, but I think the thing is that when you think 3D game, you think, "I can
(1:42:18) Al: move the camera."
(1:42:20) Kev: Well, you couldn't in ORAS! I'm not going to count Soaring, because Soaring is such a small, in my opinion, a small part of the game.
(1:42:25) Al: It was huge!
(1:42:27) Al: I thought, yes, it was a small part of the game, but it was the first time you could do something.
(1:42:29) Kev: Soaring...
(1:42:31) Kev: Soaring was just a very pretty quick travel! That's all it is! It's not like it's a main part of the game.
(1:42:36) Al: No, I disagree. It was not a quick travel. It was a medium travel.
(1:42:44) Kev: I'm happy!
(1:42:48) Al: When I first did soaring, something fundamentally changed in my brain.
(1:42:53) Al: And I went, "This is the future of Pokémon."
(1:42:56) Kev: Yeah, I don't know, I didn't feel it.
(1:42:57) Al: I don't think anything else in Pokémon up to that point was as fundamental a change as that was.
(1:43:04) Kev: I- I don't feel it.
(1:43:04) Al: I don't think saying, "Oh, we used 3D models."
(1:43:06) Kev: It's so fundamental they didn't use it for another decade.
(1:43:12) Al: It took them a while to get a working version. That's different from "This needs to happen."
(1:43:19) Al: I cannot imagine how I would have thought about things if that didn't exist.
(1:43:25) Al: but like, whereas X and Y go...
(1:43:27) Al: Oh yeah, we're using 3D models rather than sprites.
(1:43:30) Al: Yes, it was a big deal, but it didn't change anything other than how it looked.
(1:43:34) Al: It didn't change gameplay.
(1:43:36) Kev: I don't know maybe I just don't feel as strongly because they didn't follow up on it for a
(1:43:36) Al: It didn't change what you thought about these things.
(1:43:40) Al: They did. It just took them a while.
(1:43:43) Kev: decade plus.
(1:43:44) Al: It was not a decade plus, come on.
(1:43:48) Kev: What was our as 2014 I would call that I would say it wasn't followed up till Arceus.
(1:43:53) Kev: So there you go.
(1:43:54) Kev: How long was that?
(1:43:55) Kev: Okay.
(1:43:56) Kev: It was less than a decade.
(1:43:57) Kev: It was 2022.
(1:43:58) Kev: I think.
(1:43:59) Kev: Yeah, whatever.
(1:44:00) Al: 22 22 yeah I don't I I I also I'm not do I agree with you that they didn't follow up
(1:44:00) Kev: Eight years.
(1:44:01) Kev: Yeah.
(1:44:12) Kev: I can't think of anything that makes you say,
(1:44:13) Kev: oh, here's the, you know,
(1:44:15) Kev: there's soaring or, you know, the natural progression.
(1:44:18) Al: I feel like it's not the same thing, but I feel like the wild area in Sword and Shield,
(1:44:26) Kev: an open area turning the camera like open area turn the camera fine
(1:44:26) Al: not in terms of travel, but in terms of... and yeah, exactly, exactly, this is...
(1:44:36) Al: Swordring was the first open world in Pokémon games. You weren't limited by anything. You could
(1:44:43) Al: fly over the entire world in Swordring and yeah, they didn't do it again on the 3D.
(1:44:48) Al: Yes, but it's only a few years later that Sword and Shield came out.
(1:44:52) Kev: I get I mmm not that
(1:44:55) Al: We're talking five years.
(1:44:57) Kev: 2018 I guess so. Yeah, okay. Maybe I can see you'd argue for it, but um I
(1:45:04) Al: I don't know how this turned into a Pokemon conversation, uh, yeah, I think Pokemon and
(1:45:06) Kev: Well, it's it's remake talk they are no they are king of that hill the compared it's gonna compare
(1:45:13) Al: Final Fantasy are probably the two biggest ones in terms of remakes, right?
(1:45:17) Kev: Yes of defining what remakes can do like you're going back to the point
(1:45:22) Kev: You were trying to make originally like a remake. I will I think agree a remake
(1:45:28) Kev: That adds and changes kind of the fundamental thing not even like a sequel doesn't have to be a sequel cuz like
(1:45:34) Kev: The or as the Pokemon remakes they weren't sequels. They were remakes
(1:45:39) Kev: And they still added and showed what a remake could do
(1:45:42) Al: Yeah. I'm not saying that all remakes should be sequels. I'm saying that farming games shouldn't
(1:45:48) Al: have remakes. They should do sequels instead, because sequels do the same thing for nostalgia,
(1:45:55) Al: but in a better way for farming games specifically. That is, I think that's the conclusion that I have
(1:46:03) Al: come to, and that is what I'm putting out into the world. And I know not everyone's going to agree.
(1:46:08) Al: I know you loved playing A Wonderful Life, the remake, but would you not?
(1:46:11) Kev: Oh boy did I, heh heh heh.
(1:46:12) Kev: Yeah.
(1:46:13) Kev: Yeah.
(1:46:13) Al: If you also had new characters and the characters you'd known.
(1:46:14) Kev: Oh boy did I.
(1:46:15) Kev: Heh heh heh.
(1:46:16) Kev: Yeah.
(1:46:17) Al: I mean, I guess it's different for that game, right? Because that game's whole hook would grow old.
(1:46:17) Kev: Yeah.
(1:46:18) Kev: Yeah.
(1:46:21) Al: But, like, if there were other characters and the characters you'd known in that game started off as old,
(1:46:28) Al: do you not think that might have been more fun?
(1:46:30) Kev: I mean, I don't I don't know about that. Like there's different things they could have done
(1:46:35) Kev: They could have reworked how farming worked in that game for instance, right like the main
(1:46:41) Al: Well that's a whole other discussion right that was my point about like do you have to do you
(1:46:42) Kev: activity
(1:46:45) Al: bring the flaws or do you do like it's a whole complicated discussion and I think if you're doing
(1:46:47) Kev: Yeah, it is
(1:46:50) Al: remakes then you have to have that discussion and if you're doing a sequel then you obviously go
(1:46:54) Al: with the new stuff and I think that the new stuff is better but the problem is that I don't think
(1:46:58) Al: you can fully encapsulate what a game was without its flaws. I don't think the I don't I think there
(1:47:02) Kev: uh well well look at pokémon that I i
(1:47:08) Al: it is. I don't I don't if you play fire red and leaf key.
(1:47:11) Al: Green. I don't think you truly understand the original games
(1:47:14) Kev: I I just okay fire and leaf green that jump may have been too wide, but
(1:47:21) Kev: What about hard gold or or s like I think I see if you play those
(1:47:27) Kev: I think you still get the original experience more or less like obviously it's different, but you still get the fundamental bare bones
(1:47:30) Al: No, no. No, I don't think so.
(1:47:33) Kev: Like the skeleton is in there in my opinion
(1:47:36) Al: You get, you get, there are skeletons in there and you get hints of it, you get hints of what it was like, but I don't think you truly understand it.
(1:47:44) Kev: Mmm. Ah.
(1:47:46) Al: And I also, but I would also, and this is probably going to be my last point, because we need to wrap up, because Kevin's, Kevin's disappearing, but I also don't think you fully
(1:47:57) Al: Understand the game if you come back come to it.
(1:48:00) Al: But having played previous later games before the first one, I don't think I think a huge amount of my opinion on the older Zelda games, especially the 3D ones, 2D ones is a bit different because they're so fundamentally different to the 3D ones.
(1:48:04) Kev: Sure, sure
(1:48:18) Al: And I think my opinion on the 3D Zelda games is hugely affected by the fact that my first one was better.
(1:48:24) Kev: Oh yeah, absolutely, like it's hard to go back, that's, I mean yeah, for most, not even games, like even movies and other media, like chronological is almost always the way to go of really, like really schedule if you want to go through something.
(1:48:40) Al: Oh yeah, I 100%, especially with films, I agree with that. I hate when people are like,
(1:48:44) Al: "Oh, you should watch that, like, in this order," and I'm like, "No, no, the first
(1:48:46) Al: time you watched through something, watch it in the order it was released. Why would
(1:48:50) Kev: Yeah, because that's. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I agree there and games, I think it's similar because I think it's a similar concept where movies, sequels and remakes, whatever, like they're built looking back, they're built on the bones of the, you know, on the backs of the other one. Games, it's a very similar thing.
(1:48:50) Al: you watch it any other way?" If you want to watch it a second time, sure, watch it whatever
(1:48:54) Al: weird order you want to. That's fine, right? But the first time you watched through things,
(1:48:59) Al: watch it in the order it was released absolutely.
(1:49:14) Al: But also but also don't play the old games just play new games
(1:49:20) Kev: No, no. You have to earn the right to love Pokemon. Go play the original. Suffer. Oh, I will. Show me, show me, I want you to, if you claim to be a Pokemon, if you are a Pokemon fan, if you claim to be one, I will ask you to raise your
(1:49:21) Al: If you weren't around for the original Pokemon games don't play them they're bad games
(1:49:29) Al: No
(1:49:31) Al: No, we're not gatekeeping and in terms of films in terms of films go watch the old ones unless it's James Bond
(1:49:38) Al: Do not go watch the old James Bond films. They're bad
(1:49:42) Al: That might be the thing that people hate the most about wise head
(1:49:44) Al: this episode. Oh, I don't think any child now would understand they would play those
(1:49:50) Kev: hand. I want to see the calluses from the N64 control stick on Pokemon Stadium. Mini gates. And that's what's wrong with them.
(1:50:02) Al: games and they would laugh. They would be like, what on earth, what on earth do you
(1:50:08) Al: see in this? They don't understand the beauty, the wonder we saw when we first saw that,
(1:50:14) Al: the first 3D Pokemon game, not X and Y, it was Stadium and Wonder. I didn't have an N64,
(1:50:17) Kev: The stadium, yeah.
(1:50:22) Al: so I only got to play it when someone else had an N64. Someone brought one into school
(1:50:27) Al: once and we played Stadium on a TV in a school classroom. That was my first time playing
(1:50:30) Kev: Oh my god defining moment there absolutely
(1:50:33) Al: Pokemon Stadium and it was truly wonderful. Those games are bad. All right, I think we're
(1:50:44) Al: done here. This was... Oh, you got a last point? Well, my answer is do not remake farming
(1:50:45) Kev: wait wait wait wait we have to answer the question if we pick one
(1:50:52) Kev: no i'm holding a gun to your head which would pick a game to be remade i'm forcing you pick one
(1:50:53) Al: games. No, my answer is don't. Fine, fine. Remake the original Harvest Moon. Oh my word,
(1:51:00) Kev: no sorry everyone i'll then survive
(1:51:05) Kev: okay you're not a good one that's a good pick uh my answer wildflowers it has to be the same
(1:51:09) Kev: game just does a different art style to it yeah you know I i know I just want a different art
(1:51:13) Al: You want a demake of wildflowers, don't you?
(1:51:14) Al: Yeah, pigs pixel art wildflowers.
(1:51:18) Kev: style I don't care what kind go that I mean that would look better but that's not a high bar either
(1:51:28) Al: Alright. Thank you, Kevin, for joining me to talk about remakes.
(1:51:30) Kev: thank you that was that was a good one
(1:51:31) Al: This was a fun discussion.
(1:51:35) Al: They send your hate mail to Kevin. Where can they do that,
(1:51:40) Kev: I send it i'm i'm a coupe prez on on whatever i'm still on the burning trash fire that is twitter
(1:51:48) Kev: sadly I am on blue sky uh they send all your comments and hate mail there um uh the artist
(1:51:54) Kev: square if you want to see art art stuff don't send hate mail there they'll hurt my feelings
(1:52:00) Al: You can find me at the Scottbot on various social medias. You can find the podcast on
(1:52:00) Kev: what about you al where people
(1:52:06) Al: Tumblr and on Blue Sky at THSPod, the place you really send your hate mail though. Tell
(1:52:11) Al: us why we're wrong about everything by going to our website, harvestseason.club, where
(1:52:17) Al: you can find a feedback form. You can also find links to everything there to do with

(1:52:30) Kev: I was about to say that's where you'll get the live responses to the hate
(1:52:30) Al: true hate mail happens.
(1:52:36) Al: I am so excited for Wednesday and Thursday and seeing people's reaction to this.
(1:52:39) Kev: Oh
(1:52:40) Kev: Dude the conversation we've got we've that we're going on about
(1:52:45) Kev: relationships and the ball and chain
(1:52:46) Al: Oh yeah, that was that that went well.
