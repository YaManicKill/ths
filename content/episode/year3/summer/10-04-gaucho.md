# Transcript

(0:00:30) Kev: Well howdy partners and welcome to the harvest season.
(0:00:35) Kev: Around these parts they call me Kevin.
(0:00:39) Kev: Today you're riding with me as we wander over yonder
(0:00:42) Kev: and go exploring these fine grasslands.
(0:00:47) Kev: Yes, hello, it's true.
(0:00:49) Kev: You've heard the rumors and I can't confirm.
(0:00:52) Kev: My name is Kevin and I am your sole host of the harvest season.
(0:00:55) Kev: Hello everyone.
(0:00:56) Kev: We're here to talk about Cottage Corgades.
(0:00:59) Kev: you know how we do
(0:01:00) Kev: as I'm legally obligated to say by "ow"
(0:01:04) Kev: um, but, uh, but yes, hello, no, no co-hosts, another solo cabin episode today
(0:01:12) Kev: I can already hear the groan/cheers as you prepare for the best/worst kind of episode we have offered here on the Harvey season
(0:01:22) Kev: uh, just, just me, un-chained, unhinged, uncensored, right?
(0:01:28) Kev: No one stood here to stop me from singing.
(0:01:30) Kev: songs or doing a foghorn-leg-horn impression. And so you know, yeah, prepare yourself. Just
(0:01:38) Kev: me alone talking directly into your ears. Just you and me alone staring at each other
(0:01:44) Kev: in an empty room. Hello everyone. I hope that sets the tone as it should be if you may feel
(0:01:55) Kev: a little threatened. I'm sure Al does. Excuse me, I got a drink.
(0:02:00) Kev: I don't care. But yeah, so hello. It's harvest season. As I was doing with my little cowboy
(0:02:09) Kev: twang intro, I already got the voices going. We are here, and by we and me me, I'm here
(0:02:16) Kev: to talk about Gaucho and the Grassland game that you all know. I have been eagerly awaiting,
(0:02:26) Kev: forward to. It finally released and here I am with
(0:02:30) Kev: some first impressions for it. But before that as as per our norm we have we have
(0:02:40) Kev: some news to go over. That's a good good bit of pieces of news I like them from
(0:02:46) Kev: what I've seen so I'm looking forward to going over that with you guys. But
(0:02:51) Kev: before that let's talk about some non cottagecore game thing stuff I've been
(0:02:57) Kev: up to because people are interested in that apparently.
(0:03:02) Kev: And if you aren't well, I don't hear any objection. So there you go, you know, so
(0:03:07) Kev: The well, yeah, this week's been as usually, you know, I mean, I'm busy with work things and stuffs
(0:03:14) Kev: And I just spent time on gotcha, of course, so, you know, that was a good chunk of time this week
(0:03:20) Kev: But aside from that
(0:03:23) Kev: I've been probably
(0:03:26) Kev: So you both Pokemon unite hits fourth anniversary this this year this
(0:03:30) Kev: Week a couple days ago whenever which first of all is horrifying to think about. I'm playing this game for four years time. Oh
(0:03:39) Kev: whole time
(0:03:41) Kev: Never never stops never. It's always relentless
(0:03:47) Kev: Now as per pretty much tradition at this point every year in the anniversary they release a new Pokemon a
(0:03:53) Kev: Legendary or mythical we've had Mewtwo. Oh, oh sweet food. I think it was last year
(0:03:59) Kev: And this year a little
(0:04:00) Kev: Bit of a treat two for one special we're getting the Latias and Latios the young duo the Latino was at Latinas
(0:04:08) Kev: Whatever you want to call them the gen 3 that the blue and the red one
(0:04:13) Kev: No, not not the ones on the box the other blue and red one
(0:04:17) Kev: Yeah
(0:04:19) Kev: That's we only have Latios at the moment
(0:04:25) Kev: But Latias will be releasing soon and they do in fact work together
(0:04:31) Kev: It's the first time we've seen pokemon explicitly boost and support
(0:04:37) Kev: Another specific pokemon, so that's a fun mechanic. I think in Unite. I've seen them played and they're not
(0:04:44) Kev: Terrifyingly busted like Mewtwo when he came out, but yeah, it's fun. So
(0:04:48) Kev: Fun times over there Unite. I enjoy it still still still on that train
(0:04:54) Kev: Speaking of trains. I'm still on Zenla's on zero with its update of an update of its own
(0:05:01) Kev: The 2.1 patch or whatever number it's it's one of the bigger numbered patches which
(0:05:07) Kev: Implies a story content update a new chapter in their story
(0:05:13) Kev: Now unfortunately, I think Zenla's on zero
(0:05:16) Kev: Continues to suffer from a sort of identity crisis. I've talked about it
(0:05:22) Kev: Before but when the game first came out. It was a very
(0:05:25) Kev: Lack of better way of describing it mid 2000s urban vibe
(0:05:30) Kev: big metropolitan city is the setting and people have flip phones and their CRTs
(0:05:35) Kev: hanging about and video rentals a very specific aesthetic they were going for
(0:05:41) Kev: and it worked for me right clearly up to taste if you know the player enjoyed it
(0:05:46) Kev: or not but it worked and they they wrote that aesthetic with a with a solid
(0:05:53) Kev: playing game plan and story for a year right there were hackers and kind of this
(0:05:58) Kev: mystery to explore.
(0:06:00) Kev: And, uh, but yeah, as they hit the end of year one, they kind of wrapped up a lot of
(0:06:06) Kev: those storylines and threads, um, and I, I feel like they continue to struggle a bit
(0:06:13) Kev: to follow that up, uh, for lack of better way of describing it.
(0:06:18) Kev: Think of post-Endgame MCU, where it's a little, suffering a little in its identity, I'm not
(0:06:24) Kev: sure where to go.
(0:06:26) Kev: And now this may just be a me thing because there are
(0:06:30) Kev: leaning into this kind of like they've gone from this urban city to now we're
(0:06:35) Kev: out in rural not China where the the former hackers I mean they still are I
(0:06:41) Kev: guess technically but they are now living at a temple because trying to keep
(0:06:46) Kev: them on mystics with a bunch of monks which is a wild pivot from the more much
(0:06:52) Kev: more science fiction heavy aesthetic and genre that they're kind of leaning into
(0:06:58) Kev: and then now we're going into a bit of mysticism with
(0:07:01) Kev: feng shui and energy lines and all that good stuff
(0:07:05) Kev: So yeah, this may be an issue of just stuff getting lost in translation
(0:07:10) Kev: You know mihoyo is a Chinese company and you know this may be
(0:07:14) Kev: For that that target audience. I don't know
(0:07:18) Kev: And it doesn't help that the cast did all the new characters that have been out since
(0:07:23) Kev: 2.0, which is about a month or two ago
(0:07:26) Kev: They this new cast has just not hit
(0:07:30) Kev: I don't find them as entertaining or engaging
(0:07:34) Kev: Which isn't entirely a bad thing
(0:07:37) Kev: And this isn't just the pullable characters even a lot of NPCs. They're just not as memorable in my opinion
(0:07:44) Kev: But the the pullable the playable characters
(0:07:47) Kev: yeah, I don't I pulled for one in the
(0:07:51) Kev: Four three or four that have come out since then
(0:07:54) Kev: Which isn't entirely bad thing because that means I can now save up on resources for when stuff
(0:07:58) Kev: I do want will drop and
(0:08:00) Kev: And that will happen again. We've in true mohoyo fashion. They they tease upcoming characters
(0:08:08) Kev: Not just in the marketing, but in in the gameplay you'll you'll meet some of them who are clearly like up
(0:08:12) Kev: Here's your next banner character or a couple banners away
(0:08:16) Kev: In particular there's a group called the obol squad they're like a military Defense Force unit
(0:08:23) Kev: and
(0:08:24) Kev: Those guys have some cool designs
(0:08:26) Kev: We've already gotten a few out in ZZZ, but the looks like we're gonna fill out
(0:08:30) Kev: the rest of that roster and I'm looking forward to those guys there's a there's
(0:08:35) Kev: like a big Mecca guy that's piloted by a little bunny robot there's a their
(0:08:41) Kev: captain has a living gun who is actually the captain I think something wild like
(0:08:47) Kev: that the sniper of their unit is blind so you know there you go yeah colorful
(0:08:53) Kev: colorful crew that oval squad so I'm looking forward to that but but until
(0:09:00) Kev: I said ZZZ kind of kind of struggling a little with its the flavor if you will
(0:09:06) Kev: um but it's okay because the gameplay is still good even all those characters on
(0:09:10) Kev: that instant come out you know they give you trials or you play with them in the
(0:09:14) Kev: story or whatever they are fun mechanically gameplay wise they're not
(0:09:17) Kev: bad just yeah I'm not dying for them or anything and then the nice bit is not
(0:09:25) Kev: just zenless I think all the mihoyo games they're very strong with their side
(0:09:28) Kev: content. They have lots of weird goofy modes.
(0:09:30) Kev: For instance, right now they have a summer mode where you operate a seaside resort with all sorts of minigames.
(0:09:37) Kev: And so you have to work to upgrade the minigames and the attractions, and that is certainly enjoyable, I'm having a blast with that little mode.
(0:09:46) Kev: But yeah, that's Endless Zone Zero, there's my report. No one here to stop me.
(0:09:52) Kev: Oh, so there you go. Now, aside from that, the other thing I want to talk about...
(0:10:00) Kev: isn't game, per se, but I've been watching a lot of Monk, the mid-2000s, I think it was like 2000 to 2008.
(0:10:09) Kev: Detective Mystery Show, aired on USA Network, I think. It's about Adrian Monk, a former detective on the police force whose wife was killed.
(0:10:21) Kev: Which led to a dismissal, as he already had, let's say, a lot of conditions. OCD.
(0:10:30) Kev: And a lot of phobias.
(0:10:32) Kev: and stuff like that well all that is amplified by his wife's death and so now
(0:10:37) Kev: he does work as a private investigator helping so helping the police just not
(0:10:41) Kev: on their official payroll but but while managing all of these intense oddities
(0:10:49) Kev: and quirks yeah I mean it ran for eight seasons it's clearly a popular show and
(0:10:56) Kev: you guess what lives up to it I'm a fan of detective mystery shows play a lot
(0:11:02) Kev: right professor Layton you know it's kind of in that in that lane and and the
(0:11:08) Kev: mysteries themselves you know they obviously cast staff of writers so they
(0:11:13) Kev: can vary right some it's tough to write mysteries because how do you do it right
(0:11:18) Kev: are you breadcrumbing the clues and it's kind of obvious how it's gonna go or do
(0:11:24) Kev: you know is your detective so great they see something that the audience can't
(0:11:28) Kev: see or know, but they caught it and, oh, a big
(0:11:32) Kev: reveal at the end. Um, so it's hard to find a balance between there and, you know, between
(0:11:37) Kev: the different episodes, uh, I think they swing both ways on this pendulum, but overall still
(0:11:43) Kev: enjoyable, um, and it helps by the fact that the riding is excellent. It's a very funny
(0:11:50) Kev: show, um, as Monk has to navigate this world and the world has to navigate with Monk, supporting
(0:11:57) Kev: his OCD and need to straighten and clean everything up.
(0:12:02) Kev: and avoid things that are not clean or straight and orderly so it makes for
(0:12:10) Kev: some very very entertaining scenarios and and monk himself is very well
(0:12:16) Kev: written and enjoyable character played excellently by Tony Shalab I believe is
(0:12:21) Kev: the actor's name yeah very charming even with all his oddities and quirks very
(0:12:28) Kev: Very, very funny, excellent, can't recommend enough shocker.
(0:12:32) Kev: 8 season show was popular, for a reason, so yeah, go check it out.
(0:12:36) Kev: And hey, it has a great little intro theme, written and performed by Randy Newman, the Toy Story song guy you guys know what I'm talking about.
(0:12:44) Kev: So that's very catchy.
(0:12:49) Kev: No, I will not sing this song right now, I'll spare you all, for now.
(0:12:55) Kev: But yeah, that's uh, that's some of the stuff I've been up to lately.
(0:13:03) Kev: And so with that, let's get, uh, let's see what the world of video games has been up to.
(0:13:10) Kev: Let's start talking with those Xbox 9000 layoff.
(0:13:14) Kev: No, no, I'm kidding, let's stick to cottagecore stuff, as painful as it was, my heart, it goes out, my condolences to all those Xbox employees.
(0:13:23) Kev: Ugh.
(0:13:25) Kev: Ugh, so let's talk about things that weren't laid off, but in fact, the opposite, have stuff that...
(0:13:32) Kev: ...got launched and has, uh, updates.
(0:13:36) Kev: Let's start with, uh, Islanders.
(0:13:39) Kev: Um, the Calm City Builder, uh, it has a, it's come out with a big update, um, called Islanders New Shores.
(0:13:50) Kev: You know, one of those subtitle type, uh, updates/expansions.
(0:13:54) Kev: Um, this is the, yeah, city/island builder, and the new shores update.
(0:14:02) Kev: Um, has, oh, it's one of those kind of expansions, um, oh, I apologize, no, is this a sequel?
(0:14:11) Kev: Oh, this is a sequel, I thought it was an expansion, oh, I'm wrong, oh, good, good for me, um, I...
(0:14:26) Kev: Yeah, wow, I think this is one I just played before and said I should, I could be wrong.
(0:14:31) Kev: Either way, it's an island city builder, island/city builder.
(0:14:37) Kev: A lot of the mechanics of the first game returning just, you know, bigger, better, more biomes, more options.
(0:14:46) Kev: Very, very fun stuff. It does look up my alley and I might play it.
(0:14:52) Kev: Kinda reminds me of the Terrenil, which is a game I still go to every now and then.
(0:14:56) Kev: You can play a lot and enjoy.
(0:14:58) Kev: Yeah, you've got lava islands, snow islands, rocky islands.
(0:15:02) Kev: And you're just building up little villages and population on these islands.
(0:15:06) Kev: So yeah, very charming, very endearing.
(0:15:08) Kev: Check it out. That is out already.
(0:15:12) Kev: With a 60%... Oh my... Wait, is that right?
(0:15:16) Kev: Hold on, is this available for $2 USD?
(0:15:20) Kev: Wham!

(0:15:24) Kev: Oh, this is special prom-
(0:15:26) Kev: Yup, wow that is lovely, yeah, very affordable game check it out. It's on sale
(0:15:36) Kev: And yeah, and they're still gonna work on it they have a 2025 roadmap with
(0:15:43) Kev: Basically a lot of the same just working and expanding very cool
(0:15:48) Kev: Yeah, good for you islanders new shores
(0:15:51) Kev: Great looking game. I might very likely check this out. This looks like something
(0:15:56) Kev: I could use you know kind of a just pick up in and just zone out for a little bit sort of game
(0:16:02) Kev: Not not heavy at all. I like it
(0:16:05) Kev: All right. Let's see here. What next um ah
(0:16:10) Kev: Something that is not out, but is coming out. Let's talk about super zoo story the I
(0:16:18) Kev: Guess Star Zoo Valley you could call it. It feels what I call a star do like but set in a zoo instead of a farm
(0:16:26) Kev: um
(0:16:27) Kev: They came out with a big post on their Kickstarter
(0:16:31) Kev: This this is a this is kind of a wild one they had to clarify their release date and development
(0:16:41) Kev: Feels like an important one that probably should have been made clear, but but hey it happens
(0:16:48) Kev: Basically if they they chalk it up to they you know
(0:16:52) Kev: There was the text portion of the Kickstarter and then there's graphics portions
(0:16:56) Kev: on the Kickstarter and basically they just fudged up they mixed up some of
(0:17:03) Kev: the dates. The true and proper release date is the graphic the shown on the
(0:17:09) Kev: little timeline graphic. They are planning to release an alpha version of
(0:17:14) Kev: the game in the second half of this year 2025. A beta will release in the first
(0:17:18) Kev: half of 2026 with the goal of the full release in 2026 second half.
(0:17:26) Kev: and from their post they describe that they feel they are on track you know
(0:17:32) Kev: famous last words but hey they're trying they kind of go over different
(0:17:38) Kev: categories of stuff they're working on
(0:17:46) Kev: customization
(0:17:48) Kev: They do want to launch with multiplayer in the game including minigames like a little soccer game you can play with others
(0:17:54) Kev: That's that's fun. I don't I don't know how to start
(0:17:57) Kev: Do you have that yet like little minigames you can actually play with people are playing on multiplayer. I don't remember it does
(0:18:04) Kev: But that's uh, that's fun. That's good. Oh, so hey, but good for them. They came out trying to dress it
(0:18:11) Kev: It's we know
(0:18:14) Kev: You know still waiting a year
(0:18:16) Kev: I'm certainly in no rush for it. Let's take your time. Well, I get this. I don't know like
(0:18:21) Kev: The whole relationships and you know stardew mechanic tropes like I I don't know
(0:18:27) Kev: But it's a zoo and I really love animals. So maybe I don't know
(0:18:34) Kev: Maybe more than maybe
(0:18:38) Kev: Yeah, but yeah, there'll be plenty of time at least a year until this comes out
(0:18:44) Kev: And yeah, no rush
(0:18:46) Kev: By any means because there is plenty of stuff to play in the meanwhile
(0:18:52) Kev: Including I transition
(0:18:55) Kev: Go go town which has the fifth major update tourist trap
(0:19:02) Kev: So, yeah go go town the kind of Animal Crossing gone on hyperdrive
(0:19:12) Kev: Looking game as I would describe it
(0:19:16) Kev: They've released an update called tourist trap which puts a lot of emphasis on making the village town a tourist attraction
(0:19:23) Kev: So now you have lots of people coming in they have thought bubbles
(0:19:27) Kev: There's ratings on the attractions and the food and stuff like that. Yeah, you know kind of rollercoaster tycoon
(0:19:34) Kev: It looks cute um with this update they've also introduced like new
(0:19:40) Kev: categories of people that can visit aliens and robots and werewolves and all sorts of stuff
(0:19:46) Kev: Which is fun and some of those characters can also become what they call townies the actual villagers
(0:19:52) Kev: And then they could some structures like transit systems that introduces it a little way of doing it
(0:19:58) Kev: So basically like you okay, I want the werewolf while I have to
(0:20:01) Kev: Unlock the werewolf transit system and that will include a werewolf
(0:20:07) Kev: Townie in your town
(0:20:09) Kev: So that's fun
(0:20:11) Kev: It introduces a tier three industry. That's kind of cool
(0:20:16) Kev: a factory that leads to production of resources that leads to massive landmarks as they call it
(0:20:21) Kev: a big lighthouse a stadium ooh hot springs a conservatory okay okay um yeah that's cool
(0:20:30) Kev: and oh hey yeah yum grease that's that yum grease tm that's
(0:20:47) Kev: uh... I admire how unabashedly they are about uh...
(0:20:52) Kev: the zaniness of stuff like that uh... very cool very cute
(0:20:56) Kev: so yeah go go to oh yeah they have oh big one here uh...
(0:21:00) Kev: uh...
(0:21:01) Kev: cliff customization you know all of the new new horizons uh...
(0:21:06) Kev: that's that's been added which includes waterfalls they also added water
(0:21:18) Kev: I like that a lot, so yeah, a lot of new customization stuff, um, clowns, they can have clowns joining in the party, uh, that's fun, you know, I admire Gogotown, they just keep going at it, and leaning into whatever it is they're doing, kind of just over the top nonsense, and I appreciate that, I, Kevin, appreciate it over the top nonsense, shocker.
(0:21:42) Kev: Um, yeah, so good for you, and again, that is our
(0:21:48) Kev: party out now, uh, GOGO, see the GOGOTOWN, yeah, yeah baby, haha, um, alright, next up, uh, let's talk about super farming boy, no, not a super meat boy expansion, sadly, or crossover, um, but it is a charming game nonetheless, it is, oh gosh, uh, we've, I think we've discussed, we, I know we've seen
(0:22:18) Kev: it before, discussed it, but, um, they're, they're coming out with an early access that's out in August 12th, this game is the using, okay, quote here from their steam page, an action puzzle farming sim featuring chain reactions and combos, which is just a wild descriptor in my opinion.
(0:22:37) Kev: Um, so yeah, you play, uh, what's, little character, uh, what is, oh gosh, I get it, oh, super farming boy gets his name.
(0:22:48) Kev: It's all in this very like, oh, comic bookie style, not exactly cop head, but very cartoony style, maybe like mid 2000s or 2010s, uh, cartoon network, like adventure times, even universe esque designs.
(0:23:06) Kev: Um, yeah, you play super farming boy, his body transforms into the different tools. Um, so you just have one tool basically that just changes for the situation, which is a fun concept.
(0:23:18) Kev: Very charming, vibrant art style. Um, and yeah, the chain thing is weird. Like you pull up one carrot, but it does like a grid thing that pulls all the other carrots in the same pattern nearby.
(0:23:30) Kev: Um, very dynamic, very chaotic looking game. Um, but in a good way, like it's clearly what they're going for. So, you know, I guess that just might be a thing for days. There's boss battle. So, you know, I think that using, using the.
(0:23:50) Kev: um they have uh they have touch control that's super cool
(0:23:54) Kev: um yeah so very interesting i'll be keeping my eye out on this um and hey
(0:23:58) Kev: the hidden early access on like I said august 12th
(0:24:01) Kev: um so that's cool good for them they're getting there uh demo is out now if you
(0:24:05) Kev: want to see um look up for you super farming boy
(0:24:18) Kev: Oh here's a, you know, okay next up a game I also want to keep being themselves.
(0:24:23) Kev: Fantasy Life Eye. They have hit 1.2 million copies sold. That's a lot. Well, yeah that's for like a
(0:24:36) Kev: little over a month. That's pretty good. They're giving out some gift codes for
(0:24:47) Kev: play fantasy life I don't know these these might be good materials maybe not
(0:24:51) Kev: there's not a lot of them there's like 12 no 9 there's like three sets of one
(0:24:57) Kev: two three six okay there's 18 there's six sets of three materials each yeah
(0:25:02) Kev: I'm happy overall mostly with the number of fantasy life sold because I'm a big
(0:25:10) Kev: level 5 fan and I was especially worried when they're in North America office
(0:25:14) Kev: But their they came out with this beautiful
(0:25:17) Kev: And it's it's going strong on fantasy life seared the prequel again
(0:25:21) Kev: I played the DS version a lot the DS game
(0:25:25) Kev: I still play it actually I'm going through the DLC origin island
(0:25:31) Kev: Kind of - when this came out it was you know, I was like, oh, I don't want to buy it
(0:25:36) Kev: But I didn't do that DLC so I fired it up and I've been checking away at the DLC a little bit here and there
(0:25:42) Kev: I like it. It's good. It's the single-player MMO
(0:25:45) Kev: I don't know if Fantasy Life Eye still follows it.
(0:25:47) Kev: It still has at least a lot of that level five charm and design I still love.
(0:25:53) Kev: So good for you Fantasy Life Eye. Keep keep on selling. Do another 1.2 million.
(0:25:56) Kev: Yeah. All right speaking of games that sold probably at least 1.2 million.
(0:26:04) Kev: I'd be shocked for anything less. Hello Kitty Island Adventure coming out with
(0:26:08) Kev: another update. The Sunshine Celebration Update. Summer Vacation Festival, Tiki's
(0:26:16) Kev: Bitch
(0:26:18) Kev: You know beach party type to update. It's one of those seasonal events where hey
(0:26:28) Kev: trade 'em in for new stuff, you know, new decorations and whatnot, it's very cute.
(0:26:34) Kev: It's botsmaru, running a little juice-sticky bar.
(0:26:38) Kev: Um, yeah, I like it, very cute.
(0:26:42) Kev: Um, yeah, that's uh, oh, it's on sale right now, 25% off, get it for $30 USD, I don't know for when, but uh,
(0:26:49) Kev: but yo, check it out, it's a good game, we talked about it on at least two episodes, and I like it.
(0:26:55) Kev: Good for you, little kitty island venture. You're a good thing.
(0:26:58) Kev: That's good.
(0:27:00) Kev: Ah, you know what else is good, folks?
(0:27:04) Kev: Discounty. Or more specifically, their little PR campaign they've done.
(0:27:10) Kev: So, discounty. We have talked about it for people who may not remember.
(0:27:15) Kev: You are running a convenience type store.
(0:27:22) Kev: It's like in the middle of a city, and it kind of feels like, you know,
(0:27:26) Kev: just small little.
(0:27:28) Kev: This is a grocery type store, um, I think the store is called 'Discounty'.
(0:27:34) Kev: Anyways they released a series of videos that they call 'Employee Training Videos' and these
(0:27:41) Kev: videos are framed as such, you know you get little CRT scan lines and then the little
(0:27:47) Kev: jingle for the business as you work for the 'Discounty Corporation'.
(0:27:51) Kev: They go over a few different mechanics, they talk about store expansion, they can buy land
(0:27:58) Kev: to expand your store, excuse me.
(0:28:04) Kev: Customer happiness is one.
(0:28:09) Kev: Store layout and customization, I'm actually impressed by that one, there's a wide range
(0:28:13) Kev: of customization and layout options.
(0:28:17) Kev: And it's, I think that's a, I think this is gonna be a key element in making this enjoyable
(0:28:23) Kev: right because you know running a store as you know Al's not fond of and for a lot of
(0:28:28) Kev: understandable reasons right, it's kind of maybe, as Al says, the just, it's the shipping
(0:28:36) Kev: box with extra steps or whatever.
(0:28:38) Kev: Well this clearly is not that, there's a lot more in that, you invest, you can, you kind
(0:28:42) Kev: of think strategically how do I want to layout merchandise.
(0:28:47) Kev: And I think that's pretty clever and not just that but aesthetically there's a lot of variations
(0:28:52) Kev: you can go with.
(0:28:53) Kev: You know you can actually make it look like a little greenhouse sort of store, you know,
(0:28:58) Kev: a nursery that's the word because you have so many plants and whatnot.
(0:29:03) Kev: Yeah they're even do, they have an employee of a month contest in their discords, that's
(0:29:10) Kev: very cute, where they crown a winner of like the best looking shops every month with the
(0:29:15) Kev: demo you can play.
(0:29:17) Kev: That is, that is very, very cute.
(0:29:19) Kev: Yeah let's see, okay there's a couple more training videos, welcome to Blomkis the town's
(0:29:26) Kev: called Blomkis, kind of an overview of the town.
(0:29:29) Kev: There's a shop, some of the different locals and locales, locations you can visit.
(0:29:36) Kev: That's uh, that's fun.
(0:29:40) Kev: And then there's another employee training video on talking about relationships, like
(0:29:45) Kev: the mechanics and different types of characters you can meet and whatnot.
(0:29:52) Kev: That's yeah, that's the last one.
(0:29:55) Kev: Now throughout these training videos there's a common theme
(0:29:58) Kev: Of uh, how should I put this uh, the CD underbelly. This really feels like the Joja Market route, the game.
(0:30:10) Kev: Um, because um, at the end of each of these training videos there's a disclaimer.
(0:30:15) Kev: "Discounty corporation cannot be held liable for any environmental damage, interpersonal relationship issues,
(0:30:25) Kev: or riotous uprisings that occur as a result of the
(0:30:28) Kev: these training, uh, following this training video.
(0:30:32) Kev: So, um, yeah, clearly they framed that some of this stuff can result in bad
(0:30:37) Kev: things. Um, and you do in fact, get a tiny sliver of a frame of a riotous
(0:30:42) Kev: uprising. So, um, yeah, I don't know. Can you lean into that or is it, you know,
(0:30:48) Kev: like, oh, you're going to have a change of heart and changed how the model works.
(0:30:51) Kev: I don't know, but you know, they're aware of what they're doing. It's fun. Um,
(0:30:57) Kev: And it does look like you have the eye.
(0:30:58) Kev: You don't have the option to build relationships with people.
(0:31:02) Kev: You can bribe or make things easier for you to get around permitting or control press.
(0:31:08) Kev: Get in a relationship with a reporter and avoid bad press from your store.
(0:31:12) Kev: Which is kind of a fun idea actually.
(0:31:16) Kev: The people, your relationships impact the status of your farm. I like that. That's good.
(0:31:22) Kev: Yeah, that's clever. I'm excited for this one.
(0:31:28) Kev: This is the store simulators.
(0:31:30) Kev: I think has a lot of charm and personality and the mechanics like I said the whole store customization thing. I
(0:31:36) Kev: Like that a lot. I'm a big fan. So yeah, keep
(0:31:41) Kev: Keeping on up for that folks
(0:31:44) Kev: Say do we have a release date? I don't think we do
(0:31:51) Kev: Could be dead wrong, but oh, oh I'm dead right. I am dead wrong. It's available August 21st 2025
(0:31:56) Kev: Oh, that's that's around the corner of the month
(0:32:00) Kev: I can't wait for that. Oh, oh, yeah, I'll definitely be playing this. I'm very excited for that. Yay
(0:32:05) Kev: I like it when I don't have to wait too long for things. That's that's fun
(0:32:12) Kev: Yeah
(0:32:14) Kev: Okay, there you go discount
(0:32:16) Kev: All right. Yeah, do check out those videos. I think they're charming only down like maybe a minute long each something like that

(0:33:53) Kev: but yeah it is a
(0:33:56) Kev: missus
(0:34:07) Kev: Either way, um, it's the snack own sleeping has the blep tongue. I don't think the belly is big enough. That's gonna be my biggest
(0:34:23) Kev: Don't know maybe it's just something about the posing doesn't doesn't feel as round
(0:34:28) Kev: It does seem more raccoon like and as a plush, which I'm sure they wanted
(0:34:33) Kev: but
(0:34:35) Kev: But yeah check it out um
(0:34:38) Kev: Because you have a little better week to jump on that so
(0:34:42) Kev: Almost 38 USD that is aging premium jumbo plushie, I guess

(0:35:06) Kev: Not big the cat when do we get the big why don't wait do I have it? No, I don't think I would be the cat plushie
(0:35:13) Kev: Hold on hold on folks. This is what is a Kevin episode. I'm checking the interwebs a big the cat plush
(0:35:23) Kev: Is there an official one right? That's the question cuz of course Etsy has 800 of them
(0:35:30) Kev: Great Eastern Entertainment, I think that might be an officially licensed one. Oh snap oh
(0:35:37) Kev: Oh my gosh, and it's almost the price of the snack goon plushie
(0:35:42) Kev: Okay, I might not get snack good, but I might get a big the cat plushie
(0:35:47) Kev: This episode is an accessory
(0:35:50) Kev: You can hear the roars of cheering
(0:35:53) Kev: Enjoy as Kevin discovers the big the cat plushie
(0:35:59) Kev: He has his fishing rod oh, he looks very dopey. I love it his belly's not big enough. No his arms are too long
(0:36:12) Kev: Oh, but Kevin discovers the big, the cat flush.
(0:36:18) Kev: Good times.
(0:36:19) Kev: All right.
(0:36:20) Kev: All right.
(0:36:20) Kev: All right.
(0:36:21) Kev: The, the, the, I know that's the real hard hitting news.
(0:36:23) Kev: We all want it, but that's, that's all I got.
(0:36:25) Kev: That's, that's the news we covered the docket.
(0:36:27) Kev: Yay.
(0:36:29) Kev: Um, so with that being said, let's get into go show in the grassland.
(0:36:38) Kev: So, um, all right, this one, I feel needs a little.
(0:36:42) Kev: Just, uh, just a hint of historical context, what is a gaucho?
(0:36:54) Kev: Um, so, uh, a gaucho in a very, very base and somewhat inaccurate descriptor, uh, would
(0:37:05) Kev: be a South American cowboy, right?
(0:37:08) Kev: Um, uh, the, the emphasis being particularly on the horsemanship, the, the skills of equestrianism
(0:37:17) Kev: and all that.
(0:37:18) Kev: Um, and you know, this, as we all know, I'm Mexican, right?
(0:37:22) Kev: So this is south of my border, if you will, right?
(0:37:24) Kev: In Mexico, the Vaquero is very, very much synonymous or equivalent to the American cowboy,
(0:37:32) Kev: because, hey guess what, like a third of American cowboys were Hispanic, so.
(0:37:36) Kev: So, you know, that whole iconography, mythos, is similar, but gauchas are just a little
(0:37:44) Kev: different.
(0:37:45) Kev: Part of it, I think, is the environment, right?
(0:37:48) Kev: We're talking Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, right?
(0:37:53) Kev: A lot, uh...
(0:37:55) Kev: A very different environment from the big wide open plains of the U.S., right?
(0:38:00) Kev: I mean, there were, they called the Pampas, um, the, uh...
(0:38:05) Kev: Kind of plains out in South America, but it's still, generally speaking, a more heavily forested area, right, so...
(0:38:12) Kev: Um, the South American region, right, tropics, and all that good stuff.
(0:38:16) Kev: Um...
(0:38:19) Kev: So yeah, um, Gauchos, um...
(0:38:21) Kev: they they have this sort of uh... meat
(0:38:26) Kev: or stereotype of being brave and unruly at the same time
(0:38:30) Kev: like very rough and tumble sort of guys out there
(0:38:34) Kev: not necessarily like Wild West Sheriff type thing
(0:38:38) Kev: but you know they're out there
(0:38:48) Kev: living out on the country living out on the land
(0:38:52) Kev: that's the word I'm looking for and so again
(0:38:56) Kev: this South American region and
(0:39:00) Kev: that leads to this game Gautreaux and the Grassland which is
(0:39:04) Kev: in fact developed by a Brazilian
(0:39:07) Kev: game dev company one second let me find their name again
(0:39:13) Kev: Gautreaux and the Grassland
(0:39:18) Kev: Ipopia games I hope I'm saying that wrong
(0:39:22) Kev: or yeah good good job man I hope I'm saying that wrong I hope I'm not saying
(0:39:26) Kev: that wrong that is again for talking in South America so this is more Portuguese
(0:39:31) Kev: in Spanish so I don't speak Portuguese I can kind of you know guess a little bit
(0:39:37) Kev: but yeah so this was announced forever ago and when this when I saw this game I
(0:39:43) Kev: I was thinking, okay, it's like, 3D Stardew...
(0:39:53) Kev: That's what I thought that the game was going to be, more or less.
(0:39:57) Kev: Now, what the game was, or is, isn't quite that.
(0:40:04) Kev: Let's start with the very first thing.
(0:40:05) Kev: First of all, when I bought it, it's only $20 USD.
(0:40:08) Kev: Okay, well, I honestly expected a little more.
(0:40:11) Kev: I thought it was going to be, but, I mean, hey, that's a good surprise, right?
(0:40:15) Kev: But it also, I think, does set the expectations of the game, right?
(0:40:20) Kev: This was smaller in scale than I expected, I would say.
(0:40:24) Kev: And it's only 1.3 GB, so yeah, much smaller in scale than I expected.
(0:40:29) Kev: I was like, "Huh."
(0:40:33) Kev: But that's not a bad thing, just, you know, just surprise me a little, maybe I wasn't paying attention.
(0:40:41) Kev: So what I did get, instead of Stardew, but South American Cowboy,
(0:40:47) Kev: what we got is a game that is more, I think, about that.
(0:40:54) Kev: The themes of the couch, which is weird to say. There's an important bit here.
(0:40:59) Kev: When I checked early on, when I was playing, I just happened to check the credits, because I was curious to find out a little more.
(0:41:07) Kev: Because when you start the game, it actually tells you that this was, the development was aided by what they call the State Department of Culture,
(0:41:14) Kev: which I believe is in reference to a Brazilian governmental, like, federal funding thing.
(0:41:20) Kev: Um, which I personally found very endearing.
(0:41:24) Kev: Um, uh, and, you know, that, you know, could be largely contextual because of how things are in the U.S., we're losing NPR, PBS, et cetera, right?
(0:41:36) Kev: So, and then you have this little game out of Brazil where, you know, the Brazilian government wants to make, uh, quite a little game about, um,
(0:41:53) Kev: So, um, so yeah, that, that, that shortly made me say, huh.
(0:41:58) Kev: Um, but furthermore, like I said, I went through the credits and at the end.
(0:42:04) Kev: They, they have a dedication to the, the victims of, uh, of some
(0:42:12) Kev: floods that happened in Brazil.
(0:42:13) Kev: Um, uh, from when I read and researched about, uh, January of 2025 this year.
(0:42:21) Kev: You know to the victims and communities affected
(0:42:23) Kev: by these heavy flooding some I was not aware of this this stuff but but yeah
(0:42:31) Kev: thousands of people were affected people left homeless and so on and so forth so
(0:42:38) Kev: yeah obviously a tragic event and I don't know um like that so recent it's
(0:42:48) Kev: hard to know how much an impact did the development but that little dedication
(0:42:53) Kev: kind of paint this this whole game in a different light for me because what this
(0:43:01) Kev: game is it's not the stardew valley like I thought what this game is is about a
(0:43:07) Kev: community and helping people out because that's what the premise is you are a
(0:43:13) Kev: nameless gaucho and you are summoned by literally your ghost father that is the
(0:43:21) Kev: character's name, Ghost Father.
(0:43:23) Kev: And he, uh, has implored you, forced you.
(0:43:29) Kev: It's, it's kind of pushy, kind of not even, you don't get the choice.
(0:43:33) Kev: Um, you are given the role of a guardian, a, to, to help, to go out into these
(0:43:41) Kev: grasslands and these areas, um, where people have been suffering from all sorts
(0:43:46) Kev: of natural and unnatural disasters and to go help them out and restore their
(0:43:52) Kev: communities.
(0:43:53) Kev: And this is what the game is, it's not about necessarily your central homestead, but to go out and to go restore these different areas, helping people out.
(0:44:05) Kev: That is like legitimate, actually the progress measure, how many happy points you get from people.
(0:44:19) Kev: and so yeah it's like I said very different from what I expected but it's not
(0:44:23) Kev: necessarily a bad thing I personally found this charming and endearing like
(0:44:29) Kev: I said you know maybe
(0:44:38) Kev: Things aren't great, right? Maybe it's my own. You know, I've got a lot of personal stuff going on
(0:44:44) Kev: Maybe that's making more sympathetic. Maybe I'm just a big sap. Guess what I am - we all know this
(0:44:50) Kev: but I
(0:44:51) Kev: found
(0:44:53) Kev: This overall premise this overall theme to be very charming and endearing and I think a lot of it's a presentation
(0:44:59) Kev: It has the character designs are very overcooked
(0:45:02) Kev: Let's say for lack of a better way like very cartoony very cutesy and exaggerated
(0:45:07) Kev: You're the gout, the male gout, you can be like-
(0:45:08) Kev: I'm male or female, but the male gout characters are generally speaking very big mustaches and eyebrows, very cartoon-y and cute.
(0:45:18) Kev: Your dog also gets some eyebrows and mustache.
(0:45:24) Kev: So yeah, I don't know, for all the times I writhe in pain over the term, this game did in fact feel cozy to me.
(0:45:38) Kev: At least it touched me, let's say that.
(0:45:42) Kev: Like I said, maybe I'm reading too much into it, right? Maybe that was just a nice little dedication I put in, but...
(0:45:48) Kev: When I see this, right, it's a game about hoping people, they have these floods, and you have the State Department of Culture funding them, backing them up, like...
(0:46:00) Kev: I don't know, all that is a feel-good story to me, like, it adds up to just something a little heartwarming.
(0:46:10) Kev: But like I said, I don't know, maybe that's just me, it's just mine being just too influenced by other stuff going on.
(0:46:16) Kev: But overall, regardless of that, I do think the game is still charming, and overall the gaming is enjoyable.
(0:46:24) Kev: So let's talk about the actual gameplay mechanics.
(0:46:28) Kev: It's very resource-like collect and manage-not even manage, it's collecting, right?
(0:46:34) Kev: You're not even, or at least from the portion I've played, I've only played
(0:46:39) Kev: One of three different areas. I wasn't you're not really
(0:46:43) Kev: Farming growing crops you I was and there might be it looks like there's some different mechanics. I might unlock on each area
(0:46:52) Kev: Because I know there's chickens in the I have not encountered chickens
(0:46:55) Kev: I did raise cattle and and grow and get milk from them, but but no crops
(0:47:01) Kev: Um, so there might be that I might buy I don't want to be inaccurate
(0:47:06) Kev: But just I haven't reached that if that's the case, but so yeah, but
(0:47:09) Kev: Not so much about growing the resources going out and gathering or finding them right chopping trees picking
(0:47:15) Kev: You know using your pickaxe at stones to get stones. You mean your dog is a little resource generator
(0:47:21) Kev: You used 10 did to dig at holes and it finds metal bits or or clay or you know different different items and resources
(0:47:31) Kev: And and so yeah, so you have these different tools
(0:47:34) Kev: Yeah, the axe the pickaxe a machete. Oh machete. You can cut down grass different types of
(0:47:39) Kev: Grasses and stuff with it a jug for collecting water
(0:47:43) Kev: Oh and a milk bucket took to milk cows cuz cows or milk cow milk is a resource as well
(0:47:50) Kev: And so you're gathering all these resources and you're going around and helping people out right it's full 3d
(0:47:57) Kev: So, you know you the horse riding as it should be with a gaucho game is very important
(0:48:04) Kev: have a horse with you at all times or you can hop on or summon it you can whistle and...
(0:48:08) Kev: it'll come to you at all times. The horse riding feels good you can lasso from the
(0:48:14) Kev: horse riding and use a cattle horn to to have cows follow you all that feels
(0:48:19) Kev: good as it should be as I'd expect so you know thumbs up for that it feels
(0:48:24) Kev: like what I want or what I'd expect right which is always such an important
(0:48:28) Kev: thing for any game. So yeah mechanically I think it's it's very solid and and hey
(0:48:34) Kev: They are supporting it in between the time you're playing it and...
(0:48:38) Kev: ...and, you know, coming out and me talking about this, they've come out with a couple updates...
(0:48:43) Kev: ...including one that improved gamepad performance.
(0:48:46) Kev: 'Cause the gamepad at first felt almost like a mouse cursor, you know, that sort of experience, which isn't ideal.
(0:48:52) Kev: And so they said, "Hey, we're gonna fix that," and now it just snaps to different menu options.
(0:48:55) Kev: Like, "Alright, now that we're talking, that's what I want from a gamepad."
(0:48:59) Kev: So, so good for them. Good for them.
(0:49:01) Kev: Um...
(0:49:03) Kev: Uh...
(0:49:04) Kev: Where was it going?
(0:49:05) Kev: Uh, anyways, okay, going back to the resources.
(0:49:07) Kev: So yeah, you gather all these resources.
(0:49:08) Kev: If you're six and stones and water and all that stuff and going around and helping people, um, there's, there's all sorts of different things, but hey, help me build me build this cart and this fence.
(0:49:18) Kev: My cows all broke out.
(0:49:19) Kev: Can you help me fix this fence and, and go herd my cows back here?
(0:49:23) Kev: Can you help me build the trough for these new animals?
(0:49:26) Kev: Can you fill it with water?
(0:49:27) Kev: Can you help extinguish all these fires that are popping up with the jar?
(0:49:32) Kev: Um, uh, you know, different things.
(0:49:36) Kev: Um, it's that.
(0:49:38) Kev: particularly deep, there's no, you know, deep character stories or lures or anything.
(0:49:44) Kev: But you're just going out and just helping a community, just helping these little people
(0:49:47) Kev: regrow their little village, your community.
(0:49:51) Kev: And as you do, you know, you get, I think they literally call it happiness points or
(0:49:55) Kev: something like that.
(0:49:57) Kev: And kind of what you're doing in each of the areas, because there's, like I said, there's
(0:50:00) Kev: three different areas.
(0:50:01) Kev: You start off the game in one central hub world, but then you hop over to different
(0:50:05) Kev: areas and what you're trying to do is you're trying to find like
(0:50:08) Kev: this spirit guardian of this of each region. So once you help
(0:50:14) Kev: enough people, you open a door where there's there's some
(0:50:25) Kev: uh... and that's kind of the overall objective for each area
(0:50:32) Kev: in that there is still
(0:50:35) Kev: some sandboxy creative elements it's not
(0:50:38) Kev: totally linear
(0:50:40) Kev: uh... there's areas of land you can buy by exchanging enough resources
(0:50:45) Kev: uh... and some quests will actually ask you to do so because
(0:50:48) Kev: when you buy the land you can
(0:50:50) Kev: create different buildings on it
(0:50:53) Kev: You're given different recipes and...
(0:50:55) Kev: You can build different types of houses, or a barn, or fencing, or you know, little different structures.
(0:51:02) Kev: And from what, again, only going to employ one of the three areas, it does look like I could go to the second area and get new recipes and bring them back to the first area.
(0:51:12) Kev: So, yeah, there's this element of building up, not just repairing and helping all these little people, but actually building up the town.
(0:51:22) Kev: the town, and a lot of it is purely aesthetic, cosmetic.
(0:51:25) Kev: but it's still charming, and it's a little grid based system, you build, put a building here, put a building there, whatever.
(0:51:32) Kev: It's not super in-depth, at least from what I've seen, you can't build like, let's say, roads, which I kind of wish I could.
(0:51:39) Kev: Because I think that would kind of make the village feel nicer, or whatever.
(0:51:43) Kev: But, you know, it's not Animal Crossing customized to every bit of a speck of dirt on the island, or whatever.
(0:51:50) Kev: But it is a nice little creative outlet, too.
(0:52:00) Kev: um and so that uh yeah that that's like I said that's I i'm only maybe a third of the game it's
(0:52:11) Kev: a very short game i'll say you could probably you know for someone who's busy you could probably
(0:52:17) Kev: knock out maybe a week you just play it like an hour or two every night um because yeah i've
(0:52:22) Kev: played I don't know the exact card count but I would estimate i'm about a third of the way
(0:52:27) Kev: done with the game and you know for that price that's
(0:52:30) Kev: perfectly fine and acceptable but yeah that's that's kind of it it is a like
(0:52:39) Kev: game at least from what I've seen so far and that's okay sometimes I like game is
(0:52:44) Kev: good like I said earlier and more importantly like I said I think this
(0:52:50) Kev: game does something that's very hard and that's just to make it charming but
(0:52:56) Kev: Genuinely that that heartwarming sense of help
(0:53:01) Kev: I don't know that that's
(0:53:07) Kev: Like I think of Stardew Valley in the whole Jojo route and taking out right there helping people
(0:53:13) Kev: like those those stories, you know, you help certain people and you get involved in their stories and whatever but
(0:53:19) Kev: The overall feeling of restoring the community so I don't know sometimes that maybe that gets lost in the weeds of just trying to fill
(0:53:26) Kev: out the community
(0:53:27) Kev: Center request or whatever
(0:53:30) Kev: but this game like that's clearly what they're aiming for and I think it was a
(0:53:36) Kev: They succeeded at it, which you know hats off to them. I find that very
(0:53:41) Kev: impressive
(0:53:43) Kev: So yeah, I'm gonna keep playing this game. I want to finish it to completion. That's not terribly hard ask
(0:53:49) Kev: and
(0:53:51) Kev: But and yeah, I honestly
(0:53:53) Kev: like even
(0:53:55) Kev: Even though the game was not what I expected it
(0:54:00) Kev: The cowboy simulator I hope for personally
(0:54:04) Kev: It's still a lovely and charming game and and then two thumbs up and an easy recommendation from me
(0:54:11) Kev: You know, I hope it does well
(0:54:13) Kev: I you know, like
(0:54:16) Kev: It's a more niche
(0:54:18) Kev: like culturally
(0:54:21) Kev: Area
(0:54:22) Kev: You know, it's not like we're playing games from South American devs every other week here or in general, you know, so I
(0:54:30) Kev: Wholeheartedly encourage that and then you know, just go check it out, you know
(0:54:36) Kev: And and like I said, they you can feel the care they're putting into this there. They're updating game constantly and then fixing things
(0:54:43) Kev: And and yeah, I can't open I guess it before but though the overcooked art sounds very cute charming. I can't emphasize enough
(0:54:51) Kev: Um, okay. Yeah, I think that's that's all I got really I'm done rambling and and and and and and getting mushy and all that
(0:54:59) Kev: Um...
(0:55:01) Kev: So yeah, that is gaucho in the grass when I came out didn't disappoint hey good good for them
(0:55:06) Kev: Right the game works and didn't disappoint. What more can you ask for really?
(0:55:12) Kev: So yeah go check that out again, I highly encourage you
(0:55:17) Kev: And yeah, I guess we can call it an episode shorter one, of course just just me that's
(0:55:24) Kev: that's I
(0:55:26) Kev: I like long podcasts. My primary podcast I listen to is generally
(0:55:30) Kev: speaking three to four hours a week. I like it. Maybe it's my own personal situation when I'm at
(0:55:38) Kev: work. It's easy to turn on podcasts and just get in it for a couple hours. But yeah, I always feel
(0:55:46) Kev: bad when these episodes. That's the biggest thing I feel bad about. It's a little short, but hey,
(0:55:52) Kev: it is what it is. What can I do? I mean, I could go on, but you know, I'll save out there.
(0:56:00) Kev: Just cutting out entire sections of me talking to myself is two different characters. That'll be
(0:56:10) Kev: for another episode. But yeah, thanks again folks for listening. Thanks Al for letting me do a solo
(0:56:20) Kev: episode again. Thank you listeners for surviving somehow to the end of this. All right, and with
(0:56:29) Kev: that.
(0:56:31) Kev: You can find me on the internet if you can.
(0:56:34) Kev: Actually, you probably don't want to do that.
(0:56:35) Kev: There's probably not much that you're going to find out there.
(0:56:38) Kev: I'm @koopaprez on the bluesk, on the twitter, on the whatever.
(0:56:42) Kev: Or the artist square, if you want to see some of my art, even though I'm falling behind.
(0:56:45) Kev: I've picked...
(0:56:47) Kev: I made some sprites in the past week, that's something.
(0:56:51) Kev: Yeah, I want to make more, of course I'll make more, but I'll get to it by one day.
(0:56:55) Kev: Maybe probably, I promise.
(0:56:57) Kev: uh... say that's a cooper is on whatever at the artist
(0:57:01) Kev: on various things you want to see some my art find al at the Scott at no al at
(0:57:11) Kev: the Scott bought on masted on that Scott and blue sky find this lovely podcast at
(0:57:17) Kev: ths pod on tumblr in blue sky or better yet go to harvest season not club so you
(0:57:23) Kev: can drop a line drop the feedback I I love the feedback you know from this
(0:57:31) Kev: I love the emails I think stuff that's you know you know we gather the news we
(0:57:37) Kev: prepare topics or whatever but the element of just questions from people
(0:57:41) Kev: outside all that from this plane stuff I like that a lot so I encourage you
(0:57:46) Kev: people to leave some feedback to get read on air or to ask question doesn't
(0:57:50) Kev: have to I don't know I'll say it here doesn't even have to be college core
(0:57:54) Kev: related ask us dumb stuff and ask us to rank different pastas I don't know I
(0:57:59) Kev: I don't care, do whatever.
(0:58:01) Kev: Al loves it when I promise or say these things, he does.
(0:58:08) Kev: But yeah, Harvesting is Not Club. Check it out for all the links and the feedback.
(0:58:14) Kev: Or, or even even better, head to patreon.com/thspot

(0:58:25) Kev: Man has children. Help feed his family. You can help with that.
(0:58:32) Kev: He does not financially, at least not to that level, depend on this.
(0:58:35) Kev: But, supporting the, you know, paying, I don't know, server fees, whatever, stuff like that.
(0:58:41) Kev: That is nice. It's nice to support.
(0:58:43) Kev: But, you know, who cares about that? Because you get stuff out of it.

(0:58:59) Kev: But you can see people talk
(0:59:01) Kev: about the show and other stuff and it's very fun very entertaining not as chaotic as discord
(0:59:07) Kev: too it's very nice um you can also get an access to the greenhouse episodes of which there are many
(0:59:12) Kev: they're still good to listen to because a lot of them are not time sensitive um it's about random

(0:59:30) Kev: You know what, insider baseball, I wanted, you know we do the greenhouse episode at the end of each year, like favorite games from 2025 or 2020, you know, every next year, whatever.
(0:59:42) Kev: I was not on last year's, but I've suggested, Al, hey, can I do one and, like, I think it was Johnny, like, I want to get some people on so we can talk about other games. I still want to do that.
