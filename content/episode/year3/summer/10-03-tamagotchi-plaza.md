## Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
(0:00:34) Al: My name is Al.
(0:00:36) Kev: My name is Kevin. Supposedly.
(0:00:37) Al: And we're here, we're here, supposedly.
(0:00:40) Al: Why? What's what has happened?
(0:00:40) Kev: I don't know. I've just... I mean, I've never seen the documentation to back it up.
(0:00:46) Kev: I'm just saying.
(0:00:46) Al: You've never seen your birth certificate.
(0:00:47) Kev: Birth certificate? No, I don't... I can't remember the last time I've seen it now.
(0:00:51) Kev: If... Yeah, I mean, I probably had to dust it out for something.
(0:00:52) Al: Wow, have you seen your driving license or your passport?
(0:00:56) Kev: Oh, yeah, you know what? Sure. I guess driver license. Yeah, all right.
(0:01:01) Al: Is this Kevin, Kevin, is this where we find out that you're undocumented, Kevin?
(0:01:06) Kev: You know, I'd be a surprise to me too. But here's the fun part is it doesn't matter anymore.
(0:01:13) Al: Well, that's device very true.
(0:01:22) Al: All right, and we're here today to talk about cartridge code games, because I didn't get
(0:01:23) Kev: Oh, you know, I can keep that gym in.
(0:01:33) Kev: and not nothing
(0:01:34) Al: through that sentence.
(0:01:36) Al: Is that how this episode is going to be?
(0:01:38) Kev: That's supposedly where you're talkin' to me
(0:01:41) Al: I need a holiday.
(0:01:42) Kev: Well, well, you're close to one, aren't you?
(0:01:44) Al: Good news!
(0:01:46) Al: All right, this episode, we're going to talk for a very short period of time,
(0:01:51) Al: and you'll understand why later. We're going to talk about Time of Got You Plaza.
(0:01:57) Al: Spoiler alert, don't play this game. Before that, we've got some news. We have what we've been up to.
(0:02:07) Al: But first of all, wait, do I normally do that in that order? I know what you released the
(0:02:11) Al: the last months before what we've been up to.
(0:02:11) Kev: Isn't it normally what we've been up to first usually? Yeah
(0:02:14) Al: I think it is, yeah, OK, right.
(0:02:16) Al: Yeah, let's do that.
(0:02:17) Al: Ah, why, why?
(0:02:18) Al: It was a section and it just it just moved the title, not the whole section.
(0:02:19) Kev: I was destroying
(0:02:22) Kev: He's destroying the show live on on air
(0:02:23) Al: Stupid thing.
(0:02:25) Al: I'd love to destroy some show notes.
(0:02:28) Al: So we've got before that, we've got some news.
(0:02:30) Al: We've got I know what you released last month.
(0:02:33) Al: But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:02:36) Kev: Um, let me think here, um, not yeah, I
(0:02:42) Kev: Okay, so a lot of the usuals. Um, a little busy this week. Um, uh
(0:02:48) Al: running away from ice agents. Sorry. I really should not joke about that because the ice will
(0:02:50) Kev: Yeah, oh no, yeah, yeah that is a genuine concern every day
(0:02:57) Al: hear it and they'll come for you. We can clip it for the slack.
(0:02:58) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:03:03) Kev: The joys of being
(0:03:05) Kev: Yeah, the joys of...
(0:03:06) Kev: being a brown skinned boy in America right now.
(0:03:13) Kev: There's an ex...
(0:03:15) Kev: So...
(0:03:17) Kev: It feels like a lot of these ice raids are in the workplace, right?
(0:03:21) Kev: And so, mine just feels extra, like, odd because I work for a Chinese company, Technica...
(0:03:28) Al: Oh no. Oh no.
(0:03:28) Kev: Well...
(0:03:29) Kev: I mean, they are...
(0:03:31) Kev: They have a...
(0:03:33) Kev: Incorporation...
(0:03:34) Kev: They are incorporated here in America, right?
(0:03:36) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:03:37) Kev: They are in separate American companies.
(0:03:39) Kev: But, you know, the HQ is in China, so...
(0:03:41) Al: And let's not let's not pretend like technically an American company would stop any rabid anti-Chinese
(0:03:41) Kev: You know, there's a...
(0:03:48) Al: people in America doing anything, you know?
(0:03:48) Kev: Oh, yeah!
(0:03:49) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
(0:03:51) Kev: For sure, I'm just saying, like, there's...
(0:03:53) Kev: There's a few layers, extra fun layers to this equation.
(0:03:54) Al: Yeah.
(0:03:57) Al: As always, they're not going to come for you in that case, because they're only coming
(0:04:00) Kev: Yeah.
(0:04:03) Al: for the manual laborers, right, because they're the only ones that--
(0:04:06) Al: be illegal, obviously. That's true. That's true. Oh, goodness.
(0:04:08) Kev: They'll run out eventually. We're still in year one.
(0:04:14) Kev: I live in Georgia. I mean, I'm in the blue area of Georgia, but it's still Georgia.
(0:04:19) Kev: Southern.
(0:04:21) Kev: Oh, good.
(0:04:21) Al: Oh, a happy, happy podcast.
(0:04:25) Al: What have you been up to, Kevin?
(0:04:28) Kev: Well, while I'm not sweating my legal status, even though I was born here,
(0:04:34) Kev: Um, I've been, I've been playing.
(0:04:36) Al: I mean, who knows whether that counts or not anymore?
(0:04:38) Kev: Uh, according to some people in certain positions, I've been, uh, I've been playing card games, uh, a lot of card games in the past week.
(0:04:50) Kev: Like, yeah, a lot of the usual stuff, but, um, Marvel snap.
(0:04:54) Kev: We got the, the fantastic Ford season, um, the, the like, uh, based off the new movie, um, that's coming up.
(0:04:58) Al: Ah, yes. Is that July then? Cool. Any good cards?
(0:05:02) Kev: Yeah.
(0:05:03) Kev: Yeah.
(0:05:03) Kev: That's the July season.
(0:05:05) Kev: And okay, there's two
(0:05:08) Kev: Okay, so
(0:05:10) Kev: Yes. Okay. First of all, the season pass card is is mr. Fantastic, but the Pedro Pascal version
(0:05:17) Kev: so one you get the bonus of Pedro Pascal at first I was I was
(0:05:22) Kev: Hesitant about Pedro as mr. Fantastic. I don't get me wrong. I love Pedro
(0:05:26) Al: Yeah, you were being racist about him, yeah.
(0:05:28) Kev: Yeah, but but just mr. Fantastic so like the whitest white boy you've ever seen right and now I've been I've been I've warmed up
(0:05:36) Kev: to it. In fact, I'm down.
(0:05:38) Kev: For the revision, let's let's just retroactively put Pedro Pascale in all the Mr. Fantastic
(0:05:43) Kev: appearances. That's what I'm down for. The cards pretty dang good. Marvel Snap is reaching
(0:05:53) Kev: to play. It feels like it's reaching to play. So there's just it's just going bananas, like
(0:05:58) Kev: the power levels going up, which, you know, in most card games, that's what you have to
(0:06:02) Kev: do because you have to keep releasing new cards that people want to buy. But the other
(0:06:08) Kev: Interesting tidbit, okay, I can't remember when they introduced it or
(0:06:12) Kev: if it's always been there.
(0:06:15) Kev: So you know that there's a season pass in Marvel Snap, it's the big thing.
(0:06:18) Al: Yep. I am aware.
(0:06:20) Kev: There's the premium season pass, that's where you actually pay the money and
(0:06:25) Kev: you get the card, right?
(0:06:26) Al: Yeah. Yeah, that just unlocks 10 extra levels, right?
(0:06:26) Kev: Because the season pass, every player gets it, but
(0:06:29) Kev: you don't get half of it until you pay the $10 or whatever.
(0:06:32) Kev: All right, do you remember there is a super premium?
(0:06:38) Kev: That's what it was originally.
(0:06:38) Al: Yes, you're going to tell me it's now different.
(0:06:40) Kev: So X number of months ago, they said, okay, now if you get the super premium,
(0:06:46) Kev: you will get this variant, right?
(0:06:49) Kev: And for people familiar in Snap, variants are a big thing because they're your
(0:06:52) Kev: flare, I guess technically it can unlock a card for you if you don't have it.
(0:06:58) Kev: But it's nice, it's not mandatory.
(0:07:02) Kev: It's an existing card or whatever, but it's just a little extra icing on top, right?
(0:07:08) Kev: And so I was like, okay, sure, that makes sense.
(0:07:09) Kev: A nice little extra bonus if you get the super premium.
(0:07:12) Kev: I never got the super premium because I didn't want to pay $20 for that.
(0:07:18) Kev: But now they have finally, they've pushed the button,
(0:07:24) Kev: they've crossed the line, they broke the glass.
(0:07:27) Kev: There is a brand new card in the super premium version.
(0:07:30) Al: Oh no. No disaster.
(0:07:32) Kev: Yep, and the optics aren't great because I don't.
(0:07:38) Kev: No, if you remember a couple of weeks ago, I talked about there was a mode where they
(0:07:41) Kev: introduced a new card, but it was basically impossible to get the card just playing for free.
(0:07:46) Al: Yeah, you had to have like 500 matches or something.
(0:07:49) Kev: Yeah, something like that.
(0:07:51) Kev: Yeah, so people were already up in arms about that.
(0:07:54) Kev: And that was about a month ago or so.
(0:07:57) Kev: So now they've got this, so it's just very clear that the devs or the higher ups, whoever,
(0:08:04) Kev: There's pressure being put on the game to make it
(0:08:07) Al: >> Yep. I don't know any other games like that, but yep.
(0:08:08) Kev: more pay to win, right?
(0:08:10) Kev: I mean...
(0:08:12) Kev: Yeah...
(0:08:14) Kev: Yeah, I know.
(0:08:16) Kev: Completely novel idea.
(0:08:18) Kev: But yeah, they've done that finally.
(0:08:22) Kev: And the worst part is it's a pretty decent card.
(0:08:24) Kev: So...
(0:08:26) Kev: The Fantastic Four, all the new versions that will come out.
(0:08:30) Kev: A lot of them revolve around this...
(0:08:32) Kev: It's a mechanic that's existed since the start of the game,
(0:08:36) Kev: They, they kind of labeled it.
(0:08:38) Kev: End of turn.
(0:08:39) Kev: Um, it's just an ability that activates at the end of turn.
(0:08:43) Kev: Um, for like, right.
(0:08:44) Kev: So like Mr.
(0:08:45) Kev: Fantastic, he gives like a card in your hand, like a plus one power or something.
(0:08:49) Kev: End of turn.
(0:08:49) Kev: Right.
(0:08:50) Kev: And then some of the other fantastic four members, um, they all have.
(0:08:50) Al: That's different, because that's not what Mr. Fantastic was before.
(0:08:55) Kev: No, right.
(0:08:56) Kev: He was an ongoing, he boosted other ones, but yeah, this new version
(0:08:58) Al: Yeah.
(0:08:59) Kev: just boost cards in your hand.
(0:09:01) Kev: Um, I'm trying to remember, but there were cards that had this kind
(0:09:04) Kev: of ability at the beginning.
(0:09:06) Kev: Um, like sunspot, sunspot.
(0:09:08) Kev: One right end of turn he would gain a power right um so
(0:09:08) Al: Yes, yep.
(0:09:12) Kev: So it's basically that idea, but they just like okay. We make an official label now
(0:09:17) Al: Yeah, because I think they were just like random things it was just like it would say
(0:09:21) Kev: Yeah
(0:09:22) Al: in the description what it happened because I think the other there was I guess you know
(0:09:23) Kev: Right
(0:09:26) Al: Red Hulk was another one that would do that it would it would give you it would gain power
(0:09:27) Kev: Yeah exactly exactly
(0:09:32) Al: based on what you didn't use I think I can't remember or the opponent used yeah yeah otherwise
(0:09:33) Kev: Or what the opponent like if they didn't use the other energy yeah
(0:09:38) Kev: Yeah, but exactly right there were a handful of cards that did that but they they and this was I don't know a couple months
(0:09:43) Kev: ago they they codified that well this season they're pushing that like all the think three of the four
(0:09:49) Kev: Have or at least three of the four have end of turn abilities and the super premium card
(0:09:57) Kev: Is the fantastic car?
(0:09:59) Kev: And the fantastic car gives a boost to end of turn cards, so it works in this whole
(0:10:06) Kev: Fantastic.
(0:10:08) Kev: That's a decent card and it looks fun and cool, but it's behind this extra paywall.
(0:10:16) Kev: So, that's got people riled up, unhappy, myself included.
(0:10:16) Al: Mm-hmm. Not great
(0:10:22) Kev: So, and again, the worst...
(0:10:24) Al: Side note...
(0:10:26) Kev: I'm sorry.
(0:10:27) Al: Side note, there's... you say it's the fantastic art.
(0:10:30) Al: Have they done non-living beings before?
(0:10:34) Kev: Uh, well, I mean not counting robots. Um, no, I don't think so. Like that's the first like vehicle sort of thing
(0:10:40) Al: Yeah, because they've done like, obviously, like, they've done like ego and they've like,
(0:10:41) Kev: No, I think yeah
(0:10:45) Al: they've done like other celestial beings and stuff like that, but like,
(0:10:47) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:10:49) Al: yeah, and you write robots and stuff, but I don't like,
(0:10:51) Kev: Don't sentient beings
(0:10:52) Al: the fantastic car doesn't even like, pretend to be sentient.
(0:10:56) Kev: No, no, it is just a car right it's just a vehicle
(0:10:58) Al: Yeah, it's literally a car.
(0:10:59) Kev: Yeah, that one that flies but still
(0:11:02) Al: They're running out of people already, is that the problem?
(0:11:03) Kev: Yeah, no
(0:11:05) Kev: I
(0:11:07) Kev: Don't think they're running out because Marvel has a lot of dumb characters, but you know the the ones people get excited about maybe they're
(0:11:17) Kev: They've been going a little fast
(0:11:20) Kev: They did actually a while back they introduced a new card called skills
(0:11:26) Kev: Which are not not characters. They're just like so
(0:11:30) Kev: The a lot of the dr. Strange spells were called
(0:11:34) Kev: skills they introduce some magician type characters who generated skills in your in and
(0:11:41) Kev: Skills they when you play them, they just disappear they they have a cost they they play them they have an ability and they disappear
(0:11:47) Al: Yeah.
(0:11:49) Kev: So they don't stay and generate power on your board or whatever
(0:11:53) Kev: And so they introduced that so that that was kind of like their first really like okay, we're introducing some new cards that aren't just characters
(0:12:01) Kev: But yes the fantastic cars for it as I can tell
(0:12:04) Kev: It's like the first one that's like a piece of equipment or or vehicle or whatever
(0:12:05) Al: I, I just remembered, I just remembered Thanos gives you the Infinity Stones.
(0:12:09) Kev: Yeah, oh
(0:12:11) Kev: Yeah, there you go. Yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, that's just true those aren't characters. Yeah
(0:12:14) Al: It was not the first, and I don't need people telling me, "Oh, technically the
(0:12:18) Al: Infinity Stones have a consciousness."
(0:12:25) Kev: But yeah
(0:12:27) Kev: So it's it's a wild time and the worst part is Marvel snap is still in my opinion good like the game is good though
(0:12:34) Kev: Cakes are still solid
(0:12:36) Kev: It's grown so much that you can kind of play whatever you deck want you want now
(0:12:42) Kev: I've said that a handful times and still true, right?
(0:12:44) Kev: But I said that because there there were errors of snap where we're they were dominated by certain archetype or a certain card or whatever
(0:12:44) Al: Mm-hmm Oh
(0:12:49) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:12:52) Kev: Right, we don't see that as much now. There are no real problem
(0:12:57) Kev: children
(0:12:59) Kev: But but maybe because of that I don't know but they're
(0:13:04) Kev: They're pushing harder for the pay to win like give us money
(0:13:08) Kev: So that kind of sucks especially because again, I like the game. It's still enjoyable in my opinion
(0:13:13) Kev: The games are still six turns. They're fast. They're there because he can play lots of different types and and and archetypes and it's fun
(0:13:23) Kev: But so yeah, I will keep playing until like I don't know what we'll see i'm the frog in the boiling pot and all that
(0:13:29) Kev: we'll see
(0:13:32) Kev: But other than that, the other...
(0:13:34) Kev: A big card game I've been playing.
(0:13:42) Kev: Marvel Rivals Season 3. I need to do that in grey.
(0:13:45) Kev: I don't know if you saw it, but...
(0:13:47) Kev: Sorry, it's just so I thought.
(0:13:49) Kev: I'll report on that when I do play it.
(0:13:53) Kev: Magic the Gathering.
(0:13:56) Kev: I'm still playing the Arena, the online version.
(0:13:59) Kev: And Final Fantasy sets still going strong and all that.
(0:14:02) Kev: I tried drafting for the first time.
(0:14:04) Kev: Online, but it's still drafting.
(0:14:07) Al: Is that is that a built in feature of Arena?
(0:14:34) Kev: If you pick a card you want out of your pack and then you pass the cards to the next person and you know
(0:14:40) Kev: Everyone kind of swaps packs and everyone keeps selecting out of these different packs until you have a pile of your own cards from all
(0:14:47) Kev: These different packs
(0:14:49) Kev: and
(0:14:50) Kev: So it was always a novel idea. I never tried it before but I know something very weird about like, okay
(0:14:55) Kev: I have this pack. I don't want to share the cards. Why am I giving you my cards, but
(0:15:01) Kev: But it works out because after you know the
(0:15:04) Kev: packs are going around and rotated and all that like you have a deck that you
(0:15:10) Kev: know there's X number of packs and from that you've actually built the deck that
(0:15:14) Kev: kind of sort of works if you know what you're doing right and everyone's kind of
(0:15:18) Kev: on the same playing field because everyone's opening all these new packs
(0:15:21) Kev: nobody has any you know bringing in any existing cards or whatever so it's kind
(0:15:27) Kev: of a levelish playing field um bit of luck in there of course depending on
(0:15:31) Kev: what you open or whatnot.
(0:15:34) Kev: it's a fun novel idea. And so on Arena, the version I play, the actual drafting part
(0:15:43) Kev: is done with bots. You don't actually do it with the other players. So that's nice because
(0:15:48) Kev: you don't have to, you know, there's not a timer or anything, you know, you're just like,
(0:15:52) Kev: okay, here, I think about it, pick what I want. Or if you know, if you need to go step away,
(0:15:57) Kev: go to the bathroom, whatever you can, right, there's no pressure to actually finish the draft
(0:16:01) Kev: in X number of minutes or whatever.
(0:16:05) Kev: But then when you build your deck, then you go, uh, you play against actual other players who've done the similar, um, drafting process.
(0:16:12) Kev: Um, so, um, it, yeah, it's an awful experience.
(0:16:16) Kev: I think it's fun actually.
(0:16:18) Kev: Like I get it now with the appeal of the drafting.
(0:16:20) Kev: Um, and, uh, but yeah, it's, it's good.
(0:16:24) Kev: Final, the Final Fantasy cards was so good.
(0:16:25) Kev: I, I, I'm angry at how good they are.
(0:16:29) Kev: Um, the two, um, but I, at the very least I stayed clean.
(0:16:34) Kev: I haven't any money into magic for in a hot minute.
(0:16:38) Kev: Um, and at least not any for anything for Final Fantasy.
(0:16:42) Kev: So I feel good pounding myself on the back for that.
(0:16:44) Kev: I've stayed strong.
(0:16:45) Kev: Um, but yeah, other than that, um, nothing, nothing else.
(0:16:50) Kev: I can't, man.
(0:16:51) Kev: Oh man.
(0:16:51) Kev: Have you seen the master's costume, Pokemon masters, the costumes lately?
(0:16:56) Al: I've seen some of it.
(0:16:58) Al: I've not really kind of been paying too much attention.
(0:16:58) Kev: Did you see the, did you see the, the Larry, the vacation layer?
(0:17:04) Kev: Oh, okay.
(0:17:04) Kev: Hold on.
(0:17:05) Kev: All right.
(0:17:05) Kev: I'm going to make the usual slack exclusive thread.
(0:17:08) Kev: Um, um, but yeah, it's a, uh, uh, they gave Larry a, a, uh, Hawaiian, like a
(0:17:18) Kev: lowland themed, um, uh, vacation suit and masters.
(0:17:23) Kev: It's very funny.
(0:17:24) Kev: Um, uh, they also got summer Cynthia.
(0:17:28) Kev: So she's, I believe five or six variants of Cynthia now, because guess what?
(0:17:34) Kev: Popular.
(0:17:34) Kev: Did you know that Al?
(0:17:35) Kev: Did you know she's popular?
(0:17:36) Al: Hm hm hm, whaaat?
(0:17:37) Kev: Um, um, Skyla got a fun suit with jump off.
(0:17:43) Kev: Um, yeah, masters is good.
(0:17:45) Kev: The big, I haven't dropped money on it in a while, but I, I want those costumes.
(0:17:51) Kev: So yeah, I can say.
(0:17:52) Kev: So that's me all gotcha, all, all gambling, all card games.
(0:17:56) Kev: What about you?
(0:17:56) Kev: Al, what gotcha and gambling have you been up to lately?
(0:18:00) Al: Oh, just my usual Pokemon, right?
(0:18:02) Al: Although I've not put any money in since Go Fest.
(0:18:03) Kev: Yeah.
(0:18:05) Kev: I heard about that, that last episode, you got your training.
(0:18:06) Al: So, yeah.
(0:18:08) Kev: Gimme, gimme, gimme gold in the, in the, in the Dakota, get her weren't yet.
(0:18:13) Kev: I'm, I need to know, is she free?
(0:18:16) Kev: I need to know.
(0:18:19) Al: think so. I don't think so. No, what have I actually been playing? Let's see. I've been
(0:18:20) Kev: Yeah.
(0:18:26) Al: playing Tamagotchi Plaza and when I say playing, I played about half an hour and then searched
(0:18:31) Al: online to make sure I wasn't missing anything before I sold the game. More about that later
(0:18:36) Kev: Wow, that's fast.
(0:18:37) Al: on in the episode, but that's your, yeah it is. I have never, I've never stopped playing a game
(0:18:46) Al: that fast and not been like, "Ugh!"
(0:18:49) Al: This just isn't for me, and instead being like, "This is just a bad game."
(0:18:52) Kev: Oh I'm excited, I'm excited to hear about this later.
(0:19:00) Al: And I've also been playing some Land's Island, slowly, obviously, because if you've listened
(0:19:06) Al: to the previous episode, listener, you will know that I am not playing on my Steam Deck,
(0:19:11) Al: which is how I normally play games, Steam Deck or Switch 2, while watching TV with my wife.
(0:19:19) Al: So I've got to play it at my desk, and I don't like doing that, right? Who wants to be sitting at
(0:19:24) Al: your office desk playing games? So I've just been doing it for a couple of hours a week,
(0:19:26) Kev: Alright. I get it. It's undecided, but maybe. But hey, I mean, good for them, right? Yeah,
(0:19:31) Al: but I have been enjoying that, I think. I think I'm enjoying Land's Island, I think it's a fun game.
(0:19:42) Al: Yeah, I mean, I'm still annoyed about the controller support, but other than that,
(0:19:47) Al: I think I'm enjoying it.
(0:19:48) Kev: yeah. Yeah, that, that, I mean, that's, that's very fair. I'm with you on that boat. I want
(0:19:53) Kev: controllers for my games, by and large.
(0:19:56) Kev: I did not grow up a PC gamer so, um, you know, obviously I can do, you know, point
(0:20:02) Kev: and click or management type games.
(0:20:04) Kev: There's no problem on the mouse, but like the people who do shooters and stuff like
(0:20:07) Kev: that on the, the, on the mouse and keyboard, I don't get it.
(0:20:11) Kev: I can't, I can't, it's, it's beyond my poor comprehension.
(0:20:17) Kev: But hey, good for lens Island.
(0:20:18) Kev: Like that was a journey, but they got there.
(0:20:21) Kev: Um, they, they, yeah.
(0:20:23) Al: something like that. They got somewhere anyway. All right, I think that's it. I'm just kind
(0:20:27) Kev: They did stuff, they improved, they improved to some measure, I'm told.
(0:20:37) Al: of waiting for Donkey Kong, to be honest.
(0:20:38) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I don't blame you. It's like that game looks very good and shocker and yeah, yeah, I
(0:20:44) Al: Yeah. Soon.
(0:20:48) Kev: Wish he had more transformations. That's it's like the big thing. We've only seen three. Maybe there's more
(0:20:52) Al: Well, there might be more like surely they would have shown
(0:20:55) Kev: Yeah, well the question is
(0:20:58) Kev: Like what's a good number right like because you know, obviously
(0:21:02) Al: Yeah, like ten would be too many probably like that feels over
(0:21:06) Kev: Yeah, right
(0:21:09) Kev: And there's probably gonna be some super transformation for the final fight because that feels like a thing this they would do
(0:21:13) Al: Of course, of course.
(0:21:16) Kev: But like normally I'd say I know five is a good number not counting anything finale spectacle transformation
(0:21:23) Al: Well, let's see what happens, but I'd be surprised if they've shown us everything.
(0:21:28) Al: Let's put it that way. We'll see, but we will see.
(0:21:32) Al: All right, well, let's get into I Know What You Released last month.
(0:21:37) Al: A quiet month, apparently, June was. I don't know how I missed this out of the episode from
(0:21:42) Al: two weeks ago, which is when I was meant to do it, but apparently I did.
(0:21:46) Al: Just three games released. We got Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma.
(0:21:52) Al: I haven't played that.
(0:21:53) Al: We've got Lenz Island 1.0.
(0:21:55) Al: Obviously I've played that.
(0:21:56) Al: And we've got Tamagotchi Plaza.
(0:21:58) Al: Please do not play that.
(0:22:00) Kev: I've played none of these games one day. I'll play a room factory game. I would like to I
(0:22:08) Al: Yeah, I feel like I could-
(0:22:08) Kev: Mean
(0:22:10) Kev: Yeah, I mean it's it's story of seasons, but more anime juice up the anime they said
(0:22:16) Al: It's much, I would say it's much more like, it's a combat game that just happens to have
(0:22:21) Al: farming in it, rather than, especially now, I think you could probably argue in the four
(0:22:22) Kev: sure okay sure yeah yeah sure and you know what that makes sense like you're
(0:22:27) Al: and before days, that it was Harvest Moon with, with combat, but now I think it's definitely
(0:22:34) Al: focused the other way around.
(0:22:39) Kev: gonna do two series differentiate sure why not long as they have the cow all as
(0:22:42) Al: Yeah, yeah, different cow, but yeah, all right.
(0:22:45) Kev: well
(0:22:49) Kev: Wait, it's a different they don't use the story of Caesar's cow
(0:22:50) Al: Well, I don't think so.
(0:22:53) Kev: Oh, no, never mind. It's all it's almost don't care
(0:22:58) Al: Yeah, because they don't have standard animals in Unfactory.
(0:23:00) Al: They have like other animals.
(0:23:01) Al: So it's kind of like a lion cow, but you will love the name.
(0:23:04) Kev: Oh, huh, I'll check it out. Okay, I'll see a
(0:23:08) Al: It's called a buff-a-moo.
(0:23:11) Kev: buffer
(0:23:13) Kev: Let's see. So like a buffalo but a buffer. Okay. Oh
(0:23:19) Kev: Okay, that's oh wait no that is a while
(0:23:23) Kev: Mmm the design is kind of cute, but it also makes me think of the the girl dog from from
(0:23:30) Kev: Full metal alchemist. I don't like that
(0:23:32) Al: Well, there you go.
(0:23:38) Al: All right, we're going to get into some news and we are going to start off with Kevin's
(0:23:38) Kev: Okay, that's that's an interesting camera
(0:23:44) Al: favorite news.
(0:23:45) Al: Gaucho and the Grassland have announced that they're releasing on the 16th of July.
(0:23:51) Al: You may notice, Kevin, that is basically now.
(0:23:54) Al: When this episode comes out, it will be out.
(0:23:55) Kev: that is when this episode comes out I will be playing this game probably i'm assuming it has
(0:23:59) Al: Yeah.
(0:24:01) Kev: controller support that's that's the the uh kind of the line in the sand for me great well yeah
(0:24:04) Al: It says it has feel controller support, but I don't know whether I can trust that or not.
(0:24:12) Kev: you know that's a good point too but um yeah I don't know what can I say it's still the same like
(0:24:19) Kev: every trailer just continues to deliver the same promise you are being a cowboy that's it
(0:24:25) Kev: it and I like it's a fun yeah yeah the the the the art style is cute kind of that overcooked
(0:24:26) Al: Kevin was sold the moment he saw the first thing about being a cowboy, he was like "I'm sold,
(0:24:30) Al: I don't need to know anymore!"
(0:24:37) Kev: the looking art style um but yeah I get you get to yeah and I can see that you you get to lasso
(0:24:40) Al: It's doing a little bit of the Animal Crossing curved world as well.
(0:24:47) Kev: cows like that you know they knew that's the activity you want to do you throw you have your
(0:24:51) Kev: Europe, you're the last of the count, so they...
(0:24:55) Kev: I'm sold.
(0:24:56) Al: Yeah. I need to know how it feels. Right. Because the controls for that, it could either be interesting or just horrific and terrible to play. So it'll be interesting to see how that goes.
(0:25:08) Kev: uh you're right and it's gonna be a very delicate like thing to get right so we'll we'll see um
(0:25:17) Kev: tune in because I promise you you will find out on this show thoughts on about this game
(0:25:20) Al: It does have a demo.
(0:25:23) Kev: one form or another it does I won't play it i'm just going in blind i'm going all in
(0:25:30) Al: Next, we have Wandering Village. They have announced that they're exiting Early Access.
(0:25:38) Al: They're releasing their 1.0 this week on the 17th of July, one day after Gaut you on the
(0:25:44) Kev: That's right after. I only have one day if I want to play Cowboy if I want to do this. I will not do that.
(0:25:45) Al: grassland.
(0:25:53) Al: And that is going to Steam Switch, Xbox and PlayStation all on the same page.
(0:25:57) Kev: What a wild trailer because you have your huge dinosaur with the village or whatever on top
(0:26:02) Kev: in the trailer. Oh okay, I didn't know that. The art style is interesting because it's 3D but like
(0:26:03) Al: on onboo, I believe his name is.
(0:26:11) Kev: 2d characters and and like
(0:26:14) Kev: It's not octopath like
(0:26:16) Kev: It's a full like CG 3d looking world, but the characters look like flat paper. It's it's it's very interesting
(0:26:25) Kev: Dynamic the thing is bad. Just interesting. But yeah is you have that and then you have people with like
(0:26:32) Kev: Bane masks and then people
(0:26:36) Kev: Burning the whole village
(0:26:38) Kev: Forest for some reason. I don't know. There's a lot going on here. It is fascinating
(0:26:44) Kev: And coming out on all consoles and everything that's good good for them. That's that's impressive
(0:26:49) Al: Yep, continuing this week's releases,
(0:26:54) Al: we have Cottonville is releasing on the 17th of July.
(0:26:58) Kev: They're just making up for last month by everything out one week as they stay.
(0:27:03) Al: Everything on the same day.
(0:27:06) Al: This was originally a Kickstarter, but apparently the Kickstarter was banned.
(0:27:12) Al: And so now it's just, yeah, so goodness sake.
(0:27:12) Kev: B-band?
(0:27:16) Al: Let me let me read what it was.
(0:27:19) Al: There's a statement on it. Here we go.
(0:27:21) Al: This was back in the 15th.
(0:27:21) Kev: Oh goodness.
(0:27:23) Al: Dear Community, it says titled Kickstarter Update.
(0:27:29) Al: Dear Community, firstly, we would like to sincerely thank you for your incredible
(0:27:33) Al: support and participation in our first Kickstarter campaign.
(0:27:36) Al: It genuinely means the world to us.
(0:27:38) Al: Unfortunately, due to an oversight on our part, our Kickstarter campaign was
(0:27:43) Al: suspended for unintentionally breaching Kickstarter's guidelines.
(0:27:47) Al: As a result, all contributions have been fully remembered.
(0:27:49) Al: We are very grateful for the support gathered and to out show appreciation to all our backers
(0:28:14) Al: and we are working on the very best solution to how to reward your contributions.
(0:28:20) Al: Thank you again for your amazing support and interest in Cottonville. It truly means so
(0:28:22) Al: much to us. While this was our first experience with Kickstarter and it did not go as planned,
(0:28:27) Al: we've learned a lot. We're looking forward to future campaigns now armed with valuable.
(0:28:34) Kev: that didn't answer my question. Why? Were crimes committed at any point? Maybe. Unintentional
(0:28:40) Al: So I wonder, so it looks like what they did was they cancelled the Kickstarter and created
(0:28:43) Kev: crimes?
(0:28:52) Al: a new Kickstarter, and I'm wondering whether that's the rule they broke, like you can't
(0:28:58) Al: recreate a Kickstarter or something like that.
(0:29:00) Kev: Mm-hmm. I can see that that makes sense
(0:29:03) Kev: Yeah, I'm big. Why well, why would they do that in the first place? I don't know
(0:29:08) Al: Don't know, is this game a scam? I don't know.
(0:29:10) Kev: big
(0:29:14) Kev: That I mean there's the other fact that they are making the game without Kickstarter anymore
(0:29:20) Kev: That's the I did these are very weird flags. I don't know. They're red flags. They're just weird flags
(0:29:29) Al: >> They are definitely flags.
(0:29:31) Kev: Yeah, and the wildest part is it's for this game that
(0:29:38) Kev: Like isn't for me. It feels very Facebook
(0:29:42) Al: Oh, yeah, I hate the look of the game into it.
(0:29:42) Kev: like gamey
(0:29:45) Al: So it's from it's from the publisher Red Deer Games who have done such games
(0:29:51) Al: such as Sprout Valley, Garden Buddies.
(0:29:54) Kev: Monocats, I don't know any of you wait no in a Sprout Valley
(0:29:56) Al: And a bunch of other things that all definitely look like scam games.
(0:30:01) Kev: And is this money laundering very possibly you
(0:30:05) Al: I mean, Sprout Valley was a game and it was a fine game.
(0:30:10) Al: Garden Buddies, I'm pretty sure we didn't.
(0:30:12) Al: It's a publisher, not a developer, right?
(0:30:16) Kev: yeah look i'm the game dev people oh it's a public oh the publisher sure well okay exactly
(0:30:23) Kev: well exactly the more reason to believe it may be money laundering the devs are maybe legit and
(0:30:28) Al: Although, well, so this is where it gets interesting, is Cottonville is developed by the publisher.
(0:30:39) Al: I think it's their first game that they're developing, rather than publishing.
(0:30:40) Kev: you're right it is you're right um well that's um
(0:30:49) Kev: this is very strange and again if it were like a game that you know looked better you know that
(0:30:58) Kev: being that might be one thing but it looks so I don't know it just it just feels very weird
(0:31:08) Al: it does. It is very weird. It does have a demo. Will I play the demo? Who knows? We'll see.
(0:31:08) Kev: the way the characters are always looking at you.
(0:31:10) Kev: Straight up the camera, I don't like it.
(0:31:22) Al: Will I buy the game? Probably not, but I guess it depends how the demo goes, I guess. It's
(0:31:24) Kev: I also probably own that.
(0:31:29) Al: just, yeah, those animations are so weird. [sighs]
(0:31:32) Kev: Yeah
(0:31:33) Kev: it
(0:31:35) Kev: Comes out same day as wandering village, which noticeably feels much less possibly a scam
(0:31:42) Al: Well, that game's already out, it's just not out in 1.0.
(0:31:46) Al: All right, rounding out this week's releases,
(0:31:52) Al: Tiny Garden have announced their Summer Breeze content update
(0:31:57) Al: and cosmetic pack are releasing on the 17th of July.
(0:32:02) Kev: It's our I don't know. I gotta think of a barbenheimer equivalent cotton
(0:32:07) Kev: wandering garden, I don't know
(0:32:10) Al: Best bet is, I think it's the same week as Barbara Naimer happened.
(0:32:13) Kev: Really that's incredible
(0:32:13) Al: Yeah, because it was definitely July and I think it was this week.
(0:32:18) Kev: Yeah, my favorite thing about barbenheimer like I mean both movies are fine or whatever but people kind of under their breath were like
(0:32:23) Al: Two years ago.
(0:32:25) Kev: But barbie was a little bit better though
(0:32:27) Al: Oh, it absolutely was, yeah, I enjoyed Oppenheimer, but it was it was not as good a film.
(0:32:29) Kev: Yeah
(0:32:36) Al: But I look, I'm not saying it's a bad film, but I mean, Barbara.
(0:32:43) Al: It was my film of the year that year.
(0:32:44) Kev: I mean, the two lead roles kind of killed it in every aspect.
(0:32:52) Al: Yeah, yeah, 21st of July, it was I was right, it's the same week.
(0:33:00) Al: So this would be Gaucho Wandering Cotton Garden.
(0:33:07) Kev: yep there you go glad we found our episode title
(0:33:07) Al: Oh, OK, fine.
(0:33:11) Al: Yeah, new content pack DLC for Tiny Garden.
(0:33:18) Al: If you're enjoying that game, it was such a cheap game.
(0:33:21) Al: I suspect this will be paid.
(0:33:22) Al: It's DLC. It does look like it's paid DLC, so I mean, go support it. It's good.
(0:33:29) Kev: - Yeah, there you go.
(0:33:31) Kev: That's a cute idea of like, it's all cosmetics.
(0:33:36) Kev: Whole game is cosmetics, right?
(0:33:38) Kev: So like introducing these packs, that's a good idea.
(0:33:42) Kev: And it's like there's some,
(0:33:44) Kev: like you can grow palm trees and wait,
(0:33:47) Kev: no, there's new mechanics.
(0:33:48) Kev: Hold on, they're saying new mechanics.
(0:33:48) Al: So I think so if I if I understand it correctly, the new plants and new mechanics are a free
(0:33:49) Kev: Oh, oh music.
(0:33:55) Al: update and the cosmetics are the DLC.
(0:33:58) Kev: Uh, okay, that makes sense as it should be good for them
(0:34:02) Al: That is the correct way to do things, yes, I agree.
(0:34:04) Kev: Pokemon
(0:34:10) Kev: But good for them good for you tiny garden you little garden that
(0:34:15) Al: We also have an update for Disney Dreamlight Valley.
(0:34:19) Al: I feel like these are coming out all the time and also I care about them less and less.
(0:34:22) Kev: I mean it's yeah yeah that's that's good that's called diminishing returns and
(0:34:30) Kev: and that's what happens when you have Disney with a bajillion IPs and
(0:34:36) Kev: whatever and and the worst part is like I don't know I most of these don't feel
(0:34:43) Kev: like big story expansion I mean a lot of them are but I don't know just I look at
(0:34:50) Kev: other games like look at the mojo
(0:34:52) Kev: games right when the new contents there's big story chapters and stuff to
(0:34:57) Kev: do these I don't know maybe it's all because it's existing IPs like I don't
(0:35:05) Kev: know it just doesn't have the same hype around it maybe it's because it's too
(0:35:11) Kev: saccharine they can't they can't go crazy they can't have the chapter where
(0:35:16) Kev: or Scar eats Remy from Ratatouille.
(0:35:20) Al: I, yeah, I wonder if, because obviously they've done this thing where the DLCs have been split up,
(0:35:25) Al: so this update is called the storybook veil part two, the unwritten realm update.
(0:35:32) Kev: Okay. Okay, one name.
(0:35:38) Al: And I kind of feel like maybe it would be better if they just did all the DLC
(0:35:42) Al: for the storybook veil at once, right? Because we talked about this before, where I don't think I'd be
(0:35:50) Al: booting up Stardew every two months if there was a new update, but the way that he bundles it all
(0:35:54) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:35:56) Al: together in an update every two years or three years or whatever, means that I'm super excited,
(0:36:01) Al: because it's like, oh, it has been years since I've probably played the game, let's go in,
(0:36:05) Al: we've got loads of new content, I'm really excited for that. Whereas this is just constant, here's
(0:36:10) Al: new update. And I suspect they've probably got numbers to show that this keeps people invested,
(0:36:18) Al: Right. Like if we talk about.
(0:36:20) Al: I wouldn't want one big update every two years for that, but I don't know.
(0:36:25) Al: It's a difficult one, but I don't even play the game anymore.
(0:36:25) Kev: Uh-huh, well I mean, yeah I've never played the game so I'm just completely talking without
(0:36:30) Al: So who might it complete?
(0:36:36) Kev: any frame reference.
(0:36:38) Al: What that's not what we do
(0:36:44) Kev: So we say right after declaring cotton fields a scam without having touched it or planning
(0:36:48) Al: No, I did not, excuse me, I did not, I would like to clarify, as per my lawyers have just
(0:36:49) Kev: to.
(0:36:55) Al: told me to do, I, lol, I did not claim that the game was a scam. I asked whether it was
(0:37:03) Al: and felt, it said it felt a little scammy. That is all I'm saying. I, yep, that is very
(0:37:08) Kev: - Feel of a scam.
(0:37:12) Al: different to claiming it is a scam. It feels scammy, it's not the same thing.
(0:37:14) Kev: - True, true.
(0:37:16) Kev: Yeah, true.
(0:37:18) Al: This one has, so this update, what does this have? The final part of the story for
(0:37:26) Al: the storybook veil, which is Maleficent and Hades doing some stuff.
(0:37:32) Al: Who's the new characters? Is that Peter Pan?
(0:37:33) Kev: It's embedded, looks like it.
(0:37:37) Al: And who else is with Peter? Is that Aurora? No, not Aurora. What am I talking about? Who is that?
(0:37:44) Kev: Trying to see that is
(0:37:44) Al: I just saw the colour of dress.
(0:37:47) Kev: Wait, who is that? Is that a player character? That might be the player character. I don't think I recognize
(0:37:49) Al: Oh, that's the player character, that would make sense, right? And a monkey? Who's the monkey?
(0:37:53) Kev: Yeah, I know
(0:37:57) Al: I can't see, this image is so small.
(0:37:59) Kev: It is I'm trying to yeah, that's just a pet monkey
(0:38:03) Al: And for some reason, the patch notes don't mention characters other than Maleficent and Hades.
(0:38:09) Al: Like normally they list, I don't think so.
(0:38:09) Kev: Wasn't Peter Pan already added? Oh
(0:38:14) Kev: Okay, I don't know I don't know it says yeah there become pals with Peter Pan you're right yeah, I don't know that's just a pet monkey
(0:38:18) Al: Oh, here we go. No, I there is Aurora, right? So venture into the pages of a storybook to uncover Aurora in an enchanting dream style, in addition to her regular
(0:38:26) Kev: There's a guy who looks evil with wings. He looks cool. I don't know what else
(0:38:34) Kev: And that dog on Peter Pan
(0:38:36) Al: Anyway, whatever. There's an update. I don't think you need us to explain.
(0:38:42) Kev: There's Eric's dog - what's the best dog in Disney movies we should we should make it ranking
(0:38:50) Al: That sounds like a greenhouse episode. All right.
(0:38:53) Kev: Best pets for Disney
(0:38:56) Al: We have two more news updates. The first is Lens Island have released their post 1.0 roadmap.
(0:39:04) Kev: Mm-hmm is the bro map just say take the money and run I'd applaud somebody if they said that
(0:39:05) Al: So, first of all.
(0:39:06) Al: I mean, they had a Kickstarter that if they were going to take the money and run it would
(0:39:15) Al: have been back then.
(0:39:16) Al: So they say the rest of July will be post release bug fixing.
(0:39:21) Al: In August, there will be a community feedback update.
(0:39:22) Kev: Sure
(0:39:25) Al: I have community feedback.
(0:39:26) Al: Give us proper controller support.
(0:39:29) Kev: There's the the developer livestream you see you can yell at them in real time. Thank you
(0:39:34) Al: Also, silly question, is that not the whole point of early access,
(0:39:37) Al: is to get community feedback and update it based on that?
(0:39:39) Al: Like, why are you waiting until after 1.0 to do that?
(0:39:42) Al: Whatever.
(0:39:42) Kev: It's fine, it's fine
(0:39:44) Al: And then in December, they will be releasing a major content update.
(0:39:48) Al: No information on that.
(0:39:49) Al: Just there will be stuff and more coming in 2026.
(0:39:51) Kev: So I was about to say, so the roadmap is we're going to work on it, maybe.
(0:39:53) Al: So it's a pretty loose.
(0:39:58) Al: You know.
(0:40:01) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:40:03) Al: the update is.
(0:40:04) Al: We're going to bug fix, and then we're going to add some changes, and then we're going to
(0:40:08) Al: have a new new content. And it says December. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't this year.
(0:40:10) Kev: listen to people yeah yep we'll see I mean but they're gonna continue to
(0:40:23) Kev: support it which I mean every game does now because games or service did you
(0:40:28) Kev: know that out
(0:40:29) Al: Yes. And let me double check.
(0:40:32) Al: But I think this is, let me double check something.
(0:40:38) Al: And they do just seem to have.
(0:40:40) Al: So I am not aware of another game that they're working on just now or anything else.
(0:40:46) Al: I thought I was aware of one, but no, I think that's a different company.
(0:40:50) Al: So maybe they are just planning on continuing work on Lenz Island.
(0:40:55) Al: I I doubt that that is going to be continue to be.
(0:40:59) Al: And final piece of news, Kevin Stardew Valley is now the this Stardew Valley is now the
(0:41:05) Kev: >> Yeah, that's correct.
(0:41:18) Kev: Hmm, yeah, yeah this this one scares me
(0:41:27) Al: top-rated game on Steam.
(0:41:29) Al: Iso.
(0:41:29) Kev: That scares me
(0:41:35) Kev: Steam has a lot of games on it. I'll I
(0:41:39) Kev: Know there has to be I know there has to be a number one
(0:41:44) Kev: Like but it just feels so surreal that the game that
(0:41:49) Kev: Not that we care about per se but that is so close to us because of this podcast like
(0:41:55) Kev: That's the number one. That's wild to me
(0:41:58) Al: So have you don't click on the don't click on the link to the top 250.
(0:42:03) Al: Have you looked at it at all?
(0:42:04) Al: I want to check.
(0:42:04) Kev: No, I'm not.
(0:42:05) Al: OK, so let's do a little let's do a little game.
(0:42:08) Al: See how many of the top 10 Kevin can guess.
(0:42:11) Kev: Oh, there's a bajillion games on Steam.
(0:42:15) Kev: I don't know.
(0:42:17) Al: Think of games that people like.
(0:42:17) Kev: All right.
(0:42:18) Kev: OK, OK, Portal 2 is number two because that's the one that
(0:42:21) Al: So, yeah, so we know that we've got two already.
(0:42:21) Kev: got me dethroned.
(0:42:23) Al: We've got Stardium and got Portal 2, number one and number two.
(0:42:25) Kev: Oh, well, let's see.
(0:42:28) Kev: And here's part of the question, right?
(0:42:30) Kev: How is this calculated, right?
(0:42:32) Kev: Because if a game has 5.0 review
(0:42:34) Al: Yeah, so I suspect you have to get above a certain amount of, let's put it this way,
(0:42:35) Kev: But only has 100 reviews
(0:42:37) Kev: It's probably not hitting the top
(0:42:39) Kev: Even though if it is really good you know
(0:42:45) Al: I will give you a clue, every single one of the top 10 has over 100,000 volts. So it's
(0:42:51) Kev: Okay. Sure.
(0:42:52) Al: at least some kind of popular game. Nope, that is number 14.
(0:42:56) Kev: Sure. Okay. Like, uh, I know Baldur's gate three is up there.
(0:43:01) Kev: No, it's Baldur's gate three is really wow.
(0:43:04) Al: Yep, number 14 with 8.73. I will say it's very crowded at the top, right? So 8.73,
(0:43:08) Kev: Wow. I, wow. I'm, I'm.
(0:43:14) Al: compare that to Stardew at 1, 8.87, right? Like there's not a lot in it, they're all very close.
(0:43:21) Kev: I'm not gonna get a single guess here
(0:43:23) Al: I think you will keep going. I think you will get some wrong, but I think you'll get some right.
(0:43:27) Kev: Okay, see yeah cuz I mean like okay, I'm trying to think oh, this is hard right because a lot of games
(0:43:35) Kev: Are really good, but they're ports right like
(0:43:38) Kev: Spider-man is now on Steam if I recall right the spider-man 1/2 are they
(0:43:42) Al: Definitely not up there. It was not it was not a very well-received port because it was very bad.
(0:43:48) Kev: Yeah, that's true I forgot about that right
(0:43:48) Al: I don't I can't even see them in the list. Let's see where we've got Spider-Man.
(0:43:51) Kev: Like uh see this is the thing
(0:43:53) Al: The first Spider-Man is 140 and Spider-Man 2 is not.
(0:43:58) Kev: Great that's fantastic see this is the thing like I have to think about I don't think about steam as much as
(0:44:07) Al: Would you like some clues?
(0:44:09) Al: I can give you some.
(0:44:10) Kev: Is one of them Stanley parable
(0:44:10) Al: They all.
(0:44:12) Al: It is not there.
(0:44:14) Kev: God yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't know this is oh
(0:44:17) Al: Let me let me give you a clue.
(0:44:19) Al: Let me give you a clue by giving you genres.
(0:44:19) Kev: Okay, okay.
(0:44:22) Al: So we have what number three, the genre is open world survival craft.
(0:44:28) Kev: Oh my goodness. Oh god. Is it power? No!
(0:44:32) Al: No, it is not power world.
(0:44:33) Kev: I'm kidding. I know it's not power.
(0:44:35) Kev: What is it?
(0:44:38) Kev: Did, oh, what is the name?
(0:44:40) Al: Our world is 241.
(0:44:41) Kev: Is Umamusume pretty derby? Did it skyrocket to the top?
(0:44:47) Kev: Do you know what I'm talking about, Al?
(0:44:48) Al: I have no idea what you're talking about.
(0:44:52) Kev: Okay, oh man, I'm happy.
(0:44:54) Kev: Dale is going to be thrilled. I brought it up on the podcast. Okay.
(0:44:57) Al: Right, let's stick to this. Open world survival craft, think of a game, a very popular game,
(0:44:58) Kev: I'm okay. I'll bring it up. Fine. Fine. That is no, cause that's not on steam. Um, hug.
(0:45:05) Al: that people like. What was that? Just say it. It was not Minecraft, no. I was tempted
(0:45:11) Kev: See, no, cause Minecraft's not on steam. Yeah. Yeah. No. Cause Minecraft's not on steam.
(0:45:18) Al: to say it's open world survival craft, but not that one, thinking you were going to think
(0:45:22) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. No.
(0:45:23) Al: Minecraft initially. It is not correct, but it's not Minecraft, but it is.
(0:45:26) Kev: Is it?
(0:45:28) Kev: AHHH! Is it um, oh gosh, I just I'm not a steam person. I don't know these as well. Um, I what is? Oh my gosh. What is?
(0:45:37) Kev: What is this?
(0:45:38) Kev: What is that one horror-y game?
(0:45:42) Kev: The four or something like that? I don't remember. Just tell me. I don't know. You're gonna fail all these out.
(0:45:44) Al: No, no, what? I don't understand. It's not Minecraft. It is 2D.
(0:45:50) Kev: Oh wait. Oh
(0:45:52) Al: Come on! Terraria number three! There we go!
(0:45:52) Kev: Terraria! Oh my gosh. Terraria. Oh duh. Wow, I'm stupid. Yeah.
(0:45:58) Kev: Terraria, duh. How did I not think that? Yeah. Wow.
(0:45:59) Al: You will not get number four. I have never heard of this game. People Playground?
(0:46:04) Kev: Well, I don't know what that is. Um, okay, okay.
(0:46:07) Al: Neither do I. It's a sandbox game, apparently. Number five. Zombies.
(0:46:13) Kev: It's not it's not art. It's not gonna be an RE game. It's
(0:46:15) Al: No, but not far off. You're kind of in the right game's circle.
(0:46:18) Kev: No, it's I mean
(0:46:26) Kev: I mean is it dead by I mean I don't dead by daylight is more than zombies but um
(0:46:30) Al: It is not. It is not. You might have one word, right?
(0:46:34) Kev: uh dead uh dead uh oh my gosh I what is the name of that one I oh my goodness dead
(0:46:41) Al: I think you've got it. I think you've nearly got there.
(0:46:44) Kev: oh what is the name of that game um uh yeah no i'm i'm at a loss here I have a game on the tip
(0:46:51) Kev: by tongue, but I cannot remember the name of it for the love of my life. Tell me.
(0:46:54) Al: with an L. No, it has dead in the title, come on. Left for dead too.
(0:46:56) Kev: Last of us?
(0:46:58) Kev: I don't know.
(0:47:06) Kev: Geez, I'm turning in my gamer card. I don't
(0:47:08) Al: It's all right, you're gonna get the next two, I believe in you, you can get the next two. So,
(0:47:11) Kev: Okay, okay, okay
(0:47:13) Al: we've got action roguelike, number seven, number six, another action roguelike.
(0:47:15) Kev: Hades
(0:47:18) Kev: No, oh
(0:47:21) Kev: Celeste has to be somewhere on this list. Oh no
(0:47:23) Al: No, no, no, no.
(0:47:25) Al: Let me see where Celeste is 46.
(0:47:28) Kev: No, oh my gosh, wait is room world's a thing. I don't know what room world is, but that's a big one
(0:47:34) Al: remote 12 remote 12 it is colony sim not action roguelike how do I give this one away with how do I give you a clue of this one but without giving it away.
(0:47:36) Kev: Okay, I've been the ballpark
(0:47:44) Kev: Action rogue like um, it's not Hades
(0:47:45) Al: action roguelike released a few years ago absolutely terrible looking game but people absolutely love it for some reason.
(0:47:53) Kev: Oh, that's not helping.
(0:47:58) Kev: No, I get it, what does it tell me?
(0:48:00) Al: Vampire survivors.
(0:48:01) Kev: Oh my gosh!
(0:48:02) Kev: I didn't realize Vampire Survivors was that big!
(0:48:05) Al: Yeah.
(0:48:05) Kev: Yo, good for you, Vampire Survivors.
(0:48:07) Al: Eight point seven nine, not far off the top five.
(0:48:12) Al: OK, you got seven Hades.
(0:48:13) Al: Number eight, driving.
(0:48:16) Kev: Oh my... is it a... is Forza on... on... on there? No, okay.
(0:48:18) Al: No.
(0:48:20) Al: Nope, don't think that exciting.
(0:48:22) Kev: Nah.
(0:48:24) Kev: Are we... a truck simulator?
(0:48:26) Al: Yeah, which one?
(0:48:27) Kev: I don't know which one... Euro truck simulator... I don't know that... that world.
(0:48:30) Al: Yeah, Euro Truck Simulator 2.
(0:48:32) Kev: There you go, jeez.
(0:48:34) Kev: She's... she's... incomprehensible to me.
(0:48:34) Al: Number nine, number nine is Schedule One.
(0:48:38) Kev: Yeah.
(0:48:40) Al: I've never heard of this, but it's apparently an EA game.
(0:48:41) Kev: I...
(0:48:43) Kev: I don't know... I don't know...
(0:48:45) Al: I don't know what this game is, but apparently it's number nine.
(0:48:48) Al: Number 10, the sequel is also on the list to this game.
(0:48:53) Al: The sequel to this game is also on the list.
(0:48:55) Kev: I have no idea. There's could be so many games it though. Oh
(0:49:00) Al: No, no, in the top ten, the sequels on the top ten.
(0:49:03) Kev: Left 4 Dead whatever, whatever sequel Left 4 Dead has
(0:49:05) Al: Think about what games are on the list
(0:49:08) Al: and which one had an also very successful first game.
(0:49:09) Kev: Okay, it's not
(0:49:12) Kev: Okay, these two is not out yeah, I don't believe that's on the top 10. Oh, it's the first one. Oh portal. Oh
(0:49:15) Al: No, this is the first game.
(0:49:19) Al: Portal, there we go.
(0:49:22) Al: Oh, I'll give you the next ten just because I'm not going to make you guess
(0:49:26) Al: anymore, but the next ten is quite interesting.
(0:49:26) Kev: Yes, yes.
(0:49:28) Al: So, I live in his Garys mod.
(0:49:28) Kev: Sparrowsall.
(0:49:30) Kev: I don't know what that is.
(0:49:30) Al: You know what Garys mod is? It is a physics sandbox. I think it started out as a mod to,
(0:49:40) Al: I want to say Team Fortress, maybe? But it ended up being like a standalone physics game. Let me
(0:49:50) Kev: it's team fortress I already see that's a that's team fortress person yep yeah I
(0:49:55) Kev: don't know what this is but that's a team fortress mod in there I do I don't
(0:50:00) Kev: know what I am looking at this looks like whatever the game
(0:50:03) Al: He doesn't have Half-Life 2. It was originally Half-Life 2 mod. There you go.
(0:50:07) Kev: okay oh okay sure
(0:50:09) Al: Alright, so 11 is Garry's Mod, 12 is Rimworld, 13 is Blackmyth Wukong, 14 is Baldur's Gate,
(0:50:16) Al: 3, 15 is Lethal Company. 16 is one I was expecting you to guess for the top 10, and that's Bilateral.
(0:50:22) Kev: Oh, I it's oh my god. I forget that started on Steam. It's just so ingrained is mobile in my brain
(0:50:28) Al: It is a very good mobile game. I think it's better on mobile. 17 is BIMMG.DRIVE. I have
(0:50:28) Kev: I don't consider it anywhere else
(0:50:33) Kev: Yeah, absolutely
(0:50:41) Al: never heard of that game before. 18 is Half-Life 2. 19 is the binding of Isaac Rebirth. And
(0:50:48) Al: 20 is Bloons TD6, a tarot defense game.
(0:50:52) Kev: Do what oh, I like tired of events. I don't know if it is but okay
(0:50:58) Al: Anyway, there you go. So that's the top 20 steam games. Sargeu number one.
(0:51:04) Kev: That's great
(0:51:06) Kev: That's that's what a wild variety there and again even more wild to me that it started as their past and again, it's not
(0:51:15) Kev: It's not any I'm not trying to
(0:51:18) Kev: Give a slight to stardew or anything stardew is an incredible game. Don't get me wrong, but it just
(0:51:22) Kev: feels weird that other people like the game that I like. That's the ultimate thing.
(0:51:26) Al: Let's I think it's is it is it fair to say that no matter what the top rated game is you'd probably be surprised
(0:51:34) Al: just because something has to be top but
(0:51:37) Kev: Like I said, I don't know Steam as well, so this is why it's hard for me, but let's just say, if we talk about the Switch, I don't know what number one is, but if they said it was "Tears of the King" that was number one, no, that wouldn't surprise me.
(0:51:38) Al: What are the chances that it was going to be that top that one?
(0:51:56) Kev: _Laughing_ Some games are, that should be a number one game. And Stardew, like, I'm not surprised, it's top ten anymore.
(0:51:58) Al: Well, I don't know what to tell you.
(0:52:07) Kev: It's even top five! It's number one, wow, that's impressive.
(0:52:12) Al: All right, I've put it off long enough. Let's talk about Tamagotchi Plaza.
(0:52:17) Kev: Don't play it we're done
(0:52:19) Al: I mean, pretty much, right? I have written five bullet points for this game.
(0:52:24) Kev: Okay first, what is the game?
(0:52:26) Al: It's Tamagotchi Plaza. No, the first bullet point is this will not be a long section.
(0:52:34) Al: The second bullet point is please do not buy this game. There are games,
(0:52:40) Al: There are good games.
(0:52:42) Al: There are OK games, there are bad games, and then there's whatever on earth this is.
(0:52:49) Al: This is barely a game, and that's not in a "oh, it doesn't really have much, I don't
(0:52:55) Al: think it's a real game".
(0:52:56) Al: This is a, I don't know what, this is so hard to explain how bad this is, but basically
(0:53:06) Al: it is a bunch of, in my bullet point I said it's a bunch of boring minigames.
(0:53:12) Al: That's not quite true, it is a bunch of a single boring minigame, with no real interaction
(0:53:19) Al: other than pressing one button to continue the game, but it's the same game in various
(0:53:25) Al: different skins basically, inside a really tiny open world.
(0:53:32) Al: There is nothing to do, there is nobody to talk to, there are these weird minigames that
(0:53:38) Al: is. Oh, we need to give this person the ice cream.
(0:53:42) Al: Press A to give the ice cream.
(0:53:44) Al: And then you press the A and they get the ice cream and you go,
(0:53:46) Kev: What?
(0:53:48) Al: yay, we gave the ice cream.
(0:53:51) Al: And it is this is not even a kid's game, right?
(0:53:55) Al: There are some games where you're like, take the Bluey game.
(0:53:57) Al: The Bluey game, it is not a particularly complicated game.
(0:54:00) Al: It is not a particularly interesting game.
(0:54:03) Al: It took my six year old all of about two hours to finish the game.
(0:54:07) Al: But he had fun with it.
(0:54:09) Al: This is nothing.
(0:54:12) Al: There is nothing, I guess maybe if for some reason you want to control a Tamagotchi character
(0:54:21) Al: walking around an open world and jumping, then maybe this is something you could look at, but
(0:54:28) Al: it's not even worth it for that. There is nothing to do in the world. There is this world that is
(0:54:34) Al: like a town hall, not a town hall, like a town square, and there are buildings around. You go
(0:54:40) Al: into a building you are.
(0:54:42) Al: It's not a minigame like so you've got minigames in like Mario Party where it's like, oh, you need to do this thing like you need me need to like do this thing really quick or you need to do this not fall off this thing blah blah blah and then you have warrior wear micro games which are a step down but they're kind of fun because it's like you've got like 10 seconds to figure out what to do and do it.
(0:54:58) Kev: Yeah, yep, yep.
(0:55:08) Kev: Right, reaction, yeah, react, go, go, go, uh-huh.
(0:55:10) Al: And then you've got like another step down from that.
(0:55:12) Al: Which would be like, "Oh, I guess there's some sort of gameplay in this,
(0:55:16) Al: but I'm not really sure what I'm doing and it's not particularly fun."
(0:55:19) Al: And then you've got these underneath, still underneath that.
(0:55:24) Kev: This is wild.
(0:55:25) Al: You've got these minigames, which are again the same gameplay for every single minigame.
(0:55:33) Al: Basically press A to continue the game and you don't even get any interesting story or
(0:55:42) Al: thing from it. It's like, here's this infinite line of characters that you can give a thing to.
(0:55:47) Al: That is the game. That's it. There is literally nothing else to this game.
(0:55:52) Kev: That's, okay, that's wild because it's Tamagotchi, right?
(0:55:59) Kev: Like, so let's look at the base, the source material, right?
(0:56:03) Kev: If, let's say you had to do these questionable activities,
(0:56:09) Kev: let's not even call them games,
(0:56:11) Kev: but you were raising a Tamagotchi, you know,
(0:56:14) Kev: helping it grow up or whatever.
(0:56:16) Kev: You know, that might be a thing,
(0:56:17) Kev: but you're, sounds like you're not even doing that.
(0:56:19) Kev: - Sounds like just a menu and then--
(0:56:22) Kev: - Weird activities to do.
(0:56:24) Kev: This is very strange.
(0:56:27) Kev: It's Tomagotcha, this is a big brand.
(0:56:29) Kev: How are they screwing this up?
(0:56:30) Al: It is absolutely fascinating. I do not understand how this happened. This is at $35.
(0:56:34) Kev: How much?
(0:56:39) Kev: Holy moly, not even 20.
(0:56:43) Kev: Wow.
(0:56:44) Al: In fact, no, sorry, sorry, that's Â£35. It is $40. $40 for this, whatever this is. It's like a
(0:56:49) Kev: Wow.
(0:56:54) Al: jumping simulator for models, Tamagotchi models. That's all it is. That's the only thing that is
(0:57:02) Kev: That is insanity! There... oh my goodness.
(0:57:10) Al: If you want to see a bunch of Tamagotchi 3D models, and see them say a bunch of stock
(0:57:18) Al: answers as you press a button, buy this game. If you don't, and that should be all of you,
(0:57:25) Al: do not buy this game. I was so excited with the idea of like an Animal Crossing, but Tamagotchi,
(0:57:31) Al: or you know, because we also got Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and that just like raised the
(0:57:40) Al: things, and I was so excited for something like that. This is, no, this is not. I played,
(0:57:46) Al: half an hour would even be generous. I played 15 minutes of this game, I played three different
(0:57:52) Al: minigames, and I went, what is this? And I googled to see if I was missing anything,
(0:57:57) Al: and I was not missing anything. And I went, how have I seen this entire game in 15 minutes,
(0:58:03) Al: and it's terrible. I don't, like, they've put all of the work into making the models,
(0:58:10) Al: for like, there's like 100 characters in this game, and none of them do anything.
(0:58:14) Kev: yeah okay i'm that's so i'm i'm just i'm reading and watching some videos right now
(0:58:21) Kev: first of all I see your mistake would you play this on
(0:58:24) Al: It's only on the Switch. Switch 2, sorry.
(0:58:28) Kev: oh it's oh really okay okay the switch 2 version has more mini games apparently
(0:58:30) Al: It's Switch and Switch 2, I think, yeah. But there is a Switch 2 version, I'm pretty sure.
(0:58:37) Al: Oh, does it? I missed that.
(0:58:38) Kev: okay i'm looking okay how many of these mini games are there first of all
(0:58:43) Al: I don't even know, right? Like, it's maybe like 10?
(0:58:49) Kev: I'm seeing... because I'm looking... I just look at this... quickly see me over
(0:58:57) Kev: this video. Looks like there's a decent amount, but that doesn't mean they're fun
(0:59:02) Kev: or anything, but there's like a rhythm game. That's something. Okay...
(0:59:04) Al: Yes, as far as I'm looking at a list here and I'm seeing 10.
(0:59:12) Al: Again, just pressing A. I mean, granted, I will accept that that is a little bit more interesting than just pressing A to continue it.
(0:59:19) Al: But it's not like they're not.
(0:59:19) Kev: Yeah, you're right, you're right.
(0:59:22) Al: I think that literally any other game with minigames is more fun than this.
(0:59:27) Al: Like these are just bizarrely on.
(0:59:28) Kev: Sure, sure
(0:59:32) Kev: Yeah, that's
(0:59:34) Kev: Well, even if it's 10, right? You know, it's a little higher. Let's just say 15. That's not enough if that's the whole thing
(0:59:40) Kev: That's the wild part cuz
(0:59:41) Al: - Oh, I just saw a trailer which said it's 15.
(0:59:44) Kev: No, oh that might be the switch to version I don't know either like either way
(0:59:48) Kev: It's it's not enough because you're not Animal Crossing. You're not building. You don't have a house. You're not decorating
(0:59:53) Al: No.
(0:59:55) Al: No.
(0:59:55) Kev: right, you're you're
(0:59:57) Al: It is just the minigames.
(0:59:58) Kev: I think I read I think you're great
(0:59:59) Al: I was maybe being a little bit harsh on the minigames.
(1:00:01) Al: It does look like some of the ones I didn't play are a little bit more.
(1:00:04) Al: But it's like sorting and stuff like that.
(1:00:05) Kev: Uh-huh
(1:00:07) Al: It's like, oh, give the right sushi to this person.
(1:00:07) Kev: Yeah
(1:00:09) Al: OK, fine, whatever.
(1:00:11) Al: Like, they're still not, like, the interaction with them is not fun.
(1:00:16) Al: They're just like infinite minigames.
(1:00:18) Al: There's no winning or losing.
(1:00:20) Al: doing a thing and then it either happens.
(1:00:22) Kev: yeah it's yeah right like it's um because okay i'm just reading some stuff off the
(1:00:29) Kev: interwebs here like okay you can upgrade your town but that's all it doesn't get any specifics
(1:00:35) Al: Yeah, I think that's just to unlock more shops like as you play them you get more of the shops
(1:00:40) Al: There's nothing else there is nothing else to unlock. It's just the shops
(1:00:45) Kev: hmm and what do you buy in the shops oh oh you unlock more oh oh I see oh no oh no I thought that
(1:00:48) Al: No, no the shops in the minigame
(1:00:55) Al: No, so you play, you play the mini games, which are so basically, I'll give you a look.
(1:00:56) Kev: was something better
(1:01:02) Al: There is a little bit more kind of background to the try and explain away what's happening,
(1:01:07) Al: right?
(1:01:08) Al: So you are this nameless faceless creature that comes to this Tamagotchi Plaza, and you're
(1:01:13) Al: then presented with some Tamagotchi, and you get to choose one that is your character who
(1:01:18) Al: you are controlling, but it's not you, you're like, you're meant to be going around the
(1:01:22) Al: the tone with them.
(1:01:24) Kev: - Okay. - Okay.
(1:01:26) Al: They take you into one of the shops, and you go, "Oh, we need to run the shop."
(1:01:31) Al: And so we're running the shop, and we're giving things to people.
(1:01:34) Al: But again, that one in particular is just, literally, just press A to do, right?
(1:01:40) Al: There's no sorting, or moving, or anything, right?
(1:01:41) Kev: Yeah.
(1:01:44) Al: There's one that's like a decorating one, I think,
(1:01:46) Kev: That's.
(1:01:46) Al: and there's one that's like, "You have to give the right sushi to people, but whatever."
(1:01:47) Kev: Huh.
(1:01:50) Al: And yeah, you do this, and again, it is just this infinite line of characters that come in.
(1:01:55) Al: And I didn't see any scoring.
(1:01:57) Al: I didn't see any, like, end point, or you need to get to this thing.
(1:02:01) Kev: Yeah there's there's no there's no completion no no
(1:02:03) Al: I honestly don't understand.
(1:02:06) Al: The completion is unlocking at the 15 shops, I guess,
(1:02:10) Al: but they're all more minigames, more bad minigames.
(1:02:11) Kev: It's so strange like you can't even dress up your tamagotchis or anything like
(1:02:16) Al: No.
(1:02:17) Kev: That's oh my god that's so bizarre
(1:02:18) Al: The Tamagotchis are pre-made, and your character doesn't exist.
(1:02:23) Al: Yeah, there's none of that.
(1:02:25) Al: How you're setting up, or anything.
(1:02:26) Kev: no strange because I mean a minigame collection has to it has to kind of have a point right
(1:02:33) Al: 15 minigames is not enough for a minigame collection.
(1:02:36) Kev: no this
(1:02:36) Al: This is the thing, right?
(1:02:37) Al: A Mario Party will come out with 150 minigames.
(1:02:40) Kev: yeah like I think about it's like a modern day gaming watch collection
(1:02:42) Al: 15 is dreadful.
(1:02:47) Kev: except not the charm of a gaming watch
(1:02:47) Al: It's almost-- so it's almost pretty much, yeah.
(1:02:51) Al: Yeah, you're right.
(1:02:52) Al: It's almost like the thought, what
(1:02:54) Al: if we did a town-based game with minigames which
(1:02:57) Al: you use to unlock the town and build up and meet characters?
(1:03:00) Al: And then they went, OK, we've done
(1:03:03) Al: and they went, good, sounds good.
(1:03:05) Al: We're done.
(1:03:06) Al: Oh, but what about the fact that we want to create a community
(1:03:10) Al: and we want to expand our town?
(1:03:12) Al: Oh, well, make sure that you can only
(1:03:15) Al: access five of the minigames to start with.
(1:03:17) Al: OK, and are we going to have scoring and high scores?
(1:03:20) Al: And we're going to have like--
(1:03:22) Al: no, no, no, none of that.
(1:03:25) Al: The minigames are not particularly-- they aren't fun,
(1:03:30) Al: but I could see how they could have been the base.
(1:03:33) Al: To a bigger game a more interesting game, but they didn't do that that game doesn't exist.
(1:03:36) Kev: yeah yeah like it they don't so they don't have animal crossing us you know conversations and
(1:03:43) Al: There are there are conversations but it's very much like you know how you're disappointed by
(1:03:49) Al: new leaf to new horizons and the downgrade in conversations imagine that again to another level.
(1:03:50) Kev: Yes, uh-huh, right. Oh
(1:03:55) Kev: God
(1:03:56) Kev: Yeah, that's a thing right cuz I mean, okay
(1:04:00) Kev: Well, let's let's use this exact compares to animal crossing right? Let's just say animal crossing came out the mini game
(1:04:05) Kev: collection game
(1:04:07) Kev: But you still have your whole town that you can interact with that that still might have a little value, you know
(1:04:14) Kev: But that that's not here so
(1:04:14) Al: Again, I'm not against, like I love playing a Mario Party even if you're just playing
(1:04:18) Al: the minigames, because you know that if you come into it, you're going to get a randomly
(1:04:19) Kev: Yes
(1:04:23) Al: generated one, even if you spend like two hours playing the game, you're not going to
(1:04:26) Al: get the same game twice.
(1:04:28) Al: But there are 15 games here, and there's no scoring, there's no, like it's not PvP, there's
(1:04:34) Al: no like, oh you did better this time, there's just, I'm going to do the thing.
(1:04:38) Kev: Yep, what's the point?
(1:04:40) Kev: Yeah, what's the point that it doesn't like I'm trying I'm reading I'm looking at stuff, and I'm trying to find a
(1:04:44) Al: There's no gratification.
(1:04:50) Al: You're trying so hard to find something that I've missed, aren't you?
(1:04:51) Kev: point
(1:04:52) Kev: Yes, like what's the point of it all right like ah because we the mini-game. Yeah like
(1:04:59) Kev: Mario Party, I mean like the point
(1:05:02) Kev: You're having fun with friends designed for you know multiplayer and nonsense, and so it's a party
(1:05:08) Kev: Why are you aware? There's it's a bit of humor to it. It's it's the reaction
(1:05:14) Kev: But like what's what's the point here? Why are you doing the mini games?
(1:05:19) Al: There is apparently you can connect it to one of the Tamagotchi Unii,
(1:05:24) Al: which is like the more modern Tamagotchis. But even that, you connect it to the game,
(1:05:25) Kev: Uh-huh.
(1:05:32) Al: it shows you a cutscene and then it gives you a code for your Tamagotchi. There's it.
(1:05:38) Kev: Oh my gosh, this is wild.
(1:05:39) Al: There's no ongoing integration as far as I can.
(1:05:42) Kev: This is wild.
(1:05:44) Kev: Man, it's crazy how much Hello Kitty has curved on this.
(1:05:48) Al: They apparently have like a password thing where you can put in a password and get something
(1:05:54) Al: in the game.
(1:05:54) Al: They've released two of them.
(1:05:56) Al: One is "makes minty leaves appear in the air around town hall" and "changes music in game
(1:06:00) Kev: Oh yeah, now we're talking
(1:06:04) Al: to the first corner shops theme".
(1:06:06) Kev: Oh, yeah, who developed this this is wild
(1:06:12) Al: It is... so it looks like 12 in the Switch version and 15 in the Switch 2 version.
(1:06:18) Al: And the Switch 2 ones apparently...
(1:06:21) Al: I think I only got the Switch version of the game but the Switch 2 games are... they do
(1:06:26) Al: look like they're slightly more interactive and they use the mouse functionality for the
(1:06:30) Kev: - Uh-huh.
(1:06:32) Al: Joy-Con 2s.
(1:06:35) Al: So those... so that's the sushi shop, the shurik...
(1:06:39) Al: How do you say that?
(1:06:40) Al: Shuriken?
(1:06:40) Kev: Sure again, yep, sure again, uh-huh.
(1:06:41) Al: Shuriken?
(1:06:42) Al: Shuriken?
(1:06:43) Al: The shuriken shop.
(1:06:44) Al: Which by the way, very weird that you can buy ninja stars in a kid's game.
(1:06:48) Al: And you're gonna love this, a sushi shuriken shop.
(1:06:55) Kev: Oh, now we're talking.
(1:06:57) Al: Those are definitely the most interesting minigames, but even them it's like the shuriken
(1:07:03) Al: is you throw ninja stars at targets.
(1:07:05) Al: Okay, sure, fine.
(1:07:08) Al: As far as I can see there's still no scoring, it's just you you infinitely do it.
(1:07:15) Kev: That's wild.
(1:07:15) Al: And then there's the sushi, which is
(1:07:18) Al: choose the sushi, give it to a customer who's asking for it.
(1:07:23) Al: And again, as far as I can see, no scoring.
(1:07:26) Al: There's like one of them is like a decorating one and there's like a tooth
(1:07:31) Al: cleaning one, but they are like, click, click the right bit.
(1:07:37) Al: OK, still no scoring.
(1:07:39) Al: Just success or fail, and you can infinitely.
(1:07:44) Kev: crazy again what's you know like it's mini game right supposed to be a small
(1:07:51) Kev: part of a bigger experience what's the point oh my gosh that's insane that's
(1:07:52) Al: Yeah.
(1:07:58) Al: Eight years since the last Tamagotchi video game, and this is what we do.
(1:08:04) Kev: Ugh, I don't even know. How did this get greenlight? How'd they okay it? I, what a wild experience this is.
(1:08:18) Al: Yeah, I don't think there's anything else to say, and I now feel like we're just
(1:08:21) Al: beating it with a dead horse. So don't buy this game. Like, this is a terrible game.
(1:08:24) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(1:08:28) Al: There are so many better games to play. Just do not, please do not buy it. Like, I often am like,
(1:08:28) Kev: That's the worst part that price holy moly
(1:08:35) Al: you know, when people talk about like, you know, Scarlet and Violet, like all the terrible games,
(1:08:39) Al: and we keep buying them, we keep doing it. And I'm like, yeah, you know what, but it's fun.
(1:08:43) Al: whatever, I don't care, I enjoy it. But it's like, there's a level where you get, you know, this is...
(1:08:46) Kev: Yes.
(1:08:48) Al: just like, this is just irresponsible. This is the real money laundering.
(1:08:52) Kev: You know what, Cottonvale? I take it back.
(1:08:57) Kev: You're fine. You're fine. Yeah, this is the money launderer.
(1:09:02) Al: I just, I do wonder, I do wonder whether it was, they spent too much time modelling characters,
(1:09:09) Al: and then someone in Managers was like, we need to do something about this, we can't just keep not
(1:09:13) Al: Releasing this game and they went oh well. There's a game here kind of
(1:09:17) Kev: Mmm
(1:09:18) Al: and then they released it. Like if this had maybe double the number of minigames and you had
(1:09:20) Kev: That's wild and it's
(1:09:28) Al: some way of like customizing the town and the conversations were more interesting,
(1:09:32) Kev: yes yeah
(1:09:35) Al: maybe there's something there, maybe it's a fun little game but I'm still not going oh yes I need
(1:09:40) Kev: yeah like I i
(1:09:43) Al: to play that game.
(1:09:44) Kev: right right like I can see it very easily like exactly double the number that's 30 right 30 is
(1:09:51) Kev: a healthier number of mini games and you have a shop where you can buy outfits for your tomagotchis
(1:09:57) Kev: or unlock Tamagotchis to bring into your town or whatever, there's something
(1:10:02) Kev: there. There's an idea, right? Like there's a point to the mid-day games then, but
(1:10:06) Kev: it's not there! It doesn't exist! That's wild!
(1:10:10) Kev: Okay, here right now, we are literally writing fanfiction of what the game
(1:10:15) Kev: should be at this point. We're done.
(1:10:16) Al: I think I have had what I think we have had one game where I said it was bad before I
(1:10:22) Al: can't remember what game that was.
(1:10:24) Kev: Uh, there sure wasn't many.
(1:10:28) Al: There was only there was only one game that I said this is a bad game and I can't remember
(1:10:32) Al: what it was but this is the first where even that was like this is a bad game but you know
(1:10:38) Al: what fine if you enjoy it that's fine this is the first where I'm like no please I beg
(1:10:44) Al: of you. I beg you.
(1:10:46) Al: I do not buy this game. This is terrible.
(1:10:51) Kev: It's such a big I'm just the chocolate salt. That's all that's all this is gonna keep being to me in shock
(1:10:58) Al: All right, well thank you for joining me to talk about whatever this is.
(1:10:58) Kev: Okay, before we stop
(1:11:00) Kev: here
(1:11:01) Kev: Hold on. I'm gonna say I'm gonna save it by talking about
(1:11:06) Kev: Was it who my moose a pretty derby? Okay, so
(1:11:11) Kev: this I think I believe is an anime before but it just like just this past week or two ago a
(1:11:18) Kev: Game came out at least in the states. I think it's already been in Japan for a while
(1:11:22) Kev: Um, so the source anime are material. Okay. It's a horse racing anime
(1:11:31) Kev: But here's the thing out the horses are anime girls instead of little horse ear things
(1:11:40) Al: Oh, no, please no.
(1:11:41) Kev: Yeah
(1:11:43) Kev: But here's the catch it's super accurate
(1:11:45) Al: Don't know, do we need, do we need any more?
(1:11:48) Kev: It's super accurate all the characters are
(1:11:51) Kev: actual racing horses apparently the anime a lot of the races are super
(1:11:56) Kev: accurate down to like camera angles of real life horse races and so the game
(1:12:02) Kev: that came out is now a gotcha game where you pull for your horse racing girls and
(1:12:07) Kev: then you you race them or whatever I don't know it's it's it's huge Alex
(1:12:12) Kev: coming for that number one watch out stardew the anime horse girls are coming
(1:12:19) Kev: All right, that's it.
(1:12:21) Kev: This, I've saved it.
(1:12:22) Al: Yes, please, please.
(1:12:26) Al: All right, thank you, Kevin, for joining me for this summary execution.
(1:12:30) Kev: Whatever that was.
(1:12:35) Al: We have killed Tamagotchi.
(1:12:37) Kev: Thank you all for having me on.
(1:12:37) Al: Congratulations.
(1:12:39) Al: Where can people find you on the internet?
(1:12:39) Kev: No, they did.
(1:12:40) Kev: We're just, we're just in shock.
(1:12:46) Kev: People find me at Cooper is on whatever.
(1:12:49) Kev: I'm, I'm that's me.
(1:12:50) Kev: No one, no one else.
(1:12:51) Kev: steal my dumb name I promise you.
(1:12:53) Kev: It's a dumb name.
(1:12:54) Kev: I came up with 13.
(1:12:56) Kev: Um, yeah, find me wherever at the artist square.
(1:12:59) Kev: If you want, I don't make, I haven't made art in a long while.
(1:13:02) Kev: I should do that.
(1:13:03) Kev: I think I will do that.
(1:13:04) Kev: That's a good idea.
(1:13:05) Kev: Thanks.
(1:13:06) Al: Well, speaking of dumb names, you can find me at the scotbot.
(1:13:06) Kev: Um, but yeah, that's where you can find me.
(1:13:08) Kev: All right.
(1:13:08) Kev: Uh, where do people find you?
(1:13:14) Kev: At least that makes sense.
(1:13:15) Kev: You're Scott and you're a little, and you're, you know,
(1:13:19) Kev: fund yourself at the robotic part.
(1:13:21) Kev: Yeah.
(1:13:22) Al: Yeah, my name my name used to be Yamanic Kill, which is an anagram of my name, but was just so...
(1:13:26) Kev: Yeah.
(1:13:28) Kev: Yeah.
(1:13:30) Kev: Oh, it was an anagram.
(1:13:31) Kev: I never realized that wall.
(1:13:33) Kev: That Oh, I feel so dumb.
(1:13:35) Kev: That's, that's good.
(1:13:37) Kev: Anagrams are great.
(1:13:38) Al: the best bit is it's an anagram not of Al McKinley but of Ali McKinley because when I was like a
(1:13:39) Kev: Oh man.
(1:13:42) Kev: Yeah.
(1:13:44) Kev: Okay.
(1:13:45) Al: teenager people would call me Ali. I didn't particularly care but I go by Al now. Anyway
(1:13:46) Kev: Yeah.
(1:13:48) Kev: Okay.
(1:13:49) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(1:13:53) Al: you can find the podcast which is much more important on Tumblr and on Blue Sky at THSPod.
(1:13:59) Al: You can send us feedback from our website harvestseason.club where you can also find links
(1:14:04) Al: to everything to do with the podcast, including a link to our Patreon, Patreon.com.
(1:14:08) Al: We will have a break on the podcast. I'm hoping there's an episode next week, but we don't have
(1:14:19) Al: that planned just now, and I won't be able to record it. So I don't know whether that's happening
(1:14:23) Al: or not, but we'll see. Hoping there's an episode next week. No, I can't. I'm away already.
(1:14:24) Kev: Wait, you're not recording?
(1:14:27) Kev: Well, well, well, yeah, I mean if you want an episode one can happen, you know
(1:14:33) Al: Oh, goodness. Kevin just...
(1:14:34) Kev: You know this can happen. I
(1:14:38) Kev: could promise an episode
(1:14:38) Al: Kevin just talking about "Gaucho and the Grassland" for two hours.
(1:14:41) Kev: Yo
(1:14:48) Al: But when there will be at least a two-week break, possibly three weeks,
(1:14:53) Al: if Kevin doesn't make me let him do that episode. But in the two-week break, we will be having two
(1:15:01) Al: bonus greenhouse episodes about the Lord of the Rings. Cody did tell me how they'd split up those
(1:15:09) Al: episodes, but I can't remember what it was.
(1:15:14) Kev: Probably not
(1:15:17) Kev: I don't mean we're gonna tell look how the the shire gains the month of the shire. We're gonna have the
(1:15:23) Kev: the shire
(1:15:25) Kev: The tales of the shire will be discussed right and and and
(1:15:29) Kev: How it started off. I made the joke. Okay, we're just gonna do the month of the shire because you know
(1:15:32) Kev: We've done that gear years when al's off the wild man. We
(1:15:36) Kev: Do a themed month in advance or whatever and I joke. Okay, we'll do the month of the shire
(1:15:40) Kev: Let's talk about the movies and the other stuff and yada yada
(1:15:44) Kev: And it was I said it half jokingly
(1:15:48) Kev: But no one came up with a better idea. So that's what we're kind of doing it
(1:15:52) Al: It looks like one is Lord of the Rings and one is Hobbit.
(1:15:57) Kev: Oh, yeah, are you excited to talk about barrels cgi barrels? Yeah
(1:16:03) Al: and books. So it's not just about the films. Anyway, so those will be coming out on the
(1:16:11) Al: off weeks and then we will return majestically in August with the Tales of the Shire episode,
(1:16:19) Al: assuming nothing goes wrong. So if you want to get the full Shire feeling and experience
