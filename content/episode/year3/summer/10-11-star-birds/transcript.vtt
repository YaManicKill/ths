<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah. A big, a big, a big part of my complaints about the talk, the people talking about this game online is not enough people having clearly played Dragon Quest Builders too when they're like,

24
00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:25.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>oh, it's like animal crossing or it's like Minecraft. You're like, no, it's like Dragon Quest Builders too. Play more games. Yeah, did we know? I saw someone say that it's the developers. There are help well it's game free

25
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:37.879
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>no. Oh my god. Some of those textures are like I think straight out of track and quest builders. It is, yeah, Koi Tecmo. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And it's clear that those developers are working on it because some of them textures, they're straight out of DQB. And I love game. Why isn't it? I

26
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.080
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>as well but like it's game free and the developers of Dragon Quest Builders 2.

27
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.840
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, yeah.

<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like it. I don't like it. All right. Okay, let's talk about non existentially horrifying concepts. Wait, have I done anything? No, nothing. Yeah, okay.

29
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Luke, I love it.

30
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.719
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Gavin, why have you been up to you?

31
00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.280
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>- I did star birds, that wasn't,

32
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.719
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I did. Link, banner of the spark, that game, that was in that one direct, and then the other direct, and then it came out, and I bought it.

33
00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:24.400
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's a road like, it's robots, and they snuck animal crossing in there.

34
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:37.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I have many thoughts that may be I'll say for another time, another place, but overall, yeah, like overall, it's not bad, but just the bar's been raised.

35
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yes, please do. Let's not waste the episode

36
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.199
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So, that's a problem. Yeah, yeah, that's, so like, yeah, you're just in the shadows of people who've done it better, but anyways, so yeah, I have been playing it though, and I'm still playing it.

37
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.979
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, I'm intrigued. Very impressed.

38
00:03:50.199 --> 00:04:04.840
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So, let's see, those are the big ones, I picked up Minecraft because I just get that itch every, I got it like a week before Pacopia was announced, so you know, it wasn't even because of that, but sometimes I just get the itch, so I've been playing that again.

39
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.840
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Um, sometimes I just want to make it far mint and-

40
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>go caving and what not. Um, no specific project or anything, just-

41
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>just puts it around in a blocky world. Um, let's see, what else?

42
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I think that's- is that really- oh, oh, I haven't talked about this in this. I haven't talked about it. It's DZZ.

43
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.800
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh yeah, this game still exists.

44
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Um, it was like more than a week ago. It does exist. Um, they came out with a good update,

45
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>a banger of an update actually. Um, it's about- it's all the current faction.

46
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Um, they're a military squad. Um, they're- they're all females. Um, they all- not all of them, but they-

47
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>they all have tragic, like deep backstories are actually pretty good. Um, and, uh, a few of them already been out.

48
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>But the- the latest character being added, I'm torn. This is the first one that's really like- I've really been torn. I pulled for them. I got the character.

49
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.959
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>character. But I... Okay, her name is Seed. She pilots Ameka.

50
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:35.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And that's in her gameplay. She has a little like hover scooter, and she shoots little lasers from that, but she'll pull out the mecca every now and then and you fire missiles and shooting lots of guns and stuff. It's very fun. It's dynamic and fun. And I love that element. See the character. She's... She's okay. I think she's kind of fun. She has a sweet backstory. She's like a weirdo character.

51
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.959
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>character, it isn't. Get a lot of stuff in no interaction.

52
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>People almost autistic I would say like they don't label it, but it's coated. That's the word they say, right? Yeah, coated.

53
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.980
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yes. Autistic coded would be the correct way.

54
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah, let's say that. Okay. So overall, I think she's so I yeah, there's a lot of stuff. I love about seed.

55
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Here's the problem. She, okay, it is a gacha game. It is bohoyo. So there's no secret. You know, they lean into

56
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:37.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>whatever type, whatever cells, right? Let's say that. She is, and I think she's the, yeah, yeah. She is the first one in a cross. I think all the different nooyo games I've seen. She is the feat character. And dear God, dear God is a bad. I'm just going to say I that is correct.

57
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, family friendly.

58
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.339
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>- Okay.

59
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.699
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>- Okay.

60
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.620
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>- I don't know what to say.

61
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:52.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So I'm torn because like when, when you pop her oath, like the, her oath is she gets into the mech and you do an extended barrage of miss, like the screen changes like you're, you're in a camera.

62
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Like a sniper scope sort of thing firing. It's very cool. It's very fun. But in that animation, you, you get a close up real good right up to them. And yep.

63
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So there, here I am, cursed with this. I have to work my.

64
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.879
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>degenerate stuff to get to the fun part. But that said, overall though, yeah, it's fun story about

65
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.240
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>squad and soldiers who died to appease corporate overlords and people getting revenge for that and

66
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, yes, and super fun.

67
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:37.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>yeah, it's messy. It's deep. I love it. It is great. Yeah, and there's still going to release another oval squad character I'm going to pull for. She's interesting.

68
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:50.759
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's a two-in-one character because characters name is Orphy, but then there is a robot gun named Megas, and the robot gun is actually the captain of the squad leader.

69
00:07:50.759 --> 00:08:02.680
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, so it's goofy. Anyways, yeah, it's endless on zero. That's me. I'm still going through that because there's things I like, but then they do stuff that no, why?

70
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:08.240
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Anyways, that feels like a lot of things these days.

71
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, well, what have I been up to?

72
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.319
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>What about you? What'd you been up to?

73
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.100
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Well, let me check my list.

74
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I have finished study season's grand bazaar.

75
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.740
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So I got two credits in two days, which was incredible.

76
00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:27.139
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I got the credits for getting to the,

77
00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:30.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>well, I think no, I got the credits for getting married first.

78
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>When I say two days, I mean two in game days,

79
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>not two real life days.

80
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.100
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, oh, oh, that's even wilder.

81
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.580
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So I...

82
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:53.379
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So I got engaged and then I, like, two days later I got the, uh, to the top level of the bizarre, but both of those are like delayed by a little bit until they actually finished, right?

83
00:08:53.379 --> 00:09:04.340
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So, uh, I got married the next Friday and then on the Saturday is the bizarre and just before the bizarre you have the party forgetting to the highest level of bizarre.

84
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So when you get married, you get the credits and the morning of the bizarre, you

85
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>get credits.

86
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:21.019
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So I, credits on the Friday forget married and then on the Saturday I got credits for the bizarre as well, so it was very funny that they're just, they both ended up happening at the same time.

87
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.240
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Okay, that's how bizarre how bizarre

88
00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:35.179
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Okay, so yeah, yeah, so getting little max level of bizarre. Okay, that makes sense the game is called grand bizarre That would be an appropriate place to put a little credit. It's you know celebration sequence, but the marriage one that's wild

89
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.440
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, I've never a huge fan of how like farming games quite often go like get married is the goal

90
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.200
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like I feel like having a fulfilling life is the goal, right? Like

91
00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:11.559
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, even just like a, how do I put this in mechanical level? Like every farming game has that and nobody's, you know, it's, it's par for the course. It feels weird to make a big deal out of it when, you know, every game has that like, like, it feels like

92
00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:51.720
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Not at never a huge fan of that, but

93
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.879
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Sure, it is what it is I guess

94
00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:16.279
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I don't know you, Pokemon, you beat a gym.

95
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.899
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You get credits for beating a gym, like that's gonna happen, I don't know, I don't know.

96
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.879
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, I don't know. I guess cuz it like takes a lot of effort. I guess is the point right

97
00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:39.159
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Alright, well, you beat it to completion credits at least multiple times, so I guess you like them.

98
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:47.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, so then I got to the point where I was like, okay, well, I think I'm done here I'm just kind of like going through the motions now. I didn't really feel like I was doing much So I was like I think I think I'm done here

99
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>All right

100
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.080
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And considering about it physically it's like decision

101
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.980
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>made I'm gonna get rid of the game now so think where no I love the game I think it's I think it's my favorite game of the well my favorite farming game of the year so far so I

102
00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:56.200
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So you hit it the game actually that's what you're saying

103
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.039
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Think it's gonna take some it's gonna take some beating let's put it that way

104
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Well, I'll make sure it doesn't

105
00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:13.360
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Remember I haven't chosen who's on the episode yet careful now

106
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.740
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Well, irrelevant

107
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.019
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So yeah, obviously been playing a little bit

108
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:49.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>star words as well, not a humongous amount and I guess we'll talk about that why in the episode, but I have been playing it. So yeah, that's probably I don't know. There was something else. Well, I've not got my list up again. Where are we? Oh, yes. I started playing firefly village, which is another farming game that came out and it's very much are starchy like so I don't want to talk about it too much here because

109
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.240
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yum.

114
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:09.899
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I mean, all right. Yeah, boy a lot it really feels like that 90s anime art aesthetic has really been

125
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.519

131
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:15.519
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>But it is interesting. I will say like out of all the you know when you hear that when you hear

132
00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:22.399
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>factorial satisfactory like you don't think you right, but this game has a lot like acute art design

133
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I don't know. I'm, I'm not surprised by anything nowadays.

134
00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, you're right, it's

135
00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:31.200
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>We we have hit the point where college core games are kind of madlips, right?

136
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.200
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You're feeling a couple of blanks and outcomes of concept.

137
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>True that

138
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>All right, that's a big rock in their building.

139
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Well, that's that's that's the point. That's why it's endgame, you know

140
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

141
00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.639
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You gotta gotta be a good go

142
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And said October, was it seventh?

143
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's close.

144
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I will, there's a demo.

145
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I will play this demo bare minimum.

146
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:57.700
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>[laughter]

147
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>There, there they go.

148
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>There we go.

149
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.100
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Next, we have overthrown.

150
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.299
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Have announced that they're 1.0.

151
00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:03.860
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So they're currently in early access.

152
00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:09.779
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>They're 1.0 comes out on the 16th of October.

153
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:25.899
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>close. Are you excited for it? No, that's not power that just looks like it, but with that no, that's not breath of the wild link. It just looks like it. But there's more you can throw stuff,

154
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.659
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've never...

155
00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.419
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>which is fun. That is a fun

156
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.259
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, a lot of this game does interest me.

157
00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:36.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I haven't much time into it.

158
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.100
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Maybe I will at some point.

159
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.379
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>There's so many games as part of the problem.

160
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.879
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>The the super fast-tashing that that does look kind of fun. I don't know the question is how much do you do it right like

161
00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:56.080
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Because you're there's still building and farming and all this stuff But what if I just want to run around and throw animals or whatever?

162
00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:58.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That looks like fun

163
00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:01.039
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You throw buildings. That's fun

164
00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:04.399
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That sheep looks almost like the power of water

165
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>All right, but hi good to go for them one piggy

166
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>setting 1.0s that's good I like to see that

167
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.080
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Next, we have Moonstone Island, the Character Customization Update, is there now?

168
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:28.779
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I every moonstone island update

169
00:15:29.419 --> 00:15:34.539
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>feel how should I put this it they're all nice stuff they're not saying they're like bad updates

170
00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.700
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>but it always feels like it's not addressing some of the core issues like

171
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:51.580
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>they I don't know and and from what I can see maybe it's just me because I think a lot of plant fan bases it's still pretty happy for what i've seen um and it's not a bad game i Play that game to completion, but...

172
00:15:51.500 --> 00:16:03.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's not the updates I'm looking for, but I guess more to do with the monsters.

173
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I'm just collecting them, which is, I think, always a problem.

174
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Or not always, but that's one of the bigger problems I have in any creature collector.

175
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>What do you actually do with the things, right?

176
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Because a lot of the updates in Moonstone Island specifically are cosmetics.

177
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Here's this new pack of furniture.

178
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You can make, here's your character comes to me.

179
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's fine and dandy, or sometimes here's a new creature to collect or two.

180
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's not bad, but it's not giving you a reason to go back into the game.

181
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's what I want.

182
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I want a reason to go back and really play something I could be excited for.

183
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>But, like I said, there are a lot of people who still like it, and people ask for it, so good for them.

184
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.440
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Fair enough. So you're not excited about the 36 new clothing items in 20 new 28 new hats and hairs.

185
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:14.579
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>well you know what made what hats maybe you know maybe we could talk if I look on all the hats yeah cuz yeah the base hat is a little do it is a little goofy I'll say that so yeah yeah

186
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.740
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>[laughing]

187
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:11.940
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, I mean, that's deliberate, right?

188
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.140
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Next, we have Center Bunny.

189
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.779
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>They have released their community events update.

190
00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:22.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It's out now, on it includes community event.

191
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's that's a great idea for this game in any village game generally speaking you probably want events and holidays

192
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:39.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>There's an Aurora view party, a biannual duck derby, a lantern festival, a forest fire, a awareness day, sparkle night,

193
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>kite festival, rain festival and the great bunnish beak off.

194
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:56.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good. Okay, I think so like I okay, first of all, I know that I know the townspeople who on earth

195
00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:49.359
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Is it? Is it though?

196
00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:01.339
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>No one else bakes in that town. Who's gonna challenge me? I want to know I don't know

197
00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:11.440
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, I Aurora Viewing party. I think that's actually very cool. The duck therapy racing rubber duckies on a river. I like that a lot

198
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's actually kind of cute. I like that. Um, yeah, I I think these are fun. They're not

199
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:30.279
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's not Valentine's is Halloween Christmas. You know the standard four or five every other game Is so I appreciate it myself. It's a baking game. How could you not want to bake off?

200
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Fair enough

201
00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:39.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah fair fair point bake off into I just didn't like the name that's all

202
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.660
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, sure, the main name might not be great. Yeah, I won't argue you there. Just but I like the idea

203
00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:47.779
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, that's fair

204
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:55.579
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, oh my gosh, you know, there's a great American bake-off. Why I just I look at it. Why that's that's not big

205
00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:01.160
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Is that what they called it as well, but that's but that's funny because like they didn't they didn't because then the

206
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.099
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah, that's what they call it. They miss

207
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:08.259
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The great British bake off is not called that in America. They called that the great British baking show. So why did they call the American one?

208
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.640
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Or is it baking show whatever? It's just this would stop British for American. I could be wrong. What is the exact name?

209
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.400
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I don't know but the the key point is the ah

210
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.240
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>the word people

211
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.859
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, yeah, no, they did call it the great,

212
00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:20.740
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>they called it the great American baking show.

213
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.180
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But right, there's two things.

214
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:27.380
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>One, I still don't understand why they changed it from the great British bake-off to the great British baking show.

215
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:34.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, I'm sorry, like, I know the joke is that Americans don't understand things as much, right?

216
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.380
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Sidewalk, horseback riding, ha ha.

217
00:19:37.500 --> 00:20:06.380
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It is a term yeah yeah yeah no I look I'm not I don't get it I don't get it either but the bigger thing is even the reason people watch yes yes okay yes

218
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.259
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But we all know those stupid, right?

219
00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:44.980
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, people, are we really trying to suggest that Americans wouldn't understand bake-off?

220
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.980
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, is that not a term in America?

221
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.579
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That you go, exactly.

222
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:54.660
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So it's like, it's not even like that is a Britishism that you need to get rid of, right?

223
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.380
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So that's my first thing.

224
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>No, no, no, before, before, no, my second point, right?

225
00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:07.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Now, this needs to go before your point because this is still about the naming.

226
00:20:07.059 --> 00:20:11.339
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Great British, it's because it's great Britain.

227
00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:13.200
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're, ooh, that's a good point.

228
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.779
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Great American, that's not a thing.

229
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.900
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>[laugh]

230
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Not yet, maybe under this administration.

231
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.660
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>[laughs]

232
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.400
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>[laugh]

233
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:27.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And also like, great, great, an America.

234
00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:32.819
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Has a, a bit of a bad connotation in some areas.

235
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.779
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Shall we say that America, great?

236
00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:38.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That's all I'm saying.

237
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.079
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>[laughs]

238
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.779
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Maybe don't make your baking show, Maga.

239
00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:42.180
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>[laughs]

240
00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:52.680
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh gosh, the main, oh, oh, what's that far back? Oh, wow, I didn't realize that, huh?

241
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.299
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That's all I'm saying.

242
00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:47.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Or, patently, that was right back.

243
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:56.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So, okay, technically, yeah, the first episode of the Great American Baking Show was 2015.

244
00:20:56.359 --> 00:20:58.440
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, I didn't realize that.

245
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>There've only been four seasons.

246
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.119
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, I just heard about her recently. Wow, behind the boat each other way.

247
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, it looks like they redid it.

248
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:10.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So, they did one season, and then they did a second season, and then let me check the dates.

249
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>How you this came back?

250
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So, season, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Okay, so they did 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2018, '19, so that's five,

252
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:24.799
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>and then they had like a four-year gap, and then they did, they've done three new seasons.

253
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.460
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh my gosh, okay, look, I...

254
00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:31.119
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It was Roku that brought it back, interesting, so it was ABC, and then Roku did it.

255
00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.740
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, that's why I'm seeing the ads for it now.

256
00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:35.819
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>There you go. There you go, now you know.

257
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.700
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I just recently got Roroku, okay.

258
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.720
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>No, I know.

259
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.740
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I still say the reason everyone watched it,

260
00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:46.299
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>'cause it was British and you guys got the accents and you're more charming than the Americans.

261
00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:47.819
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You were hosting it.

262
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.920
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>[laughing]

263
00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:49.220
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's the boy.

264
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.539
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And I watch the bunnies baked into your marriage.

265
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.299
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And I like some baking shows, but...

266
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.400
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That's also a fair point. That's also a fair point

267
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.240
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Anyway, I think I mean we can agree that that's a silly show

268
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's in a bunny.

269
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Those are good events.

270

<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I like that.

272
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah.

273
00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.599
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Next we have Hello Kitty island adventure have a new event and it is the jam

274
00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:25.920
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Jamboree the island has turned into a festival of fruity fun filled with sweet surprises and Barry inspired rewards get ready to win prizes and cute mascot out.

275

276
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:58.539
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Now when they say a splash of color, they mean pink. Do you like pink? Because everything you will touch will be pink in this update. Yeah, some red. That's a pink derivative at this point. Yeah, in this update, it is. I like the strawberry hat. But other, yeah,

277
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.519
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Well, you know, some some red as well. It's not he's a red, you know

278
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.920
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>He's not how that works

279
00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:55.279
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Okay, fair enough

280
00:22:58.539 --> 00:23:04.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>it's fine. It's cute. Did you know how low Katie likes sweets? Do you know that now?

281
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:29.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yes. All right. Next we have an information update from my time ever Shane. So this is the third in the my time that series and there the post is titled current search as in relation. It is. It is. It's like, come on. Like,

282
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah.

283
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.799
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Okay. First of all, it's an awful name for update. Yeah.

284
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>we're all assuming that everybody's dead now based on that, right? Like, come Come on, what are you doing?

285
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.160
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah.

286
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:41.819
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Hi, governors. It's been a while as some of notice is September and we still haven't released the first kickstart ability yet in truth

287
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.900
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We've been having some problems with the main gameplay loop and it has been impeding our overall progress

288
00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:49.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We went to give you a quick update on the progress

289
00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:58.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>When we first started planning for ever shine We wanted to give you an experience where you get personal growth roleplay as well as the strategy involved in team and city planning

290
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.579
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We would use stats such as money, health, comfort, hunger to help the player mark the milestone

291
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:30.019
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>of settlement development, the story would use the stats to create problems for the player to solve pushing it forward at least on paper It looked like a good work well, but as we finally finished all the set reports and combined them into one build at the end of last year The result was unsatisfactory The two styles were in constant conflict the RPG part would send the player out into the field But the strategy part wanted to keep the player in the base the RPG part wanted to the player to do things in

292
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.380
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>linear fashion, while a strategy part wanted to play it to have more freedom.

293
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:40.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We ended up with multiple situations where the story told you to do one thing but the strategy part didn't really need it.

294
00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:46.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>On top of that it was a pain to express all the stats in third person and to keep track of all things.

295
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.740
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Nobody wanted to care about Ragnar being hungry again for the sixth time.

296
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.140
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It was a mess!

297
00:24:51.140 --> 00:25:02.740
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So we decided to make, so we had a decision to make, continue with what the build had and hope we solved the conflicts down the road or spend time tweaking the main loop until we're satisfied.

298
00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.099
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Of course we chose the second option.

299
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:11.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We did discuss if we wanted to go back to a builder type of gameplay but this being the third game we wanted to give players something new.

300
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.200
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We went through several iterations trying to find the right balance after 10 months of development we think we're getting pretty close.

301
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:24.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We ended up simplifying the strategy parts of the gameplay loop and tilting the game more towards open world exploration and RPG.

302
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:31.599
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Of course due to the gameplay loop tweaks the main story was also tweaked, some players became more important while others had the roles diminished.

303
00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:34.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The challenges facing the settlement also

304
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:58.180
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>got more challenging, the twists are still redacted. Despite the setbacks, development is proceeding at a fast clip the systems, character stories and art assets didn't stop development because of main loop issues. We are doing our best to make available the Kickstarter build soon and we look forward to your feedback. So why find most interesting about this, Kevin?

305
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:14.259
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yes. Tell me. Yeah. Well, I guess it's for you, I guess then. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know.

306
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:05.299
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Is that it's not a builder anymore? That was what I didn't like about the first game.

307
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.460
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's a third one. That's my first. That's the first thing I thought of. I guess it is, but

308
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:27.299
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>that this is interesting because like I first of all, I want to tip my hat towards them because they

309
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:48.420
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>this is a very hard thing and a lot of games mess up, not knowing what you want your core thing to be. And especially if you want to do two separate ones, that's hard to do. I think it'd be really hard to do. So it's good for them for acknowledging all that. Now that said, being the third game,

310
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:58.259
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I don't know. It feels a little weird, but it's all right. I'm looking at the trailer. That guy looks like a Nazi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

311
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.740
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>[laughs]

312
00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:06.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, there's no here. I'm dead. Um, but, uh, well, I mean, hey, good for that. Look,

313
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:22.579
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>transparency, that's even with the awful title. That's a good thing. That's, you know, that's a key thing. Um, and it sounds like yeah, it's a tough thing they're wrangling with so good for them for trying to deal with it and acknowledging it. Um, yeah, I don't know, I don't know.

314
00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:29.619
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>What about, uh, what are your thoughts?

315
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I mean, I'm interested in the game more now than I was before

316
00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:36.039
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Because like I I you know, I've talked about how I didn't like - time at Porsche and it was it was mainly because of the

317
00:27:37.579 --> 00:27:43.700
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You know the the game being the 3d building thing. I didn't like that and so I

318
00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:53.339
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Kind of just assumed that this would be the same and therefore didn't really pay much attention to it But if this is different, I'm maybe interested again

319
00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:09.980
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Do you find it funny? I'm looking through the comments and like some people are like oh, it's great Just you know do do we need to do and then some people are like I really wish you'd just made the decision to make it back a builder again That's what I like with which is like I get that. Yeah, like I understand why some people would have that opinion like it's a

320
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>[laughs]

321
00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:19.220
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah Interesting I guess we'll see what it inevitably goes, but I can't see them like I can't really see them changing

322
00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:24.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Back to that now that they've you know gone with this decision if he was like a decision

323
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.059
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah.

324
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:31.559
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>that they've made and they're gonna stick with it so I guess we'll see we'll see how that goes

325
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.460
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>All right, well, I guess that's that's the biggest thing. I don't know how will this look like I have no idea cuz they're

326
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.640
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, who knows who it is all righty

327
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.240
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I'll see

328
00:28:42.859 --> 00:28:48.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We have one more piece of news and that is a new game to cover. This is cosmic coop

329
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.680
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And I think I'm excited about this one now.

330
00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, yeah, me too.

331
00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:15.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We love, we love critical actors, we love farming, we love farming, creature collectors, like what's there, what's there not to like, I don't know, I'll tell you once I've played it.

332
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:36.440

335
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.400

336
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.339
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Well, yeah, but it all been like what nearly three weeks

337
00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:37.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>If if ZA is great yeah, you might still be playing by that point, but if it's not you won't be

338
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:42.119
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>well okay well okay here's the thing hold on wait wait let me see what is the date for

339
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.799
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>because right now like gaming wise my life has kind of gotten locked down

340
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Talk to me, tell me.

341
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:59.039
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>because here's the thing we get ZA in October and it's that until you know November 20th 'cause then air riders comes out.

342
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.599
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, yes. I forget about Eric, because I'm not, I'm not, I'm not on the

343
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Well, train well, yeah.

344
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:09.720
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Airriders, uh, train, right? Like I, I might play it at some point, but I'm not like, I'm not buying a day one. Yeah.

345
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Well, okay, we got air riders.

346
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And then Pocopoeia comes out 2026 and then my life will just be alternating between these two games for the forever.

347
00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:19.279
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You're just assuming that it's like super early in 2026.

348
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>No, I don't care. No, no, no, no, I'm not assuming that.

349
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I'm assuming I will be playing air riders until the moment that goes.

350
00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:23.200
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Wait.

351
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.920
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So I just realized there's a

352
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:58.359
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>reason they've given us this game, they've told us about this game. Now, because if it's coming out next year, no, no, no, no, we definitely are. There's no way we're not getting a new game next year. Come on, there's the 30th anniversary. No, no, I think I think two things. One, they want to focus on the new game on next year at the, you know, Gen 10, wherever it is going to be. They want to focus on that

353
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.359
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, we're not getting a Pokemon next year, are we? That's what you're seeing.

354
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.200
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, is it? Oh, they're mine. You're right. I'm wrong. Yeah. Okay.

355
00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.680
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Okay. Yeah.

356
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.279
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>year's Pokemon direct on Pokemon day. But also, I think if this game wasn't coming out in Q1,

357
00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:18.119
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>they would just tell us about it existing on Pokemon day. Why else would they tell us at this point? I don't think they would tell us about this game just now if it's coming out Q2 or 3 or 4, right?

358
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:27.039
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, well, it's gonna come on the first half. That's clear because you're you're right. I forgot about that because

359
00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:21.960
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I think this coming out Q1, I think this might be coming out in February.

360
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.480
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Second half there. That's dedicated to new game Pokemon time

361
00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:37.200
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So anything else that's gonna come out. You're right. It's gonna be first half. Maybe Q1. I think that's likely

362
00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:43.759
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Maybe Pokemon day that'd be dope. Oh my goodness. That'd be that'd be the highest one since

363
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>What if they don't announce the release date?

364
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.279
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Until Pokemon Day and they're like,

365
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.359
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's just shadow drop it. Oh my gosh. I scream

366
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Now we're going to be disappointed when they don't do that, right?

367
00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:04.559
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Come out be fine. I can I can live either way. That would be good though

368
00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:13.359
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Anyways, the point being Cosmic coop like as cute as you are you have a very narrow window to exist

369
00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.480
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So and it looks like you might hit it. So good for you

370
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah fair

371
00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We shall see all depends on how good ZA is let's let's

372
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:30.319
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It depends on which on me I'll be elements looks good. Will the game be good? I don't know that part

373
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.440
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I like looking about Z. I like thinking about Z. Yeah

374
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah.

375
00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:41.119
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Like playing it and bad when you may have to do that. I don't know

376
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.519
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We shall see.

377
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:07.759
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>games aren't out yet. You know what else isn't out yet? I mean, it is, but it really isn't the same time. Starbirds!

378
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.839
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>All right. Let's talk about Starbird, shall we? Okay. So,

379
00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:15.679
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>quick intro to this before I get into my standard complaints, and then we'll talk about the actual game.

380
00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:23.440
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So this is a base building asteroid management game. Is that a fair description of it?

381
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:48.300
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I've wouldn't say bass building. I would say well, I guess if you want to say that it's I want to say it's resource again factorial satisfactory type resource management on asteroids. So it is like and small little asteroids. So the size and space like the physicality of the asteroids is a factor.

382
00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.639
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, you're building lots of bases.

383
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.920
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I do want to.

384
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yes.

385
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Fair.

386
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.099
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You're a bunch of birds traveling through space exploring. That's that's the premise of the game.

387
00:34:53.500 --> 00:35:03.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And you're come to a field of asteroids and you use their resources to generate stuff to explore a thing basically.

388
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:13.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And why was I tricked into playing early access games? You know, I don't like the list. It's the day.

389
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Cool

390
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:20.940
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I think you'll find Kevin I said these things are coming out and you said I want to play Starbirds and I said okay, let's do Starbirds then I

391
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.199
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, but nobody says early access.

392
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.960
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Will see so um

393
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:35.559
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Did I not see I should I said it was early access. Yes. Mmm anyway, it doesn't matter doesn't matter I

394
00:35:30.219 --> 00:35:35.460
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You probably did. I don't remember either way. I tricked myself. I played myself here.

395
00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:46.320
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I Will say foreign early access and obviously every early access is going to have limitations somewhere. It doesn't feel buggy. It's not buggy

396
00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:40.599
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's

397
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:49.579
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, that is I was about to say that it is working well.

398
00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.900
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>for an early access, which I don't expect from my early access games.

399
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>They have done the thing that I've said time and time again the early access needs to do and it's what uber it's did it is

400
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.860
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Build out your game make it polished

401
00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:05.300
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But just make a small section of it

402
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.599
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Because otherwise you go into and go oh, this is horrible and you run away and you never come back to it

403
00:36:10.639 --> 00:36:17.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Whereas what you need to do is you need to make it polished enough to people go I really like that. I want more, please

404
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.880
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But obviously there's always problems with that we have you know comments about

405
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:37.719
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>access all the time having said that I have one big issue with this which I'm sure you'll have other issues But my one big issue is the control support is terrible on this game. This is always my issue with these things

406
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:57.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, you know what, I didn't even think about controllers, because I'm playing a resource like as much as I love controllers and I've got, you know, I've been clear about that on this show like it's my go-to, I don't play PC games, generally speaking of keyboard and mouse, a resource management, I think I don't even, it's the opposite, I don't even consider control is because I'm.

407
00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:44.199
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yep, yeah

408
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:09.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah. So. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. So I get that. And this was going to be my, my, my point is that this, I'm less annoyed about this as I am about other games because I get this is a really hard game to make controller support work for.

409
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>How does it work? How do you connect the pipes?

410
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:21.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But. Well, let me get, let me get that to you, right? My problem is when you go, let me get the exact wording because when you go to the steam page every game has our.

411
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:39.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>point and on the steam page, and it says, vowel testing indicates that star birds is playable on steam deck, which means that it has some good things and some bad things, and it will say, oh, this game, sometimes sure is most keyboard or non steam deck controller icons. Okay. Sure. Fine.

412
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That's an annoying thing that you just have to deal with sometimes, especially in early access where it's like, the controllers will work, but it will show you like, press the Y key and you're like, what is the.

413
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>the order, so you press the R.

414
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And you're like, but what is mapped to the R.

415
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Can you? And that's an annoying thing, but that's something that is what it is.

416
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I'm used to that entering some text requires manually invoking the on string keyboard.

417
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Again, I'm used to that.

418
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You press the steam key and the right trigger and it brings up the keyboard.

419
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I know how to do that.

420
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I'm used to that.

421
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Some in-game text is small and maybe difficult to read.

422
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Sure, I have good eyes.

423
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I make things smaller on my phone than anybody ever likes.

424
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>People will see my phone all the time and they go,

425
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>like so small and I go, because I want it to be small.

426
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Get glasses if you can't read it.

427
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And then it says this is these are the good things.

428
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>All functionality is accessible when using the default controller configuration and the games default graphics configuration performance.

429
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Steam deck.

430
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That last one is true.

431
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The second one is technically true.

432
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But here's the problem.

433
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>The best kind of true.

434
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Here's the problem.

435
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>All functionality is accessible while using it.

436
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And the default controller configuration, and this allowed me into a false sense of security, and went, "Oh, great, they've got controller support!"

437
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Not really!

438
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Not really do they have controller support.

439
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:10.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Because essentially, most of the game you're playing is using either the analog stick or the touchpad as a mouse.

440
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.719
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Don't you love it when games do that.

441
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And I'm like, I now, having looked closer, I noticed that it doesn't have the little icon that most games have.

442
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But I feel like this should be wrapped up into the Steam Deck compatibility thing, like, yes, technically, all functionality is accessible.

443
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:41.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But you know how annoying it is to use the touchpad to be like, "I'm going to connect these two things between them, and I'm going to be moving the planet at the same time."

444
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I can't even imagine

445
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, duh, there's horror, but do not play this. On Steam Deck, it's dreadful, and I'm like, "Just don't pretend! Don't pretend!"

446
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, I get that not all games can work like that.

447
00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:01.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I understand that. But don't pretend like it is good. It's not. All functionality accessible, brackets, but terrible.

448
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Right? Like, I don't know why you would make it seem like this is a good game to play on the Steam Deck.

449
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:15.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The only things it complains about are icons might look weird. You might need to manually add the keyboard, and some text is small.

450
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>That is a standard list of things that I see when I'm playing games on Steam Deck, and I'm like, "Yeah, I'm used to those things!"

451
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:33.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I can deal with those things. But what it doesn't tell you is the game is played 99% with the touchpad as a mouse. That's not fun. No one wants to do that.

452
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Nope. Oh, that's rough. I didn't even

453
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:47.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And the worst part is this game doesn't even play on Mac, so I couldn't even play it on my Mac. So what I was doing was taking my Steam Deck up to my mouse, keyboard, and mouse. Sorry, my keyboard and mouse at my desk.

454
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.840
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>and the monitors so I could actually play the game.

455
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh my goodness

456
00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:56.280
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it's my fault. I know blah, blah, blah. You don't have to tell me

457
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I mean, well no, I will say in this sort of game. They should

458
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:08.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>This is like the very fringe case for it. You know, I just don't do the controller support right or or save it for

459
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:17.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And they clearly haven't and they clearly haven't right? The game doesn't pretend that you actually you load up the game And you're immediately showing this is this is doesn't have controllers aboard. It's the Steam page

460
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.320
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, or save it

461
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, exactly and yeah, don't do it and don't

462
00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:19.980
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That don't do it and don't pretend like you're going to

463
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:49.400
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>do it. That's fine unless you know, maybe you do a console release or whatever. But anyway, but for now, especially for early access, just say, no, don't, don't play. Do the opposite. Say, don't play control or support. We anti-support it. Yeah, so yeah, that's fair. It should be clear that don't play this with the controller. Oh, gosh, I can't even imagine like, even using a mouse. I don't like how it's placed the pipes.

464
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.519
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>All right, well, let's let's talk about the game. Let's talk about the game as a whole. Let's get your thoughts on it

465
00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:19.079
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Okay. Yeah. Oh, let me check steam. Actually, I'm curious. I have played two point one hours. There you go. And I, the reason I haven't played more, it's like, okay.

466
00:41:55.159 --> 00:41:58.880
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>How much time you put into this game so far. Let's let's go go

467
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.880
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Because I think I've maybe put in two hours

468
00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:08.119
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So that's what I'm sitting at oh

469
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.320
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Wow, nice. What about the same fantastic?

470
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:47.800
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I'm, this is all the asterisk of early access, right? The hope that things could get better, right? And it's not like what's here is bad per se. I think, like we talked about, I think it's actually quite nice, like the polish, the game runs well functions for an early access game. It works well. It does its stuff. The art direction. I do like it. It's colorful. It's cartoony. I think it wasn't Spencer.

471
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.360
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It's the standard cuts, because that's our direction.

472
00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:19.840
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's, it's great visually. It's fantastic. The resource management is, is fine. I think for the most part, like, I, you know, you, you start off every asteroid. You have to put a landing pad in a

473
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.860
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>If you've watched any of their videos on YouTube, this is basically that, right?

474
00:42:55.380 --> 00:43:00.980
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Which, yeah, I really love to watch the videos and the visuals are a huge part of that.

475
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:50.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>it's, it's, you know, it's, it's, I don't think it's anything like super groundbreaking that I can think of. So, it's fine. For me, the problem is, and the reason I only have two hours is,

476
00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:50.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>a reason to keep playing, like there's no big objective, like the incentivization isn't there for me, right? Like I feel like I'm just crafting stuff for the sake of crafting stuff. Like they kind of give you a goal at the beginning, but it's, how should I put this? There's no, there's no stakes. There's no time. They, they get you give you at the grade at the end. And that's, that's one problem. Like I don't think they're very clear about their grading until you get the grade. Um, but, uh, it's just like, okay, here's, you know, make this, this material. Here are the steps to do it. Just go do it. And I, I do it. And, and, yeah, you clear the stage. That's it. Um, so that, for me, that's probably the biggest thing. Like I'm just not feeling the, the, what's the point? What's the overall objective?

477
00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:20.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Just they're not selling me on it so far. Um, and, and maybe they can get there because like I said, every, the, the parts they have in there are functioning. The game works well. Um, so I don't know. That's, that's my thoughts. There's a lot of good here, but I'm just struggling to find the reason to really play it. What about you? What are your thoughts?

478
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:17.840
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, I mean, obviously I have issues with the, you know, the playing it in and of itself, right?

479
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:26.699
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like I, it's fine once you hook up the stuff, but that's not how I like to play games, right?

480
00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:30.739
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, and maybe I should have expected this when I'm playing a resource management game.

481
00:45:30.739 --> 00:45:36.260
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You know, we've talked about resource management games before and they're not my most favorite type of game.

482
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I feel like it was something that

483
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:45.260
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I liked when I was younger and it's something that I want to like, right?

484
00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:51.340
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like I was a big, I was a big sim city guy, I was a big rollercoaster tycoon guy,

485
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:56.380
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>and that style of, you know, click and drag and like, Debbie, Debbie, that sort of thing,

486
00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:02.380
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I've really liked then and the sims as well, similar sort of gameplay feel.

487
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And I never really got into things like factorial or other similar things,

488
00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:09.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>but I feel like I probably would...

489
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:14.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>have liked them back then, but the thing is that's just not like how I like to play games anymore, right?

490
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:24.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And that's fine. I guess the problem is that I, for some reason, look to this one, I love the look at this game.

491
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:37.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I want to play this and it says it works on the Steam Deck, so therefore let's go for it, and maybe I'll actually manage to enjoy a resource management game on my couch, but that isn't how it worked out.

492
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So that I think colors a lot.

493
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:59.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I think you're totally fair about it does feel very much like you're here to resource farm. Why to resource farm? Like why wouldn't you want to do that? And I suspect that's where the missing stuff is and that's going to come with later versions.

494
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:09.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You're right, the graphics are great. The game feels nice as we talked about. Like it doesn't feel buggy.

495
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:19.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But I'm just not enthused to continue playing it because I'm like, okay, but why? You know, and that's a problem.

496
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:32.239
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah. And this is part of it too, where it's such a small scale thing, like I can't believe it was only two hours I played, because I played, I think four sectors they called it,

497
00:47:32.239 --> 00:47:37.440
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>like the stage is basically. And it's just basically the same thing on repeat, just, you know,

498
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>different flavors of resources or whatever. You know, they teach you a new mechanic or two,

499
00:47:42.639 --> 00:47:47.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>like here, built this is a combined certain resources, yeah, but it's basically,

500
00:47:48.000 --> 00:48:00.119
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>plops something, collect the resources, pop another thing, connect them with the pipe, and then send it to the right place. And you're just doing that on repeat. So that's, that's very hard to stay engaged in.

501
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.260
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, the things that you're harvesting change, but not the gameplay, not the way you do them.

502
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>But yeah

503
00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:15.280
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like I think the add us a second thing, which is like you put water into it and it does something else.

504
00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:29.519
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah, it's yeah, it is just a different button on the menu that you click on instead of you know You put the second type extractor some of the first one that's lit. That's it. There is no. Yeah, there's no

505
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.320
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But it's really just like another pipe.

506
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.320
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Right?

507
00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.920
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It doesn't actually change the gameplay at all.

508
00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:34.719
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, no change in the gameplay between the different resources or whatever

509
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.519
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>um and like

510
00:48:39.159 --> 00:48:47.159
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's very weird because you know all the stuff there isn't bad like I think it's a solid foundation But I guess this is what it's early access right like they have to flesh out

511
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:54.039
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>What they're trying to do and they have like a little story They have little cutscenes with the cute art of the birds talking and that's fun and all but

512
00:48:55.159 --> 00:48:57.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's not translating to the actual gameplay

513
00:48:58.679 --> 00:49:03.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Um, you know, I don't know and and like it's

514
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.199
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Maybe part of it is like I said, there's no sense of stakes like there's no

515
00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:18.519
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>state Um, per se Like maybe you can run out of money to build stuff I guess but that's one hard to do and just just reset but

516
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:26.099
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Not really because it's like the first time you run out money. It's like oh, here's your little buggy that can go make you more money And you're like, okay

517
00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.480
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, oh you can

518
00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:27.719
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, you're right. You can just pick up money off the ground. Yeah. Yeah, you're right

519
00:49:26.739 --> 00:49:31.579
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It just it just stops it being automatic and it means you just have to do a little bit of a manual thing in your own, okay?

520
00:49:31.159 --> 00:49:35.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, you're right. You're right. If totally forgot about that. Yeah, so yeah, there's no fail state. There's no

521
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.760
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>clock or anything um

522
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:53.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's it's take all the time on earth you need and you can just you know they'll give you a list of different objectives or resources to go for But you can do them all one at a time and just take your time doesn't matter

523
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:03.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Like I said, you get a grading at the end, but it's it's they don't show you those like the How they're grading you at the beginning or whatever

524
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So yeah, I don't know It's, it's, it's, it's.

525
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:27.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Just needs that reason to keep going. That's the biggest thing, which is a shame because I do like all the stuff that's there. I like the art. I like the, the, the physicality, the way you, because you have to rotate the asteroids to find a place to pop down your, your, your extractors or your launch pads or whatever.

526
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:36.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And that's kind of fun. And, and, and, you know, maybe if they went further, it becomes more of a challenge, you know, fitting everything on one asteroid. But right now it's not. It's just not.

527
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>not. So, yeah.

528
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:49.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>The foundation here. It's early access again, right? That's the big asterisk. And I think there is hope for this game because what is here? I think is pretty solid, especially for early access.

529
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So, you know, maybe 1.0, it'll be good. I don't know what else it says.

530
00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:02.699
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, yeah, and I think it could be really good if they managed to get that sick because okay, so

531
00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:06.179
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You know, yeah, it's a crucial the

532
00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:11.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Angry reviewer he did the zero punctuation

533
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.300
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You know the guy I'm talking like

534
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.519
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>- Yeah, I think so, yes.

535
00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.940
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>He swears a lot in his reviews of games

536
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.219
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>His thing his big thing is he talks about

537
00:51:21.219 --> 00:51:57.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And I'm sure lots of other people talk about this as well but like he's the person I had talked about this so don't come up and tell me oh it's a standard game development thing I'm not a game developer so sharp he talks about how like you have to have the core gameplay loop and which this game does it has the loop of connecting things and and building up that money but then to make a good game you have to have a secondary and a tertiary gameplay loop as well and those have to build into each other and create this larger game that actually makes you want to keep doing because it's all very well and good having like You know, think about it like

538
00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:12.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>with Mario the primary gameplay of loop is moving side to side and jumping, right? And that and that in Mario feels great. But if that's all there was and there wasn't any level system and progression to that, you would get bored in that game super quickly.

539
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:14.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. That's...

540
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:21.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So you need to have that secondary gameplay loop and you need to have the character gameplay loop to make you actually want to continue playing a game for more than two hours.

541
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:30.400
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's an excellent point, right? Like if they just had a big overall goal of like, you know,

542
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:36.320
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>filling up a progress bar to discovering this thing or creating different pieces for a big thing,

543
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:52.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>you know, that would at least engage me a little more just term, you know, wanting to cross off the check marks or whatever. But, but you're right, like there's, there's no, there's nothing between the levels to make me feel like they're connected or any reason.

544
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.159
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I just do the level to do it again. That's literally it. It's a very good point. Yeah

545
00:52:52.500 --> 00:53:20.780
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah exactly exactly and there's no second for your tertiary thing to do with the money right you're building you're getting the money to spend the money to get the money to spend the money right where is like if you think about like stargy you make the money but then you spend that money on other things building up your farm in different ways where is this is like you're spending your money on doing the same thing again.

546
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah

547
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:23.320
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, it's true Oh man, this is just like no man's sky when it first came out. It's literally the same thing

548
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.780
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, the difference.

549
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:52.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The difference is that no one's kind of pretended it was pretty pretended it wasn't early access. If no one's guy had released as an early access, I feel like it's press would have been so much better. That's you're absolutely right though, like that game was looked great. And, you know, as far as I'm aware, I never played it. As far as I'm aware, like the actual movement and stuff was good. It's just that it didn't have anything on top of that and it upsold you on so many things exactly.

550
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.480
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, oh, yeah, you're right. You're right. Oh my gosh

551
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah

552
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.159
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah, it's the same problem. You didn't what was the point of doing anything

553
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.239
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>You landed on the planet to gather the resources to get off the planet. That's all it was

554
00:53:59.119 --> 00:54:01.280
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Man oh no, man's guy

555
00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:06.199
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Did you I just all right aside, but did you see the new one that they they came out with?

556
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:13.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Was it no no fire no something I don't ring their new game. Did you see it the the hello games?

557
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I have not, no, actually.

558
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Hold on look it up

559
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Light no fire. It's it's basically

560
00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:25.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Don't man sky but fantasy like dragons medieval

561
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Okay, right. Uh-huh.

562
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:31.079
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It looks just like no man sky, but it's it's all it did you write dragons. That's all

563
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.360
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Anyways, but

564
00:54:34.519 --> 00:54:41.760
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, Starbirds. It's it's yeah, basically like no. It's but it's early access. You're right. That's the big thing, right? Like they're not pretending

565
00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.940
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>So hey no man Skype

566
00:54:45.000 --> 00:55:14.980
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>we got a lot better there's probably hope for this game too I feel like I say this a lot because I don't know why it happens I see it a lot in college core games they get a lot of the hard parts right they got charm they got a great visual style right there the mechanics quirk well it's not broken like those are very hard things to do and they've already got it right just you're missing you know one or two important pieces so you know you they can just.

567
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.079
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah. Yeah.

568
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.280
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>give me a reason to care to keep playing I think this will be a slam dunk but.

569
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.820
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I think that's the thing and this is where we get into just our regular point of

570
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:32.860
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Early access is a flawed system and I don't think I'm I'm not doing a journey. I'm not saying it shouldn't exist

571
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I am. No, I'm kidding. It should exist.

572
00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:43.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I do think that a lot of games would do better with demos. Would I feel better about this if this was a demo versus early access?

573
00:55:44.139 --> 00:55:49.019
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Probably mainly because I wouldn't be spending the money on this point, right? Like we

574
00:55:49.739 --> 00:56:02.699
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>on this game and now we're not gonna play it and maybe we'll come back to it later or maybe we won't because we'll be on Something else. That's the fundamental problem with early access is you're essentially it's essentially kickstarter

575
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, it is. It really is.

576
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:11.659
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Right, it's kickstarter, but you're also gonna play the game as soon as you buy it and then that might lead to you never playing it again

577
00:56:12.059 --> 00:56:18.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>because you're just like, oh fine, whatever and I'm kind of I

578
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:25.340
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Maybe six months ago, but trying not to kickstart as much because I think it's not good for me

579
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.039
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah.

580
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:31.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>As a person. I don't think it's good for me as my game. I like I spend a lot of money and then don't

581
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:34.139
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>play the games

582
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.199
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, that's fair.

583
00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:39.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>And I've actually done really well with that like I have I've kickstarted one

584
00:56:37.239 --> 00:56:41.639
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, good for you.

585
00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:46.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Game this year and that was the autonomica, which I was always going to kickstart because like that's a whole other thing

586
00:56:45.000 --> 00:57:04.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>sure. Yeah, I know that that's fair. I think I was this year. Thank you. Is that the one you kickstarted right after you said you were going to kickstart? Oh, was it? Oh, okay.

587
00:56:47.980 --> 00:57:05.579
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Cause I don't think I think monster patch was last year, or was that this year as well, so this was March, so this was before I said I was going to stop kick-starting things.

588
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:11.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Okay.

589
00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:10.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Autonomica was the one that I kick-started after I said I was going to stop.

590
00:57:10.539 --> 00:57:15.659
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So I've kick-started two games this year, only one after I said I was going to stop kick-starting things.

591
00:57:15.659 --> 00:57:19.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But I do think the pit monster patch is different because that's very much like

592
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:48.579
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>funding our indie game developer, you know, like I think that that feels different. That's me giving my money to him and going, please, yeah, go make a make a game, please. And, you know, that's a different thing. Whereas, autonomica definitely didn't need my money, right? They have, you know, a lot of money. So like they got a million dollars in their, their Kickstarter. So I'm trying to kick

593
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.179
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It's Sean Young.

594
00:57:24.099 --> 00:57:25.179
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>It is, and it...

595
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.619
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yes, yeah.

596
00:57:32.739 --> 00:57:34.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And he has credibility.

597
00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:37.460
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Hehehehe.

598
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. (laughs)

599
00:57:49.500 --> 00:58:10.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>me and I'm trying to never kickstart. No, I say that. Monster patch got half a million in his Kickstarter. Oh, my words. Goodness me. There you go. Yeah. I would love to see how much money, um, concern date would kickstart if he ever did a kickstarter.

600
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:04.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Well, hey, that's when you have a guy who has crud, you have a name in it.

601
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:19.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Um, he's never going to, and he probably shouldn't and he doesn't because he doesn't need to, but I would just love to see I wonder how much we

602
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:24.920
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, no, I want, I want to see, if he can, I want to see if he can to throw on the critical rolls, could kickstarter.

603
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:30.599
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>did it be the biggest Kickstarter ever? Yeah. Yeah, I just,

604
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:35.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>That's what I want to see, I want to see the Titans fight, that's, I want to see it.

605
00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:48.940
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>that's the thing, I like it could, it could, it could end up being the biggest Kickstarter ever. Who would make a bigger Kickstarter if they launched one in 2025, concern date or team

606
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.880
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I want to feel the earth's rotation, you know, orbit shift because of all the money concentrating in his pockets.

607
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:58.239
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>No, I didn't, no one on earth is going, if Team Shuri came out right now with a kickstarter,

608
00:58:58.239 --> 00:59:06.559
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>everyone say, hell no, like eventually, but not right now.

609
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.960
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Come on, let don't don't pretend anything really you don't you really don't think they were

610
00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:11.880
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, no, I, no.

611
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:19.559
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I, I know, okay, they would, but no, concerned they would crush it, they crush it,

612
00:59:19.559 --> 00:59:26.800
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>because like, oh yeah, no, yeah, oh absolutely like.

613
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.719
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>you think?

614
00:59:24.719 --> 00:59:30.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Silksong broke every story it was in.

615
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:41.980
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I know, I, I, I know they liked it, but like, you know what, no forget, I want to see the to it. I'd love to...

616
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:34.480
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I think you underestimate how big, how much people like it.

617
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>to see them have the audacity of soaks on just released.

618
00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:57.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The absolute, well, this is the thing is I think the same about them as I think about concern date, neither of them should do a Kickstarter. Mainly because they don't need to,

619
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Here's our new Kickstarter.

620
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Oh, yeah. Yeah, they don't need

621
00:59:57.059 --> 01:00:03.460
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>right? But also because I think it would put too much pressure on them. I think that,

622
01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:07.860
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>actually, that's the reason that concern date probably hasn't done it for

623
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:20.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>no. I don't think anyone can put more pressure than he does on himself. I don't think it'll factor it.

624
01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.940
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Onto Jocoteers because he doesn't want the pressure of that.

625
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:36.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>well no I i don't think that the pressure would actually increase your mother people necessary I think there already is a lot of pressure that people have on him I think it's more like he doesn't want his own pressure of that like if he's if he's taking money from people he feels he owes them something.

626
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Well, I

627
01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:42.739
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Don't think so because he's not taking money from people and he still feels like he was there

628
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yes, and taking money would make it worse

629
01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:52.880
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Maybe maybe to but here's the thing. Well, I mean well team cherry's not gonna feel it. They care about it during silks

630
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.780
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Come on, of course it would

631
01:00:52.940 --> 01:01:01.300
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>They're they're well, yeah, they they don't have that pressure They I think that yeah, they took they took money from people for so long and they still take it forever

632
01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.820
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>They have the opposite problem

633
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:14.559
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, yeah, it's exactly. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, yeah, it's great.

634
01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:12.340
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>They have they have the opposite problem while having the same effect, which is that they release games once a decade

635
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:26.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But but for a different reason right like they're they're just having too much fun developing it and like bigger or bigger bigger Whereas I think the concern date once is a perfectionist and once it wants to release a perfect thing

636
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:44.519
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah. It's great. Oh my gosh. Oh, there are. There are. Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah. There are.

637
01:01:27.219 --> 01:01:30.619
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But it both means that they just take forever to release things

638
01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.699
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>There's actually a lot of similarities between concern Dave and team Jenny when you think about it

639
01:01:44.519 --> 01:01:56.679
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>They, they, didn't we make the memes on the discord of the of the the the the handshaking me. Anyways, but yeah.

640
01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:12.159
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>always something I can't remember a lose track as so many we may I make a lot of memes. Oh, that's what it was. Yeah, that's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. But I just when you think about it, there's more and more similarities between them, but also differences at the same time, right?

641
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Dear, I've been pretty sure it's a dear god you can stop working on the game.

642
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:17.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah. Yeah. There are. There are. But look. Oh man. I'm just thinking.

643
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Because specifically in my brain I'm thinking concerned it comes out of the game.

644
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And he just called it Stardew Valley Two. That's the Kickstarter.

645
01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:28.340
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Well, yeah, I mean he has talked about the idea of doing a starchy value to

646
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>How can anyone touch it?

647
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I don't think anything on Earth could touch that.

648
01:02:33.139 --> 01:02:35.139
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I yeah, I don't know

649
01:02:35.539 --> 01:02:43.320
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It feels if I feel like it would do a lot similarly to some like I think there's a lot of similarities between them I

650
01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.659
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Just like I I honestly don't know

651
01:02:47.219 --> 01:02:52.820
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Whether it would be like I mean it would obviously be it would hit his goal within seconds, right?

652
01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.960
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We know there's that's fine, blah, blah, blah.

653
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:58.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But my question is like, "How high would it go?" That's my question.

654
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:21.099
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yeah, oh, yeah, for sure. That's that's absolutely the question. How many mill can we hit not seven, can we hit eight digits, tens of millions, maybe. Yeah. Oh my gosh, I want to see that happen. That's our, yep, that's our takeaway from star bird.

655
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I'm fascinated by that.

656
01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Oh, oh for sure

657
01:03:14.619 --> 01:03:22.019
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>But I yeah, anyway fascinating conversation kickstarter is weird early access is weird

658
01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:30.619
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I'm not saying that either of them are necessarily bad, but I think there might be an overliance on that on it and it's a complicated one and

659
01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.820
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I want this game to be good and

660
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.179
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>The primary gameplay loop as mentioned is good

661
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>more

662
01:03:41.739 --> 01:03:50.619
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>We I mean the perfect example of this is a week ago. I said to Kevin Oh, I think I might need so I think we might need some more time

663
01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:20.960
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>Yup, and I think the same day, so next day, yeah, and what's funny, and what's funny is I thought you just outright hit yourself because I am played at that moment actually and then I played it later

664
01:03:51.019 --> 01:03:53.820
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Before this episode because I've not even started playing the game yet

665
01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:03.699
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>So let's delay let's delay a week. No, it wasn't the same day. It was it was a couple of days later You came to me and said so should we do this week and I'm like yeah

666
01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:07.780
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Probably I think I've played enough to have an opinion on this. Yeah

667
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It's like I hadn't even started playing it before we delayed it and then undelate it

668
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:33.840
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>myself, like, "Oh, oh, this is quite!" Yeah, yeah, we played it, we literally, we've exhausted the material, I don't know what else to say.

669
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:29.260
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, because it's not that it's not that I hate it. It's just we played the entire game basically

670
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:39.260
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>It's it's it's it's like if you had a Pokemon game and you started playing it and you're like you catch a Pokemon and then

671
01:04:40.059 --> 01:04:42.059
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You catch a Pokemon

672
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:47.900
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>you mean pokemon go in the first release no not even that because that had like that

673
01:04:44.699 --> 01:04:50.539
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Well, no, but like there's limited Pokemon like if all the Pokemon just like they look different but they

674
01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:55.340
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>and they had different names, but they didn't do anything. You were just

675
01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:59.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>watching it and it was just there, and then there was nowhere to go with them, and nothing to do with them, and battles didn't exist.

676
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:07.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>You were just, there was one grassy area, and you went in there and you caught a Pokemon, and that was it, you would get very bored of that very quickly.

677
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Like, yeah.

678
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:15.059
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>We... hmm... I want it to...

679
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:21.500
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>I want this game to be good. Make it good. Please and thank you, and my thoughts on early access are as complicated as ever.

680
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:32.900
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>well it's game dev is an easy cue the the Sakurai big sigh the groan all right

681
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:34.400
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Yeah, it's it's honestly it's impressive anytime any game ever releases

682
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:43.860
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>yeah really is and you know hey we live in the post soaksong world anything is possible Anything

683
01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.300
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Can't believe we've got silk song before GTA 6. All right

684
01:05:48.539 --> 01:05:53.139
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Thank you Kevin for joining me for an interesting episode

685
01:05:51.500 --> 01:06:08.380
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I'm on the Twitter, I'm on Twitter sadly, but I still am.

686
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:57.420
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>Is there anything you would like to say to the audience?

687
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:21.159
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>And here's the thing though, when we had the release of the new Megas or whatever, was intended wasn't it when we got the new ones the all the starters come out

688
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.840
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>- Yeah.

689
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:50.500
<v ED08659D-9242-40A1-90D6-B10320CB48A8>I see on Twitter now which isn't the way it's in a bad thing but it's just hilarious because obviously there's a lot of that but go go for my feet you want to see retreating a bunch of Pokemon fan art that's all it is these days

690
01:06:21.559 --> 01:06:23.619
<v 4ECC0078-DAB1-4ED9-92C6-E6FA90CC4FDE>- Yes, yes it was, that was wild.
