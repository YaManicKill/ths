(1m 51s)

> and digitally."

(1m 52s)

(2m 3s) **Kevin:**

(2m 7s) **Al:**

> Before that, we have a bunch of news, but first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?

## What Have We Been Up To

(2m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Digimon most of it at the finish line, but who cares shut up? I got news of my own rainbow road radio

(2m 17s)

> It's the malaia movie. It happened. Did you see it? Did you see the trailer? I need to talk about the trailer

(2m 21s) **Al:**

> Where's I saw the trailer, what are you, what do you, what do you take me for, a fake farm?

(2m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I'm saying it to I'm talking to the listener really

(2m 27s)

> Okay, yeah, I'm today. Here's my Mario corner because you know remember what's on the hiatus question work

(2m 34s)

> Anyways, um, dang that movie looks good. Holy moly. Um, I

(2m 41s)

> See anime

(2m 42s)

> Okay, you and I are both enjoyed the first one

(2m 46s)

> And it looks like they're doing a lot of the same things that were done right the new cast there are the two members that were announced a plus

(2m 54s) **Al:**

> Hmm. First of all, so the guy who's doing Bowser Jr. can't

(2m 56s) **Kevin:**

> I

(2m 58s)

> Yeah, I

(2m 58s) **Al:**

> member his name, Benny something wasn't?

(3m) **Kevin:**

> Let me look at it because I was about to say I don't remember it. Maybe they're

(3m 4s)

> Let's see it is

(3m 6s)

> Benny's saffti

(3m 8s) **Al:**

> Benny Safti, right?

(3m 11s)

> I

(3m 13s)

> Honestly when I saw the trailer cuz the show does the trailer before they told us who was doing it

(3m 18s)

> I

(3m 20s)

> Legitimately thought it was just

(3m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Jack Black it's it is incredible. It's incredible how how dead on that is

(3m 24s) **Al:**

> Jack Black with a voice filter on it's so sounded like Jack like a squeaky Jack black video voice

(3m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Which is yeah

(3m 36s) **Al:**

> Okay, Google, see when I type in Bowser Jr. Ben.

(3m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(3m 39s) **Al:**

> Why am I getting Bowser Jr. Ben Shapiro?

(3m 43s)

> What is happening?

(3m 43s) **Kevin:**

> What I

(3m 45s)

> Mmm, that's deep floor. I don't know if I know that but so yeah, I look it's the movie looks good the voice is great and and

(3m 54s)

> Really, you know what no this is appropriate because it was me and you specifically out on the rainbow road radio where we

(4m 2s)

> Manifested Brie Larson and entering the the the the new MC of the Marvio cinematic universe

(4m 8s)

> I'm I'm so thrilled for her. She's probably thrilled to bits to be Rosalina because that's a boss character to be and holy

(4m 18s) **Al:**

> I can't remember, I can't remember if we made that prediction whether it would be Rosalina or just we were just in general saying it'd be great for it to be in it.

(4m 24s) **Kevin:**

> No, we were actually a live-action casting and we threw Brie in for peace. Yeah

(4m 26s) **Al:**

> Oh live action, oh live action be peach right makes sense yeah okay fair enough fair enough this works this works.

(4m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but yeah, she yeah, Brie Larson known Nintendo fan

(4m 37s)

> Look if I can breathe if you listen this somehow on the internet ether and you want to join an episode of our

(4m 44s)

> I'll learn how to edit. I'll get that up and running. We'll do it. Just just hit me up

(4m 48s) **Al:**

> I mean, I just like the implication that you listen to this podcast, you know, that's enough

(4m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Mmm, you never know. Look there was a non-zero chance. She's listened to an episode of rainbow road radio. I'm just saying

(5m 2s) **Al:**

> It's near zero.

(5m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Near zero, but not zero

(5m 6s) **Al:**

> Sure, sure. Technically, it's non-zero.

(5m 12s) **Kevin:**

> She's she sounds great as Rosalina Rosalina looks great they have her smash moves set in the trailer

(5m 18s)

> She does some of her smash moves

(5m 21s)

> Which is so cool. Uh, they're they're they're

(5m 24s)

> pretty solid with their references and whatnot. What one minor thing? So, you know, obviously Bowser Jr. with the painting, that's well established, but we get Bowser senior painting and that that's a fun little thing I think, you know, we see the through line there like father like son, but yeah, looks great. What's interesting is we got that, I forget the name of it, the desert Mexico world from Odyssey, we see it in the trailer.

(5m 52s)

> because there's the upside down period up here.

(5m 52s) **Al:**

> Hmm. Yeah. I hadn't noticed that, but yeah.

(5m 54s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, this is the opportunity where every little world is going to be a Mario reference of some kind.

(6m 6s)

> So.

(6m 6s) **Al:**

> - Yeah, so I'm intrigued as to what are they doing here, right?

(6m 10s)

> Because we've got Bowser Jr.

(6m 12s)

> And we've clearly got his story from Sunshine, right?

(6m 15s)

> Like you see him with the paintbrush.

(6m 17s)

> He, you know, they're doing his origin story, if you will.

(6m 23s)

> But we've also got, as you say, some things from Odyssey.

(6m 28s)

> And we've obviously got Rosalina, you know,

(6m 31s)

> from Galaxy and it's called Galaxy.

(6m 33s)

> So like, why did you...

(6m 36s)

> This is a feel like they've got multiple films that are smooshing together here.

(6m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Well, I mean, I think it's probably the right play because you know, it's not like

(6m 45s)

> Mari there's a plot I associate with every game or whatever

(6m 52s)

> It's just more the setting the vibes as the kid would say right so you know

(6m 57s)

> Taking bits here and they're just putting together into a little journey film. I think it works

(7m 4s)

> I'm okay with that

(7m 6s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna judge it until we see it. I'm just fascinated as to what they're what they're doing here. Like these, it's not like these stories have like a through line between them, right?

(7m 18s)

> Um, so it's, you know, and it's not like it's gonna be, uh, you know, an anthology or anything. Um, I think you probably could take any of the games and their stories and flesh them out to be a film.

(7m 32s)

> And so, Mike, are they just like...

(7m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know.

(7m 36s) **Al:**

> I don't know. Like, what's happening?

(7m 39s)

> I'm fascinated. Like, I don't understand how they're going to end up going into space,

(7m 44s)

> but also going to, you know, Mexico.

(7m 48s)

> Like, I don't, what plot brings them to both those places.

(7m 48s) **Kevin:**

> like it's it's the it's the woods

(7m 53s)

> It's the the stars are just falling the star we're shooting some look Bowser Jr. We're here. Let's go there. That's it. That's it. That's fine

(8m 2s) **Al:**

> I just, like, it feels like the going to multiple different places is a story, right?

(8m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(8m 6s) **Al:**

> Where you're like, "Oh, we're, we're, we're searching for something."

(8m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(8m 9s) **Al:**

> But I don't think that takes you to places on Earth and also going into space.

(8m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Well, the desert world is gonna be it's on the world. It's it's not gonna be

(8m 18s)

> on earth or Mario or through it or I know was but I think they're gonna take

(8m 19s) **Al:**

> So it's not so it's not the Odyssey level then because that was like.

(8m 24s) **Kevin:**

> liberty and just put it in some planet. That's what I think. That's what I would

(8m 28s) **Al:**

> I guess maybe you could yeah maybe I'm just look I just we I want I feel like if they're gonna do the sunshine story you got to do the sunshine story and get Mario arrested

(8m 32s) **Kevin:**

> that's it's it's literally

(8m 41s)

> Oh, oh, you know what? That is an excellent point. That's an excellent counterpoint.

(8m 45s) **Al:**

> Like sunshine you say like there's not a big a clear story in each of the games I agree with you but sunshine is the most story they have

(8m 53s) **Kevin:**

> You're right. He gets arrested. You have the big climactic fight with the robot. And that was

(8m 59s)

> your junior, the shadow mark. You're super right. That's sometimes it would be the one to

(9m 4s)

> turn into a film like that. Well, that is insane.

(9m 6s) **Al:**

> So it looks like they're taking the story of sunshine and throwing it into Mario Galaxy instead and I'm not saying I'm not saying that can't work. I'm just

(9m 12s) **Kevin:**

> they could still do it later because they don't have shadow Mario, right? Like, you know, I could play

(9m 18s)

> on that later. Yeah. Well, look, Bowser Junior has had the paintbrush way longer than sunshine at

(9m 19s) **Al:**

> Well, you don't I mean you don't know that like that was the whole point of the paintbrush

(9m 27s) **Kevin:**

> this point. So it's it's fine. Yeah, it is. Yeah, everything is when he was first there. Um, yeah.

(9m 30s) **Al:**

> Well, that was when it was first there.

(9m 37s)

> So like, I'm not, I just like, what do you do with the paint brush to start off with if it's not shadow my

(9m 44s) **Kevin:**

> he just he just has or or okay yeah putting my real Mario hat on

(9m 50s)

> it's it's the segue to the e-gad the little Luigi's Mansion movie yeah there he

(9m 54s) **Al:**

> Yeah, but you're still going to do something with the paintbrush, right?

(9m 58s) **Kevin:**

> I don't think he's gonna be in it

(10m 3s) **Al:**

> I'd be surprised if Shadow Mario wasn't in there.

(10m 8s) **Kevin:**

> the Bowser Junior has his already the show he gets a little like painted

(10m 12s)

> shadowy form already, they're not going to show you.

(10m 14s)

> It's fine.

(10m 15s) **Al:**

> We'll see. We'll see.

(10m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, just a couple other quick notes.

(10m 22s)

> One, okay, spoiler for people who didn't know or didn't

(10m 26s)

> watch the post credit scene from the first movie.

(10m 28s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm

(10m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Yo, she's in this film, but was noticeably

(10m 30s)

> not in this trailer.

(10m 32s) **Al:**

> Yeah, that's interesting. Is that like I wonder what the deal is with that is that just like he's gonna

(10m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Oh.

(10m 38s) **Al:**

> Like are they gonna find cuz because like he was his egg was in the sewers of New York on earth

(10m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah.

(10m 45s) **Al:**

> He wasn't in and maybe it maybe this is just our like oh

(10m 51s)

> That egg got there through the pipe and

(10m 54s)

> They're actually all in the mushroom kingdom or something weird like that.

(10m 58s)

> I just like what's what's going to be the link there? Why that?

(10m 59s) **Kevin:**

> knows maybe one one I don't know I'm I'm curious myself yeah I don't know

(11m 7s)

> that's a good question because you know we didn't see any regular New York

(11m 11s)

> or or whatever in the movie or in the trailer excuse me so I don't know

(11m 15s)

> that's a good question we'll see I mean we don't have any Yoshi it also

(11m 19s)

> we'll see but they do yeah but I managed that hard to go back and forth

(11m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well and and and Mario and Luigi live in the mushroom kingdom now after the first film

(11m 28s)

> I just I just suspect it's gonna be hand-waved away

(11m 30s) **Kevin:**

> oh yeah absolutely that of course that's the look I enjoyed the Mario

(11m 36s)

> movie I I'm not I still don't expect to be any high-level cinema or you

(11m 41s)

> know deep themes or whatever I expect everything to just get a hand wave

(11m 45s)

> the way

(11m 49s)

> did you have you seen the Yoshi render though because that's out there

(11m 54s)

> uh okay I love of it because it's my favorite form of spoilers and that's the

(11m 59s)

> merchandise spoiler when yeah yeah it's it's specifically it's uh

(12m 1s) **Al:**

> Oh, that was the that was the marriage by the way. Okay. I saw I saw you post about the marriage by the bed and actually click on it

(12m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Pillsbury Yoshi egg pattern cookie dough cookies

(12m 16s)

> yeah with the render of Yoshi on

(12m 20s)

> um oh I love those stupid merch spoilers and leaks um anyways

(12m 26s) **Al:**

> Some of them are so silly as well. Like the one the one that is the most ridiculous was the

(12m 31s)

> The Captain America brave new world red Hulk spoiler

(12m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, wait, which one?

(12m 36s) **Al:**

> Because that was that was a McDonald's toy like

(12m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah. Yeah, and I was used before.

(12m 40s) **Al:**

> Like six months six months before the film came out

(12m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I forgot about that.

(12m 47s) **Al:**

> Because yeah, we got right no

(12m 48s)

> It might be in a year or so because I was delayed by quite a long time

(12m 51s)

> And I know that they did have they did have Red Hulk in one of the trailers

(12m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, almost a year.

(12m 56s) **Al:**

> but I'm pretty sure that it was way before that that we spoiled in the

(12m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, they spoiled everything.

(13m 1s) **Al:**

> McDonald's League

(13m 2s) **Kevin:**

> yeah red hope uh the new falcon and uh

(13m 5s)

> all sorts of stuff yeah all that was a good one oh yeah I think Mario

(13m 10s)

> movie got spilled to actually the first one because we've got the

(13m 12s)

> leaders something the mark I believe I've I remember the Mario movie toys came

(13m 16s)

> out before the movie yeah well okay this is now okay I have two questions

(13m 18s) **Al:**

> Oh wait, I have seen this, I have seen this, this image. No, I did, I did click. He looks fine.

(13m 27s) **Kevin:**

> remaining one is yeah I know I agree he looks fine he looks like what I expect

(13m 31s) **Al:**

> Yeah, he looks like Yoshi. I don't know what to say.

(13m 31s) **Kevin:**

> sent Yoshi in the movie to look like

(13m 33s)

> yeah shocker

(13m 35s)

> one is he going to talk or is it gonna be Yoshi noises I'm leaning towards the

(13m 41s)

> ladder because that's another excuse to throw a big name in there

(13m 43s) **Al:**

> What do I think is gonna happen

(13m 44s)

> or what do I want to happen?

(13m 45s) **Kevin:**

> do you either or tell me both I guess

(13m 49s) **Al:**

> - I honestly don't know either way

(13m 50s)

> which way they would go with it

(13m 52s)

> because they've made some great decisions

(13m 54s)

> and they've made some bizarre decisions.

(13m 57s)

> You don't know, Chris Pratt.

(13m 57s) **Kevin:**

> no that wasn't a bizarre decision it was a not a not well like to see

(14m 5s)

> but I it makes sense to me why did

(14m 7s) **Al:**

> You remember when he did that thing

(14m 10s)

> like before any of the trailers came out?

(14m 13s)

> He was like, oh, I've been working on my Mario voice

(14m 15s)

> and then he does a voice that's just his voice.

(14m 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(14m 17s) **Al:**

> And then everybody was like, does he think,

(14m 21s)

> is this a bit or does he think he's doing

(14m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I

(14m 23s) **Al:**

> a different voice than normal?

(14m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Think one of my favorite parts of the whole Chris Pratt thing was the picture they used when they announced it you know like the black

(14m 31s) **Al:**

> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the head shot.

(14m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I like just something about that just just felt so foreboding

(14m 38s) **Al:**

> I've been watching, have you,

(14m 40s)

> you've probably not watched the studio

(14m 43s)

> Apple TV?

(14m 43s) **Kevin:**

> No

(14m 44s) **Al:**

> But it's our, I call my dear about like the industry

(14m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that sounds good

(14m 48s) **Al:**

> but it's the main, the main character is Seth Rogan

(14m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(14m 54s) **Al:**

> and the reason I say that is because

(14m 56s)

> like every time he laughs, I'm like, don't get calm.

(14m 58s)

[laughing]

(15m 1s)

> And it's like, I've not seen a huge amount

(15m 4s)

> of stuff with him in it and I just realized

(15m 5s)

> like the don't get calm, like his laugh is just his laugh.

(15m 8s) **Kevin:**

> It is. Yeah. No, it is. Yeah. Like Seth Rogan was a good pick for that bit, but that was just a

(15m 8s) **Al:**

> Like the, it's just, it's really,

(15m 13s)

[laughing]

(15m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Seth Rogan, you know, it was. Um,

(15m 17s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't,

(15m 18s)

> I don't just like him as don't come.

(15m 21s)

> I really hope they just do noises.

(15m 24s)

> And obviously there is precedent for them like,

(15m 24s) **Kevin:**

> I will yeah

(15m 27s) **Al:**

> 'cause like Mario doesn't really talk,

(15m 29s)

> like he just only says a few phrases and stuff like that.

(15m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(15m 33s) **Al:**

> But I think if I think, here's why I really want you

(15m 37s)

> to talk.

(15m 38s)

> Not just because like you're, it doesn't talk,

(15m 41s)

> she just makes sure she noises, right?

(15m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(15m 43s) **Al:**

> But also, if Yoshi talks, Link is going to talk.

(15m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Dude Link is gonna talk

(15m 50s)

> Link is gonna look no it's not Yoshi Mario talking Mario talk even Link was gonna talk that that was already sent stone for me

(15m 55s) **Al:**

> No, I don't think, I think there's difference there because, yeah, Link makes noises, but he doesn't say any words.

(16m 1s) **Kevin:**

> That that's very true he does say

(16m 2s) **Al:**

> Where does Mario did say words?

(16m 5s) **Kevin:**

> He does say hogi and wind waker when he pushes and pulls expressing his love of seeing

(16m 10s) **Al:**

> Oh, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't played that. Is that a joke?

(16m 13s)

> This is like, this is like gay bows are all over it again.

(16m 13s) **Kevin:**

> I don't actually know it sounds like the English word for hogi hogi anyways

(16m 18s)

> Yeah, exactly

(16m 21s)

> Yeah, well the only thing that Yoshi might not talk because he's not a human right because Mario was human or his short-weight or whatever

(16m 30s) **Al:**

> Yeah. They made the Luma's talk. I'm not unhappy about that. I do think it works with what they've

(16m 30s) **Kevin:**

> So you know makes sense

(16m 32s)

> Yeah, oh, you know

(16m 36s)

> Yeah, yeah, no

(16m 37s) **Al:**

> done. But I just,

(16m 38s) **Kevin:**

> They've done a good job with their decisions whether you like the decision or you know that's

(16m 43s)

> another manner, but I think they did a good job with the decisions and actually yeah, well the most okay I think most

(16m 46s) **Al:**

> Trisprach

(16m 52s)

> Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, that's he's legitimately the only casting issue I have with any of these

(16m 58s) **Kevin:**

> people everyone else like yep though that's a goal that's a goal and then the crisp but anyway okay I won't go too

(17m 6s)

> deep in it because I mean that's that's all thing anyways say that we never actually did review the

(17m 10s)

> Yeah, that's it, and our, so we'll get to that.

(17m 13s)

> But there is one final issue or a question, I mean, there's, there's a lot of stuff, but there's a lot of,

(17m 15s) **Al:**

> Is that not just 'cause Alex didn't, what doesn't like it?

(17m 17s)

[laughing]

(17m 19s)

> Doesn't want to talk about it.

(17m 20s)

[laughing]

(17m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Mario stuff to talk about. We did, there was plenty to cover anyways. Um, uh, the other question,

(17m 30s)

> do we get the depressed Luma back? Will it return? Now is it a cameo or is it going to be like the Luma?

(17m 34s) **Al:**

> Oh, all for sure, for sure.

(17m 37s)

> So my right, do you want my theory for this?

(17m 44s)

> The reason they go into space is to get the lima back to Rosalina.

(17m 51s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know because we see because the stars are falling we see

(17m 56s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(17m 59s)

> Yes, but why are the stars falling? We don't know why and I think it's because Rosalina's trying to find the missing luma

(18m 6s) **Kevin:**

> I guess, I think it's going to be more Bowser Junior is often space when we have to chase him, but whatever, okay, then

(18m 15s) **Al:**

> No, I don't think we find, I don't think we find Bowser Junior to a lens space because he introduces himself in space.

(18m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Does it

(18m 24s) **Al:**

> I'm pretty sure that's what happens in the trailer. You're on Rosalina's space station.

(18m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, you might be right. Here we are. You know as we do frame by framing and over analyzing the two-minute trailer

(18m 40s)

> Oh, it's April. I didn't just realize it in cats. That's soon. Oh, that's coming soon. Oh, wow. Oh, that's exciting

(18m 47s)

> Well, I'm hyped for this movie rainbow road radio presents. Kevin is excited for the Mario movie galaxy movie whatever Rosie looks great or dresses. I'll shine

(18m 58s)

> - Ah, I'm so excited.

(19m 1s)

> - Okay.

(19m 2s)

> - All right.

(19m 2s) **Al:**

> Also, like I just I would I just I think these sequences in this trailer have been put there to

(19m 2s) **Kevin:**

> - Ow.

(19m 11s) **Al:**

> To miss leaders. I don't think that these are the sequences that the trailer the

(19m 16s)

> The order that the sequences are happening in but yeah, no, no, yeah, that's definitely so I'm I'm looking back at the bit with with

(19m 23s)

> Preserve Jr. He's he's deaf. That's definitely Rosalina's space. Oh, no, maybe as peaches castle

(19m 29s) **Kevin:**

> It's hard to tell because it's a green area with a castle-like building and you see other like structures in the back and

(19m 33s) **Al:**

> But yeah, but it's definitely not in like you're either not in the mushroom kingdom or

(19m 41s)

> You're like in a bubble or something like that. So I guess maybe as come down

(19m 47s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know. It's hard to say. It looks a little big for her observatory, but you know,

(19m 55s)

> they might be mixing it up.

(19m 56s) **Al:**

> But that also, when you see that later on, you definitely, it's not the same design as in Galaxy.

(20m 3s)

> Like it looks much bigger.

(20m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. We'll see, but I'm excited. All right. There you go. Rainbow Road mini

(20m 12s)

> segment over. I'll tell me what you've been up to. Okay. Wait. I forget. Okay. I've listened to

(20m 14s) **Al:**

> Ah, welcome on!

(20m 19s) **Kevin:**

> the episodes, but I don't even remember. Have you had, you hit credits, right? You beat it?

(20m 24s) **Al:**

> So, I don't think I had last time, last episode, but I have no, yes.

(20m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Okay. You have hit credits. Okay.

(20m 30s) **Al:**

> So, I have, I have done almost everything in the game.

(20m 35s)

> So, I hit credits, I've completed the Pokedex, I've done all by one of the side quests.

(20m 44s)

> All by one of like your research quests.

(20m 48s)

> So, there's very, it's basically all I've got left to do is battles.

(20m 54s)

> A lot of battles to do, but with no real aim other than finishing it.

(21m 1s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(21m 1s) **Al:**

> The absolute, I presume you know about the final battle research task.

(21m 6s) **Kevin:**

> - Uh, here, text to me, tell me, I might, I don't root.

(21m 12s) **Al:**

> I'm just going to say it's not a big spoiler, you have to get you have to have a thousand battles.

(21m 14s) **Kevin:**

> - Okay.

(21m 17s)

> - Oh, okay, no, I didn't know that, dang.

(21m 18s) **Al:**

> You have to win a thousand battles to get the shiny charm.

(21m 20s) **Kevin:**

> - Woo.

(21m 24s)

> - Woo, that's how you get the shiny charm.

(21m 26s) **Al:**

> Well, so you get the shiny charm by doing every single research task. So there's research tasks

(21m 31s)

> that give you points and you go up levels and once you've done all of the research tasks,

(21m 35s)

> you have maxed out the research levels and the last one is the shiny

(21m 42s)

> charm. But when you've if you've done everything else except the final task, you need 100 more

(21m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(21m 48s)

> Yep

(21m 48s) **Al:**

> points to get the final level. But the final research task gives you a thousand. So it's so unnecessary.

(21m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's cruel. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, I love that

(21m 58s) **Al:**

> And there's there's no other way you can't get the shiny you don't have to do every single

(22m 6s)

> research task because of how the points work. But you have to do that one. You cannot get enough

(22m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but you have to do that one.

(22m 10s) **Al:**

> points without doing that.

(22m 12s)

> And I thought so I have done almost everything in except the last thing that is basically like you have to like when when the post game battle thing like a certain amount of times before you then do the final main story which unlocks the final side quest.

(22m 25s) **Kevin:**

> okay so okay now are these battles the the the royale battles or like wild battles

(22m 29s) **Al:**

> So I've done everything except that and I am like 300 battles.

(22m 39s)

> It can be any battle.

(22m 40s) **Kevin:**

> too okay wild battles too oh it has to be a trainer okay well

(22m 42s) **Al:**

> But it has to be a trainer battle.

(22m 44s)

> It has to be a trainer battle, but it can be any trainer battle.

(22m 49s)

> So like most people who don't want to do it manually, they're like setting up,

(22m 55s)

> they've got cafe battle cafes like they had in X and Y and you can just,

(22m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's right.

(22m 59s) **Al:**

> you can set up a macro which is like shoulder button A and it just keeps spamming

(23m 4s)

> that and it will win battles and eventually you can get them done in like eight hours of a macro.

(23m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Grab that rubber band around that control stick, good times.

(23m 12s) **Al:**

> So yeah, that's probably while I end up doing, but I'm going to finish the last main quest and

(23m 20s)

> side quest because they're mostly battle related as well. So I'll just get them done

(23m 25s)

> once I've done that. I'll still have like 600 battles to go. It's absolutely mad.

(23m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I agree. That that is absolutely

(23m 30s) **Al:**

> Like I think it would be one thing if it was 500 was the top one because I don't think,

(23m 36s)

> I don't think anyone's going to get 500 now play through. And so like saying like,

(23m 40s)

> You have to then do another

(23m 42s)

> 100 on top of that is mad I don't know who made that decision and it's weird that they've

(23m 47s) **Kevin:**

> bad thing. That's wild.

(23m 51s) **Al:**

> not like I feel like they could have put in like an with the dance day that you got the updated

(23m 58s)

> game to add in a a dancy which adds in like another side quest to get the dancy like they could have

(23m 59s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(24m 4s) **Al:**

> easily just added in like another like another pokedex quest that once you've got the answer you get

(24m 10s)

> another hundred points and you wouldn't have to do this.

(24m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(24m 12s) **Al:**

> But no no and I'm also like do I actually want to do this just now or do I want to wait the what three weeks until the DLC comes out because maybe there'll be more research tasks then.

(24m 23s) **Kevin:**

> and that's a "maybe" still?

(24m 24s) **Al:**

> Is that is a maybe yeah I don't know like I how much do I want to do shiny hunting between now and then that's the big question.

(24m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah...

(24m 33s)

> Don't you want that tree flow of shiny cocoonas or whatever?

(24m 39s)

> Well, you know what this is, this is Mabel's Revenge.

(24m 42s)

> This is her ultimate revenge for everything that happened.

(24m 43s) **Al:**

> Yeah, what can we expect of a terrorist?

(24m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh, look, we'll get to it.

(24m 49s)

> get to it but I mean I think you were you saw that the screen

(24m 53s)

> shot of the the gen nine professors but what we'll get to that because we have

(24m 57s) **Al:**

> Yes, yes, yes we do we do so yeah I'm pretty much done the game but obviously I've still got many many hours to put in with shiny hunting

(24m 57s) **Kevin:**

> another professor to talk to you about I mean okay well alright well look I know

(25m 9s)

> you've said it but now that it's officially you've beaten it is thumbs up okay

(25m 16s) **Al:**

> No, yeah, it definitely thumbs up.

(25m 18s) **Kevin:**

> There we go. That's why I bought.

(25m 18s) **Al:**

> I think if you liked Legends Arceus, you will like this game.

(25m 24s) **Kevin:**

> There we go. I like legend Arcus a lot.

(25m 26s) **Al:**

> There might be, there will definitely be things that you miss in that and probably other

(25m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, like Arisu.

(25m 32s) **Al:**

> games as well, because it does the standard Pokemon thing of, here's all these features

(25m 36s)

> you loved in this previous game, they're not here.

(25m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Never. You're never allowed.

(25m 39s) **Al:**

> So the classic Pokemon thing, if you're really annoyed with Pokemon just now, you will

(25m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(25m 46s) **Al:**

> continue to be really annoyed with the Pokemon.

(25m 48s)

> If you want to play a good, if you want to, if you want to like it, and you liked previous

(25m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Wait.

(25m 54s) **Al:**

> ones, you will like this.

(25m 55s)

> If you're really annoyed and you're like, I'm nothing will make me happy except a pair

(26m)

> of a game, then maybe stay away from it.

(26m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Wait, you're sending me mixed message. I like legends arcades, but I'm also annoyed with Pokemon

(26m 3s) **Al:**

> I think if you're, I mean, if you like, I think with everything, if you go in with a, I'm

(26m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Which which one's gonna win?

(26m 13s) **Al:**

> willing to enjoy this, you'll probably enjoy it.

(26m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(26m 16s) **Al:**

> You'll also be annoyed with it, but you'll also enjoy it.

(26m 17s) **Kevin:**

> No, sure yeah, no, I mean I say that but I know why this land like I'm already I'm excited for the game

(26m 24s)

> They are bits that annoy me for sure, but yeah, I'm glad it's good overall for people who like it

(26m 31s) **Al:**

> If you want a perfect game stop, play in Pokemon

(26m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh gosh, yes. Oh gosh, yes

(26m 36s) **Al:**

> You'll play Hades too, right?

(26m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Go play Kirby air writers dropping

(26m 43s) **Al:**

> I'm like

(26m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Actually, I think by the time this drops it'll be out or very close may be after whatever

(26m 47s) **Al:**

> Is it Friday?

(26m 49s) **Kevin:**

> It's the 20th the four days from now, so Thursday, I think

(26m 53s) **Al:**

> Oh, that's Thursday, yeah, day after this drops

(26m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, there's it

(26m 56s) **Al:**

> Thursday, why are they dropping loads at? Why because Pokemon did that as well it came out on a Thursday. What's with all the games

(27m 3s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know and is weird they they're big on Fridays, but okay, I mean Pokemon can drop whatever who when it ever doesn't matter

(27m 12s)

> But Kirby, I don't know that that's weird guess cuz soccer, right? I don't whatever. I don't know who cares. I'm

(27m 17s) **Al:**

> Mokopi is also coming out in a Thursday. What's happening? What's with the intent to when all these games coming out in Thursday's night?

(27m 23s) **Kevin:**

> It's the daylight savings time

(27m 24s) **Al:**

> All right.

(27m 26s)

> The day savings.

(27m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, there you go

## Game News

(27m 29s) **Al:**

> All right. Let's talk about some news.

(27m 31s) **Kevin:**

> - All right.

(27m 33s) **Al:**

> Up first, we have Dave the diver have released a switch to edition.

(27m 36s)

> It is free if you already own. It's actually free the most people say it's free.

(27m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Wow!

(27m 42s) **Al:**

> If you're ideal in the game, technically it's free.

(27m 44s)

> if you don't on the game it's just obviously you can you can't

(27m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I like that download the upgrade pack, but no game

(27m 47s) **Al:**

> launch it cuz I forgot I forgot that I had Dave the Diver on Steam so I

(27m 54s)

> went and clicked on the the switch to edition and clicked on the upgrade

(27m 58s)

> pack and bought it well bought it for zero pounds added in my switch and then

(28m) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's sick.

(28m 4s) **Al:**

> realized wait I don't have the game so I have the upgrade pack I don't have the

(28m 10s)

> base game it's high resolution and higher free

(28m 13s) **Kevin:**

> - That's great, I love that.

(28m 18s) **Al:**

> additional anything so if you're looking for more content that's not what you

(28m 22s)

> got here but I also feel like Dave the Diver is not a game I was needing more

(28m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, which

(28m 30s) **Al:**

> resolution and higher frame rate like I'm not really sure what I'm expecting

(28m 31s) **Kevin:**

> I was about to say how do you hire a resolution pixel art, okay?

(28m 38s) **Al:**

> here it was already a great game it looked great it ran great right like okay

(28m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(28m 43s) **Al:**

> I guess we can have higher frame rate on this.

(28m 47s)

> That game that runs perfectly.

(28m 49s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(28m 52s)

> Okay

(28m 53s)

> Yeah, we did month. I was on it Yeah, yeah, that's a good time. Yeah

(28m 55s) **Al:**

> Did you play? I can't remember. Did you play Dave the diver?

(29m)

> Oh, yes, of course. Everybody played Dave the diver.

(29m 4s)

> I made everybody play it.

(29m 6s)

> Great game. If you've not played it, go play it.

(29m 9s)

> This is a great time to go get it. It is only 17 pounds.

(29m 13s)

> I don't know what it is in dollars.

(29m 15s) **Kevin:**

> can't guarantee which limited edition paid

(29m 18s)

> uh...

(29m 19s)

> deals these are available right now

(29m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, for sure.

(29m 21s) **Kevin:**

> uh...

(29m 22s)

> the one glaring flaw

(29m 26s) **Al:**

> Next, we have Dragon Shelter.

(29m 28s)

> Their Kickstarter pre-launch is no live, which is not very much news.

(29m 37s)

> All you can do is click on it and click Save and get notified when the Kickstarter launches.

(29m 41s)

> But if you're really excited about the farming game with dragons,

(29m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, look, I mean, it is cool. I'll say that the dragons and and they built this up and jumping on trampolines and cooking. That's cool, but I'm just not a fan. Look movies do the same thing. Here's the teaser trailer drops tomorrow. Get excited. Yes, not a fan of that. Yeah, but anyways the game's cute.

(30m 1s) **Al:**

> Yeah, it's news of news and announcement of an announcement.

(30m 9s)

> I get I kind of get it for a Kickstarter, right? Because like it's such a

(30m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you got to get the algorithm. Yeah, that's true. That is true. Yep, that algorithm. You got to get got to get in there. I need to see more I think, but I like the concept, but we'll see.

(30m 13s) **Al:**

> like you got to get people excited your first day and your last day are your biggest days for

(30m 18s)

> kickstarters. So I totally get why people do it because if they get loads of people to

(30m 23s)

> to follow it, then they're more likely to get it quickly.

(30m 30s)

> I

(30m 31s)

> decided as to whether I'm backing this we shall

(30m 42s)

> I will consider it. Next we have out and about and a bit their big summer update is launching the end of the time.

(30m 52s)

> Sorry. It's something very funny about this. So just to clear up the confusion, summer in the game, not in real life.

(31m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Wait what oh, okay. It's that southern hemisphere summer

(31m 4s) **Al:**

> So it's the it's stuff related to summer in the game. I'm pretty sure.

(31m 13s)

> So the story will continue with three more friendship, friendship levels per character, a new character moving to town. The season will change to summer.

(31m 20s)

> The season will change to summer with lots of new summer plants and mushrooms and also new skins of existing plants.

(31m 28s)

> Whereas interesting is the way this words it makes it sound like everybody is going to be changing to summer when the update comes out, but I'm guessing that's not it, right?

(31m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Probably not. I, okay. You know, it is good. That, that would be very weird.

(31m 47s)

> Man, it's like Pokemon seasons, but you're forced to.

(31m 56s)

> I, I will say it's interesting because this is the game where it's heavy about

(31m 59s)

> like foraging and looking at little plants and stuff.

(32m 3s)

> So, you know, changing the season would actually have a big impact.

(32m 7s)

> Presumably on the, you know, floor and fauna you can interact with.

(32m 12s)

> So that is neat.

(32m 15s) **Al:**

> Yes, there's also a new area and a paddleboard to move around the lake.

(32m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, okay. Oh, okay

(32m 23s)

> You do you okay paddle. Yeah, that's a new one. I don't think anyone's paddled before our paddle boarded. So all right

(32m 28s) **Al:**

> Yeah. I'm sure there's a game that's done it, but yeah, I've not seen one.

(32m 33s)

> It's launching at the end of November. Next, we have an update that's actually out,

(32m 37s)

> and that's the story of season's grand bizarre 1.2 update. This adds more items,

(32m 42s)

> more rewards to the bingo that they added in the last update.

(32m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Did you think, mmm, I think I'll wait to be a sushi chef before I play this game?

(32m 52s)

> Well, now you can join in, finally.

(32m 52s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Here we go. Not just the suit, you could not only get look like a sushi set.

(32m 58s)

> You can also have a sushi glider in both tuna or shrimp.

(33m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I'm down for that trip has the tail, a little

(33m 9s)

> shrimp tail. Yeah. Oh, that's a good one. Oh, that's like my brother Calvin is, it's

(33m 10s) **Al:**

> of course it's shrimp.

(33m 14s)

> There you go, I'm not a big shrimp guy.

(33m 21s) **Kevin:**

> probably one of his three favorite top three favorite foods like shrimp engine. I live

(33m 25s)

> by the coast growing up into the large portion of my up

(33m 31s)

> up until pretty much I moved to Atlanta. So I'm big on seafood in general and shrimp's good.

(33m 35s) **Al:**

> I like lots of different fishes, I'm just not a shrimp fan.

(33m 40s)

> There's something weird about the taste.

(33m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, sure. Okay. You know, shrimp is interesting because it's so hard to compare to anything

(33m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(33m 49s) **Kevin:**

> else. But but I get it. Yeah. Yeah. It tastes like shrimp. Yeah. All right.

(33m 50s) **Al:**

> It tastes like shrimp

(33m 53s)

> Next speaking of grand bazaar, we have

(33m 57s)

> finally we know about the

(33m 59s)

> Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma crossover with grand bazaar and that is that the animals are coming the grand bazaar animals are

(34m 8s)

> Live in Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma

(34m 11s)

> So if you want some

(34m 13s)

> grand bizarre if you want some story of seasons animals in your room factory.

(34m 18s)

> Finally, finally you can do it.

(34m 19s) **Kevin:**

> I thought that was already in there, I thought that was part of the deal, I thought the cow would always be present in either title, okay.

(34m 30s) **Al:**

> No, I think Rimfactory M has like monster animals basically

(34m 37s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, yeah, but that cow though.

(34m 40s) **Al:**

> Well four story seasons not for Rimfactory. Come on get with it

(34m 46s) **Kevin:**

> should be.

(34m 47s) **Al:**

> The other day is out now

(34m 50s)

> All right next we've got Pokemon pokopia. We got

## Pokopia

(34m 52s) **Kevin:**

> We're doing it, we're doing it now, we're doing it, the real meat of the episode, that's

(34m 57s) **Al:**

> We got a ten

(35m)

> minute trailer for this game. We learned so much. Let's go through the things that people complain about first.

(35m 4s) **Kevin:**

> good one, nothing, we're done.

(35m 9s) **Al:**

> $70 game. It is a $70 game. You know what? Fine, I get the complaints. I'm still buying it.

(35m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, not on that, I'm going to say it's worth it, but I get it though.

(35m 21s) **Al:**

> I think it'll be worth it as well, but I totally get it. I totally get it.

(35m 24s) **Kevin:**

> But I get it, yes, I get it, yeah, they're right, but it's worth it, it's going to be worth

(35m 29s)

> more than another $70 games, I'm going to you, Mark, or world, sorry.

(35m 31s) **Al:**

> Well, yeah.

(35m 34s)

> Wow. I really fell off a cliff, didn't it?

(35m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Boy did they?

(35m 39s) **Al:**

> Two game key. It's on the game key cards. You can buy it digitally or with the game key card, not with the game loaded onto a cart.

(35m 47s)

> We're going to talk about that later. So probably no point to talk about it here. I suspect.

(35m 53s) **Kevin:**

> - Okay, okay, sure, sure.

(35m 53s) **Al:**

> Let's talk about it later. Let's talk about it later. But it was announced that that is the case.

(36m)

> It's coming out on the 5th of March.

(36m 4s) **Kevin:**

> that soon, well, I was like, okay, that's, that's my one minor, right, could, what

(36m 4s) **Al:**

> It's very soon. It is a week after Pokémon Day.

(36m 13s) **Kevin:**

> it have killed them to push the week up, you know, released early by a week, would it,

(36m 18s)

> But in the end, it may be a wood of button.

(36m 19s) **Al:**

> Maybe it would have

(36m 22s)

> Because then no, so this is so this is the thing then it would have been a February release rather than a March release and they have a different game that they want to release in February instead

(36m 28s) **Kevin:**

> I hate this. I hate this.

(36m 35s)

> They already, what was it? I think they're saying out something dropping. Oh, the DLC drops that day.

(36m 39s) **Al:**

> The deep the what do you see?

(36m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, legends, the Z8 DLC, I think drops that day.

(36m 45s) **Al:**

> That's December

(36m 46s) **Kevin:**

> December? I could have sworn there's something they already announced dropping on the 26th.

(36m 50s) **Al:**

> There is yeah, so there's something in January. What was it?

(36m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Now on Pokemon!

(36m 56s) **Al:**

> No, so I think

(36m 58s)

> Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, but I think you're confusing the fact that they originally said that

(37m 3s)

> The the news story for the DLC would drop by the 28th of February and and so we were assuming. Oh, that means it's coming on Pokemon day, right?

(37m 14s)

> Because that's the day after Pokemon day

(37m 17s)

> But then the announced last

(37m 19s)

> week that it's actually coming out on the 10th of December instead. I don't know why they said by then,

(37m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, I get this from

(37m 24s) **Al:**

> it was such a weird thing to do to be like oh yeah this DLC is going to release by this day and then

(37m 28s)

> release it two months before that. It's a really weird decision.

(37m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that is very weird. I don't know, but okay, that it's must be what I'm thinking but okay, but well

(37m 37s) **Al:**

> Oh, animal crossing that's coming in January the switch to update and the 3.0 update that's coming in January

(37m 40s) **Kevin:**

> But

(37m 42s)

> But still it couldn't have been that hard to do it

(37m 46s) **Al:**

> Well, we don't know what's coming we don't know what the release is for February yet, right? They've got there might be something big

(37m 49s) **Kevin:**

> All right, okay, okay fine, you're right legends joto will drop that day instead fine fine fair no

(37m 54s) **Al:**

> No, just Nintendo in general

(37m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but it's Pokemon day. Oh, okay. All right. I'll try to hold it

(38m 1s) **Al:**

> They've very rarely actually released something on Pokemon day, right like Pokemon day is for telling us all about

(38m 2s) **Kevin:**

> all right. Moving past that. Yeah, they kind of do. Yeah, yeah, okay. Oh, yeah,

(38m 7s) **Al:**

> The things that we won't get from months and also all about the master's update

(38m 15s) **Kevin:**

> the three K gems you get for logging on right now. You're right. It's enough to do a

(38m 20s) **Al:**

> And I'm like, I always think there's like, I don't know if this is a lot or not.

(38m 25s) **Kevin:**

> pull. So it's it's a decent amount. Um, it's.

(38m 29s) **Al:**

> All right, so fifth of March, uh, what else we got?

(38m 32s) **Kevin:**

> All right. So let's recap. So was it Jen's one through eight? All your professors.

(38m 32s) **Al:**

> So we got Professor Tangro.

(38m 41s) **Kevin:**

> They're named after treat trees T he Jen nine. We've got robot clones of your

(38m 46s)

> dead parents. We've got a wanted terrorist under house arrest. And that'll

(38m 50s) **Al:**

> Now, can Vic convicted, convicted, terrorist?

(38m 51s) **Kevin:**

> tank growth. Sorry. Excuse me. Yes, convicted. Oh, my apologies. Yes. That's great.

(38m 55s)

> convicted terrorist under house arrest and tank growth, baby.

(39m 1s) **Al:**

> So this is really funny, right?

(39m 2s)

> So this 10 minute trailer, right?

(39m 4s)

> You start watching it and you're like,

(39m 5s)

> okay, yeah, this is what I see.

(39m 6s)

> You've got this lovely looking, you know,

(39m 8s)

> this lovely drag and quest builders world.

(39m 11s)

> I'm loving the look of it.

(39m 12s)

> It's exactly what I would want from this.

(39m 15s)

> And then you see this like destroyed town.

(39m 18s)

> You see that the Pokémon Center,

(39m 19s)

> the I theorized was just the design of a house,

(39m 22s)

> but no, it's an actual Pokémon Center.

(39m 23s)

> You see it destroyed.

(39m 25s)

> Then you see a tan growth.

(39m 26s)

> And then, oh wait, this tan growth for some reason

(39m 29s)

> has some glosses and a

(39m 31s)

> I don't know I kind of love this and what I find really funny is the way that okay

(39m 32s) **Kevin:**

> and great hair somehow.

(39m 47s) **Al:**

> no I'm jumping I'm jumping the gun should we should we follow the trailer and talk about it as we

(39m 50s)

> go well professor time goes this early early on so we can we can talk about him just now so first of all

(39m 51s) **Kevin:**

> - All right, sure, let me open the trailer,

(39m 52s)

> but I like Professor Danker.

(39m 54s)

> Let me put that on the record.

(39m 59s)

> Yes.

(40m 1s) **Al:**

> I guess destroyed town clearly right we see destroyed buildings we see a destroyed pokemon

(40m 7s)

> center I like the theory that this is cinnabar island because they like all of the music in this

(40m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's good. I like that a lot.

(40m 17s) **Al:**

> trailer is remixed kanto music

(40m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh, that's good. I like that a lot. There's a, and, and Tengla's live near center,

(40m 26s)

> well, they're like a sea root away, but now that it's, it's all fitting in. I like it.

(40m 27s) **Al:**

> Well, there you go. There you go, uh-huh, it's not going to be right just before we get

(40m 33s) **Kevin:**

> No. Yeah. Yeah.

(40m 34s) **Al:**

> too excited about it. It's not going to be it's going to be a new region. We know that right,

(40m 38s)

> but let me get excited. Let me get let me pretend.

(40m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Well, n-hmm!

(40m 41s)

> Yeah, well, you know, you might get the answer later, but okay, let's let's keep going trailer. So where we're back to Ditto person

(40m 47s) **Al:**

> And then we got we're okay. I'm about about 50 seconds. That's where I'm just now

(40m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, sure, yep, okay

(40m 53s) **Al:**

> So we've got Professor Tang growth just looking very lonely. Oh

(40m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yup, all by himself. It's pretty is really lonely. You very said. I love you Professor Tengra. I'll do I'll do anything he asks me anything I'm gonna kill that guy

(40m 58s) **Al:**

> So sad so sad

(41m 7s)

> And then and then we come back to the original thing, which is where a digital pops out of its poke bowl, right?

(41m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I'll do it. I'll do it

(41m 15s)

> me and cue the existential horror. First of all, first of all, that poke about warps out of

(41m 18s) **Al:**

> And no, but this is but we get more information here, right? Because

(41m 23s) **Kevin:**

> nowhere. It's like a beam and just materializes. Maybe, maybe.

(41m 25s) **Al:**

> It does it does is that interdimensional travel. I don't know

(41m 30s)

> But but see here's another thing we then

(41m 34s)

> Get this poke decks on the ground, which has a picture of this

(41m 38s)

> Digital or add it oh, but I'm guess it is clearly meant to be this digital next to a trainer in front of the pokemon center

(41m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yep. Yep. Clearly. Yeah. No. That's, I mean, if you look in the background of the shot,

(41m 46s) **Al:**

> So this

(41m 47s)

> Trainer died in the apocalypse, right? Yeah

(41m 54s) **Kevin:**

> there's ruined stuff. It's, it's clear that somebody died here. Yeah. No, definitely.

(41m 58s) **Al:**

> There's like a it's a wheelbarrow and some boot a book and berries

(42m 2s) **Kevin:**

> I thought it was like a boat. I don't know. There's,

(42m 4s) **Al:**

> All this so there's definitely so there's a substitute doll there. There's a cherry belly cherry

(42m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Cherryberry leopard bear whatever one of those berries is a barrier book.

(42m 11s) **Al:**

> Berry a book a ball I saw a ball or is that another

(42m 17s)

> Berry as a pile of books maybe a towel

(42m 18s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Just a whole bunch of stuff kind of like it looks like a shipwreck sort of thing.

(42m 23s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah

(42m 25s) **Kevin:**

> Just a bunch of debris. That's like

(42m 28s) **Al:**

> And then we've got this this trainer who's obviously dead now and digital stairs and turns into

(42m 35s)

> a version of its trainer I guess

(42m 38s)

> Well, why I wanted to check out was what does this pokemon center look like? Because

(42m 44s) **Kevin:**

> compared in the model. Yeah, I think some sort of canton

(42m 46s) **Al:**

> Yeah, so I think...

(42m 47s)

> that looks like the Let's Go Pokemon Center.

(42m 53s)

> Yeah, so definitely looking at the Let's Go model, it's almost identical to that.

(43m 1s)

> Let's see if we've got...

(43m 3s)

> It's just a list of...

(43m 7s) **Kevin:**

> You'd think there'd be the way to go Joe Serra being finally, you know, this is your time to shine and then look at his glottings, though

(43m 16s)

> I don't know it looks like the I think the fire red leaf green center too

(43m 22s) **Al:**

> which would make sense. The other one that I was thinking of was whether it looked like Sun

(43m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, but okay, but it's

(43m 27s) **Al:**

> and Moon or not, because I remember them looking very similar, but it does not. It does not look

(43m 31s)

> like at all. Yeah, I think this is I think this is meant to be a can. This is definitely a can

(43m 34s) **Kevin:**

> But yeah, you know one thing

(43m 38s)

> Yeah, it feels like that and I mean the whole like you said, there's the music the vast majority of the Pokemon are cantonian

(43m 39s) **Al:**

> tool for commands.

(43m 48s)

> Although fewer and fewer, we're getting a lot more non-canto pokemon, especially from this trailer.

(43m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I mean tang growth, right what we didn't know one comment about professor tang growth

(43m 54s) **Al:**

> Well... yeah... sure.

(43m 58s) **Kevin:**

> This is the deepest cut. I don't know if this was intentional or not

(44m 2s)

> But because he has one who is you know vines kind of sticking up like a hair or something

(44m 7s)

> And then a TM kind of stuck on it, right? There's the CD disc. I don't I feel like it's intentional because it's but it's so

(44m 9s) **Al:**

> - Uh-huh, yep.

(44m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Specific and niche if you go back to actually I believe it's the fire at leaf green games

(44m 23s)

> And you use a TM on a Pokemon do you

(44m 27s)

> The there's an animation of the TM being slapped on their forehead to learn them move

(44m 32s) **Al:**

> Do you think his tang growth trying to learn a move?

(44m 34s) **Kevin:**

> It's incredibly specific, but it's a whole

(44m 37s)

> there's detail, maybe I don't know, but in their way, somebody, I, that's to it.

(44m 39s) **Al:**

> I think the hair that goes up looks like a question mark, so I'm wondering if that's a clue or not.

(44m 46s) **Kevin:**

> It does.

(44m 47s)

> Yeah.

(44m 48s)

> I don't know, but, uh, or Kpop fan.

(44m 49s) **Al:**

> I feel like a Taylor Swift fan right now.

(44m 53s)

> All right, so, so digital as a trainer walks out of the cave and then finds Professor Tang growth.

(45m 2s)

> And the ruins of the Cinnabar Island still to be confirmed.

(45m 9s)

> And then we get the weird narrator starts talking and telling us what's happening and interpolating their conversation.

(45m 15s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(45m 18s)

> Yup, even though there's subtitles, but okay. Yeah

(45m 22s) **Al:**

> I want this narrator for the entire game.

(45m 26s) **Kevin:**

> I would like I'd just for the Professor Tangerith voice a lot. I'd be down for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god

(45m 30s) **Al:**

> the voices I love the idea of just

(45m 32s)

> having having full voice acting that it's just one person putting on

(45m 36s)

> voices I love that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, so also Tang growth confirms that this

(45m 38s) **Kevin:**

> What what if flex that would be especially with the the ZA no voice acting?

(45m 46s)

> Oh, good times

(45m 48s)

> Okay, so they agree to fix up the island because the professor

(45m 55s) **Al:**

> was a place where humans lived. It was once a place home to many humans but

(46m 3s)

> so what happened here and why that's what I want to know. I hope we're going to

(46m 9s)

> find out some or get some clues would be fun if we didn't get like the

(46m 13s)

> full story, right? Because no one's around to tell us but I'd love if we found

(46m 17s)

> like clues that would give us hints towards what it

(46m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. So this is, this is when, I mean, this is a whole discussion, right, because it's

(46m 25s)

> being developed by Coatekmo, right? So who's, who's lee, you know, steering the ship? Is it,

(46m 31s)

> is Pokemon holding a gun to their heads, or are they, you know, are they being able to sneak that

(46m 37s)

> horrifying post, apocalyptic can't do a story in there? I don't know, could be either way. Yep.

(46m 42s) **Al:**

> Both could be the case. There have been horrifying things in Pokemon games before, right? Like Pokemon having a gun to their head, which I think we all know will be the case. It's Pokemon, they're control freaks. Hey, Game Freak, but I don't think that means that we won't get a really weird creepy story.

(46m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just think it to that is true. That is possible.

(47m 6s)

> They are willing to, I mean, well, we'll get into it. But in this trip, we already see some other junk. But

(47m 12s)

> anyways, Pokemon, they start showing up because

(47m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah. So this is interesting. So why are the Pokemon somewhere on this island and we're

(47m 23s)

> just creating habitats that they move to or was it a desolate wasteland and in which case

(47m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Well, I'm the reason we'll answer would be the former that we're just attracting them, but we did see

(47m 38s)

> Pokebo materialized from a beat game. So you never know

(47m 43s) **Al:**

> I also have another question. You have both kinds of shellos here, uh-huh. So, at three minutes and 43 seconds,

(47m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(47m 48s)

> Wait, you do I didn't see that. Oh, yeah, they are

(47m 53s) **Al:**

> you see both shellos walking along a deer, a dog. Next to a fishing rod as well.

(48m) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that I love that so they're saying okay, they're showing off all these different ways

(48m 5s)

> You can attract Pokemon you build a trash can and troublesh pops out. You build some grass and stuff pops out

(48m 11s)

> You do a finishing rod. You can pull up a magic art. How awesome is that?

(48m 17s)

> I'm a big fan

(48m 18s) **Al:**

> That seems like a very mean way for a Pokemon to get another Pokemon to come help,

(48m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(48m 22s) **Al:**

> is hook them with a hook in their mouth.

(48m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but

(48m 26s)

> Yeah, but clearly this did oh above everyone else

(48m 30s)

> at this point. Yeah, I so one thing I I had much in yeah, it's great. One thing I love and hate I this game and trailer doing things

(48m 33s) **Al:**

> Oh, you build you build a punching bag and hit my chin comes.

(48m 44s) **Kevin:**

> I hate but I love because they're they're going all in the animations on the dido trainer is like stretching and shock and stuff. It's it's horrifying. I love it. And the the finger yeah and the fingertips are still kind of purple. Oh, I love it.

(48m 50s) **Al:**

> Oh, I love it.

(49m) **Kevin:**

> They're just leaning in full. I look it's great. Um, okay, so yeah, you've got that we get to you get to learn moves from Pokemon

(49m 10s)

> Confirmed hard confirmed up front and center. You are vomiting to grow your crops and plants in this island. I'm very excited for that

(49m 18s) **Al:**

> Very creepy, very weird.

(49m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, squirt squirrel teaches you how to project out of all the romantic to grow the trees.

(49m 30s)

> Yeah, you learn your cuts and you get your cyther sword arms punching gloves from hit munchan digging from drill burs

(49m 37s) **Al:**

> It's a fun way to continue like the, or you have to start in this small area, but as you progress,

(49m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yep, yep, yep, and then we hit the big one. The one I was not sure because the question was, okay, is it just gonna be you know this one little island

(49m 44s) **Al:**

> you then get, you're able to expand out because you're getting these new abilities.

(49m 58s) **Kevin:**

> And how big is this area?

(50m)

> Well, we reach a lap risk and sure enough you turn into your, by the way, something

(50m 6s)

> is wrong with this ditto because it cannot transform correctly.

(50m 9s)

> It turns into a lap risk with the ditto face, but it can do that.

(50m 13s)

> And then you can now sail off to other areas and they also show Dragonite.

(50m 19s)

> You can fly off to other areas.

(50m 21s)

> So the question is to how big this is, I don't know, but more than just one island.

(50m 27s)

> So there's that.

(50m 30s)

> That's exciting and it leaves room for, you know, maybe DLC in the future.

(50m 35s)

> Oh, we just discovered, I don't know, Z.A. Island over here, whatever, mega island.

(50m 40s)

> Oh, oh, what I would give for spoilers for Z.A. people, mega star me on this island.

(50m 47s)

> Okay, so that's good.

(50m 48s) **Al:**

> Oh, creepy.

(50m 52s)

> And then, and then we've got crafting.

(50m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, everyone's favorite, crafty.

(50m 57s) **Al:**

> We love a crafting.

(50m 58s)

> I actually do like crafting. I think it's fun.

(51m) **Kevin:**

> I mean, yeah, I do too.

(51m 4s)

> I agree, right?

(51m 5s)

> There's a lot of nuance to it.

(51m 6s)

> You can get things wrong, but the general idea I do enjoy making things.

(51m 10s)

> So absolutely.

(51m 13s)

> We get the straw bread, straw, it's not straw bread, straw bed, the staple from dragon quest

(51m 19s)

> builders that they can sleep on toy blocks.

(51m 24s)

> So Alkazam can play with them, that's cool.

(51m 30s)

> This is now just the decorate your island, so build a whole bunch of stuff.

(51m 37s)

> Very excited.

(51m 40s)

> Let's see what else.

(51m 41s)

> Yeah, it's a lot of like Pokemon world overworld of the hallmarks, signs and lamp posts and

(51m 50s)

> vending machine, I guess, but I'm excited. Very, very excited.

(51m 54s) **Al:**

> I mean, is it too simplistic to say that it really does just feel like dragon quest builders with Pokemon?

(52m 1s) **Kevin:**

> No, and that's not a bad thing that I say that loving yeah, yes

(52m 2s) **Al:**

> I'm not saying it is I'm definitely not saying it is it definitely not saying it's a bad thing

(52m 6s)

> It just like everything because they're like then they talk about the quests that they'll have for you to do like this is this is exactly

(52m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yes

(52m 14s)

> Some of these textures look straight straight out of Dragon Quest builders. It's you know, it's absolutely Dragon Quest builders, but Pokemon

(52m 14s) **Al:**

> What dragon quest builders too had?

(52m 18s)

> Yeah

(52m 21s)

> I

(52m 22s)

> mean if I told you a year ago there's gonna

(52m 24s)

> be a Dragon Quest Builders 3 coming out, but it's gonna be Pokemon. You'd be like excellent.

(52m 28s) **Kevin:**

> - I didn't say shut up, you liar.

(52m 31s)

[laughs]

(52m 35s) **Al:**

> It's like if you were to say how could you improve Dragon Quest Builders 2? I would say

(52m 39s) **Kevin:**

> - Popo, come on.

(52m 40s) **Al:**

> who Pokemon in it. I mean I wouldn't say that because I would never imagine they would,

(52m 42s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be one of our stupid jokes,

(52m 44s) **Al:**

> but that's exactly what I would want. Yes.

(52m 47s) **Kevin:**

> but here we are.

(52m 48s)

[laughs]

(52m 51s) **Al:**

> because this is not a drag on drag.

(52m 54s)

> This is not a drag on drag and quest, but I never really got through the story of drag and quest builders too because I didn't care because I'm not really a drag and quest guy.

(52m 56s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, here we go.

(52m 58s)

> It's not a drag on Dragon Quest.

(53m 1s)

> There we go. We got there.

(53m 12s)

> That's a shame that that you know what that's fair. I was I wasn't

(53m 17s)

> I got a light drink wasn't up, but I've never really played a game per se

(53m 20s)

> But I I'm feeling it the world and the characters, but that's she and that story was good like genuinely

(53m 26s)

> Non as a non like draw unquest player. It was a good story, but anyways

(53m 33s)

> You'll get to experience it now

(53m 35s) **Al:**

> You implying it's going to be the same story just with Bookman.

(53m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Well, maybe not the same one because literally the god

(53m 42s)

> of destruction was in DQB2, but we'll get something deep and

(53m 47s)

> existentially horrifying, I'm sure.

(53m 48s) **Al:**

> I mean, he velter could come in, he velter.

(53m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's how I say it.

(53m 53s) **Al:**

> I've just realized I have no idea how to say that name.

(53m 55s)

> Eveltal, Eveltal, I've never said that name out loud.

(54m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Well, let's see if we'll find that out. Let us hold that.

(54m 3s) **Al:**

> Eveltal, this is why they need voice acting

(54m 7s)

> in Pokemon games.

(54m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and then they can change it later.

(54m 12s)

> And it gets all confused.

(54m 14s) **Al:**

> One thing that we, so then we've got, we've got a character customization.

(54m 18s)

> One thing I would say, no bold option.

(54m 20s)

> Boo.

(54m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that they've shown

(54m 22s) **Al:**

> Give me bold.

(54m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Well, maybe you unlock it

(54m 24s) **Al:**

> What, what do you think this guy, do you think a fur-frew is going to come along and give us new hairstyles?

(54m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, that'd be good or DLC they could do that, but here's the thing about the balls specifically

(54m 34s)

> They're hiding that because you don't find that until you find blame hidden in the cave

(54m 39s) **Al:**

> and then get to realize as the people can be bold.

(54m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, there you go

(54m 46s)

> What if ting growth splashes are blains? Oh

(54m 52s) **Al:**

> I do I do think the customization looks pretty white like you see like quite

(54m 58s)

> you see like six characters and they're all very differently dressed so that's

(55m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and a lot of Pokemon specific references you get you get to address you get red's jacket

(55m 11s)

> There's a quasi-mysti. There's the black belt trainer class

(55m 17s)

> It looks like a pretty solid character customized thing. Stay with the horrifying ditto face, but yes

(55m 21s) **Al:**

> And then, and then we get what I wasn't, what we were discussing, whether they would

(55m 27s)

> have or not, which is, decorating in buildings.

(55m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm. That was a big one. Oh, you know what we skipped back up

(55m 34s) **Al:**

> And oh my word, that wallpaper is horrifying.

(55m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Back up a second you get to build structures with Pokemon

(55m 37s) **Al:**

> Oh, what did I miss?

(55m 40s)

> Yes.

(55m 41s) **Kevin:**

> How awesome is that like building houses the bigger projects?

(55m 42s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(55m 43s)

> Yeah.

(55m 44s)

> Yeah.

(55m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Pokemon will help you to some degree. I don't know what that if that's the animation or you know, it's like because

(55m 47s) **Al:**

> I suspect.

(55m 51s)

> I suspect it's like you need a certain number of Pokémon to build a certain size of building or something like that.

(55m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Probably yeah, maybe a certain kind

(55m 56s) **Al:**

> It's just a progression thing, right?

(55m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, probably but it's fun to see like even just flavor

(56m 2s)

> as you remember Dragon Quest Builders, the villagers would help you out here and there, which is a great thing.

(56m 3s) **Al:**

> Yeah.

(56m 6s)

> Yeah, yeah.

(56m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, going back, yes, you can decorate inside.

(56m 12s) **Al:**

> So we have, we have couches.

(56m 14s)

> We have wallpaper, flooring, beds.

(56m 17s)

> We have like pokeball rugs, we have arcades.

(56m 21s)

> We have our gaming PC with a curved monitor.

(56m 25s)

> We have stereo TV of many fridge.

(56m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, I'm huge. I am hugely anti-curve, man. I think I'm wondering I'm not a fan. Oh, wait. What?

(56m 33s) **Al:**

> Tell me why.

(56m 35s)

> Have you, have you actually used one?

(56m 37s) **Kevin:**

> I'm not me personally, but I've seen them on

(56m 43s)

> I've seen them in the office. I've seen other people use them. I'd rather have two or three monitors instead of one

(56m 49s) **Al:**

> Oh, see, I know I switched to a huge and ultra wide monitor years ago and it's been my favorite thing

(56m 56s)

> because you can still put multiple screens on it if you want

(56m 56s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know

(57m)

> Yeah, I know

(57m 1s) **Al:**

> Sorry, multiple multiple windows on it, but you can also have and this is something you can't really do with multiple monitors

(57m 7s)

> You can have just one window covering the whole thing

(57m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(57m 10s) **Al:**

> So like right now, I am looking at the video full screen on my

(57m 15s)

> What is it? 28 inch ultra wide monitor?

(57m 19s)

> You know, whereas like if I was having two smaller screens, then I would have the video much smaller and when I do my software development, I can have my IDE up full size and have like three different files side by side if I need in certain situations like it's just so much more flexible.

(57m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Well, it is more flexible. I'll happily admit that or you're readily admit it, but I don't know. I don't I don't like new things

(57m 47s) **Al:**

> That's fair. That's fair. I do think however it's something that you you have to like if you want to try it

(57m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, but that's it

(57m 54s) **Al:**

> You have to try it for like a week or two

(57m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, you have to grow into it. Yeah, yeah, it's it's got to put like a lamp like a sort of

(57m 57s) **Al:**

> Because otherwise you're just like oh, I hate it because it's different but after a while you start to to figure out whether you like it or not

(58m 7s)

> Anyway curve monitor great

(58m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Neon like tube lamp, but or the streamer lighting. That's what it looks like as giant pokeball. All this decor or at least the one

(58m 20s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(58m 22s)

> Many French

(58m 22s) **Kevin:**

> showing off your feels like, yeah.

(58m 24s) **Al:**

> Oh, did you oh, I just I just noticed how little

(58m 29s)

> Places things did you see that so right go to where it so go

(58m 31s) **Kevin:**

> wait let me back up i'm watching yeah oh my god did it just spit it out yeah it took water

(58m 35s) **Al:**

> It's better. It is my

(58m 40s) **Kevin:**

> going to the next level oh no that makes sense in the pokemon that can transform at the

(58m 40s) **Al:**

> Horrifying

(58m 51s) **Kevin:**

> molecular level what's inside that clearly it's a curby like infinite void so why not just keep

(58m 58s)

> Keep all your storage inside you.

(58m 59s)

> Oh no.

(59m 1s) **Al:**

> Is the like the way the cheeks puff out as you're as you're about to place it and then it just like

(59m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Oh.

(59m 4s)

> Yeah, yeah.

(59m 7s)

> Yeah, you're just walking around with your storage and your cheeks.

(59m 12s)

> Oh, my goodness.

(59m 13s)

> I love this game.

(59m 13s) **Al:**

> That's horrifying

(59m 14s) **Kevin:**

> It's awful.

(59m 15s)

> Great.

(59m 18s)

> So multiplayer, very cool up to four players.

(59m 23s)

> A tiny snip here, but it thrills me to bits,

(59m 27s)

> Bulbasaur jump rope. I hope we get a

(59m 31s)

> number of little weird minigames like that. That would be really fun. But and you can play with your friends. Very, very cool. Taking photos with your friends actually looks kind of fun. I don't know, maybe just because how the ditto's hold the cameras or whatever. But we get game share. So you can play with only one copy of the game. You can share with your friends either on Switch 2 or Switch 1. How cool is that?

(59m 58s)

> Yup, but wait

(59m 58s) **Al:**

> That is very cool, completely unexpected.

(1h 2s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, as someone, I have this too, does that imply there will be a switch one version or are there?

(1h 10s)

> Okay, all right. I was just checking. Okay. That's what I thought but just checking

(1h 15s)

> But yeah

(1h 17s)

> And then we can get kind of the recap. Oh my gosh, is that a pomie?

(1h 22s)

> There's a pomie in the video and I think it's Partha at at around 905

(1h 27s)

> You can see some of the pal day of poke

(1h 31s)

> on the tree. I'm sure I'm kind of surprised with that one. I thought it'd be because like I said it's heavily leaning towards the gen one and the trailers but clearly not all. Nine oh five it's sitting on a bench. Wait what it's jiggly pop from above. What is.

(1h 40s) **Al:**

> I don't know, is that in a spot or is it an order for you?

(1h 43s)

> Oh, no, wait, where are you looking?

(1h 47s)

> Yeah, that's side up on its side.

(1h 52s)

> It's side up on its side. (laughs)

(1h 1m)

> I'm so sorry to break this to you.

(1h 1m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Oh no no this is the best. Wow. Wow that actually jiggly pop from above. Oh there's a gopin on a bench. I like gopin. Oh good times. Yep. Yeah clearly like look at look at Gardevoir just chattening up with a little wicker when it's great.

(1h 1m 2s) **Al:**

> It's side up lying on his side on the bench.

(1h 1m 6s)

[laughs]

(1h 1m 19s)

> It just, it just, I mean, it does show you that like the Pokemon

(1h 1m 22s)

> have personalities, right? That's cool.

(1h 1m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah because I mean even a giant quest builders too was good with that right all the villagers would run around do stuff eat and and you know have expressions they were they felt you know like they had life to them. And so you know add that to Pokemon because you know we're suckers and we like Pokemon and well that's a winning formula. Oh there's a cat turn just chilling on a coach very excited.

(1h 1m 57s)

> Um, there are also some big Pokemon like Hexaurus charged earlier, they did a footage.

(1h 2m 1s)

> like a bunch of the big dragon looking Pokemon. Um, yeah, and so that's Pacopia. Um, and then we get the stinger, right?

(1h 2m 11s)

> Miracle is painting, which I'm kind of excited. I hope that's a thing in game like you do something with miracle.

(1h 2m 18s)

> Um, that would be fitting for the gameplay, but then there's street lights things go out. It's getting spooky. What's going on?

(1h 2m 24s)

> There is a ghost glowing ghostly looking Pikachu that's all gray, basically.

(1h 2m 31s)

> Um, that's a dead Pikachu. That's what I'm saying. That's just the dead Pikachu.

(1h 2m 35s) **Al:**

> I mostly agree with you, but there was something that someone that I saw on one of their

(1h 2m 41s)

> social medias that made me think it's like just, I don't know, an ice type Pikachu or something,

(1h 2m 48s)

> like the way they, yeah, something.

(1h 2m 49s) **Kevin:**

> It's albino

(1h 2m 51s)

> Is it a is it a Pikachu that would forgot it was a ditto cuz it's kind of got that ditto purple going on

(1h 2m 55s) **Al:**

> I saw someone suggest maybe it saw a mimic you evolution.

(1h 3m 3s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it's mega minic you finally here. Um, but yeah, that'd go

(1h 3m 8s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I so okay, so one this game isn't connecting to Pokemon home, right?

(1h 3m 16s)

> I think we can safely say

(1h 3m 17s) **Kevin:**

> No, yes, I will say, say...

(1h 3m 22s) **Al:**

> Two that means that these are only these only for this game probably right

(1h 3m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Probably. Yes. It's spiky or peachy. Yes.

(1h 3m 31s) **Al:**

> Except it's possible they come to Pokemon go

(1h 3m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Sure. Okay. Yeah. Pokemon goats, always the exception.

(1h 3m 39s)

> And if we get party at warpool and Pokemon go, anything's possible in Pokemon go.

(1h 3m 44s) **Al:**

> I will say that most, most lacks seems like a weird, almost like an evolution.

(1h 3m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. I mean, look, understandably, people see, that's about to say that's what it is about to say.

(1h 3m 55s)

> I mean, people popping off about the dead Pikachu.

(1h 3m 59s)

> because the mask gun looks dead or whatever, but me that they keep going on and then we get

(1h 4m 5s)

> Moss Lacks of giant I say giants might not actually sign

(1h 4m 8s) **Al:**

> They called it Mosslax, right?

(1h 4m 10s) **Kevin:**

> They did

(1h 4m 11s) **Al:**

> Like they didn't say this was a Moss covered Snarlax.

(1h 4m 13s) **Kevin:**

> They called in it. I didn't see that. Oh, oh, I didn't realize that. Well, I don't know

(1h 4m 13s) **Al:**

> They called it Mosslax.

(1h 4m 18s)

> I can't remember where it was.

(1h 4m 19s)

> I think it was on social media,

(1h 4m 20s)

> but I definitely saw them call it Mosslax.

(1h 4m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Well, I don't know what's going on, but it take feedies here, and it's a Snorlax

(1h 4m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, here you go.

(1h 4m 27s)

> So the official Pokemon Facebook page,

(1h 4m 30s)

> quietly introducing you to Mosslax.

(1h 4m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Um, yeah, I don't, this again looks incredible man. That's all I have to say.

(1h 4m 41s)

> We've reached the end. Oh, there's your early buyer bonus.

(1h 4m 45s)

> Receive a ditto rug in your house until January 31st, 2027.

(1h 4m 52s)

> As game freak does, it's nice ditto rug.

(1h 4m 57s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I mean, fine. And you get nearly a year to redeem it. It's not really an early purchase

(1h 5m) **Kevin:**

> No.

(1h 5m 3s)

> Yeah.

(1h 5m 5s) **Al:**

> bonus if you've got nearly a year. I'm not complaining. It's just very funny that it's so long.

(1h 5m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 5m 9s)

> Yeah, I'm on it either.

(1h 5m 12s)

> It is.

(1h 5m 13s)

> Oh, man, there's a rookie to either.

(1h 5m 15s) **Al:**

> But that also like the fact that they've got mystery gift in this game means that they probably

(1h 5m 19s)

> have plans for more things as well. Will they give us will it just be cosmetics or will they

(1h 5m 27s)

> also give us Pokemon in the game through mystery gift?

(1h 5m 30s) **Kevin:**

> I think that's very possible.

(1h 5m 34s)

> Like I don't imagine it's terribly hard to add a Pokemon in this game.

(1h 5m 39s)

> You know, you could just a cosmetic Pokemon that wander around your town.

(1h 5m 44s)

> They give you, they give you the, what's it called, the special patch of berry to have

(1h 5m 52s)

> petcher run or whatever show up, yada, yada, et cetera, et cetera.

(1h 5m 54s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(1h 5m 56s) **Kevin:**

> You know, the thing that brings the Pokemon over.

(1h 6m 1s)

> They're very excited.

(1h 6m 2s)

> So one thing interesting about the trailer, tang growth, you know, it's very like the front

(1h 6m 7s)

> and center.

(1h 6m 8s)

> He mentions how humans and Pokemon lived here.

(1h 6m 10s)

> And he'd love for humans in Pokemon to both return.

(1h 6m 13s)

> We didn't actually see a human in the whole trailer.

(1h 6m 16s) **Al:**

> We didn't, no, but just because time growth once, just because Professor time growth once

(1h 6m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Nope.

(1h 6m 21s) **Al:**

> human to return doesn't mean you will in the game.

(1h 6m 23s) **Kevin:**

> that is true. You're fine. It could be the credit shot, the train, the dido's trainer returns.

(1h 6m 24s) **Al:**

> But I could see that as being like the end point, like, oh, exactly, exactly, exactly.

(1h 6m 30s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, yeah, that's probably the thing, right? Yeah. Well, that's why the ghost Pikachu's

(1h 6m 32s) **Al:**

> Although the digital trainer is dead.

(1h 6m 38s) **Kevin:**

> year, it's the spirit of your deceased trainer. That is not a plot. That is not a crazy idea.

(1h 6m 41s) **Al:**

> Alright

(1h 6m 45s) **Kevin:**

> They have done similar plots in other days.

(1h 6m 46s) **Al:**

> They have yeah, yeah, I I would not be

(1h 6m 50s)

> Completely surprised if it was something like that. Oh

(1h 6m 54s)

> Haha, yours really funny see on the the Pokemon blog

(1h 6m 58s)

> Links to the mine Nintendo store if you click on it

(1h 7m 1s)

> It says you have a to leave a site operated by the Pokemon company international the Pokemon company international is not responsible for the content of any linked website

(1h 7m 9s)

> But it's like I'm going

(1h 7m 9s) **Kevin:**

> They don't understand how they make those games.

(1h 7m 11s) **Al:**

> to an intent all Kevin you buy in this game you

(1h 7m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe, just maybe.

(1h 7m 24s) **Al:**

> buy no one release day borrow Calvin's one yeah just buy it and play on

(1h 7m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Maybe, just maybe, presuming I have a switch to, but yes.

(1h 7m 29s)

> You know what?

(1h 7m 30s)

> You know what?

(1h 7m 31s)

> That may be irrelevant.

(1h 7m 32s)

> I may be buying it anyways.

(1h 7m 37s) **Al:**

> Calvin's it's not

(1h 7m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah, there you go.

(1h 7m 39s)

> That's true. That's true. That's true. Sorry, Calvin, on March. Actually, I say that November 20, if you lose your switch to.

(1h 7m 41s) **Al:**

> it's not like you don't live with someone who has a switch to come on

(1h 7m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Less than a week left, sorry, Calvin.

(1h 7m 56s) **Al:**

> that's a good point there's no way there's no way that you get to march not having

(1h 7m 59s)

> bought a switch to to plea carburetor's right come on

(1h 8m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I slash the link Calvin's whatever, but yes, Kirby or writers

(1h 8m 9s)

> But yes, I mean, yes, of course. It's it's day what it day

(1h 8m 13s)

> No, it's day negative whatever today's whenever they announced it that was the day

(1h 8m 16s)

> I purchased the game just you know, I didn't hand over the money yet, but I was locked in the day

(1h 8m 21s) **Al:**

> I've already got my savings, Paul, and I've added, like, half the money.

(1h 8m 22s) **Kevin:**

> No, it's it. I mean, what about you, Al?

(1h 8m 27s)

> Yeah, of course, right? Oh

(1h 8m 32s)

> There you go

(1h 8m 34s)

> I want this game so bad. It's all I need

(1h 8m 37s) **Al:**

> It will be interesting to see whether I do and like obviously I'm gonna buy it and I'm gonna play it the question is

(1h 8m 44s)

> One, I'm not gonna buy the back game key car or I'm gonna buy it digitally

(1h 8m 47s)

> I'm gonna use this as the reason that I'm gonna go all digital with Pokemon games

(1h 8m 51s)

> I don't know but to will I get really into this game or will I just be a

(1h 8m 57s)

> Passing fad because I've never hugely got into

(1h 9m 3s)

> Many side games for a long time

(1h 9m 7s)

> The new pokemon snap I played for maybe a week and it was fine and I was done like I never really got into it

(1h 9m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 9m 14s)

> Yeah

(1h 9m 15s) **Al:**

> Like Pokemon existing in a game doesn't mean I'm going to play it and

(1h 9m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 9m 19s) **Al:**

> Obsess over it, right?

(1h 9m 21s)

> There's a reason that I like the main series of Pokemon games and it's not just because they're Pokemon

(1h 9m 25s) **Kevin:**

> No

(1h 9m 27s) **Al:**

> It's because I really like how the games play right?

(1h 9m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 9m 29s)

> Yeah, yeah, it has the grind that that you like

(1h 9m 32s) **Al:**

> Exactly. The game gameplay is important to me and so the question is will I actually like

(1h 9m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 9m 37s) **Al:**

> this or not? And I guess we'll find it.

(1h 9m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, look

(1h 9m 41s)

> even if you don't play the game that long, like I'm confident it's going to be a very quality game. Dragon Quest Builders, whether you're a fan of the Dragon Quest, I think people can recognize, is a very quality game.

(1h 9m 47s) **Al:**

> Mm-hmm

(1h 9m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Right? So, you know, I have a lot of trust in this game being excellent, regardless if you're a fan of it or not, just sort of objectively, right?

(1h 10m 3s)

> The question is it going to be very gentle in this game?

(1h 10m 11s)

[Laughter]

(1h 10m 17s)

> That's, that's all. I'm excited.

(1h 10m 19s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I don't know

(1h 10m 21s)

> This is this is the problem with Pokemon. It's like are we good is is Jen kind of be

(1h 10m 25s) **Kevin:**

[Laughter]

(1h 10m 26s) **Al:**

> Gen 10 gonna be one of the best games ever or is it gonna be one of the worst games ever and honestly, it's a coin toss, right?

(1h 10m 33s) **Kevin:**

> at this point, yep.

(1h 10m 35s)

> - Yup.

(1h 10m 36s) **Al:**

> I just like I absolutely I don't understand how the same company that made Pokemon legends are here on ZA

(1h 10m 43s) **Kevin:**

> And it's so baffling because a lot of them are very clear like this was a decision that

(1h 10m 43s) **Al:**

> I also made

(1h 10m 45s)

> Pokemon Scarlet in violet. I just I just don't get it

(1h 10m 55s) **Kevin:**

> was made.

(1h 10m 56s)

> Like they said, they were going to do this thing or not do this thing.

(1h 10m 56s) **Al:**

> Yes, yes, yeah, because I don't think because there's a whole load of discourse just now

(1h 11m) **Kevin:**

> And it's baffling why they would do that many times.

(1h 11m 6s)

> Yeah.

(1h 11m 7s) **Al:**

> on there. Oh, they don't put enough money into these games. And that's probably true,

(1h 11m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 11m 9s)

> Yes.

(1h 11m 10s)

> Yes.

(1h 11m 10s) **Al:**

> but most of the things that you don't like about the game, we didn't improve if they put more money

(1h 11m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(1h 11m 14s) **Al:**

> into it. Right? Like, I don't think that for, you know, I, I, all the reason things they don't

(1h 11m 23s)

> don't have in this game that they did have in Legends Arches are not there.

(1h 11m 26s) **Kevin:**

> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mummy money. Right. Yep. Sure. Yep. No. No amount of

(1h 11m 26s) **Al:**

> Because they didn't want them to be there.

(1h 11m 28s)

> They're not because they didn't have the money to implement the feature, right?

(1h 11m 33s)

> Like, obviously, there are so many other issues with Scarlet and Violet that where a whole other thing, right?

(1h 11m 38s)

> Like, the performance issues is something that they probably could have fixed with more time and more money.

(1h 11m 44s)

> Fine, sure.

(1h 11m 46s)

> But like, the empty world wasn't something that they would have fixed for that.

(1h 11m 51s)

> You know, it's like saying if Nintendo put more money into animal crossing that they would have had

(1h 11m 57s)

> the villagers be more interesting. No, of course they wouldn't because they didn't seem to care about it for that game like

(1h 11m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Now, yeah, I was not the decision.

(1h 12m 3s) **Al:**

> There's not how these things work and I just it's absolutely baffling to me that people are like they'll just need to put more money

(1h 12m 9s)

> And not they don't they don't like I mean would would they make a better game if they had more money

(1h 12m 15s)

> Probably not good do they make a better game if they had more money? Yes

(1h 12m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. And.

(1h 12m 19s) **Al:**

> But those are not the same thing and you cannot assume someone who is making bad decisions

(1h 12m 23s)

> If you give them more money, they're just going to continue making bad decisions.

(1h 12m 26s)

> Which I'm not this, this is, and just to be a point, this is not an, and don't give homeless people money thing because that's what it sounded like.

(1h 12m 33s)

> It's not like, but the point is, like you just, you can't just assume the more money is going to fix the problem.

(1h 12m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and then there's I mean there's the flip side too, right? Like they've made plenty of

(1h 12m 44s)

> Pokémon has made plenty of great games without needing more money or time or whatever, right?

(1h 12m 48s) **Al:**

> Mhm. The reason, the reason we don't have balconies in Pokemon

(1h 12m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Because they were very good in their direction and decision making and made fun things.

(1h 12m 59s) **Al:**

> Legends ZA is because it would make the game run worse. It's not because

(1h 13m 4s)

> they don't have the money to make the models for it because there are balconies in some

(1h 13m 8s)

> areas that they wanted there to be balconies. Can you imagine? I like, and this is not

(1h 13m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yep. Oh.

(1h 13m 15s) **Al:**

> like a justifying the fact that the walls are flying.

(1h 13m 18s)

> I get why people are annoyed by that, but with the number of balconies they have on those walls, the game would run absolutely dreadfully if every single balcony was rendered.

(1h 13m 23s) **Kevin:**

> hahahaha

(1h 13m 28s)

> Well, no, then just need more money to fix that

(1h 13m 33s) **Al:**

> More money to make a bear console. They want to do that. It would run great on the PS5.

(1h 13m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, yeah, you go

(1h 13m 41s) **Al:**

> I just like people love to have a quick fix for these things and it's not the case, right?

(1h 13m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 13m 48s) **Al:**

> money does not equal better game. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Also, more money does not make better story. Just saying.

(1h 13m 49s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, no, it's early not a poco, my certainly not with both

(1h 13m 53s)

> I don't even need to know that I'll poquopia will absolutely have a better story

(1h 14m 5s) **Al:**

> Oh, yeah. Oh, but that's the thing. I'm not I'm not yet probably because Gen 10 is going to be another. Oh, look, there's a Pokemon destroying the world. Let's fix it

(1h 14m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, yes.

(1h 14m 15s) **Al:**

> Like I don't particularly care, right? Like I've, I've said this before. I play the games because I enjoy the interactions with the Pokemon and the catching and the back. I enjoy that. I don't particularly expect there to be an amazing story.

(1h 14m 23s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's correct.

(1h 14m 28s) **Al:**

> But would I enjoy it more if there was a better story yet probably like I enjoyed the small stories of Scarlet and Violet. They were fun.

(1h 14m 35s)

> I love the weird side things that you get in Legends EA. They're fun. Do more to that.

(1h 14m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and you know what that that's interesting about Pokemon because they've always been good at that

(1h 14m 44s)

> There's always weird little pockets or characters or side stories that are pretty good on entertaining

(1h 14m 48s) **Al:**

> Yeah

(1h 14m 50s) **Kevin:**

> But the main their main thoughts just you know the most cookie cutter thing ever, but anyways

(1h 14m 55s)

> Pakopia come in March 5 better than part gen 10 the answer is is it's not a hard no

(1h 14m 59s) **Al:**

> Apparently what a

(1h 15m 1s)

> We'll see

(1h 15m 7s)

> Can't believe we're let we're probably

(1h 15m 9s)

> No, less than a year away from Gentan coming out because if it comes out on the same Friday in November as Scarlet and Violet did it will be out on Friday

(1h 15m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's true. It will. It will. It will. It will. It will. It will. It will. It's always the second, third. Yeah, I guess. Well, it was a legend game you see. And what's next? We got other news.

(1h 15m 18s) **Al:**

> Well, you say that but it wasn't this year. It was October

(1h 15m 29s)

> And don't do it, goin'. No, no Kevin, stop.

(1h 15m 35s)

> Oh.

(1h 15m 38s)

> We have, yeah, goodness me, has this been the longest news section we've ever had.

(1h 15m 43s)

> Next, we have some new games.

(1h 15m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Well, it's Pacopia.

## New Games

(1h 15m 48s) **Al:**

> So the first new game is by the developer of Garden Galaxy,

(1h 15m 51s)

> and this game is called Willy.

(1h 15m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, uh, that's a name.

(1h 15m 54s) **Al:**

> Raise a flock of colorful sheep in this slow-paced idler.

(1h 16m)

> Gathers their fleeces and complete your collection.

(1h 16m 2s)

> It's a monster creature collector, it's a creature collector, Gavin.

(1h 16m 6s) **Kevin:**

> I don't I don't like how easily suckered. I'm in by this concept

(1h 16m 11s) **Al:**

[laughter]

(1h 16m 14s)

> Look, it costs five quid, right?

(1h 16m 16s)

> Come on.

(1h 16m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Look at all those sheet patterns

(1h 16m 20s) **Al:**

> Oh, man, you need to collect.

(1h 16m 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, what I'm not okay, but I can see the fingerprints of the Garden Galaxy devs all over

(1h 16m 28s)

> It's like you said, it's idle, right?

(1h 16m 30s)

> You're generating the coins and buying stuff with the coins and doing stuff with the coins

(1h 16m 37s) **Al:**

> Do you know the thing is though, I think actually my

(1h 16m 38s)

> prefer this to get a garden galaxy because the problem

(1h 16m 40s)

> with garden galaxy is like I was decorating.

(1h 16m 43s)

> What is this is your, your collecting animals and they're

(1h 16m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. I agree because with the decorating like it felt you were missing pieces. Is it where you know like when am I gonna get a thing, you know a water feature or lamp or whatever, but here it's like oh look on you sheep. I like this one. Yeah, it's cute. It's a fun little idea. Just a pet and full of all sorts of sheep with random patterns.

(1h 16m 46s) **Al:**

> doing things like that is much more interesting to me.

(1h 17m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, um.

(1h 17m 13s)

> And just feeding them and cleaning up their poop. Good times.

(1h 17m 18s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I might get this to try.

(1h 17m 20s) **Kevin:**

> I also might give it a try.

(1h 17m 24s) **Al:**

> All right, and the other game, the other new game we've had in

(1h 17m 28s) **Kevin:**

> I didn't see this. I didn't think I had something more exciting than, or as equally exciting.

(1h 17m 43s) **Al:**

> Kevin's about to crash because he's about to realize that this is not being announced for anywhere outside of Japan.

(1h 17m 44s) **Kevin:**

> No! Don't do that to me all. It has to.

(1h 17m 55s) **Al:**

> All right, we should probably tell the listeners what we're talking about.

(1h 17m 56s) **Kevin:**

[mumbling]

(1h 17m 58s)

> There's only two or three things that I'd react like this. They can guess.

(1h 18m 2s) **Al:**

> So it's a free-to-play Rice Cultivation and RPG game for RPG games.

(1h 18m 13s)

> And RPG, role-playing game for mobile and PC.

(1h 18m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, wait, I there are many emotions. I'm feeling right now. What do you mean free to play? I don't know if I

(1h 18m 28s) **Al:**

> I don't know what to tell you. Free to play means free to play, right?

(1h 18m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Who are all these characters there's so what are these animals?

(1h 18m 37s) **Al:**

> The original, I think, uh, it's the original vice cast that we're seeing in this video.

(1h 18m 42s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I think so they're at them in there. Yeah, because it's like this it's like an

(1h 18m 50s)

> an hour, almost 90 minute like presentation and there's presumably the voice cast. Yeah, I think that

(1h 18m 53s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Completely in Japanese. Yeah. Yeah.

(1h 18m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Sockin is a voice actor because they're dressed like they had the Sockin to look in a robe on. So I don't know

(1h 19m 5s)

> what's going on. It's all in Japanese. There's all these characters. There's new people, but there's Kolkua Dawa.

(1h 19m 14s)

> You know what? You know what? It's more Sockin in my life. What is this game play? That dungeon crawl?

(1h 19m 20s) **Al:**

> This is a weird-looking game.

(1h 19m 22s)

> I don't know what this is.

(1h 19m 24s)

> It looks like menu the game.

(1h 19m 28s) **Kevin:**

> They just brought out real life rice tools or harvesting tools on the street.

(1h 19m 34s)

> I don't know what it's not it's not I'm torn because

(1h 19m 35s) **Al:**

> It's definitely not like the first game.

(1h 19m 38s)

> Let's just put it out there.

(1h 19m 40s)

> It's very different.

(1h 19m 45s) **Kevin:**

> Sakuna is a series that could die so easily so fragile so anything I see with the name on it

(1h 19m 52s)

> is oh thank god it lives but I mean first of all I don't know

(1h 19m 58s)

> I'm gonna get this in English right

(1h 20m) **Al:**

> So yeah, we do not know anything about that yet. They've not given as any information outside of this

(1h 20m 6s)

> stream

(1h 20m 8s)

> And I mean, it's very possible that it's that it's not the steam page

(1h 20m 13s)

> Currently is unavailable outside of Japan. So that's not a great a great thing to see

(1h 20m 21s)

> But it's not unheard of for these things to sometimes

(1h 20m 25s)

> even though they're locked down then because what was the

(1h 20m 30s)

> what was the name of the one that Micah was obsessed with, um, summer vacation.

(1h 20m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I know what you're talking about, I don't remember the name, but yeah.

(1h 20m 38s) **Al:**

> Anyway, that one, the steam page was originally locked to Japan until the

(1h 20m 44s)

> announced that there was an English freshen coming as well. So

(1h 20m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Ugh, I do you ever get a dub of the the enemy?

(1h 20m 56s) **Al:**

> I think so. Was that another version? Did we know?

(1h 20m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Because I watch I watch it subbed

(1h 21m 2s) **Al:**

> I'm pretty sure both were available.

(1h 21m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Wait, did I just watch it subbed and not realize there's a dub? Oh, I think you're right

(1h 21m 13s)

> Oh, it's Laura. Oh my gosh, were they

(1h 21m 17s) **Al:**

> I know it was, it was just, it was just subbed, no doubt.

(1h 21m 17s) **Kevin:**

> I don't know, but you know, that's an enemy that happens. That's you know, you know, this tells me it's doesn't go by more copies of sock and I'm just telling them to get okay.

(1h 21m 34s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 21m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay, it's exists. I just I have to wait for any information. I just have to sit here and just sweaty

(1h 21m 47s) **Al:**

> Hold up. The new LEGO Party game is apparently available through net.

(1h 21m 47s) **Kevin:**

> waiting for more. Wait, what? There's a leg. Okay, let's back up step one. There's a Lego party game. Yeah, sure, that's what I assume, but okay.

(1h 21m 58s) **Al:**

> Sorry, how did you miss that? Yeah, it's like a like it's like Mario party, but Lego

(1h 22m 5s)

> Um, it came out recently and apparently it's on Netflix

(1h 22m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, that's all right. You don't feel like it's gaming good good. Okay. That's interesting.

(1h 22m 14s) **Al:**

> I'm gonna have to try that then I'm gonna fasten these

(1h 22m 17s) **Kevin:**

> I guess so. Hey, you know what else I found out just run the topic of these random things. Did you know there's a sonic version of Fall Guys?

(1h 22m 26s) **Al:**

> there as in like the sonic levels in focus.

(1h 22m 28s) **Kevin:**

> No, no, it's a game called Sonic Rumble. I mean, yes, there is, but there's a Sonic Fall Guys game basically. It's Fall Guys, but Sonic it's called Sonic Rumble.

(1h 22m 30s) **Al:**

> Well, there are.

(1h 22m 32s)

> Okay, but there are.

(1h 22m 41s)

> No, I did not I was not aware of this sonic rumble

(1h 22m 43s) **Kevin:**

> I only found out like last week and I was blown away

(1h 22m 47s) **Al:**

> Interesting. Oh, it's came out this year. That's why

(1h 22m 47s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I guess so oh there you go

(1h 22m 51s) **Al:**

> It is not God is God mixed steam reviews

(1h 22m 58s)

> I will say that I don't I don't think I ever looked at fall guys and went what does this need being able to run really really fast

(1h 23m 5s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, it's also Sonic game. So you know that that sounds on par-

(1h 23m 11s) **Al:**

> Yeah, well exactly exactly who disappoints their fans more pokemon or sonic

(1h 23m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(1h 23m 20s)

> That's a good point. At least at least Sonic recognize that it's one point

(1h 23m 28s) **Al:**

> All right, I don't know.

(1h 23m 28s) **Kevin:**

> That that's an episode off

(1h 23m 30s) **Al:**

> Is there anything else to talk about this not going to game?

(1h 23m 33s)

> It might be a weird game. It might exist outside of Japan at some point.

(1h 23m 38s)

> Whatever. Kevin's just excited that something exists even if he's never going to be able to play it.

(1h 23m 42s) **Kevin:**

> I'm just, I'm just, you know, reaching out and stroking and petting my screen, just looking

(1h 23m 48s)

> at this trailer existing.

(1h 23m 49s) **Al:**

[laughing]

(1h 23m 50s) **Kevin:**

> So happy.

(1h 23m 51s)

> Hey, we got more of those sock in an illustration.

(1h 23m 51s) **Al:**

> Maybe one day.

(1h 23m 54s) **Kevin:**

> That's already good enough for me.

(1h 23m 55s) **Al:**

> That's fair.

(1h 23m 59s)

> All right, well that's the news.

(1h 23m 59s) **Kevin:**

> I guess.

## Game Key Cards Discussion

(1h 24m 3s) **Al:**

> We're gonna talk about game,

(1h 24m 5s)

> an Nintendo game key cards now.

(1h 24m 8s)

> So just before we get into the discussion,

(1h 24m 10s)

> I just want to clarify,

(1h 24m 12s)

> for people who aren't aware what these are,

(1h 24m 14s)

> game key cards are like a Nintendo Switch too.

(1h 24m 19s)

> There's a key that allows your Switch to play the game or to download the game and

(1h 24m 29s)

> play it.

(1h 24m 30s)

> Now your initial thought when you hear that is, "Oh, why not just buy the game digitally

(1h 24m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Wait wait

(1h 24m 35s) **Al:**

> then?"

(1h 24m 36s) **Kevin:**

> Wait, yeah, my first thought is wait. What? I

(1h 24m 36s) **Al:**

> And the answer is because, was that not, "Well, you're not aware of that's how it works."

(1h 24m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Like I assumed I

(1h 24m 45s)

> As soon be maybe I just had paid sense, but I thought it was

(1h 24m 50s)

> I should put this like because they show the animation of

(1h 24m 54s)

> Taking out the game putting instantal and inserting into another one virtually or whatever, right?

(1h 25m 1s)

> So like it's a

(1h 25m 3s)

> I just basically thought be okay, let me back up another step digital games currently on the switch, right?

(1h 25m 10s)

> If I have breath a while on my switch and

(1h 25m 13s)

> I log into my account on Calvin's I can transfer that over

(1h 25m 18s)

> But you know the few hoops I have to jump through I have to make Calvin's switch the my prime or like I have to make

(1h 25m 23s)

> Is the primary console for my account and then I have to read download it there

(1h 25m 25s) **Al:**

> Well, it's changed and it's different how it works now. Yeah. So so so so before the switch before the switch to the way that it worked was you could

(1h 25m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Has it changed?

(1h 25m 29s)

> Wait, it's shit

(1h 25m 31s)

> Okay, I don't know anything just just tell me I'm gonna shut up now

(1h 25m 37s) **Al:**

> You could have primary switches and you can have secondary switches. You can only have one primary switch and you can have many secondary switches

(1h 25m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Right. Yeah.

(1h 25m 44s) **Al:**

> On your primary switch any user can play the games on that switch on the secondary switches only your account can play the games on those

(1h 25m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, right.

(1h 25m 56s) **Al:**

> The changed it when the switch just before the switch to came out. They changed it

(1h 26m)

> so that

(1h 26m 1s)

> you can have

(1h 26m 3s)

> two primary switches

(1h 26m 5s)

> But you have to explicitly say which games are on which switch?

(1h 26m 10s)

> Okay

(1h 26m 11s)

> And so you you can say I want this one to have this game and I want this one to have this game

(1h 26m 16s)

> And then you can play those ones any user on those switches and offline you don't have to do the online check

(1h 26m 21s)

> but you can only do it on that one unless you then say I want to switch.

(1h 26m 25s)

> back over to that switch and both switches have to be like online and

(1h 26m 30s)

> available and you do it. I think they have to be next to each other as well so

(1h 26m 34s)

> you can say so I have two switches I've got this one this is gonna be the one

(1h 26m 34s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(1h 26m 38s) **Al:**

> that I'm playing Pokemon on this is gonna be the one I'm playing Mario Kart on and

(1h 26m 40s)

> then I'm like oh actually I want the Mario Kart on this switch instead you turn

(1h 26m 45s)

> them both on you put them next to each other and you switch the cartridge over to

(1h 26m 47s) **Kevin:**

> cheese

(1h 26m 49s) **Al:**

> the other one but the other thing you can do now and this is actually why I

(1h 26m 52s)

> I think is a better as you can land games.

(1h 26m 55s)

> You don't have to have your account logged into Calvin's Switch anymore, you can be part of the same Nintendo Switch family, and you can say I want to give this to Calvin, and then for four two weeks, I'll get to that in a minute, it is no longer on your Switch, it is no one his Switch instead of your Switch, and he can play it as if he has it, has bought it.

(1h 27m 25s)

> After the two weeks and then automatically comes back to your Switch, but you can then just click the button and lend it again.

(1h 27m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Yeah.

(1h 27m 31s) **Al:**

> It's just like you have to click the button every two weeks, sort of thing, which is a little bit annoying, but whatever, at least there's no like time limit to like you have to wait again before you click the button again.

(1h 27m 41s)

> I'm pretty sure you can just click it straight away.

(1h 27m 44s)

> So that's how they changed all that digital lending, and that's where we got like the virtual game cards, and it's all a bit weird, but I understand why they've done it, but it also gets a little bit confusing and like what is a virtual game card.

(1h 27m 55s)

> It's just saying which Switch you're allowed to play the digital game on without connecting to the internet.

(1h 28m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(1h 28m 4s) **Al:**

> So it's better in some ways, it's worse in other ways.

(1h 28m 9s)

> And this is the thing is like I don't like all these restrictions, but this is one of the things that we like have to get in this weird annoying capitalist society that we have where they put limitations on what you can do with things.

(1h 28m 22s)

> I don't like it, but that's life and in terms of what exists.

(1h 28m 25s)

> I think the digital version of that is probably the best we're going to get.

(1h 28m 30s) **Kevin:**

> okay like okay this is a lot of info I'm trying to process here and so all right let's you

(1h 28m 35s) **Al:**

> Yep, go for it.

(1h 28m 40s) **Kevin:**

> let's look at a case all right let's just pickopia right so that there is digital

(1h 28m 46s)

> key uh was it cartridges or whatever these key cards or whatever right and then there's

(1h 28m 51s)

> just outright digital version of the game right these are distinct things right okay

(1h 28m 55s) **Al:**

> Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Kind of, but yes. So the, well, okay, let me, let me, let me, let

(1h 29m) **Kevin:**

> well I mean okay

(1h 29m 2s) **Al:**

> me explain a little bit more with that. So then let's just talk about POCOPIA. So you,

(1h 29m 5s)

> there is no full physical version of the game, but essentially there is a physical version

(1h 29m 10s)

> of the game, right? And I'll get to that in a minute. Well, I mean, so, well, this is the thing.

(1h 29m 12s) **Kevin:**

> digital vertical.

(1h 29m 17s) **Al:**

> What is a physical version of a game in a world where you get day one patches? I don't think

(1h 29m 21s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I know I know we're getting we're getting I know I know we're getting deep into the weeds

(1h 29m 24s) **Al:**

> There is such a thing as a physical thing.

(1h 29m 25s)

> Anyways, I'm not sure if it's a physical game anymore. Anyways.

(1h 29m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, let look let's let's try to make this clear for me. What is the date?

(1h 29m 33s)

> Let's just say pakopia had both options the digital key card and the full digital download. What is the difference?

(1h 29m 38s) **Al:**

> Okay, so digital download you buy it digitally and you can then play it without like physically

(1h 29m 48s)

> switching something in or out of your switch, right? That's how digital games work. That's

(1h 29m 52s)

> the big advantage is you have all your games on your switch. You can just choose which one to play.

(1h 29m 58s)

> The disadvantage of that is you can't sell it and it's harder to lend it, right? You can only

(1h 30m 5s)

> landed digitally to people in your Nintendo Switch family.

(1h 30m 8s)

> You can't sell it on, right? That's just that's just life.

(1h 30m 12s)

> That's how digital works.

(1h 30m 13s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, yes, okay, yes.

(1h 30m 15s) **Al:**

> Full physical version, you just have the game, you plug it in,

(1h 30m 20s)

> you then, if you plug it into a new Switch, you have to download updates and DLCs, etc., etc.,

(1h 30m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, sure sure sure sure

(1h 30m 26s) **Al:**

> but technically you have the game on the cartridge.

(1h 30m 30s)

> I still don't get what the big deal about that is if you're going to have updates anyway,

(1h 30m 35s)

> but let's leave that aside.

(1h 30m 38s)

> The thing about the digital game keycard, sorry, not the game keycard, the thing about the game keycard is it's kind of half and half and it has

(1h 30m 48s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(1h 30m 49s) **Al:**

> some of the disadvantages of both and some of the advantages of both. So

(1h 30m 52s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(1h 30m 55s) **Al:**

> I guess it doesn't actually have any of the advantages of digital games, but it does have some of the

(1h 31m)

> advantages and disadvantages of physical games. Well, I don't think it is fully the worst,

(1h 31m 2s) **Kevin:**

> the worst of both worlds.

(1h 31m 4s)

> No, I'm kidding.

(1h 31m 5s) **Al:**

> This is a thing, right?

(1h 31m 5s) **Kevin:**

> I know, I'm kidding.

(1h 31m 7s)

> I'm kidding.

(1h 31m 8s) **Al:**

> Because I think it's an important point because I think that this is the thing I understand why people when you hit it think it is just the worst of both worlds

(1h 31m 15s)

> But I don't think it is yes, you have to plug the cart into your switch to play it, right?

(1h 31m 21s)

> So how this works is when you've got like a normal cart you plug it in the game is there you can click play straight away

(1h 31m 28s)

> Ignoring day one updates and DLC's right if you have the game key cart

(1h 31m 33s)

> you plug it in and the game goes 'oh I need to download that game' so then you have the

(1h 31m 38s)

> edge of digital and that you have multiple gigabytes downloaded on the internet. Fine!

(1h 31m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, well, that's a thing right cuz okay. I get the key card like clearly when talking about the lending thing

(1h 31m 49s)

> It's clearly advantageous. I see it like it's the again

(1h 31m 51s) **Al:**

> - Yeah.

(1h 31m 53s) **Kevin:**

> It's the clear visual of hey, I'm letting you my cartridge so you can play my game right that's very clear to me and because you have my cartridge

(1h 32m)

> I can't play it on my game. I get that

(1h 32m 3s)

> Okay, well, I I guess I'm trying to figure it out right

(1h 32m 7s)

> Let's let's take that out of the equation right just on my own switch

(1h 32m 11s)

> What's the difference between?

(1h 32m 13s)

> The key card versus the full digital version.

(1h 32m 17s) **Al:**

> The only difference when if you buy a game key cart versus buying the digital version the only difference is the you

(1h 32m 26s)

> And your day-to-day usage the only differences that you have to put the cart in the in the switch to play it

(1h 32m 33s)

> Obviously, then there is that that is a disadvantage right?

(1h 32m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(1h 32m 36s) **Al:**

> I totally get that but the advantage is then if you're ever going to sell it you can do that you cannot sell a

(1h 32m 43s)

> a digital version of a game. You can sell a game

(1h 32m 45s) **Kevin:**

> right right yeah wait you can see how do you sell the key car like

(1h 32m 47s) **Al:**

> game which is why I find it a little bit weird that Nintendo has done this because they've just made it easier to sell digital games.

(1h 32m 54s)

> You just, it's a physical card. You can only play the game if the cartridge is in your game in your console.

(1h 33m 1s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, wait, it's a physical car. I thought it was all digital. Oh my goodness

(1h 33m 2s) **Al:**

> So if you sell, no, the game key card, the game key, that's the thing.

(1h 33m 7s)

> The game key card is a physical thing, but all it has on it, all it has on it is the right to play the game when it's plugged into the switch.

(1h 33m 9s) **Kevin:**

> What all

(1h 33m 16s)

> Okay, that's baffling, but okay.

(1h 33m 17s) **Al:**

> So it is weird, right? And this is the thing.

(1h 33m 21s)

> So the question then becomes why are, why do these exist?

(1h 33m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 33m 27s) **Al:**

> And the reason these exist, why would you do this over putting the game on the cartridge is because it's cheaper?

(1h 33m 33s)

> It's cheaper for publishers to do this. That's it. That's it. That's the reason, right?

(1h 33m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Sure, yeah, yeah, that's that's always boils down to that, right?

(1h 33m 41s) **Al:**

> And you can get annoyed at that. And it's fine to get annoyed at that.

(1h 33m 44s)

> I don't think it changes anything practically, right?

(1h 33m 47s)

> Like, this is what, so a couple of things.

(1h 33m 51s)

> One, people are saying that Nintendo have broken a promise because they said they would never put Nintendo developed games on a game keycard.

(1h 34m)

> This is not Nintendo developed game. There you go, right? Like, they explicitly said Nintendo developed.

(1h 34m 3s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(1h 34m 6s) **Al:**

> This is not Nintendo developed. This is Nintendo published, right? You can complain about it all you want, but saying it's a broken promise is stupid because they never promised that.

(1h 34m 15s)

> Okay, but.

(1h 34m 16s) **Kevin:**

> No.

(1h 34m 17s) **Al:**

> I think that in I understand why people are frustrated because it feels like over time over the last 20 years people have owned less owned and I'm being heavy air quotes there owned less and less they never owned any of it.

(1h 34m 32s)

> They've owned less and less as you as become on it and it seems like publishers are making it more and more difficult to have and there's more DRMR did on a blah blah I get that I totally get that I really really really get that.

(1h 34m 45s)

> However, I...

(1h 34m 47s)

> Don't think for 99% of people, I don't think this changes anything practically at all.

(1h 34m 54s)

> If you are buying physical games, the only reason, the only legitimate reason I can imagine for going I cannot have a game keycard compared to a physical card which is because you don't have the internet or you're not able to do big downloads on the internet.

(1h 35m 12s)

> I get those 10 giga thing this game is, I get that, that's, that's, that's a fair.

(1h 35m 17s)

> And that is a totally fair complaint, and I totally understand that.

(1h 35m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Wait. Wait. Is that all like always thing if I want to put the key card into what I have to be connected to the internet to play it or to start the game?

(1h 35m 27s) **Al:**

> Only to do the initial download

(1h 35m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so only only the first time. Okay.

(1h 35m 31s) **Al:**

> Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, you don't have to it

(1h 35m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(1h 35m 34s) **Al:**

> It's like playing a digital game that's on your primary switch that you've got the

(1h 35m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Okay. That's I just want to make sure.

(1h 35m 39s) **Al:**

> The digital car on you don't have to be connected to internet. That's the whole point

(1h 35m 44s)

> Right is this is the cart is the proof that you all you own the game and you can use it own if you will

(1h 35m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(1h 35m 49s)

> Okay.

(1h 35m 51s) **Al:**

> You never own any of these things. I hate the term but let's we're still gonna use that when I say own

(1h 35m 57s)

> What we mean is you own the right to play the game. That's always been the case with games don't pretend otherwise

(1h 36m 3s)

> And I'm not saying it's okay. I'm just saying it is what it is

(1h 36m 4s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, and okay, I'm welcome.

(1h 36m 9s) **Al:**

> Capitalism and lawyers always go to do their thing and that is what they've always done

(1h 36m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(1h 36m 13s) **Al:**

> so

(1h 36m 14s)

> The game car key cartridge is the proof that you are the right person to be playing this copy of the game

(1h 36m 21s) **Kevin:**

> I'm getting sure.

(1h 36m 21s) **Al:**

> It's got a car a key on the cartridge hence game key card

(1h 36m 27s)

> Is the so only the person with that physical cartridge plugged into the switch complete that game

(1h 36m 34s)

> And so if you are someone who doesn't have internet or doesn't have good internet or doesn't have the ability to have big downloads on your internet

(1h 36m 41s)

> I get that I get the complaint about that. I totally get that

(1h 36m 46s)

> For every other person

(1h 36m 48s)

> I do not understand people's complaints about this

(1h 36m 52s)

> Other than it's a principle thing right like or I don't like it out of principle

(1h 36m 58s)

> And fine sure but like the biggest way to buy games just now is on steam

(1h 37m 4s)

> and that is

(1h 37m 6s)

> The same thing right like if you if you complain about digital games just in general

(1h 37m 12s)

> I I feel like you're living in a weird past world where

(1h 37m 17s)

> You wish that you could still physically own games and have them all here and be able to play them without the internet

(1h 37m 23s)

> But that's not a world we live in full stop, right?

(1h 37m 27s)

> You, we live in a world now for better or for worse than I totally get the people would complain that it's for worse, but we live in a world now where you cannot play games without the internet realistically that you can.

(1h 37m 41s)

> We got that issue with, you know, the Xbox one where they were like, oh, you're going to have to be online to play anything and they rolled that back thankfully because that is a stupid decision.

(1h 37m 50s)

> But you're not going to get good at game experiences if you never have the internet because because you're just you're not going to get game.

(1h 37m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Well... (laughs)

(1h 37m 57s) **Al:**

> game day one patches, which are and I totally get the complaint about that, right? Like so many games are released unfinished and then they they have the last few months after they're like, you know, doing things to add to the update and then you have to have the update because they because and here's the thing actually game key cards technically, we'd actually help not to have day one patches and to actually have the very first version of the game have the good version of the game.

(1h 38m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 38m 28s) **Al:**

> Because they don't have to rush out a version of the game for the cartridges. That's why we have day one patches. It's because they want to get it on the cartridge, but they still want to finish more of the game and it takes months to develop to like actually get the game key, the game cartridges printed when it's game key cartridges. It doesn't matter because the game isn't on the cartridges. I'm saying a lot of things and I'm not really sure what my point is other than I think most I think most people are complaining about this.

(1h 38m 51s) **Kevin:**

[laughing]

(1h 38m 57s) **Al:**

> Despite the fact that it doesn't make any difference to their life at all, except you have to have more things. If you don't have a lot of storage and you have a lot of games and that's why you have cartridges because you don't want to have to store them on your switch. I will accept that that's a complaint, but if you're a bit, I mean, it's not just really cheap now. I mean, not on the not on the switch too as much because obviously the news, the new SD cards and that few

(1h 39m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 39m 22s)

> Yeah

(1h 39m 27s)

> Yeah

(1h 39m 27s) **Al:**

> was a little bit unnecessary, but most people's problem is not with these individual decisions is with capitalism, but they like to complain about the individual decisions rather than complaining about the system that emphasizes doing as little as possible for as much money as possible.

(1h 39m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, we have it. Still much better the Vida

(1h 39m 40s)

> Yeah

(1h 39m 44s)

> Yeah, it's

(1h 39m 47s)

> Okay, as someone who is not like I prefer physical by and large be for many of the reasons you've listed like

(1h 39m 54s)

> Not having the storage on the switch. I haven't gotten out and bought the terra white guesty car whatever, but anyways, there's reasons, but like

(1h 40m 4s)

> Like I'm not invested in this keycard debate. It doesn't all like as you've seen I didn't even understand it. I probably still don't fully understand it

(1h 40m 11s)

> But I will say

(1h 40m 12s) **Al:**

> Yeah, you would probably, you would probably buy one and go,

(1h 40m 15s)

> oh, I have to download a big, a big update, all right.

(1h 40m 17s)

> I'm gonna, like that's, that's what it's gonna seem like.

(1h 40m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but like you yeah, yeah, but like you said like you said a lot of games do that now

(1h 40m 21s) **Al:**

> You plug in the cartridge and it has a big update.

(1h 40m 26s) **Kevin:**

> They had the day one patches, and you know, here's the secret what it

(1h 40m 27s) **Al:**

> Yeah, the PS5 and the Xbox require that

(1h 40m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, they're

(1h 40m 31s) **Al:**

> with every single game for the record.

(1h 40m 32s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, and they're horrendous with it

(1h 40m 34s)

> Um, and I like you but anyways, but it's not a crazy concept

(1h 40m 38s)

> It's just the only thing to me is that now we've got this weird third half version of the game

(1h 40m 46s)

> I mean, you know, it's not physical digital or has the weird

(1h 40m 49s)

> mix of the match. It's just another like in the realm of

(1h 40m 56s)

> this, I want to buy a game, pop the day and play it, you know,

(1h 41m)

> having all these other steps and versions, it's adding, it's

(1h 41m 4s)

> it's noisy. That's what it is. And you know, that's, that's, I

(1h 41m 5s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I agree, that's fair.

(1h 41m 8s) **Kevin:**

> think that's a big issue or underlying issue for people on the

(1h 41m 13s)

> maybe aren't expressing you well. But clearly, of course, there are

(1h 41m 16s)

> stupid complaints like the people say our body is only

(1h 41m 19s)

> but not the key cards that that's why but yeah but that that's pretty funny

(1h 41m 21s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah, I don't know whether that person was trolling or not, but that's that's so bizarre.

(1h 41m 27s)

> I understand the like, I want the world where I can just buy a game off the shelf and immediately plug it into my switch and immediately play it.

(1h 41m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Yes, yes

(1h 41m 36s) **Al:**

> But I don't, I just don't think that exists even without game key cards.

(1h 41m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Well, well, here's I mean you yeah, but but but what are the game sucks after the day?

(1h 41m 41s) **Al:**

> Because because of the day one patches, right? Like that's still a thing that exists.

(1h 41m 51s)

> You're, but the patch is still there, right? Like, you're still, you still have to download the update. And yeah, it's a smaller update than the full game.

(1h 41m 53s) **Kevin:**

> I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I know. I know. I know yet. I'm kidding

(1h 41m 59s)

> Yeah, yeah, but okay

(1h 42m 5s)

> I'll say you won your argument. I'll I don't know what the argument is, but you want it. I'm not

(1h 42m 8s) **Al:**

> You're probably the wrong person to have this argument with me because you don't seem to have

(1h 42m 13s)

> a much of an opinion on it, right? I just like, I think I get the storage and the downloads

(1h 42m 15s) **Kevin:**

> No, I really okay

(1h 42m 21s)

> Yes, look

(1h 42m 21s) **Al:**

> complete. I get that I totally get that. But other than that, I think that people are just

(1h 42m 24s) **Kevin:**

> I will I mean I will set like

(1h 42m 26s) **Al:**

> they're complaining with no real reason.

(1h 42m 29s) **Kevin:**

> my

(1h 42m 30s)

> my thoughts like I thought

(1h 42m 33s)

> Overall, I thought it was a good thing because the way...

(1h 42m 35s)

> So I think cards are good for that, but there's still the physical bit of it, and I didn't understand that, so I don't know...

(1h 42m 50s) **Al:**

> Yeah, I think the I think I think the argument against that is like I don't think if game key cards didn't exist is

(1h 43m)

> Pokemon pokopia not going to have a physical edition. I doubt it. I think it would have a physical edition, right?

(1h 43m 8s)

> I think I I don't think many games if game key cards didn't existed. I don't think many games would go digital only

(1h 43m 16s)

> I think the games have most of the games that have game key cards with

(1h 43m 20s)

> just released a physical version and they just have less profit and yeah that's I get that that sucks like that's that's we're not getting anything out of this we're not getting any cheaper games we're not getting any more out of this it's just that the companies are making more profit because they're choosing to use that thing.

(1h 43m 39s)

> But equally I just think it's a big storm in a tiny teacup.

(1h 43m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Sure sure probably

(1h 43m 50s)

> Well, see I say that can't you check in on March 5th when I have to buy the key card for Procopia, and then I'll know what I'm talking about kind of maybe

(1h 43m 50s) **Al:**

> And it's not a difficult concept.

(1h 44m) **Kevin:**

> Then welcome back to this argument

(1h 44m 6s) **Al:**

> Just think of it as a if the physical version didn't actually end up having the game because the entire game is a day one path.

(1h 44m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, man, you know, I might fit so fall out 76

(1h 44m 22s)

> I don't know if this is still the case by at least when it launched the physical version of fall out 76

(1h 44m 29s)

> Was the like cardboard actually like it was just a cardboard disc with the game, you know like a download code on it

(1h 44m 36s) **Al:**

> Yeah, yeah. Well, that's, that's the other thing as well. Like that was a reasonably common thing in

(1h 44m 41s)

> this which lifetime where you would have, you would buy a physical thing and it would say

(1h 44m 46s)

> this is just a key and you would open it up and it was just like a cord to download from the

(1h 44m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, especially for some of the smaller games that yeah

(1h 44m 51s) **Al:**

> eShop. Yeah, exactly. What does I think this is essentially replacing that? And I do, I do think

(1h 44m 59s)

> this is better than that, like a million times better than that. I get the complaint that like some

(1h 45m 6s)

> using game keycards instead of using, putting the game on the cartridge. But I think a lot of it is

(1h 45m 10s)

> also people using game keycards instead of putting code in box and code in box is terrible.

(1h 45m 17s)

> It's dreadful. It shouldn't, it shouldn't exist. The only reason it exists is because then,

(1h 45m 17s) **Kevin:**

> nope

(1h 45m 19s)

> nope

(1h 45m 23s) **Al:**

> you know, grandparent can go into shop and go, oh, look, there's a game and buy it for their kid and

(1h 45m 27s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, that's great.

(1h 45m 28s) **Al:**

> then they give them it. And then they have this piece of plastic that doesn't have anything in it

(1h 45m 32s)

> other than a piece of paper.

(1h 45m 33s) **Kevin:**

> Yep, yep.

(1h 45m 36s) **Al:**

> that's stupid. I mean, the only games I, I only buy games physically for two reasons

(1h 45m 40s)

> now personally. One is because I don't think, I think I'm going to want to sell it, right?

(1h 45m 45s)

> I'm not going to play it for a huge amount of time. I want to play it. I want to sell it.

(1h 45m 49s)

> Which game key cards you can still do. And the second one is because I like it. The box

(1h 45m 53s)

> it on my shelf. And that's just Pokemon games basically. Well listeners, if you want to

(1h 45m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, okay, you won the argument

## Outro

(1h 46m 4s) **Al:**

> Tell me why I'm stupid.

(1h 46m 6s)

> I'm wrong, then. Please do. I'm definitely going to put a rage-bitty title for this episode.

(1h 46m 8s) **Kevin:**

> and I'm oh that's that's a good one I like that the key card debate or

(1h 46m 23s)

> something yeah yeah yeah here's why there you go I've just been looking at

(1h 46m 23s) **Al:**

> Game key cards are actually good

(1h 46m 27s)

> Now I'll get the views up

(1h 46m 31s)

> All right Kevin anything you want to share with the audience?

(1h 46m 36s) **Kevin:**

> the sock in a trailer in the mackerel.

(1h 46m 38s)

> It's just trying to decipher. Go at soccer. What is this game I need to know? Whatever. You have Cooper Perez on whatever. Where ever go look me up. I haven't had time to make art. So whatever. Go to check it out. It's all like.

(1h 48m 37s) **Kevin:**

(1h 48m 39s) **Al:**

> I haven't actually looked at any of the cards. I probably should do that.

(1h 48m 43s)

> But then the problem then is I want to buy them.

(1h 48m 49s) **Kevin:**

> the set looks good overall. The mechanics, again, you guess what fantasy ish, adjacent series
