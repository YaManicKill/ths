46
00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.840
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Let's see it is

58
00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Why am I getting Bowser Jr. Ben Shapiro?

59
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.580
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What is happening?

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Really, you know what no this is appropriate because it was me and you specifically out on the rainbow road radio where we

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm I'm so thrilled for her. She's probably thrilled to bits to be Rosalina because that's a boss character to be and holy

65
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.139
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I can't remember, I can't remember if we made that prediction whether it would be Rosalina or just we were just in general saying it'd be great for it to be in it.

66
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.319
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, we were actually a live-action casting and we threw Brie in for peace. Yeah

67
00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:34.459
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh live action, oh live action be peach right makes sense yeah okay fair enough fair enough this works this works.

70
00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.680
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'll learn how to edit. I'll get that up and running. We'll do it. Just just hit me up

71
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I mean, I just like the implication that you listen to this podcast, you know, that's enough

72
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Mmm, you never know. Look there was a non-zero chance. She's listened to an episode of rainbow road radio. I'm just saying

73
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's near zero.

74
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Near zero, but not zero

75
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.279
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Sure, sure. Technically, it's non-zero.

76
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: She's she sounds great as Rosalina Rosalina looks great they have her smash moves set in the trailer

77
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: She does some of her smash moves

78
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Which is so cool. Uh, they're they're they're

79
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:52.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: pretty solid with their references and whatnot. What one minor thing? So, you know, obviously Bowser Jr. with the painting, that's well established, but we get Bowser senior painting and that that's a fun little thing I think, you know, we see the through line there like father like son, but yeah, looks great. What's interesting is we got that, I forget the name of it, the desert Mexico world from Odyssey, we see it in the trailer.

80
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: because there's the upside down period up here.

81
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Hmm. Yeah. I hadn't noticed that, but yeah.

82
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:06.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I mean, this is the opportunity where every little world is going to be a Mario reference of some kind.

83
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So.

84
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: - Yeah, so I'm intrigued as to what are they doing here, right?

85
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because we've got Bowser Jr.

86
00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.639
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And we've clearly got his story from Sunshine, right?

87
00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.720
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like you see him with the paintbrush.

88
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: He, you know, they're doing his origin story, if you will.

89
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.180
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But we've also got, as you say, some things from Odyssey.

90
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.100
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And we've obviously got Rosalina, you know,

91
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.740
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: from Galaxy and it's called Galaxy.

92
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.740
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So like, why did you...

93
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is a feel like they've got multiple films that are smooshing together here.

94
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.019
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, I mean, I think it's probably the right play because you know, it's not like

95
00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:50.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Mari there's a plot I associate with every game or whatever

96
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's just more the setting the vibes as the kid would say right so you know

97
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Taking bits here and they're just putting together into a little journey film. I think it works

98
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm okay with that

99
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:18.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna judge it until we see it. I'm just fascinated as to what they're what they're doing here. Like these, it's not like these stories have like a through line between them, right?

100
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:32.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Um, so it's, you know, and it's not like it's gonna be, uh, you know, an anthology or anything. Um, I think you probably could take any of the games and their stories and flesh them out to be a film.

101
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And so, Mike, are they just like...

102
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know.

103
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't know. Like, what's happening?

104
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:44.319
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm fascinated. Like, I don't understand how they're going to end up going into space,

105
00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.480
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but also going to, you know, Mexico.

106
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like, I don't, what plot brings them to both those places.

107
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.939
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: like it's it's the it's the woods

108
00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:01.379
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's the the stars are just falling the star we're shooting some look Bowser Jr. We're here. Let's go there. That's it. That's it. That's fine

109
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I just, like, it feels like the going to multiple different places is a story, right?

110
00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.779
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

111
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.100
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Where you're like, "Oh, we're, we're, we're searching for something."

112
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:09.779
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

113
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.519
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But I don't think that takes you to places on Earth and also going into space.

114
00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:18.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, the desert world is gonna be it's on the world. It's it's not gonna be

115
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.860
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: on earth or Mario or through it or I know was but I think they're gonna take

116
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So it's not so it's not the Odyssey level then because that was like.

117
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:32.379
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: liberty and just put it in some planet. That's what I think. That's what I would

118
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:41.139
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I guess maybe you could yeah maybe I'm just look I just we I want I feel like if they're gonna do the sunshine story you got to do the sunshine story and get Mario arrested

119
00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:36.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: that's it's it's literally

120
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:50.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, oh, you know what? That is an excellent point. That's an excellent counterpoint.

121
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:54.259
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like sunshine you say like there's not a big a clear story in each of the games I agree with you but sunshine is the most story they have

122
00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You're right. He gets arrested. You have the big climactic fight with the robot. And that was

123
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.379
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: your junior, the shadow mark. You're super right. That's sometimes it would be the one to

124
00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:13.419
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: turn into a film like that. Well, that is insane.

125
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.700
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So it looks like they're taking the story of sunshine and throwing it into Mario Galaxy instead and I'm not saying I'm not saying that can't work. I'm just

126
00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:18.379
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: they could still do it later because they don't have shadow Mario, right? Like, you know, I could play

127
00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:27.820
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: on that later. Yeah. Well, look, Bowser Junior has had the paintbrush way longer than sunshine at

128
00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:23.320
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, you don't I mean you don't know that like that was the whole point of the paintbrush

129
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:38.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: this point. So it's it's fine. Yeah, it is. Yeah, everything is when he was first there. Um, yeah.

130
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.240
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, that was when it was first there.

131
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So like, I'm not, I just like, what do you do with the paint brush to start off with if it's not shadow my

132
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: he just he just has or or okay yeah putting my real Mario hat on

133
00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:58.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: it's it's the segue to the e-gad the little Luigi's Mansion movie yeah there he

134
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, but you're still going to do something with the paintbrush, right?

135
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:08.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't think he's gonna be in it

136
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'd be surprised if Shadow Mario wasn't in there.

137
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.740
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the Bowser Junior has his already the show he gets a little like painted

138
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.740
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: shadowy form already, they're not going to show you.

139
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's fine.

140
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We'll see. We'll see.

141
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, just a couple other quick notes.

142
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: One, okay, spoiler for people who didn't know or didn't

145
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yo, she's in this film, but was noticeably

146
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: not in this trailer.

147
00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:37.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, that's interesting. Is that like I wonder what the deal is with that is that just like he's gonna

148
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh.

149
00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:45.139

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That egg got there through the pipe and

153
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:58.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They're actually all in the mushroom kingdom or something weird like that.

154
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I just like what's what's going to be the link there? Why that?

155
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:07.500

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: that's a good question because you know we didn't see any regular New York

157
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.820
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: or or whatever in the movie or in the trailer excuse me so I don't know

158
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: that's a good question we'll see I mean we don't have any Yoshi it also

159
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:30.299
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: we'll see but they do yeah but I managed that hard to go back and forth

160
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:25.039
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, well and and and Mario and Luigi live in the mushroom kingdom now after the first film

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I just I just suspect it's gonna be hand-waved away

162
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: oh yeah absolutely that of course that's the look I enjoyed the Mario

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:45.259
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: know deep themes or whatever I expect everything to just get a hand wave

165
00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:47.659
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the way

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Some of them are so silly as well. Like the one the one that is the most ridiculous was the

174
00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:34.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The Captain America brave new world red Hulk spoiler

175
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.220

181
00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.759
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It might be in a year or so because I was delayed by quite a long time

182
00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:55.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And I know that they did have they did have Red Hulk in one of the trailers

183
00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:53.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, almost a year.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.600
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but I'm pretty sure that it was way before that that we spoiled in the

185
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, they spoiled everything.

186
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.440
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: McDonald's League

187
00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:05.500

192
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh wait, I have seen this, I have seen this, this image. No, I did, I did click. He looks fine.

193
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: remaining one is yeah I know I agree he looks fine he looks like what I expect

194
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.440
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, he looks like Yoshi. I don't know what to say.

195
00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:33.659
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: sent Yoshi in the movie to look like

196
00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.320
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: yeah shocker

197
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: one is he going to talk or is it gonna be Yoshi noises I'm leaning towards the

198
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.139
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: ladder because that's another excuse to throw a big name in there

199
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What do I think is gonna happen

200
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: or what do I want to happen?

201
00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:50.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: do you either or tell me both I guess

202
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: - I honestly don't know either way

203
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: which way they would go with it

204
00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:54.559
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: because they've made some great decisions

205
00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.120
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and they've made some bizarre decisions.

206
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.320
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You don't know, Chris Pratt.

207
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:07.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: no that wasn't a bizarre decision it was a not a not well like to see

208
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: but I it makes sense to me why did

209
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.039
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You remember when he did that thing

210
00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:12.720
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like before any of the trailers came out?

211
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.320
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: He was like, oh, I've been working on my Mario voice

212
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and then he does a voice that's just his voice.

213
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

214
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.399
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then everybody was like, does he think,

215
00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: is this a bit or does he think he's doing

216
00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:24.799
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I

217
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.559
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: a different voice than normal?

218
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.419
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Think one of my favorite parts of the whole Chris Pratt thing was the picture they used when they announced it you know like the black

219
00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:36.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the head shot.

220
00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:37.179
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, I like just something about that just just felt so foreboding

221
00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.360
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I've been watching, have you,

222
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.639
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you've probably not watched the studio

223
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Apple TV?

224
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No

225
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.320
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But it's our, I call my dear about like the industry

226
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, that sounds good

227
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.320
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but it's the main, the main character is Seth Rogan

228
00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:55.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay

229
00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:56.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and the reason I say that is because

230
00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:58.600
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like every time he laughs, I'm like, don't get calm.

231
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: [laughing]

232
00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:04.080
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And it's like, I've not seen a huge amount

233
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: of stuff with him in it and I just realized

234
00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:08.879
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like the don't get calm, like his laugh is just his laugh.

235
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It is. Yeah. No, it is. Yeah. Like Seth Rogan was a good pick for that bit, but that was just a

236
00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:11.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like the, it's just, it's really,

237
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: [laughing]

238
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Seth Rogan, you know, it was. Um,

239
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't,

240
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't just like him as don't come.

241
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.080
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I really hope they just do noises.

242
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.440
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And obviously there is precedent for them like,

243
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I will yeah

244
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.200
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: 'cause like Mario doesn't really talk,

245
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.200
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like he just only says a few phrases and stuff like that.

246
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.620
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

247
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But I think if I think, here's why I really want you

248
00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:38.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: to talk.

249
00:15:38.679 --> 00:15:41.120
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Not just because like you're, it doesn't talk,

250
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.559
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: she just makes sure she noises, right?

251
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

252
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.600
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But also, if Yoshi talks, Link is going to talk.

253
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.120
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Dude Link is gonna talk

254
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Link is gonna look no it's not Yoshi Mario talking Mario talk even Link was gonna talk that that was already sent stone for me

255
00:15:55.159 --> 00:16:01.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: No, I don't think, I think there's difference there because, yeah, Link makes noises, but he doesn't say any words.

256
00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:04.200
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That that's very true he does say

257
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.360
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Where does Mario did say words?

258
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: He does say hogi and wind waker when he pushes and pulls expressing his love of seeing

259
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.080
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't, I haven't played that. Is that a joke?

260
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is like, this is like gay bows are all over it again.

261
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't actually know it sounds like the English word for hogi hogi anyways

262
00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.919
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, exactly

263
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:29.879
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, well the only thing that Yoshi might not talk because he's not a human right because Mario was human or his short-weight or whatever

264
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah. They made the Luma's talk. I'm not unhappy about that. I do think it works with what they've

265
00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:32.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So you know makes sense

266
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, oh, you know

267
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.399
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, no

268
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: done. But I just,

269
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:42.919
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They've done a good job with their decisions whether you like the decision or you know that's

270
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:58.080
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: another manner, but I think they did a good job with the decisions and actually yeah, well the most okay I think most

271
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Trisprach

272
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:58.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, that's he's legitimately the only casting issue I have with any of these

273
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:06.160
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: people everyone else like yep though that's a goal that's a goal and then the crisp but anyway okay I won't go too

274
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.279
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: deep in it because I mean that's that's all thing anyways say that we never actually did review the

275
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that's it, and our, so we'll get to that.

276
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:22.839
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But there is one final issue or a question, I mean, there's, there's a lot of stuff, but there's a lot of,

277
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Is that not just 'cause Alex didn't, what doesn't like it?

278
00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:19.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: [laughing]

279
00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.599
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Doesn't want to talk about it.

280
00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: [laughing]

281
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:30.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Mario stuff to talk about. We did, there was plenty to cover anyways. Um, uh, the other question,

282
00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:39.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: do we get the depressed Luma back? Will it return? Now is it a cameo or is it going to be like the Luma?

283
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.839
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, all for sure, for sure.

284
00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:42.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So my right, do you want my theory for this?

285
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:50.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The reason they go into space is to get the lima back to Rosalina.

286
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.740
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know because we see because the stars are falling we see

287
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah

288
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:06.240
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yes, but why are the stars falling? We don't know why and I think it's because Rosalina's trying to find the missing luma

289
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:20.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I guess, I think it's going to be more Bowser Junior is often space when we have to chase him, but whatever, okay, then

290
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:23.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: No, I don't think we find, I don't think we find Bowser Junior to a lens space because he introduces himself in space.

291
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.240
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Does it

292
00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:29.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm pretty sure that's what happens in the trailer. You're on Rosalina's space station.

293
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, you might be right. Here we are. You know as we do frame by framing and over analyzing the two-minute trailer

294
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, it's April. I didn't just realize it in cats. That's soon. Oh, that's coming soon. Oh, wow. Oh, that's exciting

295
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:57.240
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, I'm hyped for this movie rainbow road radio presents. Kevin is excited for the Mario movie galaxy movie whatever Rosie looks great or dresses. I'll shine

296
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.220
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Ah, I'm so excited.

297
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Okay.

298
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - All right.

299
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:09.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Also, like I just I would I just I think these sequences in this trailer have been put there to

300
00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:03.660
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Ow.

301
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: To miss leaders. I don't think that these are the sequences that the trailer the

302
00:19:16.259 --> 00:19:23.299
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The order that the sequences are happening in but yeah, no, no, yeah, that's definitely so I'm I'm looking back at the bit with with

303
00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:28.940
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Preserve Jr. He's he's deaf. That's definitely Rosalina's space. Oh, no, maybe as peaches castle

304
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.619
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's hard to tell because it's a green area with a castle-like building and you see other like structures in the back and

305
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:40.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But yeah, but it's definitely not in like you're either not in the mushroom kingdom or

306
00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:46.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You're like in a bubble or something like that. So I guess maybe as come down

307
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:55.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know. It's hard to say. It looks a little big for her observatory, but you know,

308
00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:57.019
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: they might be mixing it up.

309
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.119
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But that also, when you see that later on, you definitely, it's not the same design as in Galaxy.

310
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.440
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like it looks much bigger.

311
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:12.220
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. We'll see, but I'm excited. All right. There you go. Rainbow Road mini

312
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:19.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: segment over. I'll tell me what you've been up to. Okay. Wait. I forget. Okay. I've listened to

313
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Ah, welcome on!

314
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the episodes, but I don't even remember. Have you had, you hit credits, right? You beat it?

315
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:30.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So, I don't think I had last time, last episode, but I have no, yes.

316
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.299
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay. Okay. You have hit credits. Okay.

317
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So, I have, I have done almost everything in the game.

318
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:42.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So, I hit credits, I've completed the Pokedex, I've done all by one of the side quests.

319
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All by one of like your research quests.

320
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:54.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So, there's very, it's basically all I've got left to do is battles.

321
00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:01.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: A lot of battles to do, but with no real aim other than finishing it.

322
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.339
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Yeah.

323
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The absolute, I presume you know about the final battle research task.

324
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Uh, here, text to me, tell me, I might, I don't root.

325
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm just going to say it's not a big spoiler, you have to get you have to have a thousand battles.

326
00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.019
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Okay.

327
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Oh, okay, no, I didn't know that, dang.

328
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.599
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You have to win a thousand battles to get the shiny charm.

329
00:21:20.819 --> 00:21:21.660
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Woo.

330
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.059
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Woo, that's how you get the shiny charm.

331
00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:31.200
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, so you get the shiny charm by doing every single research task. So there's research tasks

332
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: that give you points and you go up levels and once you've done all of the research tasks,

333
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:45.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you have maxed out the research levels and the last one is the shiny

334
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: charm. But when you've if you've done everything else except the final task, you need 100 more

335
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay

336
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.240
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yep

337
00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:57.279
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: points to get the final level. But the final research task gives you a thousand. So it's so unnecessary.

338
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, that's cruel. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, I love that

339
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:06.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And there's there's no other way you can't get the shiny you don't have to do every single

340
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: research task because of how the points work. But you have to do that one. You cannot get enough

341
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.339
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, but you have to do that one.

342
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: points without doing that.

343
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:29.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And I thought so I have done almost everything in except the last thing that is basically like you have to like when when the post game battle thing like a certain amount of times before you then do the final main story which unlocks the final side quest.

344
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:40.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: okay so okay now are these battles the the the royale battles or like wild battles

345
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:39.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So I've done everything except that and I am like 300 battles.

346
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It can be any battle.

347
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:49.759
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: too okay wild battles too oh it has to be a trainer okay well

348
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But it has to be a trainer battle.

349
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.039
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It has to be a trainer battle, but it can be any trainer battle.

350
00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:55.119
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So like most people who don't want to do it manually, they're like setting up,

351
00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:59.119
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: they've got cafe battle cafes like they had in X and Y and you can just,

352
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:06.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's right.

353
00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:04.480
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you can set up a macro which is like shoulder button A and it just keeps spamming

354
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: that and it will win battles and eventually you can get them done in like eight hours of a macro.

355
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Grab that rubber band around that control stick, good times.

356
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.519
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So yeah, that's probably while I end up doing, but I'm going to finish the last main quest and

357
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: side quest because they're mostly battle related as well. So I'll just get them done

358
00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:30.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: once I've done that. I'll still have like 600 battles to go. It's absolutely mad.

359
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:47.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I agree. That that is absolutely

360
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like I think it would be one thing if it was 500 was the top one because I don't think,

361
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't think anyone's going to get 500 now play through. And so like saying like,

362
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You have to then do another

363
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.599
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: 100 on top of that is mad I don't know who made that decision and it's weird that they've

364
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: bad thing. That's wild.

365
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:58.319

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Great game. If you've not played it, go play it.

459
00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:13.299
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is a great time to go get it. It is only 17 pounds.

460
00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:14.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't know what it is in dollars.

461
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.220
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: can't guarantee which limited edition paid

462
00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.240
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: uh...

463
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: deals these are available right now

464
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

465
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.660
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: uh...

466
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the one glaring flaw

467
00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:28.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Next, we have Dragon Shelter.

468
00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:36.259
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Their Kickstarter pre-launch is no live, which is not very much news.

469
00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:41.660
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All you can do is click on it and click Save and get notified when the Kickstarter launches.

470
00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But if you're really excited about the farming game with dragons,

471
00:29:43.000 --> 00:30:11.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, look, I mean, it is cool. I'll say that the dragons and and they built this up and jumping on trampolines and cooking. That's cool, but I'm just not a fan. Look movies do the same thing. Here's the teaser trailer drops tomorrow. Get excited. Yes, not a fan of that. Yeah, but anyways the game's cute.

472
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, it's news of news and announcement of an announcement.

473
00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:12.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I get I kind of get it for a Kickstarter, right? Because like it's such a

474
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:43.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, you got to get the algorithm. Yeah, that's true. That is true. Yep, that algorithm. You got to get got to get in there. I need to see more I think, but I like the concept, but we'll see.

475
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like you got to get people excited your first day and your last day are your biggest days for

476
00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:22.700
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: kickstarters. So I totally get why people do it because if they get loads of people to

477
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.940
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: to follow it, then they're more likely to get it quickly.

478
00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:32.059
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I

479
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:38.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: decided as to whether I'm backing this we shall

480
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:52.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I will consider it. Next we have out and about and a bit their big summer update is launching the end of the time.

481
00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:04.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Sorry. It's something very funny about this. So just to clear up the confusion, summer in the game, not in real life.

482
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait what oh, okay. It's that southern hemisphere summer

483
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So it's the it's stuff related to summer in the game. I'm pretty sure.

484
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So the story will continue with three more friendship, friendship levels per character, a new character moving to town. The season will change to summer.

485
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The season will change to summer with lots of new summer plants and mushrooms and also new skins of existing plants.

486
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:41.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Whereas interesting is the way this words it makes it sound like everybody is going to be changing to summer when the update comes out, but I'm guessing that's not it, right?

487
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.099
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Probably not. I, okay. You know, it is good. That, that would be very weird.

488
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:51.099
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Man, it's like Pokemon seasons, but you're forced to.

489
00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:59.400
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I, I will say it's interesting because this is the game where it's heavy about

490
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.099
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: like foraging and looking at little plants and stuff.

491
00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:06.599
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So, you know, changing the season would actually have a big impact.

492
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Presumably on the, you know, floor and fauna you can interact with.

493
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So that is neat.

494
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yes, there's also a new area and a paddleboard to move around the lake.

495
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, okay. Oh, okay

496
00:32:23.299 --> 00:32:29.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You do you okay paddle. Yeah, that's a new one. I don't think anyone's paddled before our paddle boarded. So all right

497
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.240
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah. I'm sure there's a game that's done it, but yeah, I've not seen one.

498
00:32:33.599 --> 00:32:37.759
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's launching at the end of November. Next, we have an update that's actually out,

499
00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:42.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and that's the story of season's grand bizarre 1.2 update. This adds more items,

500
00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: more rewards to the bingo that they added in the last update.

501
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:52.099
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Did you think, mmm, I think I'll wait to be a sushi chef before I play this game?

502
00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:54.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, now you can join in, finally.

503
00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah. Here we go. Not just the suit, you could not only get look like a sushi set.

504
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.599
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You can also have a sushi glider in both tuna or shrimp.

505
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.180
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. I'm down for that trip has the tail, a little

506
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:21.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: shrimp tail. Yeah. Oh, that's a good one. Oh, that's like my brother Calvin is, it's

507
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.599
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: of course it's shrimp.

508
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.259
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There you go, I'm not a big shrimp guy.

509
00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:25.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: probably one of his three favorite top three favorite foods like shrimp engine. I live

510
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: by the coast growing up into the large portion of my up

511
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:40.240
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: up until pretty much I moved to Atlanta. So I'm big on seafood in general and shrimp's good.

512
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.200
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I like lots of different fishes, I'm just not a shrimp fan.

513
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There's something weird about the taste.

514
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:49.440
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, sure. Okay. You know, shrimp is interesting because it's so hard to compare to anything

515
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah

516
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: else. But but I get it. Yeah. Yeah. It tastes like shrimp. Yeah. All right.

517
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It tastes like shrimp

518
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.799
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Next speaking of grand bazaar, we have

519
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:59.519
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: finally we know about the

520
00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:08.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma crossover with grand bazaar and that is that the animals are coming the grand bazaar animals are

521
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.280
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Live in Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma

522
00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.639
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So if you want some

523
00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: grand bizarre if you want some story of seasons animals in your room factory.

524
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.480
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Finally, finally you can do it.

525
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:31.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I thought that was already in there, I thought that was part of the deal, I thought the cow would always be present in either title, okay.

526
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.579
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: No, I think Rimfactory M has like monster animals basically

527
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I mean, yeah, but that cow though.

528
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well four story seasons not for Rimfactory. Come on get with it

529
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: should be.

530
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The other day is out now

531
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.219
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All right next we've got Pokemon pokopia. We got

532
00:34:52.519 --> 00:35:04.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: We're doing it, we're doing it now, we're doing it, the real meat of the episode, that's

533
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We got a ten

534
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:09.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: minute trailer for this game. We learned so much. Let's go through the things that people complain about first.

535
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:15.219
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: good one, nothing, we're done.

536
00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:19.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: $70 game. It is a $70 game. You know what? Fine, I get the complaints. I'm still buying it.

537
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.760
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yes, not on that, I'm going to say it's worth it, but I get it though.

538
00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:27.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think it'll be worth it as well, but I totally get it. I totally get it.

539
00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.780
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But I get it, yes, I get it, yeah, they're right, but it's worth it, it's going to be worth

540
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:38.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: more than another $70 games, I'm going to you, Mark, or world, sorry.

541
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, yeah.

542
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Wow. I really fell off a cliff, didn't it?

543
00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:40.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Boy did they?

544
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:47.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Two game key. It's on the game key cards. You can buy it digitally or with the game key card, not with the game loaded onto a cart.

545
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We're going to talk about that later. So probably no point to talk about it here. I suspect.

546
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.820
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Okay, okay, sure, sure.

547
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Let's talk about it later. Let's talk about it later. But it was announced that that is the case.

548
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's coming out on the 5th of March.

549
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.440
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: that soon, well, I was like, okay, that's, that's my one minor, right, could, what

550
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's very soon. It is a week after Pokémon Day.

551
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: it have killed them to push the week up, you know, released early by a week, would it,

552
00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:22.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But in the end, it may be a wood of button.

553
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Maybe it would have

554
00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:32.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because then no, so this is so this is the thing then it would have been a February release rather than a March release and they have a different game that they want to release in February instead

555
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.619
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I hate this. I hate this.

556
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They already, what was it? I think they're saying out something dropping. Oh, the DLC drops that day.

557
00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:42.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The deep the what do you see?

558
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Uh, legends, the Z8 DLC, I think drops that day.

559
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That's December

560
00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.139
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: December? I could have sworn there's something they already announced dropping on the 26th.

561
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There is yeah, so there's something in January. What was it?

562
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Now on Pokemon!

563
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: No, so I think

564
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:03.480
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, but I think you're confusing the fact that they originally said that

565
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:14.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The the news story for the DLC would drop by the 28th of February and and so we were assuming. Oh, that means it's coming on Pokemon day, right?

566
00:37:14.199 --> 00:37:16.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because that's the day after Pokemon day

567
00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:19.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But then the announced last

568
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.440
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: week that it's actually coming out on the 10th of December instead. I don't know why they said by then,

569
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, yeah, I get this from

570
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.519
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: it was such a weird thing to do to be like oh yeah this DLC is going to release by this day and then

571
00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:31.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: release it two months before that. It's a really weird decision.

572
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.320
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that is very weird. I don't know, but okay, that it's must be what I'm thinking but okay, but well

573
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:43.139
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, animal crossing that's coming in January the switch to update and the 3.0 update that's coming in January

574
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But

575
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.280
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But still it couldn't have been that hard to do it

576
00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:51.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, we don't know what's coming we don't know what the release is for February yet, right? They've got there might be something big

577
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:56.239
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: All right, okay, okay fine, you're right legends joto will drop that day instead fine fine fair no

578
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: No, just Nintendo in general

579
00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, but it's Pokemon day. Oh, okay. All right. I'll try to hold it

580
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:07.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They've very rarely actually released something on Pokemon day, right like Pokemon day is for telling us all about

581
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:15.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: all right. Moving past that. Yeah, they kind of do. Yeah, yeah, okay. Oh, yeah,

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the three K gems you get for logging on right now. You're right. It's enough to do a

584
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And I'm like, I always think there's like, I don't know if this is a lot or not.

585
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:32.280
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: pull. So it's it's a decent amount. Um, it's.

602
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then you see this like destroyed town.

639
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:30.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: nowhere. It's like a beam and just materializes. Maybe, maybe.

640
00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:29.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It does it does is that interdimensional travel. I don't know

641
00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:33.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But but see here's another thing we then

642
00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.139
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Get this poke decks on the ground, which has a picture of this

643
00:41:38.699 --> 00:41:45.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Digital or add it oh, but I'm guess it is clearly meant to be this digital next to a trainer in front of the pokemon center

644
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:54.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Yep. Yep. Clearly. Yeah. No. That's, I mean, if you look in the background of the shot,

645
00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So this

646
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:56.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Trainer died in the apocalypse, right? Yeah

647
00:41:54.559 --> 00:41:59.579
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: there's ruined stuff. It's, it's clear that somebody died here. Yeah. No, definitely.

648
00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:03.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There's like a it's a wheelbarrow and some boot a book and berries

649
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.059
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I thought it was like a boat. I don't know. There's,

650
00:42:04.219 --> 00:42:11.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All this so there's definitely so there's a substitute doll there. There's a cherry belly cherry

651
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Cherryberry leopard bear whatever one of those berries is a barrier book.

652
00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:17.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Berry a book a ball I saw a ball or is that another

653
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Berry as a pile of books maybe a towel

654
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:25.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Just a whole bunch of stuff kind of like it looks like a shipwreck sort of thing.

655
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.820
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah

656
00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:27.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Just a bunch of debris. That's like

657
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:34.940
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then we've got this this trainer who's obviously dead now and digital stairs and turns into

658
00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:37.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: a version of its trainer I guess

659
00:42:38.539 --> 00:42:43.820
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, why I wanted to check out was what does this pokemon center look like? Because

660
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:53.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: compared in the model. Yeah, I think some sort of canton

661
00:42:46.139 --> 00:42:47.639
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, so I think...

662
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:53.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: that looks like the Let's Go Pokemon Center.

663
00:42:53.340 --> 00:43:01.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, so definitely looking at the Let's Go model, it's almost identical to that.

664
00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:03.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Let's see if we've got...

665
00:43:03.659 --> 00:43:05.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's just a list of...

666
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:15.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You'd think there'd be the way to go Joe Serra being finally, you know, this is your time to shine and then look at his glottings, though

667
00:43:16.179 --> 00:43:22.019
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know it looks like the I think the fire red leaf green center too

668
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:27.860
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: which would make sense. The other one that I was thinking of was whether it looked like Sun

669
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.099
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, but okay, but it's

670
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and Moon or not, because I remember them looking very similar, but it does not. It does not look

671
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:39.860
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like at all. Yeah, I think this is I think this is meant to be a can. This is definitely a can

672
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But yeah, you know one thing

673
00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:46.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, it feels like that and I mean the whole like you said, there's the music the vast majority of the Pokemon are cantonian

674
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: tool for commands.

675
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Although fewer and fewer, we're getting a lot more non-canto pokemon, especially from this trailer.

676
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:56.599
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I mean tang growth, right what we didn't know one comment about professor tang growth

677
00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:57.940
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well... yeah... sure.

678
00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: This is the deepest cut. I don't know if this was intentional or not

679
00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:07.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But because he has one who is you know vines kind of sticking up like a hair or something

680
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:15.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And then a TM kind of stuck on it, right? There's the CD disc. I don't I feel like it's intentional because it's but it's so

681
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: - Uh-huh, yep.

682
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:21.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Specific and niche if you go back to actually I believe it's the fire at leaf green games

683
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.659
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And you use a TM on a Pokemon do you

684
00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:33.019
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: The there's an animation of the TM being slapped on their forehead to learn them move

685
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:39.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Do you think his tang growth trying to learn a move?

686
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's incredibly specific, but it's a whole

687
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:46.820
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: there's detail, maybe I don't know, but in their way, somebody, I, that's to it.

688
00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:49.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think the hair that goes up looks like a question mark, so I'm wondering if that's a clue or not.

689
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:47.820
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It does.

690
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.820
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah.

691
00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:56.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know, but, uh, or Kpop fan.

692
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I feel like a Taylor Swift fan right now.

693
00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:02.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All right, so, so digital as a trainer walks out of the cave and then finds Professor Tang growth.

694
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:09.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And the ruins of the Cinnabar Island still to be confirmed.

695
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:22.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then we get the weird narrator starts talking and telling us what's happening and interpolating their conversation.

696
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

697
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.059
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yup, even though there's subtitles, but okay. Yeah

698
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:30.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I want this narrator for the entire game.

699
00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:33.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I would like I'd just for the Professor Tangerith voice a lot. I'd be down for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god

700
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: the voices I love the idea of just

701
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.059
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: having having full voice acting that it's just one person putting on

702
00:45:36.059 --> 00:45:55.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: voices I love that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, so also Tang growth confirms that this

703
00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:44.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: What what if flex that would be especially with the the ZA no voice acting?

704
00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, good times

705
00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:52.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, so they agree to fix up the island because the professor

706
00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:01.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: was a place where humans lived. It was once a place home to many humans but

707
00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:09.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: so what happened here and why that's what I want to know. I hope we're going to

708
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: find out some or get some clues would be fun if we didn't get like the

709
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: full story, right? Because no one's around to tell us but I'd love if we found

710
00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like clues that would give us hints towards what it

711
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:25.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. So this is, this is when, I mean, this is a whole discussion, right, because it's

712
00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:31.219
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: being developed by Coatekmo, right? So who's, who's lee, you know, steering the ship? Is it,

713
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:37.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: is Pokemon holding a gun to their heads, or are they, you know, are they being able to sneak that

714
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:43.780
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: horrifying post, apocalyptic can't do a story in there? I don't know, could be either way. Yep.

715
00:46:42.000 --> 00:47:03.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Both could be the case. There have been horrifying things in Pokemon games before, right? Like Pokemon having a gun to their head, which I think we all know will be the case. It's Pokemon, they're control freaks. Hey, Game Freak, but I don't think that means that we won't get a really weird creepy story.

716
00:46:52.500 --> 00:47:05.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just think it to that is true. That is possible.

717
00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:12.019
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They are willing to, I mean, well, we'll get into it. But in this trip, we already see some other junk. But

718
00:47:12.019 --> 00:47:16.900
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: anyways, Pokemon, they start showing up because

719
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:23.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah. So this is interesting. So why are the Pokemon somewhere on this island and we're

720
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: just creating habitats that they move to or was it a desolate wasteland and in which case

721
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, I'm the reason we'll answer would be the former that we're just attracting them, but we did see

722
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Pokebo materialized from a beat game. So you never know

723
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:53.239
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I also have another question. You have both kinds of shellos here, uh-huh. So, at three minutes and 43 seconds,

724
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

725
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait, you do I didn't see that. Oh, yeah, they are

726
00:47:53.239 --> 00:48:00.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you see both shellos walking along a deer, a dog. Next to a fishing rod as well.

727
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.360
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that I love that so they're saying okay, they're showing off all these different ways

728

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That seems like a very mean way for a Pokemon to get another Pokemon to come help,

732
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:23.440
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's a fun way to continue like the, or you have to start in this small area, but as you progress,

746
00:49:42.639 --> 00:49:58.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yep, yep, yep, and then we hit the big one. The one I was not sure because the question was, okay, is it just gonna be you know this one little island

747
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you then get, you're able to expand out because you're getting these new abilities.

748
00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And how big is this area?

749
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, we reach a lap risk and sure enough you turn into your, by the way, something

750
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.119
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: is wrong with this ditto because it cannot transform correctly.

751
00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:13.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It turns into a lap risk with the ditto face, but it can do that.

752
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:19.440
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And then you can now sail off to other areas and they also show Dragonite.

753
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You can fly off to other areas.

754
00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:27.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So the question is to how big this is, I don't know, but more than just one island.

755
00:50:27.679 --> 00:50:29.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So there's that.

756
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That's exciting and it leaves room for, you know, maybe DLC in the future.

757
00:50:35.559 --> 00:50:40.659
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, we just discovered, I don't know, Z.A. Island over here, whatever, mega island.

759
00:50:47.719 --> 00:50:54.320
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, so that's good.

760
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, creepy.

761
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then, and then we've got crafting.

762
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:59.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, everyone's favorite, crafty.

763
00:50:57.139 --> 00:50:58.820

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I actually do like crafting. I think it's fun.

765
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.639

767
00:51:05.639 --> 00:51:06.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There's a lot of nuance to it.

768
00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You can get things wrong, but the general idea I do enjoy making things.

769
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So absolutely.

770
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:19.360
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: We get the straw bread, straw, it's not straw bread, straw bed, the staple from dragon quest

771
00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: builders that they can sleep on toy blocks.

772
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:31.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So Alkazam can play with them, that's cool.

773
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.599
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: This is now just the decorate your island, so build a whole bunch of stuff.

774
00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:40.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Very excited.

775
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.900
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Let's see what else.

776
00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:50.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, it's a lot of like Pokemon world overworld of the hallmarks, signs and lamp posts and

777
00:51:50.199 --> 00:51:53.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: vending machine, I guess, but I'm excited. Very, very excited.

778
00:51:54.500 --> 00:52:00.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I mean, is it too simplistic to say that it really does just feel like dragon quest builders with Pokemon?

779
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, and that's not a bad thing that I say that loving yeah, yes

780
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:06.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm not saying it is I'm definitely not saying it is it definitely not saying it's a bad thing

781
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:13.780
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It just like everything because they're like then they talk about the quests that they'll have for you to do like this is this is exactly

782
00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:10.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yes

783
00:52:14.159 --> 00:52:22.260
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Some of these textures look straight straight out of Dragon Quest builders. It's you know, it's absolutely Dragon Quest builders, but Pokemon

784
00:52:14.699 --> 00:52:16.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What dragon quest builders too had?

785
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah

786

787
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: mean if I told you a year ago there's gonna

788
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:29.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: be a Dragon Quest Builders 3 coming out, but it's gonna be Pokemon. You'd be like excellent.

789
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - I didn't say shut up, you liar.

790
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.260
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [laughs]

791
00:52:35.699 --> 00:52:40.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's like if you were to say how could you improve Dragon Quest Builders 2? I would say

792
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Popo, come on.

793
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: who Pokemon in it. I mean I wouldn't say that because I would never imagine they would,

794
00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:47.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be one of our stupid jokes,

795
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but that's exactly what I would want. Yes.

796
00:52:47.559 --> 00:52:48.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: but here we are.

797
00:52:48.539 --> 00:52:50.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [laughs]

798
00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: because this is not a drag on drag.

799
00:52:54.500 --> 00:53:14.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is not a drag on drag and quest, but I never really got through the story of drag and quest builders too because I didn't care because I'm not really a drag and quest guy.

800
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, here we go.

801
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's not a drag on Dragon Quest.

802
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There we go. We got there.

803
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That's a shame that that you know what that's fair. I was I wasn't

804
00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I got a light drink wasn't up, but I've never really played a game per se

805
00:53:20.519 --> 00:53:25.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But I I'm feeling it the world and the characters, but that's she and that story was good like genuinely

806
00:53:26.639 --> 00:53:31.559
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Non as a non like draw unquest player. It was a good story, but anyways

807
00:53:33.239 --> 00:53:35.239
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You'll get to experience it now

808
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You implying it's going to be the same story just with Bookman.

809
00:53:38.559 --> 00:53:42.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, maybe not the same one because literally the god

810
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: of destruction was in DQB2, but we'll get something deep and

811
00:53:47.039 --> 00:53:50.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: existentially horrifying, I'm sure.

812
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I mean, he velter could come in, he velter.

813
00:53:52.639 --> 00:53:59.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that's how I say it.

814
00:53:53.019 --> 00:53:55.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I've just realized I have no idea how to say that name.

815
00:53:55.880 --> 00:54:00.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Eveltal, Eveltal, I've never said that name out loud.

816
00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:08.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, let's see if we'll find that out. Let us hold that.

817
00:54:03.179 --> 00:54:07.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Eveltal, this is why they need voice acting

818
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: in Pokemon games.

819
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:12.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, and then they can change it later.

820
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.400
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And it gets all confused.

821
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: One thing that we, so then we've got, we've got a character customization.

822
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: One thing I would say, no bold option.

823
00:54:20.599 --> 00:54:21.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Boo.

824
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that they've shown

825
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Give me bold.

826
00:54:23.679 --> 00:54:25.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, maybe you unlock it

827
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What, what do you think this guy, do you think a fur-frew is going to come along and give us new hairstyles?

828
00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:34.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Ooh, that'd be good or DLC they could do that, but here's the thing about the balls specifically

829
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:38.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They're hiding that because you don't find that until you find blame hidden in the cave

830
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:43.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and then get to realize as the people can be bold.

831
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.760
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, there you go

832
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: What if ting growth splashes are blains? Oh

833
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.639
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I do I do think the customization looks pretty white like you see like quite

834
00:54:58.639 --> 00:55:04.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you see like six characters and they're all very differently dressed so that's

835
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, and a lot of Pokemon specific references you get you get to address you get red's jacket

836
00:55:11.659 --> 00:55:14.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There's a quasi-mysti. There's the black belt trainer class

837
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:23.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It looks like a pretty solid character customized thing. Stay with the horrifying ditto face, but yes

838
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then, and then we get what I wasn't, what we were discussing, whether they would

839
00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:34.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: have or not, which is, decorating in buildings.

840
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.400
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Mm-hmm. That was a big one. Oh, you know what we skipped back up

841
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And oh my word, that wallpaper is horrifying.

842
00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Back up a second you get to build structures with Pokemon

843
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.400
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, what did I miss?

844
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.400
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yes.

845
00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:44.940
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: How awesome is that like building houses the bigger projects?

846
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.400
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah.

847
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah.

848
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.400
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah.

849
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:50.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Pokemon will help you to some degree. I don't know what that if that's the animation or you know, it's like because

850
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I suspect.

851
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I suspect it's like you need a certain number of Pokémon to build a certain size of building or something like that.

852
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Probably yeah, maybe a certain kind

853
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's just a progression thing, right?

854
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, probably but it's fun to see like even just flavor

855
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:09.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: as you remember Dragon Quest Builders, the villagers would help you out here and there, which is a great thing.

856
00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:03.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah.

857
00:56:06.199 --> 00:56:08.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah.

858
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, going back, yes, you can decorate inside.

859
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.599
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So we have, we have couches.

860
00:56:14.599 --> 00:56:17.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We have wallpaper, flooring, beds.

861
00:56:17.699 --> 00:56:20.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We have like pokeball rugs, we have arcades.

862
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We have our gaming PC with a curved monitor.

863
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We have stereo TV of many fridge.

864
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:35.280
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, I'm huge. I am hugely anti-curve, man. I think I'm wondering I'm not a fan. Oh, wait. What?

865
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Tell me why.

866
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Have you, have you actually used one?

867
00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:42.239
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm not me personally, but I've seen them on

868
00:56:43.599 --> 00:56:48.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I've seen them in the office. I've seen other people use them. I'd rather have two or three monitors instead of one

869
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:55.579
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, see, I know I switched to a huge and ultra wide monitor years ago and it's been my favorite thing

870
00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.219
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: because you can still put multiple screens on it if you want

871
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know

872
00:57:00.619 --> 00:57:02.619
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I know

873
00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:07.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Sorry, multiple multiple windows on it, but you can also have and this is something you can't really do with multiple monitors

874
00:57:07.659 --> 00:57:09.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You can have just one window covering the whole thing

875
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

876
00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:15.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So like right now, I am looking at the video full screen on my

877
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What is it? 28 inch ultra wide monitor?

878
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:38.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You know, whereas like if I was having two smaller screens, then I would have the video much smaller and when I do my software development, I can have my IDE up full size and have like three different files side by side if I need in certain situations like it's just so much more flexible.

879
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:46.699
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, it is more flexible. I'll happily admit that or you're readily admit it, but I don't know. I don't I don't like new things

880
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:54.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That's fair. That's fair. I do think however it's something that you you have to like if you want to try it

881
00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.900
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, but that's it

882
00:57:54.099 --> 00:57:57.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You have to try it for like a week or two

883
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:13.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, you have to grow into it. Yeah, yeah, it's it's got to put like a lamp like a sort of

884
00:57:57.699 --> 00:58:05.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because otherwise you're just like oh, I hate it because it's different but after a while you start to to figure out whether you like it or not

885
00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:09.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Anyway curve monitor great

886
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:22.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Neon like tube lamp, but or the streamer lighting. That's what it looks like as giant pokeball. All this decor or at least the one

887
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah

888
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.320
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Many French

889
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.980
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: showing off your feels like, yeah.

890
00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:28.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, did you oh, I just I just noticed how little

891
00:58:29.119 --> 00:58:33.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Places things did you see that so right go to where it so go

892
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:40.280
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: wait let me back up i'm watching yeah oh my god did it just spit it out yeah it took water

893
00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:37.480
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's better. It is my

894
00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:51.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: going to the next level oh no that makes sense in the pokemon that can transform at the

895
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.440
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Horrifying

896
00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:58.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: molecular level what's inside that clearly it's a curby like infinite void so why not just keep

897
00:58:58.199 --> 00:58:59.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Keep all your storage inside you.

898
00:58:59.639 --> 00:59:00.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh no.

899
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:07.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Is the like the way the cheeks puff out as you're as you're about to place it and then it just like

900
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:02.440
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh.

901
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

902
00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:10.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, you're just walking around with your storage and your cheeks.

903
00:59:12.119 --> 00:59:13.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, my goodness.

904
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.360
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I love this game.

905
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That's horrifying

906
00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's awful.

907
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.280
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Great.

908
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So multiplayer, very cool up to four players.

909
00:59:23.199 --> 00:59:27.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: A tiny snip here, but it thrills me to bits,

910
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Bulbasaur jump rope. I hope we get a

911
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:58.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: number of little weird minigames like that. That would be really fun. But and you can play with your friends. Very, very cool. Taking photos with your friends actually looks kind of fun. I don't know, maybe just because how the ditto's hold the cameras or whatever. But we get game share. So you can play with only one copy of the game. You can share with your friends either on Switch 2 or Switch 1. How cool is that?

912
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yup, but wait

913
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That is very cool, completely unexpected.

914
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.280
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, as someone, I have this too, does that imply there will be a switch one version or are there?

915
01:00:10.079 --> 01:00:14.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, all right. I was just checking. Okay. That's what I thought but just checking

916
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But yeah

917
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And then we can get kind of the recap. Oh my gosh, is that a pomie?

918
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There's a pomie in the video and I think it's Partha at at around 905

919
01:00:27.639 --> 01:00:30.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You can see some of the pal day of poke

920
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:54.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: on the tree. I'm sure I'm kind of surprised with that one. I thought it'd be because like I said it's heavily leaning towards the gen one and the trailers but clearly not all. Nine oh five it's sitting on a bench. Wait what it's jiggly pop from above. What is.

921
01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't know, is that in a spot or is it an order for you?

922
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, no, wait, where are you looking?

923
01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:49.280
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, that's side up on its side.

924
01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:56.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's side up on its side. (laughs)

925
01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.860
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm so sorry to break this to you.

926
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:30.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh no no this is the best. Wow. Wow that actually jiggly pop from above. Oh there's a gopin on a bench. I like gopin. Oh good times. Yep. Yeah clearly like look at look at Gardevoir just chattening up with a little wicker when it's great.

927
01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's side up lying on his side on the bench.

928
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: [laughs]

929
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It just, it just, I mean, it does show you that like the Pokemon

930
01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:25.219
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: have personalities, right? That's cool.

931
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:57.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah because I mean even a giant quest builders too was good with that right all the villagers would run around do stuff eat and and you know have expressions they were they felt you know like they had life to them. And so you know add that to Pokemon because you know we're suckers and we like Pokemon and well that's a winning formula. Oh there's a cat turn just chilling on a coach very excited.

932
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Um, there are also some big Pokemon like Hexaurus charged earlier, they did a footage.

933
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: like a bunch of the big dragon looking Pokemon. Um, yeah, and so that's Pacopia. Um, and then we get the stinger, right?

934
01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:17.840
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Miracle is painting, which I'm kind of excited. I hope that's a thing in game like you do something with miracle.

935
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:24.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Um, that would be fitting for the gameplay, but then there's street lights things go out. It's getting spooky. What's going on?

936
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:31.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There is a ghost glowing ghostly looking Pikachu that's all gray, basically.

937
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Um, that's a dead Pikachu. That's what I'm saying. That's just the dead Pikachu.

938
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.780
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I mostly agree with you, but there was something that someone that I saw on one of their

939
01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:48.579
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: social medias that made me think it's like just, I don't know, an ice type Pikachu or something,

940
01:02:48.579 --> 01:02:55.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like the way they, yeah, something.

941
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's albino

942
01:02:51.719 --> 01:02:57.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Is it a is it a Pikachu that would forgot it was a ditto cuz it's kind of got that ditto purple going on

943
01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:03.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I saw someone suggest maybe it saw a mimic you evolution.

944
01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:09.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, it's mega minic you finally here. Um, but yeah, that'd go

945
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:16.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, I so okay, so one this game isn't connecting to Pokemon home, right?

946
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think we can safely say

947
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, yes, I will say, say...

948
01:03:22.139 --> 01:03:28.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Two that means that these are only these only for this game probably right

949
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Probably. Yes. It's spiky or peachy. Yes.

950
01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Except it's possible they come to Pokemon go

951
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.400
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Sure. Okay. Yeah. Pokemon goats, always the exception.

952
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And if we get party at warpool and Pokemon go, anything's possible in Pokemon go.

953
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:54.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I will say that most, most lacks seems like a weird, almost like an evolution.

954
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:55.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay. I mean, look, understandably, people see, that's about to say that's what it is about to say.

955
01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:58.400
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I mean, people popping off about the dead Pikachu.

956
01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:05.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: because the mask gun looks dead or whatever, but me that they keep going on and then we get

957
01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:09.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Moss Lacks of giant I say giants might not actually sign

958
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.019
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They called it Mosslax, right?

959
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.760
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They did

960
01:04:11.019 --> 01:04:13.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like they didn't say this was a Moss covered Snarlax.

961
01:04:13.519 --> 01:04:19.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They called in it. I didn't see that. Oh, oh, I didn't realize that. Well, I don't know

962
01:04:13.659 --> 01:04:15.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They called it Mosslax.

963
01:04:18.659 --> 01:04:19.780
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I can't remember where it was.

964
01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.900
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think it was on social media,

965
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but I definitely saw them call it Mosslax.

966
01:04:21.159 --> 01:04:26.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, I don't know what's going on, but it take feedies here, and it's a Snorlax

967
01:04:27.099 --> 01:04:27.940

968
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So the official Pokemon Facebook page,

969
01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: quietly introducing you to Mosslax.

970
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:41.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay. Um, yeah, I don't, this again looks incredible man. That's all I have to say.

971
01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:45.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: We've reached the end. Oh, there's your early buyer bonus.

972
01:04:45.739 --> 01:04:51.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Receive a ditto rug in your house until January 31st, 2027.

973
01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.179
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: As game freak does, it's nice ditto rug.

974
01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:05.820
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, I mean, fine. And you get nearly a year to redeem it. It's not really an early purchase

975
01:05:00.539 --> 01:05:01.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No.

976
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah.

977
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:11.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: bonus if you've got nearly a year. I'm not complaining. It's just very funny that it's so long.

978
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah.

979
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I'm on it either.

980
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It is.

981
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, man, there's a rookie to either.

982
01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But that also like the fact that they've got mystery gift in this game means that they probably

983
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:26.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: have plans for more things as well. Will they give us will it just be cosmetics or will they

984
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: also give us Pokemon in the game through mystery gift?

985
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.519
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I think that's very possible.

986
01:05:34.519 --> 01:05:39.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Like I don't imagine it's terribly hard to add a Pokemon in this game.

987
01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You know, you could just a cosmetic Pokemon that wander around your town.

988
01:05:44.159 --> 01:05:52.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They give you, they give you the, what's it called, the special patch of berry to have

989
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.719
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: petcher run or whatever show up, yada, yada, et cetera, et cetera.

990
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.940
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

991
01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:59.639
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You know, the thing that brings the Pokemon over.

992
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They're very excited.

993
01:06:02.199 --> 01:06:07.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So one thing interesting about the trailer, tang growth, you know, it's very like the front

994
01:06:07.679 --> 01:06:08.679
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: and center.

995
01:06:08.679 --> 01:06:10.480
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: He mentions how humans and Pokemon lived here.

996
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.360
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And he'd love for humans in Pokemon to both return.

997
01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.360
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: We didn't actually see a human in the whole trailer.

998
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We didn't, no, but just because time growth once, just because Professor time growth once

999
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Nope.

1000
01:06:21.199 --> 01:06:24.579
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: human to return doesn't mean you will in the game.

1001
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:30.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: that is true. You're fine. It could be the credit shot, the train, the dido's trainer returns.

1002
01:06:24.579 --> 01:06:32.679
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But I could see that as being like the end point, like, oh, exactly, exactly, exactly.

1003
01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:38.119
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I mean, yeah, that's probably the thing, right? Yeah. Well, that's why the ghost Pikachu's

1004
01:06:32.679 --> 01:06:35.280
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Although the digital trainer is dead.

1005
01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:45.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: year, it's the spirit of your deceased trainer. That is not a plot. That is not a crazy idea.

1006
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Alright

1007
01:06:45.739 --> 01:06:48.440
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They have done similar plots in other days.

1008
01:06:46.079 --> 01:06:49.780
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They have yeah, yeah, I I would not be

1009
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.039
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Completely surprised if it was something like that. Oh

1010
01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Haha, yours really funny see on the the Pokemon blog

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.559
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Links to the mine Nintendo store if you click on it

1012
01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:08.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It says you have a to leave a site operated by the Pokemon company international the Pokemon company international is not responsible for the content of any linked website

1013
01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:10.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But it's like I'm going

1014
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:22.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They don't understand how they make those games.

1015
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:24.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: to an intent all Kevin you buy in this game you

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Maybe, just maybe.

1017
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:37.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: buy no one release day borrow Calvin's one yeah just buy it and play on

1018
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Maybe, just maybe, presuming I have a switch to, but yes.

1019
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You know what?

1020
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You know what?

1021
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That may be irrelevant.

1022
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:37.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I may be buying it anyways.

1023
01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:42.099
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Calvin's it's not

1024
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, yeah, there you go.

1025
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:51.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That's true. That's true. That's true. Sorry, Calvin, on March. Actually, I say that November 20, if you lose your switch to.

1026
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:56.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: it's not like you don't live with someone who has a switch to come on

1027
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Less than a week left, sorry, Calvin.

1028
01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.980
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: that's a good point there's no way there's no way that you get to march not having

1029
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:12.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: bought a switch to to plea carburetor's right come on

1030
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:08.219
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I slash the link Calvin's whatever, but yes, Kirby or writers

1031
01:08:09.579 --> 01:08:13.059
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But yes, I mean, yes, of course. It's it's day what it day

1032
01:08:13.059 --> 01:08:16.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, it's day negative whatever today's whenever they announced it that was the day

1033
01:08:16.739 --> 01:08:22.939
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I purchased the game just you know, I didn't hand over the money yet, but I was locked in the day

1034
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:31.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I've already got my savings, Paul, and I've added, like, half the money.

1035
01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:25.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, it's it. I mean, what about you, Al?

1036
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.140
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, of course, right? Oh

1037
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There you go

1038
01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:38.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I want this game so bad. It's all I need

1039
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:43.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It will be interesting to see whether I do and like obviously I'm gonna buy it and I'm gonna play it the question is

1040
01:08:44.079 --> 01:08:47.399
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: One, I'm not gonna buy the back game key car or I'm gonna buy it digitally

1041
01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:51.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm gonna use this as the reason that I'm gonna go all digital with Pokemon games

1042
01:08:51.079 --> 01:08:57.399
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't know but to will I get really into this game or will I just be a

1043
01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Passing fad because I've never hugely got into

1044
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.180
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Many side games for a long time

1045
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:15.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The new pokemon snap I played for maybe a week and it was fine and I was done like I never really got into it

1046
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1047
01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1048
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:19.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like Pokemon existing in a game doesn't mean I'm going to play it and

1049
01:09:19.539 --> 01:09:21.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1050
01:09:19.699 --> 01:09:21.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Obsess over it, right?

1051
01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:27.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There's a reason that I like the main series of Pokemon games and it's not just because they're Pokemon

1052
01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:27.439
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No

1053
01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:30.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's because I really like how the games play right?

1054
01:09:27.739 --> 01:09:29.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1055
01:09:29.739 --> 01:09:32.859
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, it has the grind that that you like

1056
01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.520
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Exactly. The game gameplay is important to me and so the question is will I actually like

1057
01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.380
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1058
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.979
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: this or not? And I guess we'll find it.

1059
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, look

1060
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:53.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: even if you don't play the game that long, like I'm confident it's going to be a very quality game. Dragon Quest Builders, whether you're a fan of the Dragon Quest, I think people can recognize, is a very quality game.

1061
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Mm-hmm

1062
01:09:53.500 --> 01:10:03.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Right? So, you know, I have a lot of trust in this game being excellent, regardless if you're a fan of it or not, just sort of objectively, right?

1063
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:11.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: The question is it going to be very gentle in this game?

1064
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:17.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [Laughter]

1065
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:25.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That's, that's all. I'm excited.

1066
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, I don't know

1067
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is this is the problem with Pokemon. It's like are we good is is Jen kind of be

1068
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:33.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [Laughter]

1069
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.680
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Gen 10 gonna be one of the best games ever or is it gonna be one of the worst games ever and honestly, it's a coin toss, right?

1070
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: at this point, yep.

1071
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.180
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Yup.

1072
01:10:36.119 --> 01:10:43.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I just like I absolutely I don't understand how the same company that made Pokemon legends are here on ZA

1073
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:55.239
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And it's so baffling because a lot of them are very clear like this was a decision that

1074
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.520
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I also made

1075
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.560
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Pokemon Scarlet in violet. I just I just don't get it

1076
01:10:55.239 --> 01:10:56.239
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: was made.

1077
01:10:56.239 --> 01:11:00.520
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Like they said, they were going to do this thing or not do this thing.

1078
01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:07.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yes, yes, yeah, because I don't think because there's a whole load of discourse just now

1079
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:06.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And it's baffling why they would do that many times.

1080
01:11:06.079 --> 01:11:08.279
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah.

1081
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:10.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: on there. Oh, they don't put enough money into these games. And that's probably true,

1082
01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:09.279
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah.

1083
01:11:09.279 --> 01:11:10.279
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yes.

1084
01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:12.279
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yes.

1085
01:11:10.739 --> 01:11:14.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but most of the things that you don't like about the game, we didn't improve if they put more money

1086
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:11:14.899 --> 01:11:23.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: into it. Right? Like, I don't think that for, you know, I, I, all the reason things they don't

1088
01:11:23.699 --> 01:11:26.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: don't have in this game that they did have in Legends Arches are not there.

1089
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:51.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mummy money. Right. Yep. Sure. Yep. No. No amount of

1090
01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.819
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because they didn't want them to be there.

1091
01:11:28.819 --> 01:11:33.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They're not because they didn't have the money to implement the feature, right?

1092
01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:38.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like, obviously, there are so many other issues with Scarlet and Violet that where a whole other thing, right?

1093
01:11:38.739 --> 01:11:44.819
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like, the performance issues is something that they probably could have fixed with more time and more money.

1094
01:11:44.819 --> 01:11:46.180
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Fine, sure.

1095
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But like, the empty world wasn't something that they would have fixed for that.

1096
01:11:51.619 --> 01:11:56.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You know, it's like saying if Nintendo put more money into animal crossing that they would have had

1097
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: the villagers be more interesting. No, of course they wouldn't because they didn't seem to care about it for that game like

1098
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Now, yeah, I was not the decision.

1099
01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:09.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There's not how these things work and I just it's absolutely baffling to me that people are like they'll just need to put more money

1100
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:15.359
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And not they don't they don't like I mean would would they make a better game if they had more money

1101
01:12:15.359 --> 01:12:19.140
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Probably not good do they make a better game if they had more money? Yes

1102
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:26.979
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah. And.

1103
01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:23.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But those are not the same thing and you cannot assume someone who is making bad decisions

1104
01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:26.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: If you give them more money, they're just going to continue making bad decisions.

1105
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:33.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Which I'm not this, this is, and just to be a point, this is not an, and don't give homeless people money thing because that's what it sounded like.

1106
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:39.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's not like, but the point is, like you just, you can't just assume the more money is going to fix the problem.

1107
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:44.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, and then there's I mean there's the flip side too, right? Like they've made plenty of

1108
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:51.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Pokémon has made plenty of great games without needing more money or time or whatever, right?

1109
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:59.439
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Mhm. The reason, the reason we don't have balconies in Pokemon

1110
01:12:51.039 --> 01:12:56.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Because they were very good in their direction and decision making and made fun things.

1111
01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:04.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Legends ZA is because it would make the game run worse. It's not because

1112
01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:08.680
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: they don't have the money to make the models for it because there are balconies in some

1113
01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:15.039
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: areas that they wanted there to be balconies. Can you imagine? I like, and this is not

1114
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.939
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yep. Oh.

1115
01:13:15.039 --> 01:13:18.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: like a justifying the fact that the walls are flying.

1116
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:29.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I get why people are annoyed by that, but with the number of balconies they have on those walls, the game would run absolutely dreadfully if every single balcony was rendered.

1117
01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: hahahaha

1118
01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.319
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, no, then just need more money to fix that

1119
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: More money to make a bear console. They want to do that. It would run great on the PS5.

1120
01:13:34.819 --> 01:13:37.699
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, well, yeah, you go

1121
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I just like people love to have a quick fix for these things and it's not the case, right?

1122
01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:48.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah

1123
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:58.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: money does not equal better game. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Also, more money does not make better story. Just saying.

1124
01:13:49.779 --> 01:13:53.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, no, no, it's early not a poco, my certainly not with both

1125
01:13:53.500 --> 01:14:05.520
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't even need to know that I'll poquopia will absolutely have a better story

1126
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:13.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, yeah. Oh, but that's the thing. I'm not I'm not yet probably because Gen 10 is going to be another. Oh, look, there's a Pokemon destroying the world. Let's fix it

1127
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:22.680
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, yes.

1128
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:28.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like I don't particularly care, right? Like I've, I've said this before. I play the games because I enjoy the interactions with the Pokemon and the catching and the back. I enjoy that. I don't particularly expect there to be an amazing story.

1129
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that's correct.

1130
01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:35.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But would I enjoy it more if there was a better story yet probably like I enjoyed the small stories of Scarlet and Violet. They were fun.

1131
01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:39.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I love the weird side things that you get in Legends EA. They're fun. Do more to that.

1132
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.979
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, and you know what that that's interesting about Pokemon because they've always been good at that

1133
01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:50.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There's always weird little pockets or characters or side stories that are pretty good on entertaining

1134
01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah

1135
01:14:50.079 --> 01:14:54.699
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But the main their main thoughts just you know the most cookie cutter thing ever, but anyways

1136
01:14:55.979 --> 01:15:03.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Pakopia come in March 5 better than part gen 10 the answer is is it's not a hard no

1137
01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:01.340
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Apparently what a

1138
01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We'll see

1139
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Can't believe we're let we're probably

1140
01:15:09.579 --> 01:15:18.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: No, less than a year away from Gentan coming out because if it comes out on the same Friday in November as Scarlet and Violet did it will be out on Friday

1141
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:39.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, that's true. It will. It will. It will. It will. It will. It will. It will. It's always the second, third. Yeah, I guess. Well, it was a legend game you see. And what's next? We got other news.

1142
01:15:18.939 --> 01:15:23.479
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, you say that but it wasn't this year. It was October

1143
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.479
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And don't do it, goin'. No, no Kevin, stop.

1144
01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.180
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh.

1145
01:15:38.579 --> 01:15:43.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We have, yeah, goodness me, has this been the longest news section we've ever had.

1146
01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:48.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Next, we have some new games.

1147
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, it's Pacopia.

1148
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So the first new game is by the developer of Garden Galaxy,

1149
01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:54.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and this game is called Willy.

1150
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, uh, that's a name.

1151
01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:58.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Raise a flock of colorful sheep in this slow-paced idler.

1152
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.579
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Gathers their fleeces and complete your collection.

1153
01:16:02.579 --> 01:16:05.939
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's a monster creature collector, it's a creature collector, Gavin.

1154
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.439
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't I don't like how easily suckered. I'm in by this concept

1155
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: [laughter]

1156
01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Look, it costs five quid, right?

1157
01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Come on.

1158
01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Look at all those sheet patterns

1159
01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:23.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Oh, man, you need to collect.

1160
01:16:22.439 --> 01:16:28.560
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, what I'm not okay, but I can see the fingerprints of the Garden Galaxy devs all over

1161
01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's like you said, it's idle, right?

1162
01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:35.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You're generating the coins and buying stuff with the coins and doing stuff with the coins

1163
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Do you know the thing is though, I think actually my

1164
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: prefer this to get a garden galaxy because the problem

1165
01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.359
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: with garden galaxy is like I was decorating.

1166
01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:46.359
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What is this is your, your collecting animals and they're

1167
01:16:43.500 --> 01:17:11.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. I agree because with the decorating like it felt you were missing pieces. Is it where you know like when am I gonna get a thing, you know a water feature or lamp or whatever, but here it's like oh look on you sheep. I like this one. Yeah, it's cute. It's a fun little idea. Just a pet and full of all sorts of sheep with random patterns.

1168
01:16:46.359 --> 01:16:49.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: doing things like that is much more interesting to me.

1169
01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, um.

1170
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:18.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: And just feeding them and cleaning up their poop. Good times.

1171
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.720
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, I might get this to try.

1172
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I also might give it a try.

1173
01:17:24.319 --> 01:17:26.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All right, and the other game, the other new game we've had in

1174
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:44.319
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I didn't see this. I didn't think I had something more exciting than, or as equally exciting.

1175
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Kevin's about to crash because he's about to realize that this is not being announced for anywhere outside of Japan.

1176
01:17:44.319 --> 01:17:56.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No! Don't do that to me all. It has to.

1177
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All right, we should probably tell the listeners what we're talking about.

1178
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.680
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [mumbling]

1179
01:17:58.159 --> 01:18:01.520
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: There's only two or three things that I'd react like this. They can guess.

1180
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:12.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So it's a free-to-play Rice Cultivation and RPG game for RPG games.

1181
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And RPG, role-playing game for mobile and PC.

1182
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:28.840
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, wait, I there are many emotions. I'm feeling right now. What do you mean free to play? I don't know if I

1183
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.119
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't know what to tell you. Free to play means free to play, right?

1184
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Who are all these characters there's so what are these animals?

1185
01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:43.600
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The original, I think, uh, it's the original vice cast that we're seeing in this video.

1186
01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:49.840
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I think so they're at them in there. Yeah, because it's like this it's like an

1187
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.560
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: an hour, almost 90 minute like presentation and there's presumably the voice cast. Yeah, I think that

1188
01:18:53.500 --> 01:19:03.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah. Completely in Japanese. Yeah. Yeah.

1189
01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:05.279
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Sockin is a voice actor because they're dressed like they had the Sockin to look in a robe on. So I don't know

1190
01:19:05.279 --> 01:19:10.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: what's going on. It's all in Japanese. There's all these characters. There's new people, but there's Kolkua Dawa.

1191
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.520
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: You know what? You know what? It's more Sockin in my life. What is this game play? That dungeon crawl?

1192
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is a weird-looking game.

1193
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't know what this is.

1194
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.239
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It looks like menu the game.

1195
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They just brought out real life rice tools or harvesting tools on the street.

1196
01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:44.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know what it's not it's not I'm torn because

1197
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's definitely not like the first game.

1198
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Let's just put it out there.

1199
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's very different.

1200
01:19:45.119 --> 01:19:52.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Sakuna is a series that could die so easily so fragile so anything I see with the name on it

1201
01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:57.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: is oh thank god it lives but I mean first of all I don't know

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm gonna get this in English right

1203
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.520
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So yeah, we do not know anything about that yet. They've not given as any information outside of this

1204
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: stream

1205
01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And I mean, it's very possible that it's that it's not the steam page

1206
01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:20.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Currently is unavailable outside of Japan. So that's not a great a great thing to see

1207
01:20:21.039 --> 01:20:24.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But it's not unheard of for these things to sometimes

1208
01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: even though they're locked down then because what was the

1209
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:38.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: what was the name of the one that Micah was obsessed with, um, summer vacation.

1210
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I know what you're talking about, I don't remember the name, but yeah.

1211
01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:44.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Anyway, that one, the steam page was originally locked to Japan until the

1212
01:20:44.079 --> 01:20:48.680
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: announced that there was an English freshen coming as well. So

1213
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:55.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Ugh, I do you ever get a dub of the the enemy?

1214
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think so. Was that another version? Did we know?

1215
01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:01.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Because I watch I watch it subbed

1216
01:21:02.319 --> 01:21:05.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm pretty sure both were available.

1217
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:07.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait, did I just watch it subbed and not realize there's a dub? Oh, I think you're right

1218
01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, it's Laura. Oh my gosh, were they

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know, but you know, that's an enemy that happens. That's you know, you know, this tells me it's doesn't go by more copies of sock and I'm just telling them to get okay.

1221

1239
01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:04.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I will say that I don't I don't think I ever looked at fall guys and went what does this need being able to run really really fast

1240
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, it's also Sonic game. So you know that that sounds on par-

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:17.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, well exactly exactly who disappoints their fans more pokemon or sonic

1242
01:23:18.439 --> 01:23:20.439
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That's a good point. At least at least Sonic recognize that it's one point

1244
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All right, I don't know.

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Is there anything else to talk about this not going to game?

1247
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:38.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It might be a weird game. It might exist outside of Japan at some point.

1248
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Whatever. Kevin's just excited that something exists even if he's never going to be able to play it.

1249
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm just, I'm just, you know, reaching out and stroking and petting my screen, just looking

1250
01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.100

1252
01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So happy.

1253
01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Hey, we got more of those sock in an illustration.

1254
01:23:51.979 --> 01:23:52.979
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Maybe one day.

1255
01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:59.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: That's already good enough for me.

1256
01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:56.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That's fair.

1257
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: All right, well that's the news.

1258
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:08.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I guess.

1259
01:24:03.699 --> 01:24:05.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We're gonna talk about game,

1260
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:08.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: an Nintendo game key cards now.

1261
01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So just before we get into the discussion,

1262
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I just want to clarify,

1263
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: for people who aren't aware what these are,

1264
01:24:14.779 --> 01:24:19.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: game key cards are like a Nintendo Switch too.

1265
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:29.140
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There's a key that allows your Switch to play the game or to download the game and

1266
01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: play it.

1267
01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:35.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Now your initial thought when you hear that is, "Oh, why not just buy the game digitally

1268
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait wait

1269
01:24:35.539 --> 01:24:36.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: then?"

1270
01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:38.319
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait, yeah, my first thought is wait. What? I

1271
01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:41.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And the answer is because, was that not, "Well, you're not aware of that's how it works."

1272
01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.840
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Like I assumed I

1273
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.680
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: As soon be maybe I just had paid sense, but I thought it was

1274
01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:53.579
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I should put this like because they show the animation of

1275
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.939
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Taking out the game putting instantal and inserting into another one virtually or whatever, right?

1276
01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So like it's a

1277
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:10.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I just basically thought be okay, let me back up another step digital games currently on the switch, right?

1278
01:25:10.039 --> 01:25:12.520
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: If I have breath a while on my switch and

1279
01:25:13.319 --> 01:25:18.039
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I log into my account on Calvin's I can transfer that over

1280
01:25:18.039 --> 01:25:23.479
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But you know the few hoops I have to jump through I have to make Calvin's switch the my prime or like I have to make

1281
01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:26.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Is the primary console for my account and then I have to read download it there

1282
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:37.180
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Well, it's changed and it's different how it works now. Yeah. So so so so before the switch before the switch to the way that it worked was you could

1283
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Has it changed?

1284
01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait, it's shit

1285
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, I don't know anything just just tell me I'm gonna shut up now

1286
01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You could have primary switches and you can have secondary switches. You can only have one primary switch and you can have many secondary switches

1287
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.239
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Right. Yeah.

1288
01:25:44.119 --> 01:25:54.520
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: On your primary switch any user can play the games on that switch on the secondary switches only your account can play the games on those

1289
01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, right.

1290
01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The changed it when the switch just before the switch to came out. They changed it

1291
01:26:00.619 --> 01:26:01.939
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: so that

1292
01:26:01.939 --> 01:26:03.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you can have

1293
01:26:03.539 --> 01:26:05.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: two primary switches

1294
01:26:05.699 --> 01:26:09.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But you have to explicitly say which games are on which switch?

1295
01:26:10.579 --> 01:26:11.859
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Okay

1296
01:26:11.859 --> 01:26:16.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And so you you can say I want this one to have this game and I want this one to have this game

1297
01:26:16.619 --> 01:26:21.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then you can play those ones any user on those switches and offline you don't have to do the online check

1298
01:26:21.899 --> 01:26:25.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but you can only do it on that one unless you then say I want to switch.

1299
01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: back over to that switch and both switches have to be like online and

1300
01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:34.420
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: available and you do it. I think they have to be next to each other as well so

1301
01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you can say so I have two switches I've got this one this is gonna be the one

1302
01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [laughs]

1303
01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: that I'm playing Pokemon on this is gonna be the one I'm playing Mario Kart on and

1304
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: then I'm like oh actually I want the Mario Kart on this switch instead you turn

1305
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: them both on you put them next to each other and you switch the cartridge over to

1306
01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: cheese

1307
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:52.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: the other one but the other thing you can do now and this is actually why I

1308
01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:55.380
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think is a better as you can land games.

1309
01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:24.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You don't have to have your account logged into Calvin's Switch anymore, you can be part of the same Nintendo Switch family, and you can say I want to give this to Calvin, and then for four two weeks, I'll get to that in a minute, it is no longer on your Switch, it is no one his Switch instead of your Switch, and he can play it as if he has it, has bought it.

1310
01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:31.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: After the two weeks and then automatically comes back to your Switch, but you can then just click the button and lend it again.

1311
01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:36.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay. Yeah.

1312
01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:41.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's just like you have to click the button every two weeks, sort of thing, which is a little bit annoying, but whatever, at least there's no like time limit to like you have to wait again before you click the button again.

1313
01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm pretty sure you can just click it straight away.

1314
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:55.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So that's how they changed all that digital lending, and that's where we got like the virtual game cards, and it's all a bit weird, but I understand why they've done it, but it also gets a little bit confusing and like what is a virtual game card.

1315
01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:04.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's just saying which Switch you're allowed to play the digital game on without connecting to the internet.

1316
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay

1317
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So it's better in some ways, it's worse in other ways.

1318
01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:22.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And this is the thing is like I don't like all these restrictions, but this is one of the things that we like have to get in this weird annoying capitalist society that we have where they put limitations on what you can do with things.

1319
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't like it, but that's life and in terms of what exists.

1320
01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:29.939
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think the digital version of that is probably the best we're going to get.

1321
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:40.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: okay like okay this is a lot of info I'm trying to process here and so all right let's you

1322
01:28:35.939 --> 01:28:37.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yep, go for it.

1323
01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:46.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: let's look at a case all right let's just pickopia right so that there is digital

1324
01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:51.859
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: key uh was it cartridges or whatever these key cards or whatever right and then there's

1325
01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:58.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: just outright digital version of the game right these are distinct things right okay

1326
01:28:55.500 --> 01:29:02.939
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Kind of, but yes. So the, well, okay, let me, let me, let me, let

1327
01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:06.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: well I mean okay

1328
01:29:02.939 --> 01:29:05.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: me explain a little bit more with that. So then let's just talk about POCOPIA. So you,

1329
01:29:05.899 --> 01:29:10.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: there is no full physical version of the game, but essentially there is a physical version

1330
01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:17.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: of the game, right? And I'll get to that in a minute. Well, I mean, so, well, this is the thing.

1331
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: digital vertical.

1332
01:29:17.899 --> 01:29:24.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What is a physical version of a game in a world where you get day one patches? I don't think

1333
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:28.859
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, I know I know we're getting we're getting I know I know we're getting deep into the weeds

1334
01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.460
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: There is such a thing as a physical thing.

1335
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Anyways, I'm not sure if it's a physical game anymore. Anyways.

1336
01:29:28.859 --> 01:29:33.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, let look let's let's try to make this clear for me. What is the date?

1337
01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:40.479
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Let's just say pakopia had both options the digital key card and the full digital download. What is the difference?

1338
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:48.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Okay, so digital download you buy it digitally and you can then play it without like physically

1339
01:29:48.079 --> 01:29:52.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: switching something in or out of your switch, right? That's how digital games work. That's

1340
01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:57.119
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: the big advantage is you have all your games on your switch. You can just choose which one to play.

1341
01:29:58.479 --> 01:30:05.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The disadvantage of that is you can't sell it and it's harder to lend it, right? You can only

1342
01:30:05.199 --> 01:30:07.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: landed digitally to people in your Nintendo Switch family.

1343
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.560
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You can't sell it on, right? That's just that's just life.

1344
01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: That's how digital works.

1345
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: - Yeah, yes, okay, yes.

1346
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:20.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Full physical version, you just have the game, you plug it in,

1347
01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:26.600
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you then, if you plug it into a new Switch, you have to download updates and DLCs, etc., etc.,

1348
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.060
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, sure sure sure sure

1349
01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:30.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but technically you have the game on the cartridge.

1350
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I still don't get what the big deal about that is if you're going to have updates anyway,

1351
01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.560
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: but let's leave that aside.

1352
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:48.399
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The thing about the digital game keycard, sorry, not the game keycard, the thing about the game keycard is it's kind of half and half and it has

1353
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay

1354
01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:52.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: some of the disadvantages of both and some of the advantages of both. So

1355
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay

1356
01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:00.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I guess it doesn't actually have any of the advantages of digital games, but it does have some of the

1357
01:31:00.079 --> 01:31:05.439
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: advantages and disadvantages of physical games. Well, I don't think it is fully the worst,

1358
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the worst of both worlds.

1359
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, I'm kidding.

1360
01:31:05.439 --> 01:31:07.439
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is a thing, right?

1361
01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I know, I'm kidding.

1362
01:31:07.199 --> 01:31:07.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm kidding.

1363
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:15.560
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because I think it's an important point because I think that this is the thing I understand why people when you hit it think it is just the worst of both worlds

1364
01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:21.439
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But I don't think it is yes, you have to plug the cart into your switch to play it, right?

1365
01:31:21.439 --> 01:31:27.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So how this works is when you've got like a normal cart you plug it in the game is there you can click play straight away

1366
01:31:28.819 --> 01:31:33.760
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Ignoring day one updates and DLC's right if you have the game key cart

1367
01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:37.279
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: you plug it in and the game goes 'oh I need to download that game' so then you have the

1368
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:47.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: edge of digital and that you have multiple gigabytes downloaded on the internet. Fine!

1369
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, well, that's a thing right cuz okay. I get the key card like clearly when talking about the lending thing

1370
01:31:49.539 --> 01:31:53.119
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's clearly advantageous. I see it like it's the again

1371
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:51.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: - Yeah.

1372
01:31:53.119 --> 01:32:00.880
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's the clear visual of hey, I'm letting you my cartridge so you can play my game right that's very clear to me and because you have my cartridge

1373
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:02.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I can't play it on my game. I get that

1374
01:32:03.319 --> 01:32:06.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, well, I I guess I'm trying to figure it out right

1375
01:32:07.039 --> 01:32:10.439
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Let's let's take that out of the equation right just on my own switch

1376
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: What's the difference between?

1377
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: The key card versus the full digital version.

1378
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:25.819
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The only difference when if you buy a game key cart versus buying the digital version the only difference is the you

1379
01:32:26.279 --> 01:32:31.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And your day-to-day usage the only differences that you have to put the cart in the in the switch to play it

1380
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Obviously, then there is that that is a disadvantage right?

1381
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay.

1382
01:32:36.199 --> 01:32:42.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I totally get that but the advantage is then if you're ever going to sell it you can do that you cannot sell a

1383
01:32:43.399 --> 01:32:46.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: a digital version of a game. You can sell a game

1384
01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:56.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: right right yeah wait you can see how do you sell the key car like

1385
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:54.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: game which is why I find it a little bit weird that Nintendo has done this because they've just made it easier to sell digital games.

1386
01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:02.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You just, it's a physical card. You can only play the game if the cartridge is in your game in your console.

1387
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.140
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, wait, it's a physical car. I thought it was all digital. Oh my goodness

1388
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So if you sell, no, the game key card, the game key, that's the thing.

1389
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:16.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The game key card is a physical thing, but all it has on it, all it has on it is the right to play the game when it's plugged into the switch.

1390
01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: What all

1391
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, that's baffling, but okay.

1392
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So it is weird, right? And this is the thing.

1393
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: So the question then becomes why are, why do these exist?

1394
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1395
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And the reason these exist, why would you do this over putting the game on the cartridge is because it's cheaper?

1396
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:41.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's cheaper for publishers to do this. That's it. That's it. That's the reason, right?

1397
01:33:33.319 --> 01:33:38.220
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Sure, yeah, yeah, that's that's always boils down to that, right?

1398
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And you can get annoyed at that. And it's fine to get annoyed at that.

1399
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I don't think it changes anything practically, right?

1400
01:33:47.159 --> 01:33:51.800
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Like, this is what, so a couple of things.

1401
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:59.119
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: One, people are saying that Nintendo have broken a promise because they said they would never put Nintendo developed games on a game keycard.

1402
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is not Nintendo developed game. There you go, right? Like, they explicitly said Nintendo developed.

1403
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.460
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [laughs]

1404
01:34:06.199 --> 01:34:14.359
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: This is not Nintendo developed. This is Nintendo published, right? You can complain about it all you want, but saying it's a broken promise is stupid because they never promised that.

1405
01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Okay, but.

1406
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No.

1407
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:32.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think that in I understand why people are frustrated because it feels like over time over the last 20 years people have owned less owned and I'm being heavy air quotes there owned less and less they never owned any of it.

1408
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:45.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: They've owned less and less as you as become on it and it seems like publishers are making it more and more difficult to have and there's more DRMR did on a blah blah I get that I totally get that I really really really get that.

1409
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.079
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: However, I...

1410
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:54.960
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Don't think for 99% of people, I don't think this changes anything practically at all.

1411
01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:12.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: If you are buying physical games, the only reason, the only legitimate reason I can imagine for going I cannot have a game keycard compared to a physical card which is because you don't have the internet or you're not able to do big downloads on the internet.

1412
01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.000
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I get those 10 giga thing this game is, I get that, that's, that's, that's a fair.

1413
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.880
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And that is a totally fair complaint, and I totally understand that.

1414
01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:29.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Wait. Wait. Is that all like always thing if I want to put the key card into what I have to be connected to the internet to play it or to start the game?

1415
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Only to do the initial download

1416
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, so only only the first time. Okay.

1417
01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:34.300
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, you don't have to it

1418
01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:34.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay.

1419
01:35:34.699 --> 01:35:39.020
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's like playing a digital game that's on your primary switch that you've got the

1420
01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:41.199
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay. Okay. That's I just want to make sure.

1421
01:35:39.739 --> 01:35:43.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The digital car on you don't have to be connected to internet. That's the whole point

1422
01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:50.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Right is this is the cart is the proof that you all you own the game and you can use it own if you will

1423
01:35:44.199 --> 01:35:44.699
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay.

1424
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay.

1425
01:35:51.659 --> 01:35:56.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You never own any of these things. I hate the term but let's we're still gonna use that when I say own

1426
01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.859
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: What we mean is you own the right to play the game. That's always been the case with games don't pretend otherwise

1427
01:36:03.979 --> 01:36:06.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And I'm not saying it's okay. I'm just saying it is what it is

1428
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, yeah, and okay, I'm welcome.

1429
01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:12.779
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Capitalism and lawyers always go to do their thing and that is what they've always done

1430
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah.

1431
01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.060
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: so

1432
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:21.180
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The game car key cartridge is the proof that you are the right person to be playing this copy of the game

1433
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm getting sure.

1434
01:36:21.899 --> 01:36:26.220
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's got a car a key on the cartridge hence game key card

1435
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:32.699
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Is the so only the person with that physical cartridge plugged into the switch complete that game

1436
01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:41.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And so if you are someone who doesn't have internet or doesn't have good internet or doesn't have the ability to have big downloads on your internet

1437
01:36:41.979 --> 01:36:45.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I get that I get the complaint about that. I totally get that

1438
01:36:46.859 --> 01:36:48.859
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: For every other person

1439
01:36:48.859 --> 01:36:51.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I do not understand people's complaints about this

1440
01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:57.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Other than it's a principle thing right like or I don't like it out of principle

1441
01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:03.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And fine sure but like the biggest way to buy games just now is on steam

1442
01:37:04.619 --> 01:37:06.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: and that is

1443
01:37:06.619 --> 01:37:11.579
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: The same thing right like if you if you complain about digital games just in general

1444
01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:16.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I I feel like you're living in a weird past world where

1445
01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:23.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You wish that you could still physically own games and have them all here and be able to play them without the internet

1446
01:37:23.739 --> 01:37:26.899
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But that's not a world we live in full stop, right?

1447
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:41.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You, we live in a world now for better or for worse than I totally get the people would complain that it's for worse, but we live in a world now where you cannot play games without the internet realistically that you can.

1448
01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:50.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: We got that issue with, you know, the Xbox one where they were like, oh, you're going to have to be online to play anything and they rolled that back thankfully because that is a stupid decision.

1449
01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:57.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But you're not going to get good at game experiences if you never have the internet because because you're just you're not going to get game.

1450
01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well... (laughs)

1451
01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:26.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: game day one patches, which are and I totally get the complaint about that, right? Like so many games are released unfinished and then they they have the last few months after they're like, you know, doing things to add to the update and then you have to have the update because they because and here's the thing actually game key cards technically, we'd actually help not to have day one patches and to actually have the very first version of the game have the good version of the game.

1452
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1453
01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:56.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because they don't have to rush out a version of the game for the cartridges. That's why we have day one patches. It's because they want to get it on the cartridge, but they still want to finish more of the game and it takes months to develop to like actually get the game key, the game cartridges printed when it's game key cartridges. It doesn't matter because the game isn't on the cartridges. I'm saying a lot of things and I'm not really sure what my point is other than I think most I think most people are complaining about this.

1454
01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: [laughing]

1455
01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:27.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Despite the fact that it doesn't make any difference to their life at all, except you have to have more things. If you don't have a lot of storage and you have a lot of games and that's why you have cartridges because you don't want to have to store them on your switch. I will accept that that's a complaint, but if you're a bit, I mean, it's not just really cheap now. I mean, not on the not on the switch too as much because obviously the news, the new SD cards and that few

1456
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1457
01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.220
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1458
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1459
01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:57.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: was a little bit unnecessary, but most people's problem is not with these individual decisions is with capitalism, but they like to complain about the individual decisions rather than complaining about the system that emphasizes doing as little as possible for as much money as possible.

1460
01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:32.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, we have it. Still much better the Vida

1461
01:39:40.619 --> 01:39:42.619
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah

1462
01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:46.180
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, it's

1463
01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:54.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, as someone who is not like I prefer physical by and large be for many of the reasons you've listed like

1464
01:39:54.859 --> 01:40:03.340
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Not having the storage on the switch. I haven't gotten out and bought the terra white guesty car whatever, but anyways, there's reasons, but like

1465
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:11.300
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Like I'm not invested in this keycard debate. It doesn't all like as you've seen I didn't even understand it. I probably still don't fully understand it

1466
01:40:11.819 --> 01:40:13.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But I will say

1467
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.260
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, you would probably, you would probably buy one and go,

1468
01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.659
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: oh, I have to download a big, a big update, all right.

1469
01:40:17.659 --> 01:40:21.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I'm gonna, like that's, that's what it's gonna seem like.

1470
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.319
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, but like you yeah, yeah, but like you said like you said a lot of games do that now

1471
01:40:21.539 --> 01:40:24.039
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You plug in the cartridge and it has a big update.

1472
01:40:26.319 --> 01:40:29.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They had the day one patches, and you know, here's the secret what it

1473
01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:31.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, the PS5 and the Xbox require that

1474
01:40:30.159 --> 01:40:32.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, they're

1475
01:40:31.539 --> 01:40:33.619
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: with every single game for the record.

1476
01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.560
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, and they're horrendous with it

1477
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.699
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Um, and I like you but anyways, but it's not a crazy concept

1478
01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:46.119
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: It's just the only thing to me is that now we've got this weird third half version of the game

1479
01:40:46.119 --> 01:40:49.000
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I mean, you know, it's not physical digital or has the weird

1480
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:56.960
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: mix of the match. It's just another like in the realm of

1481
01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.760
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: this, I want to buy a game, pop the day and play it, you know,

1482
01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:04.159
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: having all these other steps and versions, it's adding, it's

1483
01:41:04.159 --> 01:41:08.600
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: it's noisy. That's what it is. And you know, that's, that's, I

1484
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.399
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, I agree, that's fair.

1485
01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.079
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: think that's a big issue or underlying issue for people on the

1486
01:41:13.119 --> 01:41:16.720
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: maybe aren't expressing you well. But clearly, of course, there are

1487
01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.979
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: stupid complaints like the people say our body is only

1488
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:28.800
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: but not the key cards that that's why but yeah but that that's pretty funny

1489
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:27.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah, I don't know whether that person was trolling or not, but that's that's so bizarre.

1490
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:36.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I understand the like, I want the world where I can just buy a game off the shelf and immediately plug it into my switch and immediately play it.

1491
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yes, yes

1492
01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:41.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But I don't, I just don't think that exists even without game key cards.

1493
01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:49.739
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, well, here's I mean you yeah, but but but what are the game sucks after the day?

1494
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:47.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Because because of the day one patches, right? Like that's still a thing that exists.

1495
01:41:51.500 --> 01:42:00.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You're, but the patch is still there, right? Like, you're still, you still have to download the update. And yeah, it's a smaller update than the full game.

1496
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I know. I know. I know yet. I'm kidding

1497
01:41:59.739 --> 01:42:04.140
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, but okay

1498
01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:11.899
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I'll say you won your argument. I'll I don't know what the argument is, but you want it. I'm not

1499
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: You're probably the wrong person to have this argument with me because you don't seem to have

1500
01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:21.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: a much of an opinion on it, right? I just like, I think I get the storage and the downloads

1501
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: No, I really okay

1502
01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.020
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yes, look

1503
01:42:21.159 --> 01:42:26.840
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: complete. I get that I totally get that. But other than that, I think that people are just

1504
01:42:24.859 --> 01:42:27.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I will I mean I will set like

1505
01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.439
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: they're complaining with no real reason.

1506
01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.140
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: my

1507
01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:32.140
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: my thoughts like I thought

1508
01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:35.100
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Overall, I thought it was a good thing because the way...

1509
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:54.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: So I think cards are good for that, but there's still the physical bit of it, and I didn't understand that, so I don't know...

1510
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:59.739
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, I think the I think I think the argument against that is like I don't think if game key cards didn't exist is

1511
01:43:00.279 --> 01:43:06.640
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Pokemon pokopia not going to have a physical edition. I doubt it. I think it would have a physical edition, right?

1512
01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:16.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think I I don't think many games if game key cards didn't existed. I don't think many games would go digital only

1513
01:43:16.539 --> 01:43:20.539
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I think the games have most of the games that have game key cards with

1514
01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:39.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: just released a physical version and they just have less profit and yeah that's I get that that sucks like that's that's we're not getting anything out of this we're not getting any cheaper games we're not getting any more out of this it's just that the companies are making more profit because they're choosing to use that thing.

1515
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:50.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But equally I just think it's a big storm in a tiny teacup.

1516
01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Sure sure probably

1517
01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:58.920
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Well, see I say that can't you check in on March 5th when I have to buy the key card for Procopia, and then I'll know what I'm talking about kind of maybe

1518
01:43:50.500 --> 01:44:06.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And it's not a difficult concept.

1519
01:44:00.279 --> 01:44:02.439
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Then welcome back to this argument

1520
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:14.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Just think of it as a if the physical version didn't actually end up having the game because the entire game is a day one path.

1521
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.640
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Okay, man, you know, I might fit so fall out 76

1522
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.699
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: I don't know if this is still the case by at least when it launched the physical version of fall out 76

1523
01:44:29.239 --> 01:44:35.840
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Was the like cardboard actually like it was just a cardboard disc with the game, you know like a download code on it

1524
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.920
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: Yeah, yeah. Well, that's, that's the other thing as well. Like that was a reasonably common thing in

1525
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.720
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: this which lifetime where you would have, you would buy a physical thing and it would say

1526
01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:51.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: this is just a key and you would open it up and it was just like a cord to download from the

1527
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.819
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Yeah, especially for some of the smaller games that yeah

1528
01:44:51.199 --> 01:44:59.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: eShop. Yeah, exactly. What does I think this is essentially replacing that? And I do, I do think

1529
01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:04.560
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: this is better than that, like a million times better than that. I get the complaint that like some

1530
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.720
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: using game keycards instead of using, putting the game on the cartridge. But I think a lot of it is

1531
01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:17.279
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: also people using game keycards instead of putting code in box and code in box is terrible.

1532
01:45:17.279 --> 01:45:23.199
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: It's dreadful. It shouldn't, it shouldn't exist. The only reason it exists is because then,

1533
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: nope

1534
01:45:19.939 --> 01:45:21.939
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: nope

<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: What? What bender would you be? Oh, okay. Okay, so all right, there's two things. One,

1580
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:43.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: I haven't actually looked at any of the cards. I probably should do that.

1581
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.500
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: But then the problem then is I want to buy them.

1582
01:48:49.699 --> 01:48:56.420
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: the set looks good overall. The mechanics, again, you guess what fantasy ish, adjacent series

1583
01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:58.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: with, you know, distinct tribes.

1584
01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:07.260
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: But they also did this thing, I forget the name of it, but there's the series of cards,

1585
01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:10.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: like the collector series or whatever.

1586
01:49:10.539 --> 01:49:13.979
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They're screenshots from the actual show.

1587
01:49:13.979 --> 01:49:23.539
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: They did one for every episode, but they're horrible resolution, horrible, it's incredible.

1588
01:49:23.539 --> 01:49:28.380
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: just a four-card screenshot from the anime, but it's bad.

1589
01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:40.500
<v 2C1FA953-C885-4795-A48B-91EAFF32B4FB>Kevin: Oh, okay. I'm excited for that greenhouse again with the list of it. That's patreon.com/thspod if I'm correct, and they go listen to that so you can listen to this.

1590
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:48.159
<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: correct. You've got longer to listen to wait than everyone else because it's nearly

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And my headphones just died as I said that line.

1604
01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:59.159

<v ABDBE248-4C82-447D-87E4-03DEEBA4DFFC>Al: And then I said, have a good harvest and it turned off.
