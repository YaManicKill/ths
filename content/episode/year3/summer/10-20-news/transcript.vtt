192

<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: But I just bought the magic of the gathering

193

195
00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:45.860
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I've never played magic. I learned how to play like 12 years ago, but I have retained none of that

196
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.679
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I'm probably gonna open it up right when we're done recording. It's there's no packs in it. It's just like eight many days

197
00:13:50.500 --> 00:14:00.340
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Oh, it's all they have one of those. Those are fun. It's like or generally they call it jumpstart packs

198
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.299
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I think this is what it is. I don't know if that's within this box, but if it's a beginner box

199
00:14:04.299 --> 00:14:09.200
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I think that's what it is like packs that you can kind of shuffle up and mix into different decks like mini decks

200
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:19.799
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Now let me slap you the link and then you can see what's in there.

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: The faint, tiniest toe dip in the magic, apparently, and then going back.

204
00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:27.059
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Do you play any other card games?

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.740
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I'm just trying to get the frame of reference here.

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:38.259
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's a good game.

211
00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:39.259
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's a pity.

212

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's, you know, it costs like literally arm and legs to play, but obviously you did the greenhouse

213
00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:50.179
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: that's out now already.

214
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:58.179
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I'd not listened yet, but so you're a big avatar, Fanny.

215
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.480
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah, yeah. It's one of my primary interests. I try to keep up with the novels, the graphic novels,

216
00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:01.820
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Okay.

219
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:39.600
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Okay, very okay. Okay. All right. I'm looking here. Um, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, sorry, I'm looking at the product description. Yeah. Yeah. Jumpstart packs. That's what it is. They're like, I had two half decks. They're like 40 instead of the 60 card. But anyways, you, you know, pick two, you shuffle them up and play. And it's fun. It's a little variety because you can make some match between the different packs. So that's very cool. I didn't know they did one for Avatar specifically.

220
00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:14.399
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: seeing everything, watching everything. I love it.

222
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:52.200
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Um, yeah. I think so. They did one for what's called foundations. I remember, um, but, yeah, that's cool. Um,

223

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: For the most part.

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Okay, so all right, okay. No, okay, so there are these packs called collector packs or collector boosters

249
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.140
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Those are they have they're just filled to the brim with rarities and yada yada

250
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.039
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That's where the really expensive stuff is pulled from these collector boxes, okay

251
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Ah, wonderful.

253
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:47.420
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: The MSRP for a pack of 12 is three, four hundred, it's stupid, it's stupid.

254
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.259
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's like 40 bucks for a pack MSRP.

255
00:17:50.259 --> 00:17:55.980
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Anyways, well, putting that aside, again, magic money problems are either, but so specifically

256
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.420
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: for this set, for the Avatar set, they released, I forget what it is, but they released

257
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:08.460
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: a set of full art cards of just, they're literally just screen captures from the show.

258
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:18.460
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: And they did one for every episode, yeah, which is kind of cool, but the only like asterisk,

259
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:23.660
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I think, they're kind of low resolution and don't look great, a lot of them look kind of blurry,

260
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:31.039
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: it's very weird, but you know, you can take a look for yourself, I have to look up what

261
00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:38.500
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: they're called, I forget, but yeah, it's a very interesting, yeah.

262
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.539
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Oh, okay. I'm looking at some of them now. Yeah, they are low-resolution.

263
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:47.019
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Okay, yeah, it's so, it's so baffling, like I could take a better resolution, I think, you know,

264
00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:48.019
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: my computer.

265
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I think it has something to do with the fact that these episodes just were never like

266
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: it HD to begin with.

267
00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:07.339
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: maybe. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, look over those collector cards. The big

268
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.359
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: They're on blue right now, but they were drawn for a square aspect ratio.

269
00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:13.680
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: money ones. So what is it? Okay. You know, the the intro everyone knows the intro, right

270
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.059
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: earth, water, fire, yada, yada. They basically did those for, you know, that very stylistic

271
00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:24.460
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: art, they did a version of that kind of, I'll try to.

272
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:30.859

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.119
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I'm measuring history by the post-Kirby Air Writers era

369
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.839
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: and we're here, this is it.

370
00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:16.079
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I have played the Kirby.

371
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:31.279
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I actually didn't play until yesterday, I'm trying to record him because I was just so busy.

372
00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:38.240
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Oh, I got, I think it was at least two, three hours and a little today and I'll probably

373
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.059
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Hopefully you fit like a six hour session and I would assume.

374
00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:38.099
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: That's good.

375
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:44.559
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: play right after, anyways, okay, so first off, I picked up the game because of course

376
00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:45.940
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: so they haven't had this with you yet.

377
00:24:46.200 --> 00:25:14.359
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I'm going to plan count on two gears, but which really funny is later, a couple of days later, just yesterday again actually, I went to Costco to pick up some stuff and Tom went with me and to start, I jokingly told him, okay, hey, we're going to stop by Walmart so I can pick up another copy of Kirby AirRiders because I just love the game that much, you know, just joking around, but then we got to Costco.

378
00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:45.500
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I saw the, sorry, I saw the game at a cheaper price, only five bucks, but I ended up with another copy of Kirby AirRiders anyways, yeah, so, yeah, that's, it was, oh yeah, I bought it, but I opened that one, but I mean, I Costco doing great things as always, anyways, okay, oh, okay, I'll tell you my first, the first reaction, let's go chronological.

379
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.500
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Let's go.

380
00:25:46.000 --> 00:26:15.660
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Before the game even came out, before the game even released in the States, I was already seeing the art or the, the air ride customization on the, on Twitter, do you know what I'm talking about? I've shared some, yeah, yeah, so for people who don't know, the air ride machines, the vehicles, you can customize them, but they'll, you know, colors and decals and accessories, yada, yada, yada, and it has essentially become a new art medium, because,

381
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: - Yeah, oh yeah, I was following as you were posting about it.

382
00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:45.660
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: before, day one, again, before it even hit the States, I saw somebody had already created a coyoga as an air ride machine, and you know, there's a lot of Pokemon, there's just all sorts of things, I just, whatever you can think of, somebody has probably made it. Lots of, uh, the animes and other characters and just pretty pieces of art, it's incredible, it is, it is quite seriously an art medium at this point, the creativity.

383
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:53.299
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: They work so fast, you know, like it you almost feel like they had like notes going in like I'm gonna be able to design my

384
00:26:46.000 --> 00:27:16.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: They do. Yeah, they were thinking. Yeah, yeah, um, and of course, with, as with equals speed, as with, as art goes, the degeneracy also broke out. Um, Kawasaki with the microkini is, is the number one popular air ride machine, like just period, Nintendo is already trying to crack down on it, but it's out there,

385
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.420
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Star here's what it's gonna look like

386
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.940
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I'm sure I'm sure.

387
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:46.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: shouldn't it still, it's hard to contain that. That's a, that's a heavy game of black and more. Yeah, it's the same thing at the stages, that's correct. Um, oh, yeah, but there's, I've, I've seen, I went through the, I spent like an hour just going through the different, uh, ones I could see and, and there, there's masterpieces out there. There's, um, Jerry from Tom and Jerry, I've seen,

388
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:25.700
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: They're like soccer. Why did you let them customize? Why happened with the stages

389
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.099
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: too and we couldn't do anything to stop it?

390
00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:16.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: um, lots of Simpsons, um, there's, uh, Brock from Pokemon. That was a good clever one. Um, the, there's a star club wagon starts very box shaped. So, uh, and it looks kind of like a Chinese delivery food sort of, but then, um, so that one gets a lot of play people turn it into an Amazon prime box into a game cube. Um, et cetera, et cetera. Anyways, yeah, yeah, masterful, masterful work out there. Um, I haven't made one of my

391
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Cool, love that.

392
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:46.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: things off, but I, I get a lot of fun just looking through it all. Um, okay. Now for the game. Now that I've actually played it. Okay. Oh, oh boy. Where do I begin? Uh, first one. Okay. It's fantastic. It's amazing. It's delivering everything I want. Let's say that there's no, I have no complaints. Um, the only thing that comes close to a complaint that is different. The speed of the game compared to the first one is at least doubled.

393
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Okay, so speed of the game is in like the speed of your movement or the speed of like load times and stuff.

394
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.759
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: the speed of the movement, the vehicles, right?

395
00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:58.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: 'Cause this is a racer, so when I'm talking about speed

396
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.019
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: and talking about the speed of your vehicles.

397
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.400
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, it is at least double.

398
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.839
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I would, it feels at least double from the original.

399
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Wow, we call that the F0G X effect.

400
00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:11.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, basically, right?

401
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.440
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's not, and here's the thing, Kirby outright,

402
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.880
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I get by comparison to other racers was a slower game.

403
00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.680
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: So it's not like it's absurdly fast,

404
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.680
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: like not unplayably fed.

405
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It does feel a lot more chaotic.

406
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: You also have six racers. The original only had four at a time.

407
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: So with all the enemies flying by the powers and the copy abilities, all that stuff.

408
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: The races feel a lot more frantic and chaotic.

409
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Especially in the city trial mode where you race around a city trying to collect power-ups for a game at the end.

410
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.759
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: uh... in the original game that was a very

411
00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:58.119
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: but like you could be very deliberate i'm gonna go over to this area to this

412
00:29:58.119 --> 00:30:02.359
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: part of the city to try to look for something to go here there I got you could

413
00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:04.359
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: think and plan what you're trying to do

414
00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:09.480
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: in this one oh my goodness it's just non-stop barrage of all there's stuff's

415
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.279
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: falling all over there's enemies everywhere

416
00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:14.839
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: uh... it's it's just pure chaos

417
00:30:14.839 --> 00:30:18.599
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: and again it's not bad it's still very quality i'm enjoying it but it is

418
00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:22.799
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: different. Um, yeah, um, so,

419
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.079
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: it's not, I don't think it's to an extreme degree, but I'm also biased, you know,

420
00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.440
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I was like, my fundamentals from the first game still are there. I, you know,

421
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.380
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: so, so I, uh, maybe that makes it easier to digest. I, I'd say that, you know,

422
00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:43.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: um, I'd probably need the opinions of maybe someone else who doesn't love the

423
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.599
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: game as much as I do. Um, yeah.

424
00:30:45.000 --> 00:31:15.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: So you know how you play you jump from like melee to brawl and that can it's essentially the same game, but it controls way different, and then you jump from brawl to smash for, and that's different, and then smash for to ultimate is similar, but still different, is is is is Kirby air writer to air writers similar jump or is it like a is it is a closer to what?

425
00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:56.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Mm-hmm.

426
00:30:56.599 --> 00:30:59.359
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

427
00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:03.200
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah. That's correct.

428
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:16.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Uh, it, I feel it's not that far of a jump, um,

429
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.400
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: because there's, in the, in the different smash games, it feels like there's a lot more knobs

430
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: in variables that turn right.

431
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:50.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I'm trying to think I feel like I'm Mario Kart comparison would be better.

432
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.900
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I'm trying to think it might be I actually think maybe

433
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.339
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: from eight to world, like yeah, right? Like it's

434
00:31:58.339 --> 00:32:01.900
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: it's different not inherently worse, but it's just you know,

435
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:10.519
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: you can feel that difference. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

436
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.039
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah, you notice a couple of things, but those fundamentals that you're describing are definitely

437
00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:16.400
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: that's that is yeah. So the game play itself is in my

438
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:22.900
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: opinion. It's fine. Yeah, it's and it's good. One that

439
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.380
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: interesting thing or okay, it's Masahiro Sakurai and it's got

440
00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.380
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Masahiro Sakurai's fingerprints all over. I say that, but

441
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.380
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: actually Kirby, the first Kirby air ride is really where a lot of

442
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.539
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: his things began. The checklist to unlock everything kind of

443
00:32:41.539 --> 00:32:46.779
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: the menu layouts, the design he goes for. When you win the race,

444
00:32:46.779 --> 00:32:50.240
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: that is just a smash victory screen. It has, you know, all the

445
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.960
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: contestants on the side and even has that kind of

446
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.700
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: of like shadowy color after effect. Yeah, it's it's it's a soccer I

447
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:03.319
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: game through and through, including unlocking everything. You start off with two

448
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: [laughing]

449
00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:09.759
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: or three machines and four characters and there's 20 characters total and

450
00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:14.519
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: probably roughly the same amount of vehicles. So I haven't even got to touch

451
00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:19.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: everything, all the new characters and whatnot. All the courses from the original

452
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: back in I'm on launch I don't lock those two at

453
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.279
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: et cetera et cetera yeah it's it's so much

454
00:33:28.279 --> 00:33:33.680
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: there's as soccer I does so much content and of course then there's all the

455
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.839
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: cosmetic nonsense because not only can you do all the aforementioned you know

456
00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:43.759
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: modifications to your vehicles you can also get hats for all the

457
00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:52.640
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: characters get get colors in different skits for your characters it's it's

458
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.579
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's a deep wall and I'm very very excited and happy to go through you know to dig through it and find all the gems I can

459
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:10.019
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: that's really cool. So what is the, like, I'm going to ask about the gameplay loop, but I'm also interested

460
00:34:10.019 --> 00:34:15.539
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: in, like, are you playing more, like, single player stuff, local multiplayer, online multiplayer,

461
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:44.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Okay, sure. So I haven't played online at all. I've played with my siblings. So it's been primarily local multiplayer. But I can, you know, compare, going back to the original, like the experience of playing single player versus multiplayer isn't that terribly different, I'll say.

462
00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:22.980
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: like, how is the online multiplayer? What can you speak to the, to the, to the playing experience?

463
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's, again, Mario.

464
00:34:46.000 --> 00:35:09.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I mean, you are competing, but it's moving so fast, like, you know, you can't focus in on someone or whatever.

465
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.739
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah, well, can I interrupt for a soon?

466
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:15.559
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Is it like a racer like you're making laps or you're I always thought that you were on these vehicles, but you were like fighting each other

467
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yes. Yes.

468
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: No. No. Okay. So there are three modes. The first is air ride mode, which is your standard racer doing laps around a course.

469
00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:20.639
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Okay

470
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: The standard is only two laps, and because of the speed these things, you're done in a race in under five minutes, probably.

471
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.840
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Okay.

472
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Actually, yeah, I'd say under three minutes on average, because they show you the time when you finish.

473
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:44.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: So you're doing laps around a course. So it, you know, your standard Mario Kart sort of experience just very fast.

474
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.960
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: The second mode is called top mode.

475
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It is still racer doing laps, but it is, as the implies, like a top-down view.

476
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: You see the entire course.

477
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: All the little racers are basically many racers on the course, and everyone's just racing off one screen.

478
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: The control scheme is a little different.

479
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:15.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Basically, if you tilt the control stick moves, you turn in the direction of your control stick.

480
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:16.340
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Mm-hmm.

481
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's a little hard to describe, but it's just left right, like, you're going up, down, left, right, and all directions, because you're doing this top-down view.

482
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:34.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Those are even, well, those courses are short, because you're, you know, you're fitting everything on one screen, but you're doing five to eight laps of each one.

483
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That one is probably the least popular or memorable mode, and it's still enjoyable.

484
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Well, just, I'm the other one, just, I just have sunk so much more time in historically when the first one.

485
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.900
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah, no, I follow that. I've heard of this one.

486
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

487
00:36:49.000 --> 00:37:03.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Oh, and one thing I should say for all the modes, one of the big differentiators, everything accelerates automatically.

488
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:14.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, so you are, it's a very simple game where everything accelerates, and you have a drift/boost, because it does both at the same time.

489
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.039
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah, I know that it's like one button.

490
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.860
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, yeah, that's the intent.

491
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, and it works great in my opinion.

492
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Anyways, going back to the third mode. It's called City Trial.

493
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: This, yeah.

494
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.400
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah, this one I know about. I've watched videos.

495
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Oh, there you go, right?

496
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: You're running around a city area, trying to collect buffs for a game at the end.

497
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Like a mini game type thing.

498
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: And it can be all sorts of things.

499
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Like I said, it's very, very chaotic with everything going on.

500
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: the like forget how many people it can be up to 20 that might be online only

501
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.159
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I don't know it's a ridiculous amount of racers and events going on and abilities

502
00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:56.079
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: insanely and insanely fun prob I don't know if it might be my favorite vote from the original

503
00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:04.559
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: but yeah it's enjoyable and yeah and those these three are your bread and butter you're just

504
00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:10.880
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: going through it trying to get all the check boxes on the grid to unlock everything and you know

505
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: cosmetics whatnot better times etc etc I haven't hit the online

506
00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:20.719
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: so you know all the modes so I can't speak to that experience yet but I mean gameplay

507
00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:29.760
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: as it's you know gonna be the same thing so oh yeah yeah

508
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:32.619
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Well, my last question is, you said it's six people, six players, is that all on the couch?

509
00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:37.260
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Like, can you give people six controllers and they can do this? Or is it just up to four?

510
00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:42.159
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: oh that's uh I'm guessing it's up to four because when you go to the character select screen

511
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.980
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Okay. Gotcha.

512
00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:45.900
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: you see four slots, or you know the player 1, 2, 3, 4.

513
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:57.239
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: spots. Yeah, I don't think locally you can go more than four, but yeah, but yeah, that's

514
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.460
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Yeah. Okay. I was just curious.

515
00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:02.039
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: that's Kirby Airlines. I love it to death. It's lived up. I'm so happy it exists.

516
00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:05.880
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: And oh, you know what? There's a single player. There's a campaign. I haven't even

535
00:40:52.039 --> 00:40:58.039
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: same way that it's like, "Oh, you're on an island, make it into the environment that you're

536
00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:04.280
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: familiar with with villagers and shops and all that." This is like, "Okay, you're in the West,

537
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.840
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: make it into an environment that...

564
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.019

566
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:19.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: structure on a car and I wonder if it's gonna like impact your driving and whatnot I'm

567
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.940
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: just looking forward to it looks very very entertaining again that that

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:27.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Kirby Air Writer-esque like what nonsense are people gonna come up with I'm very

569
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.500
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: interested.

570
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.780
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I wonder if there's gonna be like a switch to upgrade

571
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.420
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: or if it's just like, well, it's on switch one,

572
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.619
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: air go, it is on.

573
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.800
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That's an interesting question. Have we really seen that from a third-party developer yet like switch to exclusive for you?

574
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: How Silk Song has a Switch 2 upgrade?

575
00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.840
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Oh, it does. What's the upgrade?

576
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I'd just like better, like runs better.

577
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I don't think it has any extra content or anything like that.

578
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:58.039
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Well sure I mean, but I think all games do that by default, right? If they are on switch

579
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: Well, here's the thing is if you're running, let's say Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Switch 2,

580
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: it will load faster, but it will not necessarily look better.

581
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Hmm, okay.

582
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:20.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: It's a more efficient machine, so it's going to play the games more efficiently,

583
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:31.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: but that's not to say that it has been enhanced or optimized or meticulously crafted to work the best it can on Switch 2.

584
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:41.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: The Silk Song Switch 2 Edition has 120 FPS, it has, I think it can go up to 4K.

585
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:53.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: It is a dedicated Switch 2 edition, so not necessarily something that outbound is interested in.

586
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: I just wonder if there will be one or not.

587
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.159
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I see anything specific about that. So who knows

588
00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:05.920
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: question marks for now. Um, but, but I mean, it's caught it. You know, as so many

589
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.719
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: college core games aim or, or are requested to come to switch because, you know, that's

590
00:45:11.719 --> 00:45:21.500
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: the demographics line up there. Um, so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think they already had PlayStation

592
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.860
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: next box version is cooking so I guess that means it's coming to

593
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.760
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: everything which is cool. Speaking of things that are coming to

594
00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.380
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: switch and well I guess it was already on there but it's coming again this time in

595
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:44.840
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: the real world, Moonstone Island, a well-known game that I enjoyed question mark. Monster

596
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:55.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: collector farming island hopping game where yeah coming to switch physically we are getting

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: looking at it. Oh it's a physical edition. It is one of those limited run-type games

598
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:08.280
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: or its limited stock. It's at super rare games which again a lot of cottagecore games also

599
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:17.639
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: tend to gravitate to. Yeah that's cool if you want it for your shelf or whatever. You know

600
00:46:17.639 --> 00:46:21.719
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: one thing I will say it's always interesting to see what is the box are going to look

601
00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:24.880
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: quite great because we have images of the

602
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I mean, it's a game I played to completion, which is something

605
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: and they've done lots of DLC. I still have a couple of

606
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: hiccups, but it's, you know, I will recommend it. I'll see that.

607
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yeah, it's Moonstone Island.

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I was thinking about it, but I feel like...

611
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:02.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I still don't understand, I mean, I have to say it, but yeah.

612
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:03.500
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: The game key cards is what they're called.

617
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Oh, wait, hold the phones.

<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: They're not going to make a lot of them, so they have to charge for the difference.

624
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: You got a root.

627
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Well, I got that much.

865
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.960

866
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.960
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: We're getting the cow plush

867
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:34.800
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: First of all, what do you mean? We haven't had it before. You can't buy one right now. What is that? That's wild

868
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Second of all, it's through makeshift.

869
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:51.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That's a limited time run, generally speaking, launches November 28th right after Thanksgiving or whatever I guess.

870
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's a fantastic plush because that's the best cow ever made or designed.

871
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: But I just wish it wasn't makeshift because this should just be always available.

872
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: This feels like a huge wasted potential to just not be selling it forever from whatever story of seasons.

873
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That is a sizable franchise.

874
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.940
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: - Yeah, it's not small.

875
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: They could probably scrape up the money to just make a proper release of a plush you can buy on a website.

876
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That isn't limited time.

877
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Okay, that's mind-boggling, but it's coming.

878
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:40.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Well, by the time it's actually I think the day of, when the day is the day of, no, it's like two days after.

879
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: This releases, yeah, the tuning in.

880
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Anyways, it's coming.

881
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: It's a good plush, I'll say that again, but I'm just mind-boggled.

882
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: That one, it's not already available in two that's through makeshift, but there you go.

883
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I still might get one.

884
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I just love that cow, it's so much.

885
01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.019
<v DE0993AD-B832-42C1-B917-FEB15B813CC5>Nama: It's a real good design.

886
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: Yep.

887
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000

<v F8035699-2ACF-4458-9B8B-47DD8FA29245>Kevin: I don't know who this is, but it's a ping, it's not a ping, it's a bird with an orange beak.

892
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
