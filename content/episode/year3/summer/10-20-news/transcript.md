(1m)

> Look at that, it's a little treat for the audiences.

(1m 1s) **Nama:**

> It's a bit of a surprise. I didn't think they would ask me back

(1m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Well, now it keeps having me on, so, you know, the bars, the bar is lower than the floor.

(1m 11s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I'm just one wrong above you

(1m 18s) **Kevin:**

> But yeah, hello listeners. Hello, everyone. No, no, no big topic, I didn't have time to think what we

(1m 27s)

> God is where we're just going to news it up.

(1m 30s)

> Um, just just chatting. Um, all right, but before that, we're getting into all the wonderful news.

## What Have We Been Up To

(1m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Uh, Naomi, what's what's going on? Tell me about things.

(1m 42s) **Nama:**

> Well, did you ever watch Peanut Butter Gamer, the YouTuber, from Like?

(1m 47s) **Kevin:**

> I do love PPG, is this old? I find it very amusing. Yes, I'm fond of PPG.

(1m 53s) **Nama:**

> - Yeah, he stuck around for a good while.

(1m 57s) **Kevin:**

> Has he stopped? Okay. Okay. Okay.

(1m 58s) **Nama:**

> Back, no, he's still going, yeah.

(2m 2s)

> When Skyward Sword was coming out,

(2m 5s)

> he declared November to be Zelda Month

(2m 8s)

> and he uploaded four videos, four Zelda videos,

(2m 11s)

> and then he kept that going for a little while.

(2m 13s)

> He stopped eventually, but still,

(2m 17s)

> you'll see like little peaks above the ground

(2m 23s)

> and oh, it's Zelda Month, I'm gonna play a Zelda game

(2m 25s)

> and I'm playing a Zelda game.

(2m 28s)

> I'm playing two, last time I came on,

(2m 30s)

> I talked about, because of wisdom a little bit

(2m 33s)

> and I rolled credits on that game.

(2m 35s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, I still need to play that, but yeah.

(2m 37s) **Nama:**

> And since then, I have gone back to the Nintendo Switch

(2m 41s)

> 2 edition of Breath of the Wild.

(2m 43s)

> I started a master mode play-through

(2m 46s)

> back when the Switch 2 launched in June

(2m 49s)

> and I'm picking up the where I left off

(2m 53s)

> and I'm hopefully going to finish that up

(2m 56s)

> before the end of the month.

(2m 58s)

> Time's running out, I got like a week left.

(3m) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Well. Oh, yeah, I guess it is. Well, that's gonna be hard. We got turkey day. So

(3m 5s)

> but good luck to you, but

(3m 7s)

> Okay, how is well you're playing on switch to my presume?

(3m 11s) **Nama:**

> Yes.

(3m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Did you get the upgrade pack or or is it just the drawn enhancements?

(3m 17s) **Nama:**

> Now the upgrade pack is free for NSO subscribers.

(3m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Oh

(3m 20s)

> Okay, okay. That's nice. That's good

(3m 23s)

> All right. How how is it? How is the house note taking and all that? All right, I can't remember what it is

(3m 30s) **Nama:**

> Sure. Yeah, they're okay. So first of all, the visual enhancements. Wow. I don't notice it as much

(3m 30s) **Kevin:**

> Taking in that. I don't know. Right.

(3m 38s) **Nama:**

> right now. But when I first turned it on back in June, like playing the OG game to playing

(3m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

(3m 44s) **Nama:**

> this game, whether you're a doctor handheld, it's like put it on glasses for the first time. It's

(3m 49s)

> like, whoa, like, I just, I can't imagine going back to what it used to be, even though I can't

(3m 56s)

> remember it and that's not to say that it looked bad before.

(3m 57s) **Kevin:**

> hmm yeah oh that sounds nice

(4m) **Nama:**

> But it's really, really poppin'. It controls real fluid, you know, it's a joy to play.

(4m 8s)

> But I have come to really enjoy the app that they put out.

(4m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm. No, okay. I mean, yeah, I guess this is a good one for that because you can have so many loose threads going or, or, you know, things you're thinking about. You want to jot them down. That makes sense.

(4m 25s) **Nama:**

> So, in the Nintendo Switch Online app, I guess it's called Nintendo Switch app now, there

(4m 34s)

> is a little page for Zelda Notes and it works for both Breath of the Wild and Tuesday

(4m 40s)

> the Kingdom Switch 2 editions and it knows when you're playing, you have to be online

(4m 47s)

> to use it and it checks your Nintendo Switch profile and it's like, "Oh, you're connected,

(4m 53s)

> know you're playing.

(4m 55s)

> And you can do a few things with the app, there is

(5m)

> Item storage, which is pretty neat.

(5m 3s) **Kevin:**

> On the app, what what what does that mean?

(5m 4s) **Nama:**

> Yes, so I can go into my key items

(5m 8s)

> and I can select upload or deposit is what they say.

(5m 13s)

> And you can go to your weapons or your bows,

(5m 16s)

> your shields, some of your ingredients,

(5m 18s)

> and you can select up to 10 items a day

(5m 21s)

> to deposit into your app.

(5m 23s)

> And, uh...

(5m 26s)

> You can then withdraw items from your app as well.

(5m 30s)

> So all of my good stuff, or all of my not so good stuff, I put into the app.

(5m 37s)

> And then whenever I'm like really empty or running low, I don't feel like I have to hoard too many things.

(5m 45s)

> Because I can hoard them on the mobile app.

(5m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Encom. Right. That's, that's interesting. I guess there's two things. One, it bottles my mind

(5m 47s) **Nama:**

> And it's pretty nice.

(5m 55s) **Kevin:**

> an Nintendo game having this level of capabilities with another, you know, another device over

(6m 1s)

> an online functionality. Um, so we got that. But second, like, I'm just thinking, because this is

(6m 9s)

> right. I mean, going back to the, I guess 10 year old debate at this point of, I know, item

(6m 16s)

> weapon durability, right? Like that's, that's like on the one hand, it's nice to have stored

(6m 21s)

> on the other hand, the games also design for you just keep just going through your stuff. But I

(6m 26s)

> guess just having a, yeah, literally stuff in your back pocket, basically. Um, and I guess that's

(6m 32s)

> nice. You can, you can store your really nice weapons there for that boss fight, I guess. I don't know.

(6m 39s) **Nama:**

> There's a few little things.

(6m 39s) **Kevin:**

> But that's cool.

(6m 40s) **Nama:**

> Oh, yeah, there's a few little things in the app.

(6m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(6m 42s) **Nama:**

> Like there's a daily bonus where you can just spin a dial

(6m 47s)

> and it get a view like, "Oh, a speed boost for 24 hours,"

(6m 50s)

> not for a full 24 hours,

(6m 51s)

> but you'll get a 10 minute speed boost

(6m 54s)

> and that's your bonus for the day,

(6m 56s)

> or you'll get a defense boost

(6m 57s)

> and that's your bonus for the day.

(7m 1s)

> There, it tracks all your play data.

(7m 3s)

> So there's achievements in the app.

(7m 7s)

> stuff like, how many.

(7m 9s)

> weapons you've collected or how many he knocks as you've defeated.

(7m 13s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh, that's dangerous.

(7m 15s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, and you can make them bronze silver gold and platinum, right?

(7m 20s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, there's your reason to get it, I guess.

(7m 20s) **Nama:**

> So like this, if you're, if you're a chaser for that stuff, it's all in there.

(7m 30s)

> It shows you all of the hours that you've put in across all your save files, that's not related

(7m 39s)

> but you can have a second save file on the switch to edition.

(7m 43s)

> There's global play data, so you can compare your stats with other people's stats.

(7m 51s)

> Then the two big things, I mentioned one of them first.

(7m 55s)

> There's a navigation app where you, it's basically the IGN map of but official.

(7m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that. Yeah

(8m 5s) **Nama:**

> It shows you all the shrines that you haven't found.

(8m 7s)

> them. Cora.

(8m 9s)

> You can see the box that you haven't found and you can toggle these to turn off and on. Yes, you can have this map leads you to all 900 corks. All the side quests, all the memories. Yeah, and it has like it's so helpful enough. It has Google maps on it like you you can select one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well.

(8m 12s) **Kevin:**

> Wait, even Quarox, whoa!

(8m 20s)

> Wow, wow, wow, that's like the cheat code mode.

(8m 28s)

> That's crazy.

(8m 29s)

> OK, wow.

(8m 36s)

> The topography?

(8m 38s)

> Oh, my goodness.

(8m 39s) **Nama:**

> Not not quite the topography. It will show where you are on the map and where the thing you're looking for is. But if you activate voice guidance, they'll be like Siri or something that that will say make a like go north, go northwest. You need to descend. You need to double check your direction and it eventually guides you there. And oh, there's the corak.

(8m 44s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(8m 50s)

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, remember that.

(9m 6s)

> Yeah, okay.

(9m 9s) **Nama:**

> The first thing in this is kind of the beefy thing. It's the voice memories.

(9m 13s)

> Prince is Zelda has a bunch of audio lines recorded. There are a hundred and there's a hundred and twenty five little voice memories. And all it is is flavor text and it is really, really, really nice. You'll come to like an abandoned village that you really wouldn't pay much attention to in like the base game.

(9m 37s)

> But then your voice may

(9m 39s)

> will pop and Zelda will start talking about what it used to be. And yeah, it's really nice. Yes,

(9m 43s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, that's so cool. Audio tour.

(9m 47s) **Nama:**

> it's an audio tour of the whole map. There's there's multiples points in the towns. That's like

(9m 49s) **Kevin:**

> That's crazy cool.

(9m 55s) **Nama:**

> where most of them are deposited. But like I said, there's a bunch of ruins that it will cover

(10m 2s)

> some shrine locations that she talks about. Some like highly in rights of passage.

(10m 9s)

> Like, oh, this is where people would jump off a cliff. It's it's really nice. And the

(10m 12s) **Kevin:**

[laughs]

(10m 17s) **Nama:**

> tears of the kingdom one has even more of that because it's not just Zelda, but it's also Rauru.

(10m 22s)

> And I think Minaru. Yeah, I don't know the third one. But yeah, I'm looking forward to

(10m 25s) **Kevin:**

> What that's so cool

(10m 31s) **Nama:**

> getting into tears of the kingdom for those. So the app has really, really like breathed

(10m 39s)

> some new life into the game. And my my closing remark on it is that it's kind of a we use

(10m 46s)

> situation where I've got a second screen.

(10m 51s) **Kevin:**

> That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.

(10m 57s) **Nama:**

> So you're coming at me at the tail end of my journey.

(11m)

> I've got about 20 voice memories to find.

(11m 2s)

> About 15 of them are all inside of Hyrule Castle.

(11m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Okay. Yeah.

(11m 7s) **Nama:**

> I just need to do basically a boss rush.

(11m 10s)

> I've been saving all the temples,

(11m 11s)

> all of the divine beasts for last.

(11m 15s)

> So I'm gonna do like one a day

(11m 17s)

> and then close up the game.

(11m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Wow, that's how that's so fast me and so

(11m 24s)

> Just think about the voice log thing is that I you're right that that sounds very cool to me

(11m 28s)

> Like I know her

(11m 31s)

> Our Patricia Somerset. That's the Zelda's actor name

(11m 36s)

> Like I know her performance has been divisive because the accent I guess or whatever

(11m 42s)

> But I've learned to grow fond of it

(11m 45s)

> I've grown attached to it and anyway

(11m 48s)

> I think part of it is Patricia Summers said she's quite a charming person and really funny, especially about Zelda stuff online. So that's so cool. Just

(11m 59s)

> Hours of more Patricia Summers ain't kind of that's great. I love that. Cool. Cool. That's so cool. That is that sounds way more rude. Yeah. That sounds way more robust than I expected.

(12m 4s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I agree with everything you said.

(12m 11s)

> Yeah, it really has extended the game.

(12m 14s)

> Like I didn't know how much would be there for me,

(12m 16s)

> but like even if I queued up my old save file

(12m 18s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(12m 21s) **Nama:**

> and ran around, it would have been nice.

(12m 23s)

> And you can do one of two things, right?

(12m 26s)

> You can turn on the Google map

(12m 28s)

> and just have it lead you to every single voice point.

(12m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.

(12m 32s) **Nama:**

> or you can open just the voice memories.

(12m 34s)

> And then it will ping the same way that your shrine thing will ping, so if you're walking about, it'll say, "Hey, there's a voice memory nearby, you want to find it yourself?"

(12m 44s)

> And so it will give you that option of whether you want to have it be shown to you or if you want to find it.

(12m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, that's right. I think the play oh, I'm thinking should I restart or should I just

(12m 59s)

> Just play the just go find the corox and fill on all the voice logs there that the map on

(13m 1s) **Nama:**

[laughs]

(13m 4s)

> Yeah, that's the thing is if you have your old say file,

(13m 8s)

> you can like, well, it's time to 100% this,

(13m 10s)

> it's time to finish it up.

(13m 11s) **Kevin:**

> And if you did the DLC you get the bike so you can you know go that way

(13m 15s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, right.

(13m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, all right cool very very cool

(13m 19s)

> Wow, that is really the fresh new breath breathing life

(13m 24s)

> very well, very cool. Alright, what else, what is with us going on?

(13m 28s) **Nama:**

> Well, the only other thing I'll share is it's kind of a tease

(13m 31s)

> But I just bought the magic of the gathering

(13m 35s)

> Avatar the last airbender beginner box. I have never

(13m 39s) **Kevin:**

> Okay

(13m 40s) **Nama:**

> I've never played magic. I learned how to play like 12 years ago, but I have retained none of that

(13m 46s)

> I'm probably gonna open it up right when we're done recording. It's there's no packs in it. It's just like eight many days

(13m 50s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, it's all they have one of those. Those are fun. It's like or generally they call it jumpstart packs

(14m)

> I think this is what it is. I don't know if that's within this box, but if it's a beginner box

(14m 4s)

> I think that's what it is like packs that you can kind of shuffle up and mix into different decks like mini decks

(14m 10s) **Nama:**

> Now let me slap you the link and then you can see what's in there.

(14m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, I think that I'm gonna guess that's it is okay. So you've played

(14m 16s)

> You're from a PTCD, of course.

(14m 20s)

> The faint, tiniest toe dip in the magic, apparently, and then going back.

(14m 25s)

> Do you play any other card games?

(14m 27s)

> I'm just trying to get the frame of reference here.

(14m 28s) **Nama:**

> Um, no, not really.

(14m 29s) **Kevin:**

> Now, okay.

(14m 33s)

> Well, hey, that's cool.

(14m 36s)

> Magic is fun.

(14m 37s)

> It's a good game.

(14m 38s)

> It's a pity.

(14m 39s)

> It's, you know, it costs like literally arm and legs to play, but obviously you did the greenhouse

(14m 48s)

> that's out now already.

(14m 51s)

> I'd not listened yet, but so you're a big avatar, Fanny.

(14m 56s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, yeah. It's one of my primary interests. I try to keep up with the novels, the graphic novels,

(14m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Okay.

(15m 1s)

> Nah.

(15m 4s) **Nama:**

> I was following pretty heavily for a while. I need to catch up with about half of them at this point,

(15m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, very okay. Okay. All right. I'm looking here. Um, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, sorry, I'm looking at the product description. Yeah. Yeah. Jumpstart packs. That's what it is. They're like, I had two half decks. They're like 40 instead of the 60 card. But anyways, you, you know, pick two, you shuffle them up and play. And it's fun. It's a little variety because you can make some match between the different packs. So that's very cool. I didn't know they did one for Avatar specifically.

(15m 10s) **Nama:**

> seeing everything, watching everything. I love it.

(15m 40s)

> I think it's just the second one that they've done in terms of beginner boxes

(15m 40s) **Kevin:**

> Um, yeah. I think so. They did one for what's called foundations. I remember, um, but, yeah, that's cool. Um,

(15m 48s) **Nama:**

> Yes, yeah

(15m 50s)

> It's funny. I own two magic things in there both beginner boxes because I somebody somebody gifted me the foundations box

(15m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Do well.

(15m 58s) **Nama:**

> And it has been sitting on my shelf unwrapped so maybe this'll get me to open up the other one

(15m 59s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(16m 2s)

> Yeah. There you go. Hey, and then you can just splash them in with these decks too. Very cool. Yeah.

(16m 7s) **Nama:**

> That's true. I could I could really

(16m 10s)

> get acclimated to to it all.

(16m 11s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Um, radical. Okay. So, okay. You have the, you didn't open it. Have you bought any other packs? Uh, no.

(16m 21s) **Nama:**

> No, like I said, this is a very boring, what are you doing?

(16m 24s)

> Because I haven't yet begun my adventure, but I've, yep.

(16m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, okay. I get you. I get you. Well, I mean, have you looked at any of the cards?

(16m 32s)

> Have you seen any art like obviously you're excited but okay

(16m 33s) **Nama:**

> Yes, I have, I have my brother bought a box and he ripped it and he showed me the stuff inside.

(16m 41s)

> He showed me some gold, some, some, some rares, some, what's the one above rare?

(16m 41s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, snap.

(16m 46s)

> I don't know. They have so many berries or whatever. Mythics? Mythics? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah.

(16m 49s) **Nama:**

> the red one.

(16m 51s)

> Yeah, he showed me a couple of mythics.

(16m 54s)

> The art is really good.

(16m 57s)

> I'm glad that they didn't just go with, I'm glad they didn't just go with the standard snap shots

(16m 59s) **Kevin:**

> For the most part.

(17m 7s) **Nama:**

> from the show or anything like that.

(17m 8s) **Kevin:**

> Well, well you say that butt butt. Do you know what I'm referencing?

(17m 15s) **Nama:**

> No, I don't show which card is it? I'll look it up.

(17m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, so all right, okay. No, okay, so there are these packs called collector packs or collector boosters

(17m 24s)

> Those are they have they're just filled to the brim with rarities and yada yada

(17m 30s)

> That's where the really expensive stuff is pulled from these collector boxes, okay

(17m 34s) **Nama:**

> Ah, wonderful.

(17m 36s) **Kevin:**

> They're insanely expensive.

(17m 38s)

> The MSRP for a pack of 12 is three, four hundred, it's stupid, it's stupid.

(17m 47s)

> It's like 40 bucks for a pack MSRP.

(17m 50s)

> Anyways, well, putting that aside, again, magic money problems are either, but so specifically

(17m 55s)

> for this set, for the Avatar set, they released, I forget what it is, but they released

(18m)

> a set of full art cards of just, they're literally just screen captures from the show.

(18m 9s)

> And they did one for every episode, yeah, which is kind of cool, but the only like asterisk,

(18m 18s)

> I think, they're kind of low resolution and don't look great, a lot of them look kind of blurry,

(18m 23s)

> it's very weird, but you know, you can take a look for yourself, I have to look up what

(18m 31s)

> they're called, I forget, but yeah, it's a very interesting, yeah.

(18m 35s) **Nama:**

> Oh, okay. I'm looking at some of them now. Yeah, they are low-resolution.

(18m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, yeah, it's so, it's so baffling, like I could take a better resolution, I think, you know,

(18m 47s)

> my computer.

(18m 49s) **Nama:**

> I think it has something to do with the fact that these episodes just were never like

(18m 53s)

> it HD to begin with.

(18m 54s) **Kevin:**

> maybe. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, look over those collector cards. The big

(18m 55s) **Nama:**

> They're on blue right now, but they were drawn for a square aspect ratio.

(19m 7s) **Kevin:**

> money ones. So what is it? Okay. You know, the the intro everyone knows the intro, right

(19m 13s)

> earth, water, fire, yada, yada. They basically did those for, you know, that very stylistic

(19m 21s)

> art, they did a version of that kind of, I'll try to.

(19m 24s)

> But they did one for each of the four tribes, and those are the big money ones.

(19m 30s)

> They, I think, they're worth $2,000 plus each, um, something ridiculous like that.

(19m 34s) **Nama:**

> Wow. I'm just visiting. I don't need to I don't need to stay in this hobby.

(19m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The collector's booster box. That's where things get wild.

(19m 46s)

> Um, but, but anyways, but yeah. Um, overall, I haven't bought any, uh, avatar, but I, I've

(19m 54s)

> great things like, uh, people with mechanically gameplay wise, it's, it's very fun. Um,

(20m)

> very, you know, four different colors and, and it just translates easily into the game

(20m 6s)

> from mechanics and stuff. Um, so very cool. Oh my gosh, you, you know, what's one of the

(20m 11s)

> funniest, uh, possibly the best card in the whole game. What would you guess, uh, in the, in this

(20m 17s)

> set? What would you guess what character or, or, or creature or just take a guess? What do you

(20m 20s) **Nama:**

> I'll stay basic and say like Avatar dang or something like that, yeah.

(20m 23s) **Kevin:**

> I think would be one of the best.

(20m 24s)

> Yeah, you'd think so, right?

(20m 29s)

> Apparently the feedback most people think, badgermole cub.

(20m 35s)

> That is one of the best cards.

(20m 38s)

> I don't know why or how, but badgermole cub is apparently breaking, going to break the game or

(20m 46s) **Nama:**

> I'll look at the art at least. I can't mention the gameplay.

(20m 46s) **Kevin:**

> reas already doing so.

(20m 54s)

> I love Avatar The Last Airbender.

(21m)

> Here it is, I found the art, okay, I'll try to share the art with you.

(21m 7s)

> But I love Avatar, I love card games in general.

(21m 12s)

> Oh, can I, I don't know how, you know, I got to send it to you on Discord, it's not

(21m 17s)

> opening on the chat, anyways, oh, oh, okay, you are badgermole cub, no, I'm talking about

(21m 18s) **Nama:**

> No, I I'm looking at the card right now

(21m 21s)

> Yep

(21m 23s) **Kevin:**

> The pretty art one.

(21m 24s)

> Here I'll show you what I'm saying anyway.

(21m 24s) **Nama:**

> Oh, sure sure

(21m 26s) **Kevin:**

> But anyways, yeah.

(21m 27s)

> So I'm glad you get to play the universe is beyond stuff.

(21m 36s)

> It's really tricky and magic.

(21m 38s)

> It's a touchy subject because it's so bloated with it.

(21m 40s)

> But the avatar stuff fits in well.

(21m 41s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, it seems like it really fits it like a glove, you know, like it's a real good match better match than Spider-Man anyway

(21m 43s) **Kevin:**

> I think a lot of people are happy with it.

(21m 46s)

> Yeah.

(21m 47s)

> Yeah.

(21m 48s)

> Yeah.

(21m 50s)

> Oh, absolutely.

(21m 51s)

> Absolutely.

(21m 54s)

> This set gets the property.

(21m 55s)

> It's gotten proper loving care.

(21m 57s)

> So very cool for you.

(22m)

> Yeah.

(22m)

> You know, it's crazy though.

(22m 1s)

> They didn't do any quora.

(22m 2s)

> No quora whatsoever.

(22m 4s) **Nama:**

> Well, Kevin, that's a whole other set.

(22m 4s) **Kevin:**

> I mean, maybe they'll save it for a later set.

(22m 6s) **Nama:**

> Like that's like for next year.

(22m 7s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

(22m 11s)

> OK, all right, I'll save people.

(22m 13s)

> OK, keep going on about magic because it's nonsense.

(22m 16s)

> But anyways, all right, yeah.

(22m 16s) **Nama:**

> Well, yeah, I wanted to bring it up because I know you

(22m 19s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, yeah, I do.

(22m 20s)

> Well, I mean, card games in general, that's my vice.

(22m 24s)

> OK, cool, cool, cool, cool.

(22m 25s)

> Can't wait to hear how you play in your games.

(22m 27s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, hey Kevin. Did anything happen with you this week?

(22m 27s) **Kevin:**

> OK, you know what, before I get there, one last question.

(22m 35s)

> All right, what would you want to build?

(22m 37s)

> Like what is a deck or what, you know,

(22m 40s)

> tribe or character you want to build around?

(22m 43s) **Nama:**

> - Well, from the ideals that I'm aware of,

(22m 45s)

> from the general look of the game, is I like,

(22m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(22m 48s)

> Yeah.

(22m 49s)

> - Yeah.

(22m 52s) **Nama:**

> I like probably blue.

(22m 55s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(22m 57s) **Nama:**

> I like how like fluid that gameplay can be,

(23m) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(23m) **Nama:**

> like controlling your library and that.

(23m 1s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(23m 2s)

> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(23m 4s) **Nama:**

> I really like the gameplay hook of in fact,

(23m 7s)

> and that comes with black, I think.

(23m 8s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(23m 9s)

> - Yeah, it does, I think.

(23m 13s) **Nama:**

> It works their wise, like the characters that appear,

(23m 15s)

> not just Avatar, but in general,

(23m 18s)

> I like kind of like the vibes that white has

(23m 21s)

> and the vibes that green have.

(23m 23s)

> So basically anything but red.

(23m 24s) **Kevin:**

> them. Yeah. Okay, good stuff. Um, I don't know, I want to build the

(23m 32s)

> deck around Boomi. I don't know what he does, but I'll

(23m 34s)

> look in Boomi. So yeah, I'm talking about avatar.

(23m 34s) **Nama:**

> Oh sure. Well, if we're talking about avatar, then I want to build a yeah, boomy, earth benders.

(23m 42s)

> Um, yeah, earth bending or airbending have always been my favorite, um, uh, elements.

(23m 46s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah, yeah.

(23m 49s)

> - Huh, okay, good stuff.

(23m 51s)

> Okay, now, all right, it's over folks.

(23m 55s)

> I'm taking the mic and this is it, ladies and gentlemen.

(24m 1s)

> Some people, you know, measure the world events

(24m 6s)

> or, you know, history by world events and whatnot.

## Kirby Airriders

(24m 8s) **Kevin:**

> I'm measuring history by the post-Kirby Air Writers era

(24m 13s)

> and we're here, this is it.

(24m 14s)

> I have played the Kirby.

(24m 16s)

> I actually didn't play until yesterday, I'm trying to record him because I was just so busy.

(24m 31s)

> Oh, I got, I think it was at least two, three hours and a little today and I'll probably

(24m 31s) **Nama:**

> Hopefully you fit like a six hour session and I would assume.

(24m 37s)

> That's good.

(24m 38s) **Kevin:**

> play right after, anyways, okay, so first off, I picked up the game because of course

(24m 44s)

> so they haven't had this with you yet.

(24m 46s)

> I'm going to plan count on two gears, but which really funny is later, a couple of days later, just yesterday again actually, I went to Costco to pick up some stuff and Tom went with me and to start, I jokingly told him, okay, hey, we're going to stop by Walmart so I can pick up another copy of Kirby AirRiders because I just love the game that much, you know, just joking around, but then we got to Costco.

(25m 16s)

> I saw the, sorry, I saw the game at a cheaper price, only five bucks, but I ended up with another copy of Kirby AirRiders anyways, yeah, so, yeah, that's, it was, oh yeah, I bought it, but I opened that one, but I mean, I Costco doing great things as always, anyways, okay, oh, okay, I'll tell you my first, the first reaction, let's go chronological.

(25m 25s) **Nama:**

> Let's go.

(25m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Before the game even came out, before the game even released in the States, I was already seeing the art or the, the air ride customization on the, on Twitter, do you know what I'm talking about? I've shared some, yeah, yeah, so for people who don't know, the air ride machines, the vehicles, you can customize them, but they'll, you know, colors and decals and accessories, yada, yada, yada, and it has essentially become a new art medium, because,

(25m 55s) **Nama:**

> - Yeah, oh yeah, I was following as you were posting about it.

(26m 16s) **Kevin:**

> before, day one, again, before it even hit the States, I saw somebody had already created a coyoga as an air ride machine, and you know, there's a lot of Pokemon, there's just all sorts of things, I just, whatever you can think of, somebody has probably made it. Lots of, uh, the animes and other characters and just pretty pieces of art, it's incredible, it is, it is quite seriously an art medium at this point, the creativity.

(26m 44s) **Nama:**

> They work so fast, you know, like it you almost feel like they had like notes going in like I'm gonna be able to design my

(26m 46s) **Kevin:**

> They do. Yeah, they were thinking. Yeah, yeah, um, and of course, with, as with equals speed, as with, as art goes, the degeneracy also broke out. Um, Kawasaki with the microkini is, is the number one popular air ride machine, like just period, Nintendo is already trying to crack down on it, but it's out there,

(26m 54s) **Nama:**

> Star here's what it's gonna look like

(27m 4s)

> I'm sure I'm sure.

(27m 16s) **Kevin:**

> shouldn't it still, it's hard to contain that. That's a, that's a heavy game of black and more. Yeah, it's the same thing at the stages, that's correct. Um, oh, yeah, but there's, I've, I've seen, I went through the, I spent like an hour just going through the different, uh, ones I could see and, and there, there's masterpieces out there. There's, um, Jerry from Tom and Jerry, I've seen,

(27m 17s) **Nama:**

> They're like soccer. Why did you let them customize? Why happened with the stages

(27m 25s)

> too and we couldn't do anything to stop it?

(27m 46s) **Kevin:**

> um, lots of Simpsons, um, there's, uh, Brock from Pokemon. That was a good clever one. Um, the, there's a star club wagon starts very box shaped. So, uh, and it looks kind of like a Chinese delivery food sort of, but then, um, so that one gets a lot of play people turn it into an Amazon prime box into a game cube. Um, et cetera, et cetera. Anyways, yeah, yeah, masterful, masterful work out there. Um, I haven't made one of my

(27m 52s) **Nama:**

> Cool, love that.

(28m 16s) **Kevin:**

> things off, but I, I get a lot of fun just looking through it all. Um, okay. Now for the game. Now that I've actually played it. Okay. Oh, oh boy. Where do I begin? Uh, first one. Okay. It's fantastic. It's amazing. It's delivering everything I want. Let's say that there's no, I have no complaints. Um, the only thing that comes close to a complaint that is different. The speed of the game compared to the first one is at least doubled.

(28m 48s) **Nama:**

> Okay, so speed of the game is in like the speed of your movement or the speed of like load times and stuff.

(28m 53s) **Kevin:**

> the speed of the movement, the vehicles, right?

(28m 55s)

> 'Cause this is a racer, so when I'm talking about speed

(28m 58s)

> and talking about the speed of your vehicles.

(29m 1s)

> Yeah, it is at least double.

(29m 3s)

> I would, it feels at least double from the original.

(29m 5s) **Nama:**

> Wow, we call that the F0G X effect.

(29m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, basically, right?

(29m 11s)

> It's not, and here's the thing, Kirby outright,

(29m 14s)

> I get by comparison to other racers was a slower game.

(29m 19s)

> So it's not like it's absurdly fast,

(29m 21s)

> like not unplayably fed.

(29m 24s)

> It does feel a lot more chaotic.

(29m 28s)

> You also have six racers. The original only had four at a time.

(29m 32s)

> So with all the enemies flying by the powers and the copy abilities, all that stuff.

(29m 37s)

> The races feel a lot more frantic and chaotic.

(29m 42s)

> Especially in the city trial mode where you race around a city trying to collect power-ups for a game at the end.

(29m 50s)

> uh... in the original game that was a very

(29m 53s)

> but like you could be very deliberate i'm gonna go over to this area to this

(29m 58s)

> part of the city to try to look for something to go here there I got you could

(30m 2s)

> think and plan what you're trying to do

(30m 4s)

> in this one oh my goodness it's just non-stop barrage of all there's stuff's

(30m 9s)

> falling all over there's enemies everywhere

(30m 12s)

> uh... it's it's just pure chaos

(30m 14s)

> and again it's not bad it's still very quality i'm enjoying it but it is

(30m 18s)

> different. Um, yeah, um, so,

(30m 23s)

> it's not, I don't think it's to an extreme degree, but I'm also biased, you know,

(30m 28s)

> I was like, my fundamentals from the first game still are there. I, you know,

(30m 33s)

> so, so I, uh, maybe that makes it easier to digest. I, I'd say that, you know,

(30m 39s)

> um, I'd probably need the opinions of maybe someone else who doesn't love the

(30m 43s)

> game as much as I do. Um, yeah.

(30m 45s) **Nama:**

> So you know how you play you jump from like melee to brawl and that can it's essentially the same game, but it controls way different, and then you jump from brawl to smash for, and that's different, and then smash for to ultimate is similar, but still different, is is is is Kirby air writer to air writers similar jump or is it like a is it is a closer to what?

(30m 53s) **Kevin:**

> Mm-hmm.

(30m 56s)

> Mm-hmm. Yeah.

(31m)

> Yeah. That's correct.

(31m 7s)

> Uh, it, I feel it's not that far of a jump, um,

(31m 16s)

> because there's, in the, in the different smash games, it feels like there's a lot more knobs

(31m 21s)

> in variables that turn right.

(31m 23s)

> I'm trying to think I feel like I'm Mario Kart comparison would be better.

(31m 50s)

> I'm trying to think it might be I actually think maybe

(31m 53s)

> from eight to world, like yeah, right? Like it's

(31m 58s)

> it's different not inherently worse, but it's just you know,

(32m 1s)

> you can feel that difference. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

(32m 3s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, you notice a couple of things, but those fundamentals that you're describing are definitely

(32m 10s) **Kevin:**

> that's that is yeah. So the game play itself is in my

(32m 16s)

> opinion. It's fine. Yeah, it's and it's good. One that

(32m 23s)

> interesting thing or okay, it's Masahiro Sakurai and it's got

(32m 30s)

> Masahiro Sakurai's fingerprints all over. I say that, but

(32m 34s)

> actually Kirby, the first Kirby air ride is really where a lot of

(32m 37s)

> his things began. The checklist to unlock everything kind of

(32m 41s)

> the menu layouts, the design he goes for. When you win the race,

(32m 46s)

> that is just a smash victory screen. It has, you know, all the

(32m 50s)

> contestants on the side and even has that kind of

(32m 53s)

> of like shadowy color after effect. Yeah, it's it's it's a soccer I

(32m 57s)

> game through and through, including unlocking everything. You start off with two

(33m 3s) **Nama:**

[laughing]

(33m 3s) **Kevin:**

> or three machines and four characters and there's 20 characters total and

(33m 9s)

> probably roughly the same amount of vehicles. So I haven't even got to touch

(33m 14s)

> everything, all the new characters and whatnot. All the courses from the original

(33m 19s)

> back in I'm on launch I don't lock those two at

(33m 23s)

> et cetera et cetera yeah it's it's so much

(33m 28s)

> there's as soccer I does so much content and of course then there's all the

(33m 33s)

> cosmetic nonsense because not only can you do all the aforementioned you know

(33m 38s)

> modifications to your vehicles you can also get hats for all the

(33m 43s)

> characters get get colors in different skits for your characters it's it's

(33m 53s)

> It's a deep wall and I'm very very excited and happy to go through you know to dig through it and find all the gems I can

(34m) **Nama:**

> that's really cool. So what is the, like, I'm going to ask about the gameplay loop, but I'm also interested

(34m 10s)

> in, like, are you playing more, like, single player stuff, local multiplayer, online multiplayer,

(34m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Okay, sure. So I haven't played online at all. I've played with my siblings. So it's been primarily local multiplayer. But I can, you know, compare, going back to the original, like the experience of playing single player versus multiplayer isn't that terribly different, I'll say.

(34m 17s) **Nama:**

> like, how is the online multiplayer? What can you speak to the, to the, to the playing experience?

(34m 44s) **Kevin:**

> It's, again, Mario.

(34m 46s)

> I mean, you are competing, but it's moving so fast, like, you know, you can't focus in on someone or whatever.

(35m 1s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, well, can I interrupt for a soon?

(35m 7s)

> Is it like a racer like you're making laps or you're I always thought that you were on these vehicles, but you were like fighting each other

(35m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Yes. Yes.

(35m 16s)

> No. No. Okay. So there are three modes. The first is air ride mode, which is your standard racer doing laps around a course.

(35m 18s) **Nama:**

> Okay

(35m 24s) **Kevin:**

> The standard is only two laps, and because of the speed these things, you're done in a race in under five minutes, probably.

(35m 31s) **Nama:**

> Okay.

(35m 31s) **Kevin:**

> Actually, yeah, I'd say under three minutes on average, because they show you the time when you finish.

(35m 36s)

> So you're doing laps around a course. So it, you know, your standard Mario Kart sort of experience just very fast.

(35m 44s)

> The second mode is called top mode.

(35m 46s)

> It is still racer doing laps, but it is, as the implies, like a top-down view.

(35m 55s)

> You see the entire course.

(35m 57s)

> All the little racers are basically many racers on the course, and everyone's just racing off one screen.

(36m 3s)

> The control scheme is a little different.

(36m 6s)

> Basically, if you tilt the control stick moves, you turn in the direction of your control stick.

(36m 15s) **Nama:**

> Mm-hmm.

(36m 16s) **Kevin:**

> It's a little hard to describe, but it's just left right, like, you're going up, down, left, right, and all directions, because you're doing this top-down view.

(36m 23s)

> Those are even, well, those courses are short, because you're, you know, you're fitting everything on one screen, but you're doing five to eight laps of each one.

(36m 34s)

> That one is probably the least popular or memorable mode, and it's still enjoyable.

(36m 40s)

> Well, just, I'm the other one, just, I just have sunk so much more time in historically when the first one.

(36m 43s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, no, I follow that. I've heard of this one.

(36m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah.

(36m 49s)

> Oh, and one thing I should say for all the modes, one of the big differentiators, everything accelerates automatically.

(37m 3s)

> Yeah, so you are, it's a very simple game where everything accelerates, and you have a drift/boost, because it does both at the same time.

(37m 12s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, I know that it's like one button.

(37m 14s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that's the intent.

(37m 17s)

> Yeah, and it works great in my opinion.

(37m 20s)

> Anyways, going back to the third mode. It's called City Trial.

(37m 24s)

> This, yeah.

(37m 24s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, this one I know about. I've watched videos.

(37m 28s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, there you go, right?

(37m 30s)

> You're running around a city area, trying to collect buffs for a game at the end.

(37m 34s)

> Like a mini game type thing.

(37m 36s)

> And it can be all sorts of things.

(37m 39s)

> Like I said, it's very, very chaotic with everything going on.

(37m 42s)

> the like forget how many people it can be up to 20 that might be online only

(37m 46s)

> I don't know it's a ridiculous amount of racers and events going on and abilities

(37m 51s)

> insanely and insanely fun prob I don't know if it might be my favorite vote from the original

(37m 57s)

> but yeah it's enjoyable and yeah and those these three are your bread and butter you're just

(38m 4s)

> going through it trying to get all the check boxes on the grid to unlock everything and you know

(38m 10s)

> cosmetics whatnot better times etc etc I haven't hit the online

(38m 16s)

> so you know all the modes so I can't speak to that experience yet but I mean gameplay

(38m 20s)

> as it's you know gonna be the same thing so oh yeah yeah

(38m 23s) **Nama:**

> Well, my last question is, you said it's six people, six players, is that all on the couch?

(38m 32s)

> Like, can you give people six controllers and they can do this? Or is it just up to four?

(38m 34s) **Kevin:**

> oh that's uh I'm guessing it's up to four because when you go to the character select screen

(38m 39s) **Nama:**

> Okay. Gotcha.

(38m 42s) **Kevin:**

> you see four slots, or you know the player 1, 2, 3, 4.

(38m 46s)

> spots. Yeah, I don't think locally you can go more than four, but yeah, but yeah, that's

(38m 49s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. Okay. I was just curious.

(38m 57s) **Kevin:**

> that's Kirby Airlines. I love it to death. It's lived up. I'm so happy it exists.

(39m 2s)

> And oh, you know what? There's a single player. There's a campaign. I haven't even

(39m 5s)

> touched or looked at that yet. I forgot about that. But yeah, that's there, too.

(39m 7s) **Nama:**

> that's great. Well, I've got it on hold at the library when my cop becomes in I'll try to hit you up and will roll around at the speed of sound.

(39m 12s) **Kevin:**

> - Yeah.

(39m 16s)

(40m 58s)

(41m 53s)

> There you go. That's the way to do it

(41m 56s) **Nama:**

> They said we gotta publish it right now.

(41m 58s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, but it's only EA so who knows what?

(42m 8s)

> We'll release date, but I imagine that's question marks right now on. There's a trailer check it out

(42m 15s)

> The designs are cute. I'll see that for the animals. I like them

(42m 18s)

> um

(42m 20s)

(42m 22s)

> Next up we have outbound

(42m 26s)

> Oh my gosh, this is the crazy

(42m 29s)

> camper, but you build a whole house cabin structure on top of it

(42m 35s) **Nama:**

> Oh, I remember seeing something about that.

(42m 38s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, which is a wild wild mechanic. It's I find it very amusing slash entertaining

(42m 46s)

> But the big announcement coming officially to switch and switch to

(42m 54s)

> Presumably at the same time as the

(42m 57s)

> Steam version, which is slated for Q2 2026 as of right now

(43m 3s)

> Yeah, I don't know I'm in I'm I'm intrigued

(43m 8s)

> by this game right because that whole idea of building a car or you know a

(43m 13s)

> structure on a car and I wonder if it's gonna like impact your driving and whatnot I'm

(43m 19s)

> just looking forward to it looks very very entertaining again that that

(43m 22s)

> Kirby Air Writer-esque like what nonsense are people gonna come up with I'm very

(43m 27s)

> interested.

(43m 29s) **Nama:**

> I wonder if there's gonna be like a switch to upgrade

(43m 32s)

> or if it's just like, well, it's on switch one,

(43m 35s)

> air go, it is on.

(43m 37s) **Kevin:**

> That's an interesting question. Have we really seen that from a third-party developer yet like switch to exclusive for you?

(43m 42s) **Nama:**

> How Silk Song has a Switch 2 upgrade?

(43m 46s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, it does. What's the upgrade?

(43m 49s) **Nama:**

> I'd just like better, like runs better.

(43m 51s)

> I don't think it has any extra content or anything like that.

(43m 51s) **Kevin:**

> Well sure I mean, but I think all games do that by default, right? If they are on switch

(43m 58s) **Nama:**

> Well, here's the thing is if you're running, let's say Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Switch 2,

(44m 5s)

> it will load faster, but it will not necessarily look better.

(44m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Hmm, okay.

(44m 12s) **Nama:**

> It's a more efficient machine, so it's going to play the games more efficiently,

(44m 20s)

> but that's not to say that it has been enhanced or optimized or meticulously crafted to work the best it can on Switch 2.

(44m 31s)

> The Silk Song Switch 2 Edition has 120 FPS, it has, I think it can go up to 4K.

(44m 42s)

> It is a dedicated Switch 2 edition, so not necessarily something that outbound is interested in.

(44m 53s)

> I just wonder if there will be one or not.

(44m 55s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I see anything specific about that. So who knows

(45m)

> question marks for now. Um, but, but I mean, it's caught it. You know, as so many

(45m 5s)

> college core games aim or, or are requested to come to switch because, you know, that's

(45m 11s)

> the demographics line up there. Um, so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think they already had PlayStation

(45m 14s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, no, it's great that they got got it working on council

(45m 21s) **Kevin:**

> next box version is cooking so I guess that means it's coming to

(45m 25s)

> everything which is cool. Speaking of things that are coming to

(45m 28s)

> switch and well I guess it was already on there but it's coming again this time in

(45m 34s)

> the real world, Moonstone Island, a well-known game that I enjoyed question mark. Monster

(45m 44s)

> collector farming island hopping game where yeah coming to switch physically we are getting

(45m 55s)

> looking at it. Oh it's a physical edition. It is one of those limited run-type games

(46m)

> or its limited stock. It's at super rare games which again a lot of cottagecore games also

(46m 8s)

> tend to gravitate to. Yeah that's cool if you want it for your shelf or whatever. You know

(46m 17s)

> one thing I will say it's always interesting to see what is the box are going to look

(46m 21s)

> quite great because we have images of the

(46m 25s)

> game already or with a promotion of how they're going to

(46m 27s)

> align it. And it looks nice. I like the

(46m 31s)

> I mean, it's a game I played to completion, which is something

(46m 35s)

> and they've done lots of DLC. I still have a couple of

(46m 39s)

> hiccups, but it's, you know, I will recommend it. I'll see that.

(46m 43s)

> Yeah, it's Moonstone Island.

(46m 44s) **Nama:**

> It's all on the cart as well. There's no, yeah.

(46m 49s) **Kevin:**

> He card whatever nonsense, I guess.

(46m 53s)

> I was thinking about it, but I feel like...

(46m 55s)

> I still don't understand, I mean, I have to say it, but yeah.

(46m 58s) **Nama:**

> The game key cards is what they're called.

(47m 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

(47m 3s) **Nama:**

> I need to listen to that episode, it's in my queue,

(47m 6s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah.

(47m 6s) **Nama:**

> but apparently there was a hole to do about that

(47m 9s) **Kevin:**

> Oh, wait, hold the phones.

(47m 12s)

> 50 bucks, you as D to get that physical hurt?

(47m 15s) **Nama:**

> Well, it costs a lot to print the cartridge.

(47m 16s) **Kevin:**

> Ooh.

(47m 18s)

> I'm...

(47m 20s)

> I don't think it's that much on Switch.

(47m 21s) **Nama:**

> They're not going to make a lot of them, so they have to charge for the difference.

(47m 23s) **Kevin:**

> You got a root.

(47m 26s)

> I guess so.

(47m 28s)

> It's out now if you want to go look at it, but oh, I mean, I like it.

(47m 32s)

> Well, I got that much.

(47m 37s)

> All right.

(47m 38s)

> So there.

(47m 39s)

> So again, that's out now already on Switch.

(47m 43s)

> Okay.

(47m 57s)

> We got monsters, monster, collector-y type thing.

(48m 1s)

> Anyways, so we're getting.

(48m 4s)

> This is interesting.

(48m 5s)

(48m 9s)

> space.

(48m 10s)

(49m 1s)

> And I think it can like fuse them and breed them together, which is interesting

(49m 5s)

> um, I might check it out because I think like the breeding fusion aspect is always an interesting one or adds a lot to monster collectors

(49m 15s)

> So it may be worth investigating or looking at but yeah

(49m 21s)

> Yeah, that's uh, I'm sorry. I was just skimming or

(49m 25s)

> scanning trying to see. There's no alternate target window or date from what I see, so

(1h 2s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 8s) **Nama:**

> Fishing, you know?

(1h 10s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, oh, that'd be good. Oh, have they ever done a crossover map? I don't think they have, but that's a good idea. I like the way you're thinking

(1h 15s) **Nama:**

> This would have been the one to do it with, but that's fine.

(1h 17s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, it would be that's yeah

(1h 19s) **Nama:**

> Well, we'll pitch it to them.

(1h 22s)

> They'll listen to this when it comes out and we're like, "Oh, we'll just do that."

(1h 22s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 24s)

> Yeah, yeah

(1h 26s)

> Yeah, Sebastian's bangs hat. Okay. I'm kind of surprised. They don't have

(1h 33s)

> Robus or Crocus would ever get his name the shadowy creature fella. Um, that

(1h 38s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, you're right that's okay. We'll just be very comfortable with Grandpa's night cap hat

(1h 40s) **Kevin:**

> Feels like he would have fit him perfect, but no, he's not in there. Um,

(1h 49s)

> There you go. Okay, my wife didn't make it in. It's our layer. Oh

(1h 57s)

> Okay, next up my time at Santa rock we have

(1h 1m 4s)

> Hey, wait. No, I'm okay. Wait. Am I crossing stories? I think I'm crossing stories. Um, what on earth?

(1h 1m 10s) **Nama:**

> It's a new merch for a story of seasons.

(1h 1m 10s) **Kevin:**

> Did I

(1h 1m 12s)

> Oh, I skipped a story. That's yeah, I skipped. I

(1h 1m 14s) **Nama:**

> Yeah.

(1h 1m 16s) **Kevin:**

> We are getting to plushie stories. I got my wires crossed here

(1h 1m 19s) **Nama:**

[laughs]

(1h 1m 21s) **Kevin:**

> First up story of seasons. Yes

(1h 1m 24s)

> Okay

(1h 1m 25s)

> We're getting the cow plush

(1h 1m 28s)

> First of all, what do you mean? We haven't had it before. You can't buy one right now. What is that? That's wild

(1h 1m 36s)

> Second of all, it's through makeshift.

(1h 1m 40s)

> That's a limited time run, generally speaking, launches November 28th right after Thanksgiving or whatever I guess.

(1h 1m 51s)

> It's a fantastic plush because that's the best cow ever made or designed.

(1h 1m 57s)

> But I just wish it wasn't makeshift because this should just be always available.

(1h 2m 2s)

> This feels like a huge wasted potential to just not be selling it forever from whatever story of seasons.

(1h 2m 10s)

> That is a sizable franchise.

(1h 2m 12s) **Nama:**

> - Yeah, it's not small.

(1h 2m 13s) **Kevin:**

> They could probably scrape up the money to just make a proper release of a plush you can buy on a website.

(1h 2m 21s)

> That isn't limited time.

(1h 2m 23s)

> Okay, that's mind-boggling, but it's coming.

(1h 2m 31s)

> Well, by the time it's actually I think the day of, when the day is the day of, no, it's like two days after.

(1h 2m 40s)

> This releases, yeah, the tuning in.

(1h 2m 44s)

> Anyways, it's coming.

(1h 2m 46s)

> It's a good plush, I'll say that again, but I'm just mind-boggled.

(1h 2m 51s)

> That one, it's not already available in two that's through makeshift, but there you go.

(1h 2m 56s)

> I still might get one.

(1h 2m 57s)

> I just love that cow, it's so much.

(1h 2m 57s) **Nama:**

> It's a real good design.

(1h 3m) **Kevin:**

> Yep.

(1h 3m 2s)

> Alright, next up we have, again, another plush I got confused.

(1h 3m 8s)

> I was looking at my listing correctly.

(1h 3m 11s)

> Okay, I was confused because the other, no, no, that was a plush guy, but X not, not formerly Twitter X, but it's literally called X.

(1h 3m 23s)

> My time at Sandrock, they're releasing an X plushie X is a bird character, Dr. Fang's loyal sidekick.

(1h 3m 32s)

> I don't know who this is, but it's a ping, it's not a ping, it's a bird with an orange beak.

(1h 3m 38s)

> And it comes.

(1h 3m 40s)

> Yeah, right. And thank you. That's the word. That's the one. Yeah. It comes to the hood. That's removable. That's very cool. That's very, very cool.

(1h 3m 48s)

> Also on make ship.

(1h 3m 53s)

> Which means, let's see. Oh, you can already get this one. This one, it's already fully funded. It's only available until December 13th. Ships April 17th.

(1h 4m 5s)

> um the bubble cow plushie eyes. I don't know if that one's gonna

(1h 4m 10s)

> also have a you know needs X amounts of salt to get funded but I don't think

(1h 4m 14s)

> that's going to be an issue for the the cow but but it just feels weird you know

(1h 4m 19s)

> that it's still the go through those hoops but anyways but yeah X plushie it's a

(1h 4m 24s)

> good plush I'll say that the eyes looks good the beaks and their movable scarf

(1h 4m 30s)

> or head gear they hood that's the work that's very cool I like that a lot okay so

(1h 4m 38s) **Kevin:**

> So that's it, we got that.

(1h 4m 40s)

> Now, let's see. Next up we have new games.

(1h 4m 44s)

> That's all updates and stuff.

(1h 4m 46s)

> Let's talk about one new game specifically.

(1h 4m 48s)

> It is called four leaf fields.

(1h 4m 52s)

> Um, oh my gosh.

(1h 4m 54s)

> First of all, these are, okay, I like the concept we're forming,

(1h 4m 59s)

> but they're really, really giant.

(1h 5m 3s)

> Everything's giant around you.

(1h 5m 4s)

> It's a, oh, well, yeah.

(1h 5m 5s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, you are small.

(1h 5m 7s) **Kevin:**

> You are what's what was that name of the

(1h 5m 10s)

> Oh gosh the...

(1h 5m 11s)

> "Honey, I shrunk the kids' game that came out recently. I can't remember. I can't remember."

(1h 5m 15s) **Nama:**

> Oh, I don't know. I'm thinking more like Zelda minish cap.

(1h 5m 16s) **Kevin:**

> I say, yeah, that's another one. I forget. Anyways, oh gosh, I cannot remember. Anyways,

(1h 5m 29s)

> yeah, I can't remember. But anyways, so yeah, it's all the miniscaps, another good point,

(1h 5m 33s)

> or reference point, because you have houses, there's houses where everything's proportional to you,

(1h 5m 41s)

> then there's somebody lives in a, you know, shoe, and you're growing giant crops, or at least

(1h 5m 47s)

> giant for you, and there's ladybugs moving around because they're your size and so on and so forth.

(1h 5m 53s)

> They're like, I'm guessing that's like your livestock, it looks like.

(1h 5m 54s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, so like one thing that we can describe, there's you're like holding a seed that's like

(1h 6m 3s)

> the size of a football and then it grows and do a carrot that's the size of like a it would be

(1h 6m 8s)

> a normal carrot to to you as a play as a human being, but your character is like chopping it up

(1h 6m 16s)

> into a bunch of tiny little carrots that you can actually like have and hold.

(1h 6m 22s)

> It is... I gotta take it.

(1h 6m 24s)

> I love the art style. I love the setting of being in a small, like a small little borrower.

(1h 6m 34s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 6m 34s) **Nama:**

> I wish listed this game. I gotta pay attention to this.

(1h 6m 37s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah

(1h 6m 40s)

> Yeah, this one feels worthy. Let's see. Okay, the animals you can raise are mods bees butterflies and ladybugs

(1h 6m 48s)

> So yeah, the bugs are your livestock with Jay Cody. Her ears ringing

(1h 6m 52s) **Nama:**

> That sounds like a Cody game.

(1h 6m 55s) **Kevin:**

> The setting is very cool. I agree the art style is good. It's it's you know 2d pixel, but it's detailed

(1h 7m 1s)

> Doesn't feel started like it

(1h 7m 4s)

> it really feels like minish cap it feels similar art style wise yeah of course

(1h 7m 13s)

> you have a town so there's relationships and all that good stuff it's stories

(1h 7m 20s)

> and secrets, they're gonna have multiplayer yeah online multiplayer there is you can

(1h 7m 34s)

> question join a play test no idea when but no date announced or target or

(1h 7m 39s)

> anything so just keep an eye out very very cool idea

(1h 7m 43s) **Nama:**

> Yeah. This was pretty much an announcement of the game with a pretty good concept trailer,

(1h 7m 50s)

> but they're just kind of like gathering interest until they are ready for an actual date.

(1h 7m 54s) **Kevin:**

> Yep. Yep. So yeah, very, very cool. Okay. That's four leaf fields. That's the name. I'm, I'm excited.

(1h 8m 3s) **Nama:**

> Oh, sorry. Did you mention the gossip system?

(1h 8m 4s) **Kevin:**

> I'm intrigued. I didn't read too close. I'd saw there is like a relationship town system.

(1h 8m 11s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, just well, the last time that I was on, um, I got really excited about like a social

(1h 8m 17s)

> skill tree and this is yet another social skill tree. And I'm like, oh, more stuff to

(1h 8m 22s)

> fill out by talking to people.

(1h 8m 24s) **Kevin:**

> Yeah, yeah, that because yeah, there's town ranks that you can unlock it is interesting to kind of

(1h 8m 33s)

> System mafai, but yeah, there's your skill tree

(1h 8m 37s)

> And it looks like oh

(1h 8m 40s)

> If I were to guess it looks like maybe there's mechanics you can unlock through the tree on by socializing to people that's an interesting

(1h 8m 49s)

> Approach because usually the mechanical you know farming stuff is very divorced

(1h 8m 54s)

> From the social aspects, but if you have yeah, yeah, Oh, I like that a lot actually it combined them force force people force your force to talk to your neighbors

(1h 8m 56s) **Nama:**

> Yeah, maybe it's like people teaching you skills and like, you know,

(1h 9m)

> studying under them and things like that.

(1h 11m 59s)

> Looking you're kind of under the person and they're looking up so you kind of like see their chin and

(1h 12m 4s)

> they just, no one's picking on them but it is a very memorable looking fan art, let's

(1h 12m 12s)

> just say that, I invite people to book it because I cannot do it justice and it has taken

(1h 12m 15s) **Nama:**

> Everybody's got to try.

(1h 12m 19s) **Kevin:**

> off on Twitter, there's two basic responses, one, people replicating the art with other characters

(1h 12m 25s)

> because it's so amusing or two, like legit artists and stuff just like, hey, okay, this is awesome,

(1h 12m 31s)

> So here's how you can actually improve on this angle, everybody.

(1h 12m 34s)

> So it's just, and it's all fantastic, it's all great vibes and just what art is all about.

(1h 12m 41s)

> Legit people, like I saw the creator of Chun Lee from Street Fighter, like drawing their version of the thing to explain how to do it better.

(1h 12m 51s)

> It's just taken over Twitter and it's incredible.

(1h 12m 55s)

> But yes, the original fan art is very goofy and amusing looking, but it's been put up next to the Sasuke fan art.

(1h 13m 2s)

> Do you know that I'm talking about this?

(1h 13m 4s)

> It's been put on the pedestal mix to that van art that's how much this is taken off
