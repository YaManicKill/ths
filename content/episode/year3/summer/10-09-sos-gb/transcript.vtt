00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.500
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Yes

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.299
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It was it was DS

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.359
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>it was DS and I only know that because I

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.780
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Had never played it on the DS. So I pull I went back and played it in

<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>preparation for this just to get like a feel for what it was like in its original state

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Fun times

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.819

37
00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So we're gonna cover that

38
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.080
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, I've been very busy.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But first of all my Cal what have you been up to?

40
00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.599
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, I just recently got back from the Pokemon world

41
00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.840
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>championships in Anaheim.

42
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.759
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Nice, how was that?

43
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.439
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, it was very fun.

44
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.280
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It was very nice.

45
00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.240
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It was nice seeing a lot of friends and, you know, just like, it's always nice

46
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.680
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>for events like that, because there's so many people that, you know, almost

47
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:49.120
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>exclusively online that you get to meet in person either for the first time or.

48
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.639
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Again, you know, you get to see each other again.

49
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.039
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Um, so it's, it's a lot of fun.

50
00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.120
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, and it was, it was very cool.

51
00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:04.960
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It was, it was in a, an arena that this time the finals were in an arena, which was.

52
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, I didn't end up seeing any of the live stream because it's just dreadful timing for here,

53
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but I did see some clips and it looked quite interesting being in that sort of surrounding

54
00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the stage rather than kind of your standard looking forwards towards the stage.

55
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Yeah. It was like, it's the, it's the big leagues now.

56
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.979
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It's, it's a, it's a real e-sports arena, which is kind of wild that it's come

57
00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:41.219
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>this far and that's where we are, but, uh, yeah, it was, it was, it was pretty cool.

58
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.800
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It was a very cool experience.

59
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:55.259
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, I have been to a few worlds before until they started going out of the country.

60
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.580
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, fair enough. You didn't come to London and you didn't go to Japan, that's fair enough.

61
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.479
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>I did not come to London and I did not go to, no, I did.

62
00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So my question for you is then, how did it feel compared to the other ones you've been

63
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.060
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, it felt a lot bigger.

64
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.399
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>I mean, the last time I had gone was pretty pandemic.

65
00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:26.240
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Uh, and it was, you know, uh, a lot happened to Pokemon as a hobby during

66
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[laughs]

67
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Did it.

68
00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:26.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[laughs]

69
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.360
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>the pandemic, um, as evidenced by the state of the card game and, uh, the

70
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.680
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>prices of anything Pokemon.

71
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.720
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>So it was pretty like boom, the big pandemic boom.

72
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.000
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>So it was significantly smaller.

73
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.240
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Yeah, it was just a lot bigger, a lot more moving parts.

74
00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.759
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>It seemed like a lot like higher production was pretty big, pretty big deal.

75
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.740
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Fun times, I've only been to one, so I went to the London one, so I don't have anything

76
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to compare that to. But it felt pretty big to me. It was definitely a lot of fun, and

77
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.959
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Oh sure, yeah.

78
00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:19.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>if I were to get the opportunity to go again, I definitely would. There's so much, and it

79
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>feels like even if you're not particularly interested in the matches themselves, which

80
00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:30.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I find interesting, like I really only went to, during the Friday and Saturday, I kind

81
00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.540
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I walked around and watched a bunch of...

82
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.259
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the qualifications card game matches because they I think are the most accessible when there's

83
00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:47.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>loads of them and I watched a little bit of the what's it called a poking tournament because

84
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.399
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Oh, right, right, right.

85
00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:52.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they were still doing that in London they were they were fun to watch and then other than that

86
00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.899
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Wow, they were still doing Pokken in London?

87
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it was mostly they were yeah I think that was their last one I think they didn't do it after that

88
00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:54.899
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>That's awesome.

89
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Oh, that's sad.

90
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And and then other.

91
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Other than that, we just watched the finals on the Sunday, but even not knowing all the

92
00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>ins and the outs, they do a really good job of showing you.

93
00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And like, you know, like when they show you've got the screen up and they show you like the

94
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:19.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>cards for the TCG, they have the like cameras and they actually show you what cards was

95
00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:21.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>put up.

96
00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:22.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's clear.

97
00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can read it and it's quite clear.

98
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And the VGC is a little bit harder to follow because like things happen really fast and

99
00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:31.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they don't but the

100
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>commentators are pretty good at catching you up on what just happens here like yeah I have no

101
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>idea what just something happened but I have no idea what that was and they're like oh this meant

102
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.660
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>this triggered that and this meant that and that's how that happened you're like oh okay cool and I

103
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>find it really fun even when you don't know all the stuff because like I'm not deep into the

104
00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:59.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>um the tactics of the you know high-end competitive um yeah exactly exactly so it's

105
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>sure yeah me neither in any regard you know I don't cards VGC I don't really

106
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>exactly exactly we know that the basics of how this thing works right and can

107
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.879
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>know what's going on but

108
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.000
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>yeah

109
00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:11.339
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>can beat everything in game but there's a whole different level to have competitive um

110
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.480
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>I know when people are cheering that something good have happened

111
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>yes but I think they do yeah

112
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.639
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>usually I can use the context clues to be like oh that was a big move that they

113
00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:29.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>exactly exactly and it's like you know it's it's really exciting when like something crits or you

114
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Yeah

115
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You know, something doesn't quite hit like they, they,

116
00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:34.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>one HP or something that is super fun to watch that.

117
00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.639
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Right, yeah

118
00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:39.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But it's also just fun to be around, even if you don't care about that.

119
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.240
<v 3CAC2202-55C8-4CBA-B773-CFB5A67E7313>Oh, yeah, definitely

120
00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:41.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because there was loads of other events and stuff.

121
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's obviously the Pokemon Center to spend all your money in.

122
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But in London, they had like these

123
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>event like areas you could go in, like get some some merch.

124
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And there was like a whole bunch of free stuff and like just other things,

125
00:07:58.459 --> 00:07:59.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>other activities and stuff.

126
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, nice. Did you play it? Thoughts?

127
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[laughter]

128
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You're probably not going to be able to elaborate on what that means, I suspect.

129
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.919
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But.

130
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Try.

131
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:32.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Interesting. You play, and you don't feel the same about the original legend's arc.

132
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- Yeah, no, that's fair.

133
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Mm-hmm

134
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Mm-hmm

135
00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's fair

136
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:55.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, yeah, I know. Yeah, the ladder. I can't remember what they call it either. They've

137
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>always got to make up complicated names for things.

138
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, yeah, yeah

139
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't know how I feel about that. I'll probably have to try it to see how I feel about it, right?

140
00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:12.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because, like, I kind of like that Pokémon is mostly turn-based in its combat, right?

141
00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:18.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because you don't have to think quickly. But equally, if the rest of the game is real time,

142
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.740
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>then does it make sense for battles to not be real time, right?

143
00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:29.259
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I actually really liked ZA's battle system being different.

144
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:35.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But still, essentially turn-based, sorry, yeah, sorry, yeah, Legends Arceus.

145
00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:39.740
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I liked how it was still turn-based, but different.

146
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I know people didn't really like that, and that's fine, but I did.

147
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I don't know, I just, I feel like it's going to be, I'll have to try it and see how it feels.

148
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, yes, I've seen that, yeah.

149
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:07.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I know what you mean.

150
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I know what you mean.

151
00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:10.660
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's, it's this battles alphas, right?

152
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's going to be part of the main story, presumably.

153
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- Yes, of course, of course.

154
00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:58.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You'll figure out what it is and then you'll be tasked

155
00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:00.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>with going and camming the rest of them,

156
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but they're not gonna get rid of them.

157
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.480
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it's interesting. I guess the thing about the difference between that and how

158
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.839
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Arceus worked was that the way that

159
00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:09.559
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it worked in Arceus is you were trying to catch it rather than battle it.

160
00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:14.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Right. So like it kind of made sense to be kind of real time there where you're

161
00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:16.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>like trying to throw balls at it. I really like that.

162
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.400
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But when you're also then trying to decide what your Pokemon will do,

163
00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:25.480
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I wonder how that will feel. That's, I guess, my question.

164
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah, yeah, fair enough.

165
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

166
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:07.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah.

167
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I guess I just, I'll just have to see. We've not got, we've only got a month and a half now. Not long to go. Looking forward to trying it out.

168
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

169
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:54.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I'm only in I'm only in one place.

170
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:00.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

171
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Cool, we shall see.

172
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:31.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah. I mean, it gives them more flexibility as well and allows people to be like, it might

173
00:24:31.539 --> 00:24:37.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>stop some people complaining about like, "Oh, they've removed Megas again" or whatever, and like,

174
00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:41.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>"Yeah, OK, fine, they're in this other game, go play them over there if you've

175
00:24:47.500 --> 00:25:00.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, never say never, never say never, although the problem is that August is a difficult

176
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:06.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>time because I tend to be on hold like away somewhere for the first couple of weeks of

177
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:13.480
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>August and then it's like rushing away again at that point, you know, the timing is not

178
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.759
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>ideal. So we'll just, but never say never.

179
00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:27.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Look, I love doing it. When it was in London, it was great fun. I would love to go again.

180
00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:39.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Look, it definitely makes you reconsider things, let's put it that way.

181
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Cool beans.

182
00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:05.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, yeah. Have you have you downloaded Silksong yet? Have you bought?

183
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, fair enough.

184
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I played most of the way through Hollow Knight.

185
00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.099
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I got stuck on one battle and then ended up playing something else

186
00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:20.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and I never went back to it, because it's hard to go back to games sometimes.

187
00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:26.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, but I did enjoy it.

188
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm certainly not picking up Silksong right now.

189
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I might do it at some point.

190
00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:37.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I really love the combat and the platforming and the...

191
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But I absolutely hate backtracking in games.

192
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.339
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Just across the board.

193
00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:48.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I hate going back to a place I've already been, because I'm like, I've been here.

194
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it's like, you have to go all the way back through an area you've explored

195
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.099
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to get to a new area.

196
00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:54.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't find that fun.

197
00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:59.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I saw someone describe it as, you know that moment where you walk out to your car

198
00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:01.259
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and then you realize you've forgotten your car keys?

199
00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:03.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you have to go back to the house to get the car keys?

200
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.339
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's the game.

201
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I have no idea.

202
00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:16.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I was on a TikTok, so I wasn't really being attention to who it was.

203
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:52.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, it's the same thing. Yeah, if I, I mean, they're, I think they're worse, right.

204
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, no, no, I can't, can't, can't with that. Thank you very much.

205
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:17.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>This is the problem. It's hard to get 2D platformers with combat that aren't Metroidvanias now,

206
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>right? Those don't really exist anymore, because they're just all Metroidvanias now.

207
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's kind of like how, yeah, when you're watching the trailer for gaming,

208
00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:30.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you're like, "Oh, this looks really good. Really good. Oh, it's rogue-like. OK, fine."

209
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And you're like, "I get that people love it, and I get that it's a trendy thing, blah, blah, blah."

210
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

211
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[LAUGHS] Yeah.

212
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>What's the problem with this like one specific thing about a genre of games that you don't like?

213
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:17.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But whatever. Fun times. I have finished up Donkey Kong Bonanza. I hit credits on that game.

214
00:30:18.579 --> 00:30:23.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I enjoyed that game. I am undecided as to whether I'm going to go back and try and,

215
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:28.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you know, 100% everything. There's many bananas to get and apparently there's a bunch of levels in

216
00:30:28.019 --> 00:30:32.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the postgame. I haven't done them, mainly because I completed it on

217
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:38.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the day that Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar arrived. So I was like, well, this is my next

218
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>week. We gave ourselves exactly a week and two days to get this to play through the game

219
00:30:43.619 --> 00:30:47.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>before the episode. So I was like, well, I'm not going to waste more time. Whether I go back to it

220
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:54.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>or not after this is an open question. We'll just see. I did enjoy it. I'm not a huge fan of the

221
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:59.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>camera. The camera could do with a bit of improvement. But other than that, I really,

222
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>really enjoyed it. It was good fun.

223
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:05.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I like just being big monkey smashing things, right?

224
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- Yes, yep.

225
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:11.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I don't want to say much. I think it depends on your opinion on things. I enjoyed

226
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:17.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it. I do know some people who did not enjoy the conclusion, and I understand why they

227
00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:25.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>didn't enjoy the conclusion, but it's very much a, yeah, personal taste thing. I do enjoy,

228
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>no matter what you think about it, I highly recommend avoiding the end spoiler, right?

229
00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like it is...

230
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You probably wouldn't guess it, and it's nice to not be spot-- and I didn't-- I wasn't

231
00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>spoiled for that. And I was like, "Oh, I was not expecting that!" So it's nice to get that.

232
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You don't get that very often.

233
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah. And it hit the point where on Monday last week, where I was like, "Oh,

234
00:32:54.819 --> 00:33:00.259
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I feel like I'm so close. I'm just gonna do the bare minimum on each of these levels just to get

235
00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:02.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to the end now, I wasn't

236
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you know trying to get extra bananas and stuff like that because it's like I can I just I need

237
00:33:07.299 --> 00:33:12.099
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to get to the end here before I play Grand Bazaar because I can't guarantee that I'll

238
00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:20.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>ever come back to it. I might but I can't guarantee it you know. But yeah no I enjoyed it and I guess

239
00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:24.259
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>we'll see and other than that I've just been playing obviously Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar

240
00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:33.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that's pretty much it. Oh and Pokemon Go obviously but that's just life.

241
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:41.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Absolutely. All right let's I know what you released last month so this is where we go

242
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:47.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>through all the games that released last month. So in August we had quite a few releases.

243
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:56.259
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So we had Firefly Village, Herdling, Discounty, Moonlight in Garland,

244
00:33:57.059 --> 00:34:02.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>of course Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar and then we had three early accesses released.

245
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:08.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Abyss New Dawn, Out and About and Super Farming Boy. Many games.

246
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:21.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I have not. August is a busy month for me. July and August are both busy months for me so

247
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:27.219
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I haven't. I do think I'm probably going to play Firefly Village. I'm intrigued by it.

248
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>we will see. It's always hard.

249
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:40.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to know. I want to play discounty at some point, and probably super farming by, but

250
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:45.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>probably not in early access, so. I presume you've not played any of these other than

251
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Grand Bazaar. Have you heard of any of these?

252
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:06.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Firefly Village has got good reviews on Steam. It's not a huge game, but all of the people

253
00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:10.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that have played it, they seem to be enjoying it. So I'm always intrigued when something

254
00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:16.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that just looks like a standard farming sim actually has good reviews. I had that with

255
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Fields of Mystery last year. I was like, "Oh, people are actually liking this one. I guess

256
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:52.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And yeah, it'll be interesting to see whether it is just Stardew clone or whether it's doing

257
00:35:52.039 --> 00:35:54.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>something else.

258
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:59.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it's hard to know just by looking at it, because obviously the thing that they're trying

259
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.219
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to sell you on is the fact that "hey, you like Stardew, you like us" and the kind of

260
00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:06.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>other stuff is hidden elsewhere.

261
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I'll probably have to play it to find out.

262
00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:12.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Shocking.

263
00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:22.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All right, so into the news then, there's a few pieces of news this year, this episode.

264
00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:31.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>First off, we have Sunhaven have announced that 2.0 and 2.5, those updates are now out

265
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on the Switch version.

266
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I believe that means the Switch version is up to date with the Steam version.

267
00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:39.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Not many games get that.

268
00:36:42.019 --> 00:36:43.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So that's good.

269
00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:49.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's another game that's on my list that I want to play at some point.

270
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Will I?

271
00:36:50.019 --> 00:36:50.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Who knows?

272
00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:59.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's RPG farming game with magic.

273
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I mean, it's been out for quite a while.

274
00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's possible you have been and then.

275
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:19.820
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Kind of disappeared like they when did they when when did they first kick start.

276
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh goodness too many updates to go and find that out. I think it might have been 20.

277
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, well, that's not when they released, but yeah, yeah.

278
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:40.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So September 2020 was when their Kickstarter went live,

279
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:44.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and I think they released maybe 22, was there early access or something like that?

280
00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:48.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Anyway, it doesn't matter.

281
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It is there.

282
00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Next, we have Opidum, Opidum.

283
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.099
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They have released their 1.1 update.

284
00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I won't go through the details of that,

285
00:37:59.619 --> 00:38:01.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>because it's probably very specific to whether

286
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you've played the game, but if you have played

287
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:09.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the game and you wanted an update, there you go.

288
00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:11.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's got some some new stuff.

289
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.099
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it looks quite...

290
00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:17.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

291
00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:22.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's one of those things where you're like, yeah,

292
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:23.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>great, new totems.

293
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>What do the totems do?

294
00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:26.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You have to play the game to find that out.

295
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That has with everything.

296
00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:35.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But if you've been playing that game and you were waiting

297
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>for an update to get back into it, there you go, you've got one.

298
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Speaking of updates, we have an upcoming

299
00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:47.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>announcement of the next Disney Dreamlight Valley expansion.

300
00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So this will be another paid update.

301
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So they've done their paid updates and their free update.

302
00:38:53.659 --> 00:38:55.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The expansions are their paid updates.

303
00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And this one is going to be called Wish Blossom Ranch.

304
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And in the picture, we have Snow White, Tinker Bell.

305
00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:08.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And is that the horse from Tangled?

306
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>No, that's that's the Tangled horse.

307
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, Maximus.

308
00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:23.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't know whether horses are new to the game.

309
00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:27.179
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't remember there being horses before, so maybe that's a brand new feature.

310
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>>> Yes, there we go. There you go.

311
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:09.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on then. What are they? Frozen is one of the few Disney films I've not seen. No, there

312
00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:10.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>What are horses?

313
00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:11.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There are three horses in Frozen, apparently.

314
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I've not seen Frozen, so...

315
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Uh, yeah, well, I mean.

316
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.179
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They did it for the last expansion as well, for the announcement of that.

317
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's not brand new, but yeah.

318
00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:52.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Anyway, that's happening on the 15th of October.

319
00:40:52.539 --> 00:40:54.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So over a month away.

320
00:40:54.460 --> 00:41:00.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That is wild, giving us over a month, a month and a half's notice.

321
00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:04.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>In fact, when this happens, the next day,

322
00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Pokemon Z comes out

323
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's how far away that is.

324
00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:25.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, well, at least it's the day before and not the day after. Let's put it that way.

325
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:37.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And our final piece of news this episode is that Concerned Dave announced at the end of the

326
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:45.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>concert for the new tour that they're doing, Symphony of Seasons, he announced that they are

327
00:41:46.099 --> 00:41:52.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>going to be releasing a 1.7 update for Stardew Valley to shock and surprise. Nobody ever expected

328
00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:59.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that he would do another update after saying that the last three updates were the last one.

329
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:28.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Yeah, it's quite something. Look, if he's happy, that's the important thing, and

330
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:34.320
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>he clearly wants to do it. I know he said a bunch of stuff about the expectations and

331
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:41.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>stuff, but surely he must know that he could just stop, right?

332
00:42:41.039 --> 00:42:43.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>interesting thing is he posted on the haunted chocolatiers.

333
00:42:44.000 --> 00:43:10.280
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>He says "You might be wondering if Concerned Ape is working on Stardew Valley 1.7. Will

334
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that cause haunted chocolatier to take longer?"

335
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The answer may be a little...

336
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then basically he goes in to talk about how he is less and less being the key person

337
00:43:21.519 --> 00:43:30.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>in the game. It sounds like he is the kind of source of ideas and of stuff and he says he wants

338
00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:39.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to touch everything but not do everything, which sounds like a fair way to put it.

339
00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:43.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like, he wants to be involved in everything, but not do--

340
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:53.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>doing everything so that he doesn't kind of become the required linchpin for everything to be done and therefore--

341
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, that would be really, I'd be fascinated to see whether he's done everything that would

342
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>be needed for that, right? Like, do they have, like, the logins to, you know,

343
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:29.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the SwitchE store and stuff like that, right? Like, could they actually do that? Fascinating.

344
00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:33.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

345
00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:38.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>For sure.

346
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

347
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:44.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think we have to come to that conclusion. So one of the things he says in this blog post is,

348
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:49.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>"I didn't have to make a 1.7 update for Stardew Valley, but the game is so popular, in fact,

349
00:45:49.539 --> 00:45:54.179
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it's still growing, that it's hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can

350
00:45:54.179 --> 00:46:00.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>be improved." So it does sound like it's not, he feels like people are putting expectations on him

351
00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:06.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to do that, but it's like his brain can't stop going, "This needs to be improved."

352
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:12.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>"This needs to be improved. I want to do this." And the internal pressure of "I want to make

353
00:46:12.659 --> 00:46:18.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the best thing possible" is completely different from "Everyone expects me to make another update."

354
00:46:20.579 --> 00:46:25.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I think we just have to live with that and just assume that he is happy,

355
00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:31.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>because he wouldn't be continuing to do that if he wasn't. We've talked forever about he has

356
00:46:32.179 --> 00:46:36.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>more money than he knows what to do is and therefore you can do whatever he wants.

357
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:45.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And he's choosing to do both of these things and that's fine. He even says, with our no release

358
00:46:45.139 --> 00:46:50.179
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>date approach to the 1.7 update, it's not certain when that time will come. It might even be after

359
00:46:50.179 --> 00:46:56.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Haunted Chocolatier comes out, no guarantees though. So that'll be interesting if we end up

360
00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:01.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>getting Haunted Chocolatier first, but I guess that means that he doesn't even expect to stop

361
00:47:01.139 --> 00:47:03.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>working on Stardew after Haunted Chocolatier's released as well, right?

362
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And we will keep coming back to it every update.

363
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Interesting. I wonder, look, if Greta Gerwig is involved, I'll watch it.

364
00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:27.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Who am I kidding? I'll watch it either way, right?

365
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.679
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- All right.

366
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:41.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's now that time.

367
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.599
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>We're going to talk about "Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar."

368
00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:49.480
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So this is, as mentioned earlier on,

369
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>a remake of a DS game, "Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar."

370
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You said that you didn't play it when it came out,

371
00:47:56.519 --> 00:47:58.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but you've gone back and played it since then.

372
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Before talking about the new game,

373
00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:03.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>what did you think of the old game?

374
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah, that's fine. We don't need to go through everything. I just thought it was

375
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:47.320
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>interesting to cover. I checked so the original Friends of Miniro Times, not like the More

376
00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:54.599
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Friends or whatever the other ones were called, that came out in 2003 in Japan and Grand Bazaar

377
00:50:54.599 --> 00:51:05.639
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>came out in 2008. So five years difference. There were multiple between, so there was

378
00:51:05.639 --> 00:51:06.639
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>friends.

379
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Do you mean specifically on the handheld console, because obviously they were releasing

380
00:51:12.519 --> 00:51:16.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on both, because there was A Wonderful Life and Another Wonderful Life, but they were

381
00:51:16.719 --> 00:51:26.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>obviously GameCube. There was Harvest Moon DS and Island of Happiness. Yeah, so I think

382
00:51:26.239 --> 00:51:30.639
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>DS cute was just the DS, but with a girl, like with all the other ones they'd done up

383
00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:37.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to that point. Yeah, there was Island of Happiness.

384
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:50.400
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They did so many games in this time period. And then there was Sunshine Islands. It looks

385
00:51:50.400 --> 00:52:00.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>like it was, oh, that looks like it was also the girl version of Island of Happiness. Don't

386
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:04.099
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Don't get to be happy if you're a girl, you get to have sunshine.

387
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:18.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it looks like Grand Bazaar might have been the first one that didn't do that. Could

388
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:24.179
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you choose in Grand Bazaar? Well, there you go. Yeah, so that was the first one where

389
00:52:24.179 --> 00:52:33.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they didn't have a separate game for the girl. Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure, well, they did

390
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:40.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>with a wonderful life. Obviously, they had another wonderful life. Apparently, they did.

391
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:51.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They released one for PSP called Harvest Moon Boy and Girl, which was back to nature. It

392
00:52:51.619 --> 00:53:01.599
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>was back to nature, apparently. And then they had Animal Parade. Oh, they had Tree of Tranquility.

393
00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:10.480
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Tree of Tranquility looks... What is this one? That was Wii, yes. Oh, it looks like it was

394
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:15.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>back to nature. Wait, what? No, no, I clicked on the wrong thing there. Sorry. There's too

395
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:27.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>many games. I reckon this one did have both, because the box art has the two characters

396
00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:33.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on the front. Yeah, there we go. You could choose either. So there we go. Tree of Tranquility,

397
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I guess then, was the first one, not Grand Bazaar. But Tree of Tranquility came out in

398
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.480
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>in 2007.

399
00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:50.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So, yes, yeah, it's absolutely, it's just wild how many games they released at that point, right?

400
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They just threw them out every, every year.

401
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>for sure. Okay so, should we talk about the game that we're here to talk about then?

402
00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:45.679
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I want to start off with, before we get into the details of things,

403
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:56.320
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>this, I think, is my favourite story of season's game.

404
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.559
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, that's the thing, and I don't have that nostalgia, and the remake was fine.

405
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:33.320
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I enjoyed it, but it definitely felt more dated.

406
00:55:33.519 --> 00:55:34.679
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think what they did with Friends of

407
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.320
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Menroton is they tried to keep it like the original, just update the graphics,

408
00:55:39.519 --> 00:55:44.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>essentially, that when we talked about it, I'm pretty sure that that missed a lot

409
00:55:44.719 --> 00:55:48.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>of like quality of life improvements that games have had since then.

410
00:55:49.159 --> 00:55:52.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Whereas it feels like they really didn't do that here.

411
00:55:53.159 --> 00:55:56.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It felt as if they were like, let's make a new game,

412
00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:01.599
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but with the same characters and story and town and concepts.

413
00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But make it as if we were making it brand new.

414
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

415
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:46.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, let's let's go through specific mechanics and and if there's stuff you want to talk about with the original as well, we can do that in those individual things.

416
00:56:46.579 --> 00:56:57.820
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I want to talk about the movement first, because I think this is the first game that I've played since Fae Farm that I felt has actually tried to do something fun with movement in a farming game.

417
00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:02.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I will say it's not as good as the Fae Farm movement.

418
00:57:02.139 --> 00:57:03.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Did you play Fae Farm at all?

419
00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Yeah.

420
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:28.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>My summary of that game is I loved the movement, I hated the characters, and that is such an important part of these games that I felt like it was a an unforgivable sin for me.

421
00:57:31.659 --> 00:57:38.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But yeah, but my coming out of that game, I was like this movement is so good, I want every game to do this now.

422
00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:44.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like, it was just so fluid and so fun, like, okay, I don't want Stardew to do it, right?

423
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:54.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Stardew is its own unique thing and I want it to continue to be what it is, and when I go back to it, I'll feel a little bit like, oh, I wish I could move better, but it is still what it is and you have to enjoy it for what it is.

424
00:57:56.099 --> 00:58:05.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But just being able to, like, even if you just ignore like the the glider, right, let's just talk about the jumping.

425
00:58:06.099 --> 00:58:09.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>being able to walk up to our fence.

426
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:15.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and jump over the fence is so good being able to walk up to a ledge and jump up that

427
00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:21.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>just amazing the placement of they have these bouncy barrels where if you're in the town square

428
00:58:21.539 --> 00:58:26.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and you walk up you can bounce up a bouncy barrel over this cliff and then bounce up another one

429
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:32.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>over to another cliff and bam you're at the entrance to your farm like that in and of itself

430
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:38.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>is is just a game changer not having to like walk the longest direction to get to any

431
00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:45.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>um but also then they add a glider which means that you can depending on the day because the

432
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:49.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the movement of the gliders dependent on the weather which will i'm sure we can talk about

433
00:58:49.699 --> 00:58:55.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but you can like jump off the cliff and like glide all the way to the other side of the map

434
00:58:55.300 --> 00:59:02.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it's so smooth um I think my my one problem with it is that there are especially in the mountains

435
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:08.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>a lot of invisible walls that I wish weren't there that ruin it a little bit in that area

436
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:39.559
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's not, as far as I'm aware, there's no swimming, but you do get a double jump,

437
01:00:39.559 --> 01:00:42.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>which makes it makes it so easy to get over things.

438
01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:56.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>OK, interesting. No, you have to buy the double jump from the town mayor.

439
01:01:01.719 --> 01:01:07.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But it's really good, though, the double jump because, yeah, basically, since I've got that,

440
01:01:07.719 --> 01:01:12.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>there's only one scenario that I've ever fallen in the water now, and that's a very specific

441
01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:17.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>scenario, which is there's a specific area that you can only get to if you bounce off a specific

442
01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>big barrel in.

443
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:32.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like the two-arrow wind, and if you bounce off it in the one-arrow wind, you can't reach the ledge, but you also can't get back to land because the wind is pushing you away, and therefore you go in the water.

444
01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:42.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I still try every time I try and get up there because that's like where the one or a calcium node is that I want to get to.

445
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so I try every time, but I've still not managed to do it in anything other than two-star wind.

446
01:01:49.239 --> 01:02:01.400
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But be that as it may, yes, it would be nice to be able to swim, but when you get the double jump, I've not really felt like I'm annoyed by that anymore.

447
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's pretty, pretty reliable.

448
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:26.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that's an it was an interesting decision that was yeah

449
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, I I

450
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.179
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I don't know. I think I think it's just so

451
01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:05.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>My theory about it is the progression. I don't know how far in the game. Are you like, where are you time-wise?

452
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:16.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, okay, have you done a couple of weeks you've done a couple of bazaars, okay

453
01:03:20.539 --> 01:03:22.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's not hard to no one else tries hard

454
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[Laughs]

455
01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:34.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah, also herbs work as flowers in the flower festival as well

456
01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the

457
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.900
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>progression in this game is

458
01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:43.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So much faster than any other farming game I've played

459
01:03:44.219 --> 01:03:49.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like I think on my third bazaar I sold like a hundred and twenty two grand

460
01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:53.519
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>which is just so much money for Spring 1.

461
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Um...

462
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's the selling point of this game, it's what makes this game different.

463
01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You're the chosen one.

464
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It will only-- the thought bubble will only be things you do have in your inventory, by the way.

465
01:05:50.099 --> 01:05:56.980
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because I'm now halfway through fall of year one, so I've done, what is that, 10 bazaars,

466
01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and not once have I had someone put up a thought bubble that wasn't something that I had.

467
01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:06.019
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And when you have obscure things, they just happen to have the thought bubble of an obscure

468
01:06:06.019 --> 01:06:11.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>thing that you have in your inventory, so. Yeah.

469
01:06:14.659 --> 01:06:21.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Exactly, yeah. Or the first time that I accidentally put an oral calcium in my store,

470
01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>suddenly somebody wants one. Do you happen to have this, by the way?

471
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:23.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think, yeah, two, ten till two, ten till two and three till seven.

472
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:59.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I love that you took till 6.57 to be like, "huh, are we doing a second shift at all?"

473
01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:06.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm pretty sure there is a notification that says it's time for the second one, but it's

474
01:08:06.059 --> 01:08:10.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>quite subtle, and I think it's only there for a couple of seconds. So if you were reading

475
01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>something that somebody says and you didn't notice that there was something popping up,

476
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it would be quite easy to miss that. So yeah, it would be nice if it was more obvious,

477
01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:24.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>because they do the same thing in the morning. If you're not at the Bazaar yet,

478
01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:27.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it will pop up and say, "Oh, it's 10 o'clock. The first Bazaar shift has opened."

479
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:39.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I am probably well known on this podcast for hating shops, running a shop in a game.

480
01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:45.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I didn't like it in Suguju Island, but I didn't like anything about that game.

481
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I wasn't a huge... I'm not a fan of it in Ooblets.

482
01:08:49.979 --> 01:08:52.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, what was the other one that had one recently?

483
01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, I'm going to forget, forgotten the name of the game,

484
01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but it was our game of the year one year.

485
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Why have I forgotten the name of it?

486
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, there we go.

487
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Mineko's Night Market was fine, but I didn't actively hate it,

488
01:09:07.659 --> 01:09:09.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but I didn't feel like it added anything.

489
01:09:09.819 --> 01:09:12.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And generally, I find that the way that these shops are,

490
01:09:12.619 --> 01:09:14.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's just a more

491
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:24.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>drawn-out way of selling your stuff, but this game does something different.

492
01:09:24.699 --> 01:09:28.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I want to figure that out during this conversation, what that is.

493
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:33.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But there's something about this that is

494
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>not addictive, but like it makes you want to do it again.

495
01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like the the rust, rushed nature of it, I think.

496
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the, the, the try.

497
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>trying to figure out what it is that people want and putting them out, they're trying

498
01:09:48.699 --> 01:09:52.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to get through the amount of time and sell everything within the time.

499
01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:57.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The fact that there is an advantage to doing that and you in doing the shop at the bazaar

500
01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:02.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>in that you make more money than if you just sell it to the general store.

501
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think it's like you can by default, it's like 25% more, but you can increase it even

502
01:10:07.699 --> 01:10:11.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>more with like upgrades to your bazaar and stuff like that.

503
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you can make a lot of money and very quickly.

504
01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:23.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't know what happened, but I'm very happy about what happened.

505
01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:35.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And all of that put together is very satisfying. And also the fact that most of the expensive

506
01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:41.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>things that you would spend money on, you do at the same time. So it's like my kind of general

507
01:10:42.619 --> 01:10:45.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>cycle for the bazaar has been. You go for...

508
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you know, 10, you do your first one, you sell as much as you can during the first section.

509
01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:55.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then during the break, you go and figure out what it is you want to buy with the, you know,

510
01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>10 grand, 50 grand, 100 grand, whatever it is you've made. You go and figure out what it

511
01:11:00.939 --> 01:11:05.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>is you want to buy, whether you want the double jump or you want an extra field or whatever.

512
01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:12.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then you go into the second one, try and, you know, sell out. And I've not done a single week

513
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>where I didn't sell everything out, but I also didn't feel like...

514
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:22.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I had loads of extra time. It has worked very impressively in terms of just feeling like you

515
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:28.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>managed to do it just in time, but still managing to do everything, which is a very hard thing to

516
01:11:28.539 --> 01:11:34.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>do in games, just in general. And then it's like, "Okay, I've now got half an hour. Let me go and

517
01:11:34.859 --> 01:11:41.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>check what else there is. What was the last thing I wanted to buy?" But also combining that with

518
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:45.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>upgrades you can really only do weekly because of this now, right? Like your farm.

519
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:50.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Upgrades your house upgrades stuff like that. You can only do at the bazaar and you can only

520
01:11:50.779 --> 01:11:57.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>do one of them with each person. There's a few different bazaars stalls that open up that also

521
01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>do upgrades but with each stall you can only really do one upgrade. Kind of leads to this like

522
01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:10.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the progression feels both fast but also slow at the same time in and I don't dislike either of

523
01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:15.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>them. So like the first time I tried to do two upgrades to my farm it was like oh you've only

524
01:12:15.579 --> 01:12:20.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I was like oh that's really annoying but also I'm gonna be back here in a week. I can do it again

525
01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>then and I'll have more money then so you don't feel like the constant need to get money all the

526
01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:33.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>time because what are you gonna do with that money exactly on a Wednesday? So I really I was not

527
01:12:33.899 --> 01:12:37.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>expecting I was expecting to come into this conversation being I like the game but I really

528
01:12:37.659 --> 01:12:41.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>hate the bazaar and no I actually really like the bazaar and I don't get me wrong I don't want every

529
01:12:41.979 --> 01:12:45.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>game to have a shop, do not build a shop into your farming game.

530
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>still in general bad, but this is excellent. I love this game for what it is with the Bazaar.

531
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Off sugar dew island cough cough

532
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, yep.

533
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I can't remember.

534
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. And it's season, it's season long as well.

535
01:16:06.899 --> 01:16:08.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it tells you right at the beginning of the season.

536
01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:12.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you don't have like the, oh, I don't know what to do here.

537
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's like the season starts and it's like, oh, hey, these are the things that are trending this season.

538
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And you go, OK, cool. I'll go buy them.

539
01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:30.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Every single week I have sold everything between 5pm and 7pm. And I don't know if that

540
01:17:30.659 --> 01:17:36.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>is like just, I'm good at figuring out what I have and I'm just like, or whether like

541
01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:43.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I suspect the game is just like set up to do that. And if you do, and if you do, like

542
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:47.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Obviously, if you're not going to, let me give a quick explanation.

543
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:54.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You have a stall and you have a counter. You start off with, I think, three spaces

544
01:17:54.460 --> 01:18:01.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on the counter, is that right? Or is it four initially? I think it was three, yeah. I have

545
01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:07.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>two counters of four now, so it's hard to remember what it was two months ago. But yeah,

546
01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:13.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>so you start off with one counter of three spaces and you go up to a space and you press

547
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>X and you choose what item you want to go there. And it's like a

548
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:22.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>stack of one item. And you do that for all your spaces. And then people will come up and you've

549
01:18:22.619 --> 01:18:26.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>got like a bell to ring. So you ring the bell and that makes people notice that you're there.

550
01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Some of them will notice without you ringing the bell, but if you ring the bell, more people will

551
01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:36.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>notice and it's higher likelihood of someone noticing what you have. And then if they want

552
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>what you want, they'll come up and they'll ask for a certain amount and you press the

553
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:46.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>button once per item that they want. So if they say, I want 10 wheat, you press A 10 times and

554
01:18:47.579 --> 01:18:51.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>gives them everything. So you have to be on the ball because if they don't, like there's only a

555
01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:56.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>certain amount of time they'll wait. And if you don't come and do it, then they'll walk away.

556
01:18:56.859 --> 01:19:00.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you do have to be on the ball. And then when obviously when things run out, you have to

557
01:19:00.859 --> 01:19:05.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>replace them. And as we've discussed, some people will come and say, what about this? And they'll

558
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>show a little thought bubble with an item on it. So you can then switch out something you have for

559
01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:17.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>what they want and they will then come and buy that. So I think it's a combination

560
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:23.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>of both the game timing people so that if you do things well, you will sell everything,

561
01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:27.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but you still actually have to do it. Like it's not like things happen automatically.

562
01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:31.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so if you were just standing there or you miss a bunch of people, you probably wouldn't sell out.

563
01:19:31.579 --> 01:19:34.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But I think the good thing about that is because it's the way it's set up,

564
01:19:35.899 --> 01:19:42.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you feel satisfaction for doing something. So I feel like I'm actually doing something here.

565
01:19:42.619 --> 01:19:47.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>If I wasn't doing something, I wouldn't be making money, but if I'm doing it,

566
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:50.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>perfectly, I will sell everything out. It's the perfect balance.

567
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:08.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

568
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I think if you're if you're listening to this and you're thinking,

569
01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:05.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>oh, I don't like the idea of the stress of that, this is we're talking

570
01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:10.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>probably about five minutes of gameplay in about what, two to two and a half

571
01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>hours, depending on how, how much of each day you play, like this doesn't

572
01:21:14.899 --> 01:21:18.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>happen very, like I've been, I've been playing a lot of the game.

573
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:22.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I've been doing roughly about a week in game every, every day physically.

574
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And yeah, it's like, it's five minutes at the end of the day.

575
01:21:26.739 --> 01:21:27.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I've been doing is this bizarre.

576
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:35.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like the game other than that is very much a cozy cottage core farming game, right?

577
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It is, it is standard in most of the ways that you would expect.

578
01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:44.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And we'll talk about all the other mechanics after this, but don't be,

579
01:21:44.619 --> 01:21:48.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>don't be worried if you're like, I don't want the stress of that because it is

580
01:21:48.739 --> 01:21:54.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>very fast and it's very small amount of time and it's not hard to do.

581
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:57.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You just need to go, right now is the time I'm doing bizarre.

582
01:21:58.619 --> 01:22:01.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm going to focus on this and I will get it done.

583
01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:06.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And if you, if you, if you press the right buttons, you will get it done.

584
01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It is not super stressful.

585
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:14.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's not a lot of time and it is surprisingly satisfying in many.

586
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:24.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah. They just walk away. It doesn't change anything. I think there are positive

587
01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:30.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>benefits if you sell to your... The villagers come, but there's also tourists that come

588
01:23:30.619 --> 01:23:34.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to it as well. So most of the people you don't know, but there are people who you don't know

589
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>as well. And you get like a friendship.

590
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:41.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Boost with the people you sell to, if they're your friends, but I've not seen any of them being...

591
01:23:50.899 --> 01:23:55.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I've not seen anything about that. You do have a bunch of things that ups the amount of money

592
01:23:55.220 --> 01:24:01.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you get, but I've not seen anything specifically about that. That would be funny. That would be

593
01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:06.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>funny. I do have one complaint about the Bazaar. It's probably...

594
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:13.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>not something you've encountered. When you get a second counter, it is a 45-degree angle to the

595
01:24:13.699 --> 01:24:23.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>other counter. And you probably are away... like away from... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So like away

596
01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:30.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>from the other people, like towards the stairs and your stall.

597
01:24:34.739 --> 01:24:36.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Correct, yeah.

598
01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:45.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But no, my problem with this is not that.

599
01:24:45.979 --> 01:24:50.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It is how the controls work combined with that, in that the controls work differently

600
01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>when you're in bizarre mode.

601
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You're basically just moving left and right.

602
01:24:54.039 --> 01:24:58.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can, I think, move towards the stall, but it doesn't feel the same as normal.

603
01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It feels really weird, so don't do that.

604
01:25:00.779 --> 01:25:05.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But the problem with that is then, when the second counter's angled away, and then you

605
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:14.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>can't move on as angled away as well, or towards, I guess, your two-dimensional movement suddenly

606
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:19.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>becomes three-dimensional again, but you're controlling it two-dimensionally.

607
01:25:19.439 --> 01:25:25.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you're moving left and right to move left and right, but also move backwards.

608
01:25:25.899 --> 01:25:34.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so I frequently can't figure out the right place to be to sell when I'm on my angled

609
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>counter.

610
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:42.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I feel like they could have just had them all in a single line, and that would have made it so

611
01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:47.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>much better, because it's just trying to position yourself on the angled one is really difficult,

612
01:25:47.699 --> 01:25:54.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>because you're moving left and right to move backwards. Which just feels so wrong, and also

613
01:25:54.979 --> 01:26:01.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>trying-- it's like, did you play Crash Bandicoot? So jumping in Crash Bandicoot forwards and

614
01:26:01.619 --> 01:26:06.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>backwards. Terrible, right? You would always fall down trying to figure it out.

615
01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:10.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>How to position yourself in the right way. It feels like that. Where you're, like,

616
01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:14.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>moving a little bit and, like, "Oh no, the button press isn't selling just now, right?

617
01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:17.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I need to move a different way." Which way? Is it forwards or backwards? I can't quite tell.

618
01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So that is just a bit weird.

619
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, which is probably good in overall, right, because you want to be fast.

620
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think I think you get used to that, but I'm not getting used to the anger.

621
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I am not seeing any controller sensitivity settings at all.

622
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:11.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's really my like, we're just a warning to listeners.

623
01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:15.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I suspect we're about to get real nitpicky with the rest of this episode, because this

624
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>is what happens when we love when we like a game is we get real nitpicky about really

625
01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:23.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>tiny things that really don't matter, except that they really frustrate you when you're

626
01:28:23.899 --> 01:28:29.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>playing the game. So that, I think, is what I would say about that. I really like the

627
01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:33.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>bizarre other than that one one thing.

628
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:45.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I do like how most of the stuff that you buy, obviously you do have the general story, you can go buy seeds normally, but I'm not really buying seeds there for a number of reasons, which we'll probably get into.

629
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:59.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But I like how it's like this focused time of like this is the time when you buy and sell and the rest of the week is not and it actually makes it instead of less cozy, it makes it more cozy because the rest of the week you are much more chill.

630
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[both laughing]

631
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, not relaxing, but it's much more chill because you're just doing your dailies every day then.

632
01:29:24.439 --> 01:29:26.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All right, anything else about the bazaar that we need to talk about?

633
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:57.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Field and house expansions. So you can add on, so you start off with one...

634
01:29:58.819 --> 01:30:01.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, maybe we should talk about that in the farming section. Get to your question.

635
01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:24.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>This is what this is what this is what two to three is.

636
01:30:24.779 --> 01:30:26.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Two to three don't go elsewhere.

637
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>This is your two p.m. to three p.m.

638
01:30:28.619 --> 01:30:31.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>between the shifts.

639
01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's when you go to the other stalls and buy stuff.

640
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:22.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think it's just a fixed list of them, because they're all opening up in very specific places.

641
01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:27.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I suspect once you get... So yeah, the other thing I should talk about is you

642
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:33.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>upgrade the Bazaar over time. So there's different Bazaar ranks, and the whole story of the game is,

643
01:31:33.439 --> 01:31:37.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>"Oh, we used to be this Grand Bazaar, and now we're this tiny little village Bazaar,

644
01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:42.800
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>we want to become the Grand Bazaar again." So there's like seven different rankings of Bazaar,

645
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and ask.

646
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>After each Bazaar, there's like, "Oh, this is what your ranking currently is."

647
01:31:49.119 --> 01:31:54.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And when you rank up by selling things and by opening new stalls.

648
01:31:54.319 --> 01:31:59.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I think the first one is like after like 50,000, after you've sold 50,000 and you've

649
01:31:59.279 --> 01:32:05.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>opened one extra stall, then you go up to the next rank and it just increases.

650
01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:12.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So the one I'm currently on is I need to do a million and open four more stalls.

651
01:32:12.119 --> 01:32:14.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and I think it's, I think it's specific.

652
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:23.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The ones that are in total, so you can do, like, when I was on the first level, I think there were two different people I could do a stall with.

653
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But once you do one and unlock the next one, that other person, you can still open their stall.

654
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I suspect if you want to get to Grand Bazaar, I suspect you'll have to have every stall open.

655
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't think there'll be any extra ones.

656
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.720
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think it is limited space, but I also think it's limited stalls. I think it just is what it is,

657
01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:54.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you're unlocking things and progressing, and it's just what order you do them in, really.

658
01:32:57.119 --> 01:33:02.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So yeah, there's like an incentive, because some of them will be other people that come to the

659
01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:08.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>village to do that, but some of them will be villagers, and they'll be like, "Oh, I've thought

660
01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:13.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>about opening a stall." And they will generally be like replacing

661
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the-- because like in the village, there's only really two shops. There's the general store,

662
01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:24.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>which you can basically just-- you buy seeds from, and you can buy like fertilizer, and fodder, and

663
01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:30.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>stuff like that. And then there's the cafe, where you can buy food. That's basically it. And every

664
01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:37.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>other shop that you would normally get in a farming game will be a bizarre stall that you have to

665
01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:41.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>unlock. And there's been other ones as well, like I just opened a recycling center, where you can

666
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:43.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>antique stuff to be recycled and get.

667
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Other things from which is is a fun additional one there's a clothing one there's a obviously

668
01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>there has to be a decorations one for your your bazaar stall because you the decorations

669
01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:01.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on the bazaar define your power-ups and they give you like other ways to increase the amount

670
01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>of money and stuff like that. There's also one that the harvest sprites open a stall as well

671
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:58.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got, yeah, yeah, I unlocked all my backpack

672
01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:04.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>upgrades on like the third week or something, it was like, I need to do this straight away.

673
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:16.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>OK, cool. Let's go through the other kind of standard mechanics then.

674
01:35:16.579 --> 01:35:17.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So let's talk about farming.

675
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I was going to start talking about this and then realized I should probably talk about it in this section.

676
01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:27.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You start off with a, what is it, six by nine plot.

677
01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:41.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it's pretty standard mostly in that, you know, you till the land, you plant the seed, you water, you fertilize, it grows, you harvest.

678
01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:46.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But the interesting thing about this is in how the jumping works, right.

679
01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you.

680
01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So in other farming games, you start off and you do one.

681
01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:07.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>One button press does one action and then you increase that by like upgrading your tool and like holding the button down or it just automatically does more or whatever.

682
01:36:07.539 --> 01:36:11.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>In this game, you increase by jumping, so instead of pressing...

683
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:17.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>A to tail the land, if you jump and press A, you will tail three plots.

684
01:36:17.819 --> 01:36:22.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then when you upgrade the whole, it will then go to nine on your jump.

685
01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:28.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then you also, you'll love this, when you get the double jump, that increases it further.

686
01:36:28.539 --> 01:36:37.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you jump once and it will do nine, you double jump and it will do like a three by nine,

687
01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:39.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>or whatever it is, like it depends on what level it is, right?

688
01:36:48.000 --> 01:37:13.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it's fun. And it also gets to like the point where like, so I, the seed sewing, I think you can only do three by three at most, which is fair enough because like I don't know about you, but I think of the plots of land as being like essentially six, three by three plots, like I'm I'm always doing things in threes on this.

689
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But...

690
01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.199
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Absolutely.

691
01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They are, yeah.

692
01:37:24.399 --> 01:37:29.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But also all of the upgrades, they're always three by something.

693
01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:42.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so they're actually doing this thing that I hate, or not that I hate, the opposite of what I hate in almost every farming game, which is where you start off doing things in a certain configuration and you're like, "Oh, now it's uneven."

694
01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:48.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Right? Because I started doing three and now I've upgraded it and I'm now doing four watering at once, so I have to change my...

695
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>configuration of things, whereas this is always threes.

696
01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:56.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's like three by one and then three by three and then three by, I think it's three by four or five.

697
01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's not perfect, but it's always three.

698
01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you can always like do, you can keep the same configuration each time.

699
01:38:04.399 --> 01:38:12.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I'm now at the point where I'm just doing three waterings per chunk, just up each of the lines.

700
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:17.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm doing the three by six is the most efficient for me just now.

701
01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:23.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I'm hoping if I upgrade it might allow me to do two rather than three.

702
01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I really like that.

703
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:46.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah

704
01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah

705
01:38:55.500 --> 01:39:10.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, so this is where I was going with the sewing. So you've got the jump and then the

706
01:39:10.699 --> 01:39:16.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>double jump. When you double jump and sew, you do this weird little gymnastics thing

707
01:39:16.739 --> 01:39:24.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>where you flip up and you go legs above head and you spin around. It's such an incredible

708
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>animation that they've put in.

709
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:29.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So much effort into it and I have no idea why, but I love it.

710
01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's like I'm doing gymnastics to sow these seeds.

711
01:39:33.619 --> 01:39:34.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's fantastic.

712
01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, it's ultra-sewing when it's the double jump.

713
01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:14.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[laughter]

714
01:40:48.000 --> 01:41:00.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But it's also just fun because if I can jump in a game, I will traverse by jumping, because

715
01:41:00.479 --> 01:41:01.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that's just it's just more fun.

716
01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But also in this game, I'm pretty sure it's the fastest way to travel is by jumping.

717
01:41:06.319 --> 01:41:13.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The horse, there is a horse in the game that you can get, super slow.

718
01:41:13.319 --> 01:41:17.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like I think at its top speed, it is about as fast as you running and jumping, but you

719
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.199
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>have to speed up.

720
01:41:20.199 --> 01:41:23.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's the worst horse I've ever seen in a farm.

721
01:41:23.319 --> 01:41:24.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>No, that's not true.

722
01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Second worst horse, the worst horse would be in Harvest Moon, Home Sweet Home, where you

723
01:41:27.439 --> 01:41:33.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>couldn't even take out the pasture, but that's a whole other conversation.

724
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But like you start off slower than walking speed and you have you speed up.

725
01:41:38.239 --> 01:41:41.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so like, and then if you hit anything, you slow down again, it's not worth it.

726
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:46.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I got a free horse and I went and gave him away because I was like, this is useless.

727
01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I do not want this feature.

728
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>This is such a waste of time.

729
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then the horse just ends up eating all your food instead.

730
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Sure.

731
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All right, let's talk about the animals then, shall we?

732
01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:13.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's mostly standard, like with almost everything in this game.

733
01:42:14.159 --> 01:42:16.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's mostly what you would expect.

734
01:42:16.479 --> 01:42:23.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You get animals, you put them in, you give them food, you pet them and they give you stuff.

735
01:42:23.439 --> 01:42:27.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The have you have you experienced the animals much?

736
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:48.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Okay. That's fair.

737
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Nice.

738
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:26.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So the one thing that's interesting about this to me is so in most games to get the

739
01:43:26.399 --> 01:43:29.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>animals outside, you'd go ring a bell and they'd all walk outside and then you'd ring

740
01:43:29.479 --> 01:43:34.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>a bell and they all go back inside to get them out. You've got two options. One is you

741
01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:39.199
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>literally grab them and push them outside. Actually, there's three options. So that's

742
01:43:39.199 --> 01:43:47.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>one. You can literally grab them and then push them. Two is you like ring a bell.

743
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Ring a bell and they follow you, but it's a really awkward one where you have to like

744
01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.720
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>ring it inside and then wait till they all go outside and then you go outside. Otherwise

745
01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:03.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they don't go outside. So neither of those are ideal. The third option is dogs. You can

746
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:09.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>train your dogs to herd your animals outside automatically. So I have two dogs now. I have

747
01:44:09.319 --> 01:44:16.800
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>a Shiba Inu and I have a collie and they both currently herd two.

748
01:44:17.479 --> 01:44:22.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, thank you. They both currently herd two animals outside, but as you train them up,

749
01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:28.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they will increase. And so they now automatically, I don't have to do anything. I get up, I go

750
01:44:28.359 --> 01:44:35.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and grab the eggs and milk and wool and I give them all a little brush and then at like,

751
01:44:35.079 --> 01:44:38.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think it's like 7am or something, my dogs will just go take them outside and then they'll

752
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>bring them back inside before night. It's great. I love it.

753
01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:59.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, because I've always been annoyed that there's never an automatic thing for getting

754
01:44:59.939 --> 01:45:04.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>them in and out, because I just don't bother in most games, because it's just like, because

755
01:45:04.899 --> 01:45:09.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the problem isn't getting them out, the problem is remembering to put them back in at night.

756
01:45:09.579 --> 01:45:13.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And if you like faint, because I faint in this game all the time, because I'm really

757
01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:17.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>bad at checking my stamina, if you faint, there's nothing you can do.

758
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:30.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

759
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it's great. I really like.

760
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Phishing, have you done fishing?

761
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>What are your feelings on it?

762
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because every game has a different fishing minigame.

763
01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>What are your thoughts on this one?

764
01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's easy until you get a hard fish.

765
01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Then you have to be perfect.

766
01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:35.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And if you're not perfect,

767
01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

768
01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:58.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yes. Yeah, I know I know exactly what you mean. Yeah

769
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:28.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on the commands. So let's do a quick explanation. So you've got a number of, like, fish icons.

770
01:47:28.439 --> 01:47:35.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And for every fish icon, you have to do a directional input on your analog stick. And

771
01:47:35.039 --> 01:47:39.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it will say, like, oh, do up. So you do up. And then you do left. You do left. And they're

772
01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:44.720
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>timed. So you, like, have a specific number within a certain time. And there's also a

773
01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.800
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>tamer running down. If you do one wrong, the tamer jumps down a big chunk.

774
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:58.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Obviously, some of the fish have like three fish icons, so they're super easy to do, but some of them have up to like 15 fish icons.

775
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:11.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so if you were to do one wrong, you're not catching that fish, because you have to do it as quickly as you can, as soon as they appear, and perfectly, otherwise you will run out of time.

776
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's fine.

777
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:40.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I'm not saying I'm losing all the time, but there have been a few that have failed

778
01:48:40.079 --> 01:48:46.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>just because of that, right? Like you're just, you've muck up one and that's it, you're stuffed

779
01:48:46.359 --> 01:48:53.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on the hard ones. But I think this feels like maybe the best balance I've played of between

780
01:48:53.279 --> 01:48:57.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>having nothing, you just press a button to reel it in, and the more complicated ones.

781
01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:03.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I know some people love the Stardew one, I don't. I've never really found that any of

782
01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>them are particularly fun and this

783
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:10.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>is obviously not particularly fun either but it does make you do something but it's not like such

784
01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:11.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>a difficult thing that you find it so frustrating

785
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I would be too if any of them were good.

786
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.800
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Bug-catching. Have you figured out how to catch bugs yet?

787
01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:03.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you got to jump. Nope. Yeah, you got to get underneath them, get underneath them and then

788
01:51:03.239 --> 01:51:12.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>jump and catch. So I okay, let me let me just double check my play time, because it's going to

789
01:51:12.039 --> 01:51:20.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>be important when I tell you this next thing. My play time in game currently is we're trying to

790
01:51:20.039 --> 01:51:22.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>remember where it is in the game.

791
01:51:23.399 --> 01:51:27.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I've got 30 hours in this game in the last week.

792
01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I found out how to catch bugs three hours ago.

793
01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:37.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like real Titan three hours ago, like just before we recorded.

794
01:51:37.079 --> 01:51:43.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I had no idea how to catch bugs because I was like, "Where's my net?"

795
01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:45.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I'm sitting in fall of year one being like,

796
01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>"Why has nobody given me a net yet to catch any bugs?"

797
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>"No! No net!"

798
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:10.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Exactly! That was the thing. I realized that today. I was like, "Wait, why am I expecting a bug net when I've got no spaces left on my toolbar?"

799
01:52:11.239 --> 01:52:18.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I googled it and I was like, "You're kidding me. You just press, you just sneak up on it and press A. That's all you do."

800
01:52:19.159 --> 01:52:20.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I was not expecting that.

801
01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:37.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah.

802
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, and the thing is, that's the only indication you get that you can catch them is that little

803
01:52:53.239 --> 01:53:00.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>thing that pops up in the bottom right in tiny text that says a catch when you're at the right

804
01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:07.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>position to catch one. There's no tutorials. Everything else is introduced to you. It's like

805
01:53:07.399 --> 01:53:12.199
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>someone comes and gives you a fishing rod, and someone comes and gives you a pickaxe,

806
01:53:12.199 --> 01:53:16.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>or the item for pickaxe, it's like a combined pickaxe and an axe.

807
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I really like that being combined.

808
01:53:20.039 --> 01:53:21.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Everything else is introduced to you.

809
01:53:22.119 --> 01:53:25.800
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's one tutorial screen for catching bugs and you get it after you catch a bug.

810
01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:29.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Why do you get it after you catch your first bug?

811
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:44.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they should do is they should show that screen when your first bug runs away from you.

812
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like why are they waiting to you've caught one and you've figured out how to do it that's such a

813
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:07.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, you want there's a bunch of tasks that need bugs and there's a specific

814
01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:11.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>thing with the harvest sprites that needs bugs, but yeah, it's not a big part of anything else.

815
01:54:12.859 --> 01:54:20.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All right, mining and wood. This is different from most farming games in that there isn't

816
01:54:20.539 --> 01:54:31.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>a mine and you can't chop down trees, so your mine blocks like rocks and ores that

817
01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:37.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>are just like in the mountains and also just lying around the ground randomly around the town

818
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:42.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and you get wood from fallen trees as logs on the ground and use them. I really like that

819
01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:46.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>they combine the two tools into the one, so you just use one for forgetting both of them. I really

820
01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[laughs]

821
01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:26.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, that also reminds me, just this tool also has one other use, which I only found

822
01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:32.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>out today as well. You can uproot your fruit trees and put them in storage and then plant

823
01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:39.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>them again. I missed that in the Chitotea originally, but it means that, like, because

824
01:55:39.739 --> 01:55:43.699
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>your trees don't die, but it means, like, because they take up the space that you normally

825
01:55:43.699 --> 01:55:48.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>would be farming and you go out of season and it's like you don't want that wasted space.

826
01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:50.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I was going to go chop it down and then I realised you cannot.

827
01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:55.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I've just put my lemon tree in storage and I'll bring it back out in next summer.

828
01:55:55.619 --> 01:55:57.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's a fantastic feature. I love that feature.

829
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:27.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Mm hmm. Yes, it does. It does deplete while they're in

830
01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:36.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>storage. So no, the no.

831
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So, yeah, no, I just it just goes slower in storage and then you can upgrade it to go

832
01:56:47.399 --> 01:56:49.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>even slower again in storage.

833
01:56:49.979 --> 01:56:56.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I guess for listeners, like the food goes out of date in this game.

834
01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:57.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It is very slow.

835
01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:02.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Like I had a mushroom in my storage that I think took it was like a season before it

836
01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>started warning me that it was about to go out of.

837
01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:10.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then you can you it goes like a little kind of gray background and it's very clear,

838
01:57:10.359 --> 01:57:15.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>something is different about this and you hover over it and it says

839
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it's like it's close to expiring and you can then do something with it.

840
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>If it expires, you can also turn it into fertilizer, which is nice.

841
01:57:20.439 --> 01:57:21.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>This is just a little thing.

842
01:57:21.479 --> 01:57:23.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I love that little feature.

843
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:30.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But yeah, if it's in your storage in your house, it will go out of date slower.

844
01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:33.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then you can then upgrade your storage.

845
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think it puts in a fridge, so it goes down even slower.

846
01:57:39.319 --> 01:57:42.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Speaking of the storage, I kind of love and kind of dislike the storage.

847
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Storage, I love the combineness of it, right?

848
01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you don't have to have like chests lying everywhere.

849
01:57:49.319 --> 01:57:53.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You upgrade your storage and it's just like one storage.

850
01:57:53.359 --> 01:57:56.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But it's all it's so close to being perfect.

851
01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:58.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So there's two things that really annoy me.

852
01:57:58.439 --> 01:57:59.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So one,

853
01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:05.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>your kitchen isn't connected to well, there's a little store.

854
01:58:05.359 --> 01:58:08.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's a little door that allows you to get into your storage from your kitchen.

855
01:58:09.079 --> 01:58:12.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But it's not if you go to cook, you have to have things in your bag.

856
01:58:13.159 --> 01:58:16.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>To cook. Why is it not automatically connected?

857
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.199
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because I'm like here, like, let me just cook from everything in my storage, right?

858
01:58:20.199 --> 01:58:23.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's the first thing that's so annoying to have to go and grab things out of my

859
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:26.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>my storage to then cook.

860
01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I haven't done that one yet.

861
01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But it didn't mention anything about that.

862
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:39.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All it mentioned was that it just I feel like it would have mentioned that.

863
01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:42.119
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It doesn't mention it in the description of it.

864
01:58:43.119 --> 01:58:46.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It means that things will expire slower.

865
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But the other thing is the windmills.

866
01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:51.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So the windmills are your crafting, right?

867
01:58:51.159 --> 01:58:54.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And you've got you start off with one windmill and you basically you put

868
01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:59.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>something in like your eggs and it turns into mayo and you put in your

869
01:58:59.239 --> 01:59:01.199
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>weeds and they turn into fertilizer.

870
01:59:01.399 --> 01:59:05.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it's also how you upgrade your tools and stuff like that.

871
01:59:05.319 --> 01:59:07.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's a whole bunch of things you can do with it.

872
01:59:07.279 --> 01:59:08.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I really like it.

873
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Basically, yeah, and you can set up six...

874
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>...up to six blocks of up to ten things at once, and like different things take different amounts of time.

875
01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:23.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I really like it. It's a really nice way of combining all these things and stuff.

876
01:59:23.239 --> 01:59:27.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's two problems I have with it. One is that, again, the storage is not connected.

877
01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:33.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can buy a little thing that allows you to access your storage in there, but it's still separate, right?

878
01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:36.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So like I... it's like a little thing from the harvest sprites.

879
01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:43.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's like a little box and you just... you interact with the box and you can then access your...

880
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:51.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>...storage back at home. But then you also have the separate storage for output and input.

881
01:59:51.399 --> 01:59:56.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so I have to, again, go and grab stuff out of this magic box and put it into this other box...

882
01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:59.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>...and then take it out of this other box and then back into this other box.

883
01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:04.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's like, why, when you upgrade the storage, can you not just have it all connected?

884
02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:07.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's like so close to being perfect.

885
02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:12.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You get used to it.

886
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's what it is, right, but I just I feel like it could have been better if they'd done that.

887
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I mean, things still go off in the fridge, right?

888
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They just, it just happens slower.

889
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah, yeah

890
02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:50.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So the way that I solved that, and you're going to initially hate this idea,

891
02:01:50.659 --> 02:01:55.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Micah, but the way that I solved that is sell everything at the Bazaar. Basically, sell

892
02:01:55.939 --> 02:02:00.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>everything. Like, keep a couple of things, right? Like, keep your copper, because you need to use

893
02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:05.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that to upgrade. Obviously, keep your gold, you know? But like, sell everything else, right? You

894
02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:09.939
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>don't need all that stuff, and you'll get more of it, and you'll get loads of money that way. Like,

895
02:02:09.939 --> 02:02:15.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you make so much money if you sell everything, and you also solve your storage issues temporarily,

896
02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:18.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>then because you make so much

897
02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:21.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>more money, you then also solve your storage issues long-term as well, because you can

898
02:02:21.619 --> 02:02:28.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>then afford the storage upgrades. Sell everything. Don't think of it like you hoard everything

899
02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:30.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>because you're like, "I'll need everything," but you can always get something else.

900
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:51.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. You needed you only needed like 15 of them. Yeah.

901
02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:58.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes.

902
02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:06.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, so it's flowers rather than herbs, so they will specifically say in their description if they're a flower on a herb.

903
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can't sometimes quite tell, right?

904
02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because, like, mint does not look like mint.

905
02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:14.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It looks like a flower, but it is a herb because it's mint.

906
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:17.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it does. It does.

907
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Was it was it the possibly star rating?

908
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So those don't say those don't say those don't say any flower, though they do say specific flowers, though they don't say any flower.

909
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.359
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Which one are you looking at because I can see spring bouquet summer bouquet autumn bouquet and winter.

910
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:30.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Interesting. So I so I have two two questions. One, did you press the Y?

911
02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:32.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Are you on switch?

912
02:05:32.239 --> 02:05:35.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, did you press Y button to view the details of it?

913
02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:38.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it said any flower.

914
02:05:38.199 --> 02:05:42.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It should be any flower, then, because I'm pretty sure like, obviously,

915
02:05:42.199 --> 02:05:47.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't have that one anymore, right, but I'm pretty sure that it is anything that

916
02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>specifically in the description calls it to flower.

917
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.960
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Now, the interesting thing is, I don't think the toy flower is a flower.

918
02:05:52.960 --> 02:05:58.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think the toy flower is a herb, but they'd specifically say in their

919
02:05:58.680 --> 02:05:59.880
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>description what they are.

920
02:06:00.239 --> 02:06:03.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Um, cause yeah, I had the same thing where I was like, oh, these don't

921
02:06:03.279 --> 02:06:06.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>count towards it, but then I looked in the description and they said that they

922
02:06:06.819 --> 02:06:09.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>were, so like, I've got mint here and it says a wild herb.

923
02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:11.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You've got lavender, it says a wild herb.

924
02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:16.720
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't have any other in my inventory just now, but like, oh no, I do have those.

925
02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:19.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I've got the magic red flower.

926
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And pink cat flower, a flower with cute little buds.

927
02:06:24.279 --> 02:06:27.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So like they specifically say in the description whether they're a flower or not.

928
02:06:28.039 --> 02:06:30.640
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I think it will be more than just those three ones.

929
02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:34.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's just that those are the ones that you'll see around the place because there's

930
02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:38.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>only a few things that will be forageable in each season.

931
02:06:38.239 --> 02:06:40.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But there are others that you can grow as well.

932
02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:03.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Typically. Yeah.

933
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:43.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I don't know. Maybe there was something, there must have been something weird about that.

934
02:07:43.399 --> 02:07:46.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I don't know. There's something weird about that, because yeah,

935
02:07:46.279 --> 02:07:50.439
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the moon drop flower should definitely count. I'm pretty sure that I used moon drop flower for it.

936
02:07:50.439 --> 02:07:54.279
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But anyway, it doesn't matter. This is very, we're getting so detailed here.

937
02:07:55.479 --> 02:08:01.560
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Let's move back further out. So the mining and wood stuff, let's just complete that.

938
02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's fine. My one problem is you can't just like go.

939
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm going to get as many of as much mining as I want today because there's only a specific

940
02:08:11.039 --> 02:08:17.720
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>number of nodes around the map. So it's really hard to get gold when you get to that point,

941
02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:24.039
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>right? It takes ages to get the gold that you want. I would like more, please. I get

942
02:08:24.039 --> 02:08:29.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>not wanting necessarily to have a mine, but like on so on your farm, all of the things

943
02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:33.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>respawn when you walk out your farm and walk back into them. So they could do something

944
02:08:33.079 --> 02:08:36.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>like that where like if you walk out the mountains walk back in the things respawn

945
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>would be nice just more of an opportunity to be able to get stuff would be good.

946
02:08:43.239 --> 02:08:46.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Relationships you've probably not done a huge amount of relationships you've obviously done

947
02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:51.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>some of the tasks because you were talking about maples, maples task but where are you with

948
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:52.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yes. So there's a so there's a few different things. So this is an interesting

949
02:09:52.819 --> 02:09:56.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>way that it does this. I quite like what it does. Once you get used to it, it makes it really clear

950
02:09:56.979 --> 02:10:04.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>what's happening. So once you hit certain points, different things will happen. So sometimes it will

951
02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:11.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>lock it and say you need to get to know this person better. So for example, if you are

952
02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.300
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>trying to...

953
02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:20.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>increase your friendship with Sophie, the mayor's daughter. If you don't have him at a certain

954
02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:26.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>point, when you get to a certain point on Sophie, it will say "get to know..." I can't remember his

955
02:10:26.979 --> 02:10:33.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>name. What's the mayor's name? Harold or something? I can't remember. No, Harold's a different...

956
02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:41.779
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Harold's a different person. The mayor is Felix. So it will say "get to know Felix better" and then

957
02:10:41.779 --> 02:10:44.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then once you get them to a certain point, it will then...

958
02:10:44.979 --> 02:10:46.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It will unlock the person.

959
02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:53.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So I like that because you're like getting to know the family of the person that you're getting to know.

960
02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:55.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And it's like, I quite like that idea.

961
02:10:56.180 --> 02:11:07.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Then sometimes it will say nothing and then you just need to wait for a few days and it will pop up and say either has a favor to ask or something special might happen.

962
02:11:07.699 --> 02:11:11.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That has a favor to ask, you just have to go talk to them and they'll give you something to do because that's

963
02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:28.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's what that's what the has a favorite task is that's that that is that is the unlocking.

964
02:11:28.579 --> 02:11:32.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But the third thing is something special might happen.

965
02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:35.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And when that's like your your heart events that you have another one.

966
02:11:35.579 --> 02:11:41.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So like it's they have to be like a specific time in a specific place with specific people.

967
02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:44.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But the really good thing about it is you don't know what they are beforehand.

968
02:11:44.979 --> 02:11:49.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But when it is the right time and the right place, it will mark on the map with the little

969
02:11:49.619 --> 02:11:50.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>red icon.

970
02:11:50.619 --> 02:11:53.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So, if you go to the map at that time...

971
02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>...then the heart event will start.

972
02:11:56.619 --> 02:11:59.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So, it makes it very clear there's a heart event.

973
02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:02.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>If you go and do this, you can get this heart event, which I really like.

974
02:12:02.859 --> 02:12:05.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Because so many games it's like basically secret.

975
02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:08.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You know, like, I have no idea what to do to get to this point, right?

976
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Something special might happen.

977
02:12:48.500 --> 02:13:07.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It is more clear when it happens. You just haven't had it experienced. If you go to the resident info and you scroll down, it will either say you've got to wait or has a favor to ask, in which case you can go and get it from them now, or it will say something special will happen.

978
02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:16.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And that's the waiting for a specific time for the heart event. So when you have multiple of them, you can scroll down and see that they are different.

979
02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:18.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>different, I guess it's just.

980
02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:21.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>When you encounter the first one, you don't know that the other ones are going to be different, right?

981
02:13:21.579 --> 02:13:22.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's like less clear.

982
02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:25.539
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's fair.

983
02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:26.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's fair.

984
02:13:28.539 --> 02:13:29.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:33.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's definitely.

986
02:13:35.539 --> 02:13:39.460
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it's definitely improved in a lot of ways from previous ones.

987
02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:59.100
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- Yeah, for sure.

988
02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:07.380
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's fair, that's fair.

989
02:14:09.939 --> 02:14:14.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But you're not obsessively going and seeing what level your hearts are at on all your characters every day?

990
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:19.619
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, come on, come on.

991
02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:21.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You just see a colour.

992
02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:26.140
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>How do you know which, how do you know which level the colour is if you don't go and look at them and how many hearts they have?

993
02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:51.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>only one heart there. My very nitpicky thing about this is, on the resident info, let me

994
02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:59.220
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>reorder the characters, please, because the ones that I am, shall we say courting, are

995
02:14:59.220 --> 02:15:04.060
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>like halfway down the screen. So it's like when I open up the thing and I want to go

996
02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:09.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>down and see what my friendship level is on Kagetsu. I have to scroll down like

997
02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:14.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>ten people to get to her. Let me bring her to the top, please. I want to see her at the

998
02:15:14.579 --> 02:15:20.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>top and then you can just look and see what you've done. Exactly.

999
02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:33.859
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Have you, have you, is there a particular character that you are interested in courting just now?

1000
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.800
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yep.

1001
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>She specifically, when you talk to her at the beginning of fall, she explicitly says, "Oh,

1002
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:06.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I love fall as well." So it's yeah, it's very deaf.

1003
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:34.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Her birthday's in fall as well. I just realized, and this is something I didn't notice until now,

1004
02:16:36.899 --> 02:16:39.219
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it's localized here. So it says autumn, not fall.

1005
02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:46.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, okay, it's not localized then. That's just the English translation. Fair enough. All right.

1006
02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:52.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm just so used to saying fall for farming games, because they all say fall.

1007
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I never say a fall outside of conversations about farming games

1008
02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:05.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>on this podcast. Every other time I would say autumn.

1009
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:22.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So my thing, you'll probably remember that I'm a sucker in games for like the mean girl.

1010
02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:28.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm always like, so like Hailey in Stardew, and I'm like, oh, I can get you to like me,

1011
02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:34.280
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>right? Like it's a challenge. I like the challenge. There isn't really a mean girl in this game. I

1012
02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:41.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>mean, maybe June, but like she's not really, but she's not really, yeah, not to the same level,

1013
02:17:41.719 --> 02:17:44.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>right? So I was like, okay, maybe I'll go with someone else.

1014
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Have you met Kagetsu yet?

1015
02:17:48.319 --> 02:17:51.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Kagetsu is not mean.

1016
02:17:51.639 --> 02:17:55.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And so initially I was like, hey, she's definitely the one that I'm quoting just

1017
02:17:55.479 --> 02:17:58.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>now. There's a few that I'm interested in, but I think Kagetsu is probably the one

1018
02:17:58.719 --> 02:18:01.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm going to focus on for this play through.

1019
02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.959
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I was like, hey, I managed to be interested in someone who's not the mean girl.

1020
02:18:06.159 --> 02:18:10.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But then I realized she's not mean, but she is completely like she's a recluse.

1021
02:18:10.959 --> 02:18:14.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you don't meet her for like weeks because she lives in the mountains and you

1022
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>are in a portal to get to her house.

1023
02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:24.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then she basically tells you, go away, I don't talk to people.

1024
02:18:24.639 --> 02:18:30.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you have to build up that relationship before she even does anything.

1025
02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:34.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Essentially mean girl, I just ended up with the mean girl again.

1026
02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:36.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Why does this keep happening to me?

1027
02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:39.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Which is funny because my wife is not a mean girl.

1028
02:18:39.399 --> 02:18:42.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>She's the most lovely person in the world.

1029
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:43.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Bizarre.

1030
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The what I really like about the characters all feel very kind of full.

1031
02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:58.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I'll give you the example here in Kagetsu is the she doesn't have any family,

1032
02:18:58.239 --> 02:19:00.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>obviously, and she doesn't really have any friends.

1033
02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:02.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You're really the only person she interacts with.

1034
02:19:02.319 --> 02:19:06.600
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Start with like your story with her is like you're bringing her out of your shell

1035
02:19:06.799 --> 02:19:10.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and taking her around and introducing her to people.

1036
02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:13.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But there are no because of that.

1037
02:19:13.799 --> 02:19:15.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's no other characters that you--

1038
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.719
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>have to increase the heart level with alongside her. So like when I was talking about how

1039
02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:26.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>with Sophie you have to increase the the mayor's because she's her father, and with Maple you have

1040
02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:32.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to do it with the two people who run the hotel. With Kagotsu there's no one, and I like how they

1041
02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:38.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>didn't just shoehorn in someone into that just to have that mechanic there and actually go "no it's

1042
02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:44.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>more important that we have like the the character be true to the character" if that makes sense.

1043
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1044
02:19:56.219 --> 02:19:57.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>- Arata.

1045
02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:10.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't want to say anything. The story to that.

1046
02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:13.219
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's not the same. It's definitely not the same.

1047
02:20:13.219 --> 02:20:16.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>If you continue playing and interacting...

1048
02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:17.780
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, I don't think you even need to interact with him.

1049
02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:21.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's a story thing that involves that, so I don't want to say anything.

1050
02:20:23.940 --> 02:20:27.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, so I mean, as far as the relationships go, it's pretty good.

1051
02:20:27.379 --> 02:20:31.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't know if I would go so far as to say the characters are as good as stargy ones yet.

1052
02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:34.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't think I've gone through it enough to know that.

1053
02:20:34.579 --> 02:20:36.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I feel like they could be.

1054
02:20:36.899 --> 02:20:37.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm not thinking...

1055
02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:43.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>They don't all feel like one note and unique, and it feels like they do have development

1056
02:20:43.059 --> 02:20:49.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>as you get to know them, and you show them your world, and they show you your world,

1057
02:20:49.379 --> 02:20:50.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and they progress in other ways.

1058
02:20:50.899 --> 02:20:54.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it does feel like there's something there, and whether it'll end up being as much or...

1059
02:20:54.979 --> 02:20:55.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't know.

1060
02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:25.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes. They're meant to be tourists, I think.

1061
02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:37.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes. Yeah, yeah. They're pretty stock answers they've got. They're like, "Oh, I like it here.

1062
02:22:37.399 --> 02:22:42.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'll come back," and stuff like that. It's all pretty generic, which is fine. I think it's fine.

1063
02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:45.879
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You just kind of get used to who you're going to talk to and who you're not going to bother talking.

1064
02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:16.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, there's like a person that comes that help, they help you with...

1065
02:23:18.059 --> 02:23:24.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, there's like an overall organization that like defines who's bazaars and what levels,

1066
02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:27.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>she works for them and comes and helps you build up your...

1067
02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:52.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, it does it does build out even more than that. There's there's no, no, I think

1068
02:23:52.299 --> 02:24:00.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you're totally fair on Isis. I would love to know which of these characters are new

1069
02:24:00.379 --> 02:24:10.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to this version of the game. Because like Kagetsu is clearly an Asian character as well.

1070
02:24:10.899 --> 02:24:17.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So it's like, they start to build out a little bit more. And

1071
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:32.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes. I've turned off my switch now, but I can't remember his name.

1072
02:24:32.079 --> 02:24:36.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Anyway, it doesn't matter. Yeah, they definitely build it a little bit more.

1073
02:24:36.159 --> 02:24:42.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's still quite pale, but it's not like 100%, which is good.

1074
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think, yeah, I think this is what I'm saying is like, there's, it depends on how they finish

1075
02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:58.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>the arcs, I think, on whether they are as good as Stardew or not. They're definitely

1076
02:25:58.399 --> 02:26:03.120
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>not completely one note. There is, there's definitely more stuff to them all as you get

1077
02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:08.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to know them. And there's lots of little bits and pieces as well. There's like random events

1078
02:26:08.159 --> 02:26:13.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>that happen that aren't actually specifically connected to heart events that are just, and

1079
02:26:13.079 --> 02:26:15.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you're not interacting with them, you just see them interacting with other people, which

1080
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>is quite nice. So like, you know, with Maple, for example, there's been a couple of times

1081
02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:25.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I've walked into the hotel, and then there's like a cutscene with the full voice acting

1082
02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:30.959
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>of her talking to the kids, and they're like asking her questions and stuff like that.

1083
02:26:30.959 --> 02:26:35.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then that's it. You don't interact at all. That's it. And that sort of stuff is

1084
02:26:35.159 --> 02:26:36.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>really nice to build it out.

1085
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, yep.

1086
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.639
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Mm hmm. Yeah.

1087
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:36.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well that's the thing, I don't know how deep it goes, right, like I've got a few of them

1088
02:27:36.319 --> 02:27:42.280
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>at like five hearts but I've not got any further than that with anyone, it takes a lot of work.

1089
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.559
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All right, quick conversation about the voice acting.

1090
02:28:12.559 --> 02:28:13.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I like the voice acting.

1091
02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:16.540
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think it is really nice.

1092
02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:18.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's weird that it's only in some conversations.

1093
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:36.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But yeah, well that's the thing, like there are some cutscenes that are very

1094
02:28:36.059 --> 02:28:41.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>definitely cutscenes where it's just like the little noises they make, or like one word. It's

1095
02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:45.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>like "ha ha" and stuff like that, like okay, it just feels a little bit weird that there wasn't,

1096
02:28:45.579 --> 02:28:48.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but I guess I get that voice acting is expensive, whatever.

1097
02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:03.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes, yeah, that's fair.

1098
02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:21.059
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, so there's.

1099
02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:25.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, so there's another interesting thing is you have an auto progression on

1100
02:29:25.659 --> 02:29:29.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>conversations as well, which I love, especially for the full cut

1101
02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:35.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>scenes with the voice acting, because I can like this has made me more likely

1102
02:29:35.379 --> 02:29:38.540
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to pay attention to conversations, because what you do is you're like, oh,

1103
02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:40.540
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it's a cut scene, right? Let me put on the automatic thing.

1104
02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:42.540
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Let me put the kickstand out and put it down.

1105
02:29:42.739 --> 02:29:46.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And like I can go and fiddle away with something with my hands, like my Rubik's

1106
02:29:47.739 --> 02:29:49.979
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>listening and watching the conversation.

1107
02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:52.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I don't feel the need to like button mash my way through it.

1108
02:29:53.139 --> 02:29:54.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I love it. It's fantastic.

1109
02:29:54.579 --> 02:29:56.739
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's so good. Every every game should have that.

1110
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:26.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And like good voice acting as well, like it's prop, it's voice actors doing voice acting and they all feel like real characters talking to you.

1111
02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I don't think, I don't think like.

1112
02:30:53.000 --> 02:31:01.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Okay, we're getting quite long, so let's bash through a bunch of things. I've got a bunch

1113
02:31:01.159 --> 02:31:04.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>of thoughts that I want to bring up that are just really small thoughts. If you've got

1114
02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:11.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>anything else, you can add them as well. The map, I quite like the map. I like how it shows

1115
02:31:11.079 --> 02:31:15.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>where people are on them. I hate the different pages and moving between the pages. I think

1116
02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:20.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>it's just really awkward. I feel like it would have been better to have a directional thing

1117
02:31:20.239 --> 02:31:22.959
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>to get to different ones depending on where they are on the-

1118
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:28.120
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>map. I can never figure out what the next map is going to be if I press the shoulder button. No

1119
02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:29.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>idea.

1120
02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Go up and. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1121
02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:45.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah.

1122
02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:50.639
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Exactly.

1123
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:57.280
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, super, super weird.

1124
02:31:57.479 --> 02:32:00.120
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The you can't change your pronouns after creation.

1125
02:32:00.319 --> 02:32:05.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Boo is bad, but at least they have, you know,

1126
02:32:05.239 --> 02:32:07.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>generic pronouns as well.

1127
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:11.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can't be bold.

1128
02:32:11.319 --> 02:32:12.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>What's that about?

1129
02:32:12.200 --> 02:32:13.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Let me be bold, please.

1130
02:32:13.319 --> 02:32:14.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Thank you very much.

1131
02:32:15.799 --> 02:32:16.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can't be bold.

1132
02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:17.639
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's no bold option.

1133
02:32:17.639 --> 02:32:18.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Maybe you can unlock it later on,

1134
02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:20.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but there's no bold option to start with.

1135
02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:22.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The best I could do was buzz cut,

1136
02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:23.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and I hate buzz cut.

1137
02:32:23.159 --> 02:32:24.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I just want to be bold, please, and thank you.

1138
02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:27.959
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh yeah, there's also a conversation log.

1139
02:32:27.959 --> 02:32:29.239
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So as you're calling the conversation,

1140
02:32:29.239 --> 02:32:31.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>if you accidentally press through something quickly,

1141
02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you can press the X to view the conversation log.

1142
02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:36.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But if you accidentally exit the conversation

1143
02:32:37.079 --> 02:32:38.120
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>you can't get back to that.

1144
02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:40.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Please let me get back to that as well.

1145
02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:40.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So close.

1146
02:32:41.799 --> 02:32:42.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, there's a basket.

1147
02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:44.520
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Have you, do you know about the basket on your farm?

1148
02:32:45.879 --> 02:32:48.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So, right, okay.

1149
02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:52.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So this is a basket that you can take with you around the farm

1150
02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:54.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and you can put stuff into your storage that way.

1151
02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:56.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So if your storage is full, you just,

1152
02:32:56.360 --> 02:32:58.120
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>if your bag is full, you just put stuff in.

1153
02:32:58.120 --> 02:32:59.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can't take stuff out,

1154
02:32:59.079 --> 02:33:01.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>but it is a one-way, put stuff into your storage.

1155
02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:04.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think that's me.

1156
02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:06.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think that's me with all my little

1157
02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.319
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>thoughty thoughts. If you've got any other small things.

1158
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:27.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I agree. Absolutely. It's, it's super fun. And I don't know how much more time I'll

1159
02:34:27.459 --> 02:34:31.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>put into it, but I'm definitely going, I'm not going in selling this game or turning

1160
02:34:31.379 --> 02:34:36.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>off like I do with some games after the podcast. I'm, I'm, I'm playing this game more. Absolutely.

1161
02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:41.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I got to, I got to at least get, you know, I got to get my bazaar up to a grand bazaar.

1162
02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:45.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I feel like that's, that might be the point that I finish, but I feel like I got to get

1163
02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:49.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>there. I've, I've got up to like the third highest level. So I've got to.

1164
02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:55.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Two more to go. Um, and I'm like a third of the way through the next one. So, um,

1165
02:34:55.819 --> 02:35:00.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I feel like, I feel like I'm not far off because obviously the amount that you make

1166
02:35:00.299 --> 02:35:07.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>as well is increasing. Um, I, you, the, oh, one more, one more complaint about the windmills.

1167
02:35:07.899 --> 02:35:12.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>When I unlock a second windmill and the second windmill does different things in the first one,

1168
02:35:12.299 --> 02:35:17.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>also let me do the other things as well. Let it do all of the things. Let me do all of the things

1169
02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:19.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>in all of the windmills. Just let me

1170
02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.760
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>upgrade them, please. I need I want to do all of the things in all of the windmills.

1171
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>No! It's not! It's not asking too much!

1172
02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:48.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I mean, they would be able to solve that just by having the storages

1173
02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:50.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>in there just connected to everything.

1174
02:35:50.139 --> 02:35:51.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And I don't understand why it's not, but whatever.

1175
02:35:51.659 --> 02:35:54.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Anyway, all right, I think we're done then.

1176
02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:58.899
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's possible this might have been the longest episode ever, but we'll

1177
02:35:58.899 --> 02:36:01.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>find out once I've finished editing, madness.

1178
02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:05.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>But thank you, Kevin, not Kevin, thank you, Micah, for joining me.

1179
02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:13.819
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, I've obviously too used to saying thank you, Kevin, for joining me.

1180
02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:15.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Thank you, Micah, for joining.

1181
02:36:16.459 --> 02:36:23.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It has been a delight, as always, to talk to you about a game that we are enjoying, which is such a nice thing.

1182
02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:37.700
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, quick, quick thing.

1183
02:36:37.739 --> 02:36:39.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Maybe I'll put this as a separate thing.

1184
02:36:39.819 --> 02:36:43.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Any thoughts on the console version of Harvest Moon Home Sweet Home that's coming out?

1185
02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:52.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>We did. We did.

1186
02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.860
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, I think it may be out.

1187
02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:17.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, October, 31st of October.

1188
02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:19.299
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>No, no, no, don't buy that.

1189
02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:22.579
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Don't buy the Cozy Bundle.

1190
02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:25.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh, yeah.

1191
02:37:26.139 --> 02:37:28.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Well, that's true. That's very true.

1192
02:37:28.459 --> 02:37:30.139
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Look, I'm not buying the game a second time.

1193
02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.659
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I just want the update to come to the iPad.

1194
02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:33.940
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That's all.

1195
02:37:34.139 --> 02:37:35.379
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>All right. Where are we?

1196
02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:37.020
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yes. Where can people find you on the Internet?

1197
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>[laughs]

1198
02:38:04.139 --> 02:38:05.399
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Did you get many?

1199
02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:15.420
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Did you get many Dunclub entrants at Worlds?

1200
02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yep.

1201
02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:29.260
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And this is why I will come to America next time.

1202
02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:40.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It would be hilarious if I've been to America twice, and once was to LA, and once was to

1203
02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:41.180
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>San Francisco.

1204
02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:42.459
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>It's like...

1205
02:40:42.459 --> 02:40:45.340
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah, hilarious.

1206
02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:49.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Yeah. Hilarious. All right.

1207
02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:53.500
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>You can find the podcast on Tumblr and Blue Sky at THSPod.

1208
02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:56.059

1235
02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:55.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I'm looking at the time, and I think this will definitely be the longest one.

1236
02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:01.159
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>The longest one before this was our pioneers of all of town episode, which was two hours

1237
02:44:01.159 --> 02:44:02.879
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>and 29.

1238
02:44:02.879 --> 02:44:06.559
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>We've currently been recording for two hours and 50.

1239
02:44:06.559 --> 02:44:10.799
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's no way there's 20 minutes that I cut out of this.

1240
02:44:10.799 --> 02:44:15.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then the next longest before that was...

1241
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>was Harvest Moon Home Sweet Home at 2.22.

1242
02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:23.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Oh no, 2.23 was Game of the Year 2024.

1243
02:44:26.559 --> 02:44:30.440
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then Game of the Year 2023 was also 2.22.

1244
02:44:31.239 --> 02:44:33.680
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then we have one that you weren't on.

1245
02:44:33.719 --> 02:44:35.040
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>No, no, no, no, no.

1246
02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:36.840
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Then we have Story of Seasons mineral town.

1247
02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:40.479
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That was 2.21.

1248
02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.920
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Then we have one that you weren't on.

1249
02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:44.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That was Fields of Mistria.

1250
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:49.959
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>And then we have Harvest Moon, What on Earth was that one?

1251
02:44:49.959 --> 02:44:52.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>Harvest Moon, One World.

1252
02:44:53.159 --> 02:44:54.200
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>That was 2.14.

1253
02:44:59.639 --> 02:45:05.000
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>I think literally out of the over two hour episode ones.

1254
02:45:09.559 --> 02:45:13.360
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>There's only two that you weren't on, and both of those were Kelly.

1255
02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:23.079
<v AD82E97B-1AF4-42AF-B9B0-C105D0CAF891>So you and Kelly with me are the 10 longest episodes.
