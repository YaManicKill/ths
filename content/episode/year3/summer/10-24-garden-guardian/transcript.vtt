00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So I mean, you know, that's great intro.

26
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I say you're underselling yourself for folks

27
00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : not familiar, super best friends as well.

28
00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mean, I'm biased 'cause I've always been a huge fan

29
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : that was quite the little channel

30
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : you guys had going there, but and perhaps more relevant

31
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : our audience. You, Jamie, great.

32
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And that's part of the reason I brought you on because we taught cottagecore and that's

33
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : quadgcore enough because you're you're guarding plants. It's it's it's maybe not full

34
00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:51.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : on farming, but you're a growing plant you're collecting fruit. We'll get there. But I mean, that's

35
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah, thank you, I appreciate it.

36
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : that's impressive in its own.

37
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.419
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was really hard.

38
00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Even though the game is so small,

39
00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.099
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it was still a lot of work.

40
00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was my first published real game.

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.319
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Mm.

42
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I've made little game jam things before,

43
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.740
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but that was a lot.

44
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I do think it's funny,

45
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the approximating it to cozy games

46
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and cottage core and farming and stuff,

47
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. The.

48
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: because...

49
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: really, like, it's an action game.

50
00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It is, like, totally just straight up an action game,

51
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but it is farming themed and, like, there was a...

52
00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: there was a Steam sale a little while ago

53
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.139
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that was the, like, farming Steam sale or whatever it was.

54
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:50.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there you go

55
00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I kind of looked both ways

56
00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I hit the Apply button, like, "Ooh."

57
00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And Valve accepted it, so it would...

58
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.780
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I sold some units in the farming sale, so it, you know,

59
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it's adjacent.

60
00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You don't do any...

61
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.120
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's just a action game, but I'll take what I can get

62
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:04.020
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : or -- well, I mean, hey, it's 20 -- 25, possibly 6 when people are listening to this.

63
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But how did your course spaces really change, right?

64
00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.620
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Because I mean, for so long, before Stardew, really, it was all the harvest moon and

65
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.139
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : the story of Caesar, right?

66
00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.220
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And, you know, they were not -- maybe not formally -- but you knew what to expect, like,

67
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : it was very clear what they were doing, but -- but I mean, it's -- it's -- it's exploded

68
00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.519
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's so much since Stardew.

69
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.100
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And I'd say since 2020 is COVID, it just continued to kind of mushroom.

70
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah

71
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : How we've covered Picross, because Picross has done like Story of Seasons.

72
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, so we talked about that because it's adjacent enough.

73
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm

74
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, it's true. It's true what you say though before Stardew. It's it's challenging to think of like significant games

75
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.339
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That are not harvest moon rune factory

76
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Story of seasons that sort of stuff like I think the biggest one that comes to mind predating

77
00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:04.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Stardew is probably residue, right like shop simulation

78
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:17.019
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. And like, yeah, that's this part of the thing. Like, we see we're starting to see that

79
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.339
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But like yeah, yeah after Stardew changed the game

80
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: For real. Yeah

81
00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:21.899
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : connective tissue to other genres, right? Like, like you say you're an action game, but I mean,

82
00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:27.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : look at look at Sock enough rice and ruin that's literally hybrid one part farming one part sick

83
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm

84
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:37.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : character action. Um, so, you know, the lines are blurring. Um, and, and when we hear our

85
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh-huh

86
00:05:35.500 --> 00:06:05.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : overseas in love, genre talking, blurring lines and not making any sense. But yeah, there's a. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. That's that's oh, yeah. I mean, have you played spirit fair? Yeah, yeah, I believe so.

87
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.139
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I feel like that's how it is a lot now.

88
00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:51.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: A lot of cozy games have different styles of gameplay, or a lot of non-farming games incorporate

89
00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:59.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: farming, or that sort of stuff nowadays.

90
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.759
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: No, I haven't-- I'm by Thunder Lotus, right?

91
00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I've seen quite a bit of it that's actually-- I believe-- made in my hometown of Montreal

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : One thing we love doing here is finding the the thinnest excuse to cover

112
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was just whatever it takes to get it on.

113
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.240
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Whatever it takes absolutely

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: On show, hmm, I like that.

115
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, that's that's how we roll here. Um, so yeah, I know but I mean

116
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.680
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I've played Garden Guardian which it's boiler for people. It's great game. You guys check it out

117
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hm-hmm. Thank you.

118
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.879
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And it it a lot of it is something is just the vibes and it it's still like

119
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.120
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's a quick game where you have to be paying attention and you have to be responsive

120
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.660
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But it does something about protecting your plants from bugs just feels so

121
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's not just the word is tain and cozy, um, it evokes as soon

122
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:18.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm not here to promote Garden Guardian, but I will, I will happily, oh, okay, good, well now I am here to promote Garden Guardian. No, but I'm certainly not here like to sell it strictly, but like, yeah, that that feeling you're talking about like I definitely was like a goal. I actually grew up on a farm as a kid.

123
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.519
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : we're feeling in another game.

124
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I am.

125
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:44.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: My parents divorced and was young, my granddad had a farm, so whenever I was with my dad, farm life, right? And you know, one of the things that I remember was, you know, having to treat our extensive gardens and crops and also protecting our chickens, because chicken hawks would just come and just kill them, just kill them in the pen, they'd take them away, they'd eat them there.

126
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.940
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mmm. Yeah. Yeah.

127
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I probably should have put a warning on that but like yeah, they you know, that's a real thing and

128
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [Inaudible]

129
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And that was something I kept thinking about in Garden Guardian was the the the anger I feel towards things trying to steal the plants

130
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.360
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:06.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I've been working so hard on even though they're just you know, they're just living beings trying to get by but I still feel a certain a certain guilty

132
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:18.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Iron where it's like I need you out of here now permanently, but also like I get it. You don't know any better. Anyway, um, I'm I'm glad Garden Guardian in parts some of that

133
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:28.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

134
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: energy in practice because I was definitely thinking about that when I was making it running down to the coop when you see chicken hawks circling just so you could make a big enough

135
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.139
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you.

136
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Ruckus to keep him out. Yeah, yeah

137
00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:36.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You said, oh, oh man, I'd love you to meet, uh, Tony, one of our,

138
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Pope Rotating co-host. She's an entomologist and works at work.

139
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : She has plenty of analyze stories, and growing up in the American,

140
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : spending the most good portion of my life in the American South, I've had plenty.

141
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You're maybe not plenty, but a handful of wildlife encounters myself,

142
00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:00.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm. For sure, yeah.

143
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : so that's always a fun topic here.

144
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But we'll get to garden garden, because I want to deep dive into that.

145
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But before that, let's talk some other fun stuff.

146
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : What have you been up to lately?

147
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm

148
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And when you play and watch and whatever you want to do, tell me what's going...

149
00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:18.559
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Lately, uh, I have been playing a bunch of games actually. I picked up Metroid Prime for yesterday

150
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.980
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, we're trying to just drop today like on recording. Yeah.

151
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.200
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That just very nice

152
00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:30.200
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I've been really really enjoying that. I've only played for like two three hours

153
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.080
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But boy, it feels it feels just like Metroid. I love me love me and Metroid the

154
00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:43.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't know if you've heard of or discussed the npc's who chat with you who follow you around and stuff

155
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, oh, I've heard of it I've heard

156
00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:52.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's it's interesting. I definitely can't say that I like love every line that's been put to paper for the characters

157
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm

158
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But the vibe I get from it is like it reminds me of old action movies like aliens and stuff

159
00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:05.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Have where you have that sort of extended cast that that's getting picked off by the monsters kind of

160
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

161
00:11:06.259 --> 00:11:13.179
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's that's what it does seem like also that like I heard that my knee-jerk reactions are the first things I heard

162
00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:19.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : We're like concerning I felt like but after hearing a bit more like the kind of the different personalities

163
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I definitely see what you mean

164
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, it's I see why people felt that way and I like I totally get it

165
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I mean, there's always been dialogue and conversation in a lot of mature games

166
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:38.419
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But usually it's like constrained to like between moving to areas or whatever whereas like very early you meet this guy named Miles

167
00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:41.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And he's he's he's chattering to you, you know, he's he's

168
00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:49.299
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Shocked that Samus is here and he doesn't understand why he's been brought to this place and he's like he's a goof

169
00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:51.360
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: He says stuff that's goofy.

170
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.240
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There was one good joke where I was like, oh, that's actually like I laughed.

171
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I didn't say, oh, that's actually funny. I just laughed. I just skipped the analysis.

172
00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

173
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, yeah. Um, so I, I, you know, I think it's definitely a question of execution.

174
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No.

175
00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:11.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, cause like I said, even I don't love every line that's been put to paper.

176
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So if that's where I'm at and I like them, I definitely see why some people feel so fiery about it.

177
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And maybe maybe a more, uh, precision engineered script could have delivered.

178
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: something that everyone would have liked, but I'm, I'm just glad that I'm playing it. And I'm like, few, this doesn't bother me actually.

179
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:36.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I actually am like, totally fine with this. Cause it didn't. Yeah, didn't love the NPCs in Metroid Prime 3 so much.

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And other than that, like, when playing some other Switch 2 titles, uh, Hyrule Warriors came out recently and Kirby Air Riders, I've been plugging away at.

182
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:51.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Before we keep, okay, we'll get to curvy around

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm.

189
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: A time vampire, eh?

190
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.559
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, he little bit, but it it was also just

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's like, for real, my wife and I had a similar experience.

192
00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.799
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, but I mean part of it was like

193
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:30.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : There was so much to unlock and there was a lot of love put into that game because you know there was so much

194
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : There's just so much content all the characters at it was insane

195
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I did play the other one the breath of the wild one

196
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Mm.

197
00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:43.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But it was dance which one, so very slaggy.

198
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And didn't hit the same. But tell me, what are your thoughts on this?

199
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Oh yeah, yeah.

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah, so I also love the original

201
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and it's expanded releases after and like you,

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.580
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: my wife and I played a ton of co-op.

203
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.419
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Did you use the like cool split screen,

204
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.580
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: not split screen, but like where one person's on the TV,

205
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:14.759
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : yeah yeah yeah we did right wow the Wii U was ahead of its time

206
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.779
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: one person's on the game pad?

207
00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:06.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - So good.

208
00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:08.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like both people having a full screen, stellar.

209
00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:14.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah, for real, a little kind of,

210
00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: yeah, on the Switch version, you lose that.

211
00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:21.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You can only do local, which my wife and I always kind

212
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

213
00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: of thought was a little sucky and age of calamity.

214
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We liked it well enough, but it didn't fully capture

215
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the magic.

216
00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:31.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We both really liked Breath of the Wild,

217
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: so it was nice to see a little bit more of that world,

218
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, you're right exactly

219
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.740
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but it wasn't all the way there.

220
00:14:40.299 --> 00:14:44.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Actually has more recaptured the magic.

221
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think I still kind of like the original better.

222
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:51.299
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Whoa! Maybe.

223
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Maybe 'cause it just hit us at the right time

224
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and like it's gonna be hard to beat that nostalgia,

225
00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:56.580
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but the new one is definitely, I think,

226
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: just categorically better than age of calamity.

227
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't think there's a single thing

228
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: where I look back at age of calamity,

229
00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:05.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I think that's better actually.

230
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.580
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The performance is also significantly,

231
00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:11.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a way better.

232
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The one feature that we really, really liked at all,

233
00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:17.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like the Law, excuse me, is on Switch 2,

234
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: they have this new thing called Game Share.

235
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.419
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You familiar with it?

236
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, the DS download play of the today.

237
00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:26.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, where you stream the game

238
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to the other switches, right?

239
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.419
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: My wife and I have taken to playing

240
00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:35.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: age of imprisonment in bed where I've got my Switch 2,

241
00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:38.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and she's right next to me with her Switch Lite,

242
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and we do the game share.

243
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.299
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And it is so much better than either of us expected.

244
00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:46.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It is not flawless.

245
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:55.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There are milliseconds of lag, but the consistency you get from a connection that's like the devices

246
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.139
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Hmm. Yeah.

247
00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like basically three to three feet apart is it's so good that that's just how we've been playing

248
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:09.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the game and so you both get a 30 FPS image and the stream receiver gets a

249
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: shockingly good version of it, we really didn't expect that we thought it would be more compromised,

250
00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:20.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: we thought it would be less consistent and indeed when we tried to play it in the living room

251
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: with the switch to docked all the way over there and her sitting on the couch, we did get drops

252
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: here and there which was like we considered like we were we just played split screen at that point

253
00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:33.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but if you're like really sitting next to someone both playing in handheld,

254
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : mm-hmm

255
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: damn it's a good experience so that has really recaptured some of the magic of the original for us,

256
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: putting our own screen and having to communicate what we need the other player to do and stuff like

257
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:53.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that we were really enjoying this one much better than the second one which we liked enough but

258
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

259
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: this is this is better.

260
00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:04.619
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Nintendo, capturing the magic of playing with people in person in 20, 25 when the wild gods have done.

261
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: crazy

262
00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:08.759
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Crazy, yeah, yeah, best local multiplayer game and the best online one too if you

263
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.740
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: If you look to the side a little bit, yeah

264
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:18.140
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yep. I will, um, okay, but that sounds fantastic. I'm definitely much more keen. I like,

265
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.660
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : hey, I honestly forgot, as your imprisonment came out, maybe because other stuff was coming out,

266
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's been a good year for games, but.

267
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:45.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But hearing that does does excite me because yeah, hearing it's a little more close, it's higher than the age of calamity. That's that's good stuff. Although I and I just checked to confirm I will one one ding against imprisonment. No play will has to. That's.

268
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:49.160
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah definitely yeah no playable has to but I don't know if you know like I

269
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: mean I don't want to drop light spoilers but I'll drop the lightest spoiler

270
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.559
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like one of the main main main characters is a Korok like he's a new

271
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.339
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No.

272
00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:06.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: original Korok voiced by Pro ZD I think I'm pretty sure my white

273

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: leading the story in part, which is pretty fun.

279
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:39.220
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : pretty good. All that is pretty good and I love prosody. I think he's one of the

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, he's great.

281
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : funniest guys on the internet. But, you know what? I didn't even have to

282
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.359
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : sum- you don't have to sum me with that. I joke and say that but I mean this game

283
00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:52.019
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : has been narrow. That's all I need!

284
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:59.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, she's her moveset is like super like it's super amusing her moveset cuz she uses all of the

285
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.660
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Zona like zonidivices and stuff like that

286
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, that's cool.

287
00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:12.019
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So there's like one of her you know in the game when you break an opponents like guard you you do like a finishing move on them

288
00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:12.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: right

289
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.180
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, right.

290
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Her her finishing move involves like

291
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: manually spinning this rotating thing to hit a ball that sl-

292
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:26.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: times into the opponent, like the kind of thing you would do to solve a puzzle in tears of the kingdom, you know?

293
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.619
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Rube Goldberg as an old I love that that's great

294
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:45.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. Yeah, Minner's moveset is super baller actually, but if, you know, one of the things I also really like about it a lot is I felt age of calamity struggled a little bit to make me that interested in a lot of its characters.

295
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Certainly there were a few where I was like, okay, yes, I'm here for herbosa.

296
00:19:50.500 --> 00:20:20.299
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Every hour of the day, herbosa and regu can just stay on the screen because they are interesting, but like, I'm not that here for the rido ones like I didn't find the rido characters that compelling and you know, Bo as well didn't find them. I don't find them all that interesting side on I love, but you know, so age of imprisonment is one of the reasons it's fun is because although it has some characters from cheers of the kingdom you do know.

297
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.940
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh yeah!

298
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.839
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I mean, I think of that.

299
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:47.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It has it most of the characters are all new original characters and each each of the four each of the tribes has a new leader character who you have not seen in tears of the kingdom or breath the wild and those characters are charismatic protagonists and each of them has to like, like right hand guys basically.

300
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So you get you get three from each tribe and the right

301
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.599
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : mm-hmm oh that's fun okay sure

302
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:57.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: guys are much less developed but but you still get the main the main new ones for each tribe who are like

303
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:04.779
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: just bonafide new goes that making there's a new Gerudo here's a new Goron etc you know the you know the

304
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:17.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: play the the news or a chief 10 I particularly like her I think she is is great she's cool so you know

305
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.740
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, that is true.

306
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Big, big positive in my eyes.

307
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Having like all these characters, you know, I said you didn't see them in tears of the kingdom.

308
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:32.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That was actually kind of wrong because you do see them in the mat. Yeah, wearing their masks, right?

309
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.980
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You see them in the flashback right the the sequences

310
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, but you never get their names even I don't think

311
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: In this.

312
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.099
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: No, no names, no faces. So, so yeah, so technically you do see them.

313
00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.980
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

314
00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:44.799
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's true, but they weren't developed characters back that now for the most part,

315
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.900
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Right right yeah

316
00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:49.900
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: they have their masks off in this game and you speak to them and they have names and faces lives.

317
00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:48.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

318
00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:52.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's cool

319
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So it's still a mousseau game. The story only goes so deep and we have not finished it yet,

320
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.940
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, of course

321
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but it's lovely and sexy Ganondorf is on display for like from the beginning.

322
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.779
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : The real draw the absolutely

323
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah for real. Um, so, uh, yeah.

324
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.180
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : All right, that's good stuff

325
00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, so are you ready for oh?

326
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: What, what, can I ask what have you been playing lately before we, before we jump over to what I know you've been playing?

327
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:26.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, well, yeah, okay. We'll go get there. Okay. Um, so I've been I've been a bit fairly busy this past week or so

328
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.559
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So I picked up Marvels.

329
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:39.619
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I'll snap again a fair good amount I believe if I recall correctly you are a hard aficionado slash part game aficionado slash fiend like me

330
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:48.839
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. I love card games. I've fallen off in recent years because like doing TCGs at the same time

331
00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:46.259
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh

332
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.400
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

333
00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:56.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: as everything else has been too much for me. But card video, particularly narrative card video

334
00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:52.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, yeah

335
00:22:56.039 --> 00:23:00.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: games, you know, stuff like Chain of Memories and Mega Man Battle Network and Lost Kingdoms and

336
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:20.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, why is move I didn't make that mistake. I heard didn't make that smart choice. I made them sick of keeping it

337
00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:08.839
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: stuff like Big Time, Big Time, my jam. Marvel Snap, I played, I played quite a lot near launch.

338
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I deleted it from my own protection because it's, it's good. Yeah, it's good.

339
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:26.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's tough. It's tough. They, they getcha hooked easy. Anyway, yeah, go on.

340
00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So

341
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

342
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And so, yeah.

343
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:37.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mean, I fell off. I had my first break like last month because I just got busy with my stuff. It wasn't like intentional or anything. I stopped lying for a few weeks.

344
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:49.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Um, but then they added man spider. One of my favorite Marvel characters all the time because it's the stupidest idea and I love it so much. I'm so I got back in because I wanted that man spider goodness.

345
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:57.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But anyways, um, yeah, that game's been running for a while too almost three years. I think if not longer. I don't really exactly.

346
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:23.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But it's it's at a point where the card pool is so large that, you know, the meta game is is pretty stable. There's one or two dominating strategies, but, um, by and large you can kind of play what you want. Yeah, yeah, it is hard. And they're very good at balancing every like two weeks or so. They'll make nerfs and buffs and whatnot. But, um, it's.

347
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hard hard for that not to happen

348
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah

349
00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:27.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I've heard I have a I have a friend here in Japan who I often speak to who's still he's been playing since launch and

350
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.660
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hm.

351
00:24:28.579 --> 00:24:32.240
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I he's other YouTube guy you may have heard of mother's basement Jeff

352
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:41.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, and and he tells me sometimes about the the nerfs and stuff and like the tweaks people get angry because their cards

353
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:48.819
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:43.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the numbers on the--

355
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:55.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: on their cards change, which I find funny. Yeah, you're right, by the way, three years. You pretty much nailed it. So, uh, I find that so funny the numbers on the cards changing. Like, don't get that on paper so much, but.

356
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.200
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I didn't realize you were in cons talking with mother to be I forget his name

357
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.200
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : His mother's basing my brain, but oh, I love him so much Jeff. Thank you. He's great. Oh

359
00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:10.119
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Love Jeff

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, yeah, sometimes they've been doing this here and there where they'll kind of revisit a card in a new form or something like that

369
00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:49.160
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : They did it for a tip fantastic for when the movie came out. They did like all new versions

370
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.599
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You're like first-step versions of the cards just the separate cards

371
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So is that just like a new skin for them or did they also do like new new cards for them?

372
00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:53.819
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Amen.

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, no, no, it says I'll write new cards like weapon X Wolverine is just an outright new card

374
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Oh cool. Oh

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So yeah, it's so yeah, and X-Men seasons are always fun because they're not afraid to you know dig deep and pick out weird picks and whatnot

378
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

382
00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:25.779
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Next one up. Yeah, yeah

385
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I can and they're so quick. You cannot get a gaming, you know like five minutes, so

386
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.799
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's it's dangerous for that reason. Yeah

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I totally get what you mean.

395
00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:10.519
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Have you ever played any of the mohoyo games?

396
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Oh, yeah, hoi-o-verse, yeah.

397
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Liam

398
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, we oversee. Yeah

399
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:20.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I played an embarrassingly large amount of gench impact.

400
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I played a little bit at launch bounced off it,

401
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: did not like it, thought it was way too derivative.

402
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

403
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And then I came back around when Inazuma came out,

404
00:27:33.059 --> 00:27:38.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I played a lot until up until Natland stuff.

405
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And then Zennel's.

406
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:48.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: On zero, I played my wife and I both played daily for almost exactly a year.

407
00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:10.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:56.099
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think we realized it was the first anniversary and we were like, "Oh my god, we're spending

409
00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:59.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: each like half an hour plus a day on this game."

410
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And so we both went complete cold turkey on it.

411
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:10.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Despite really enjoying the combat, I really think that game has very fun combat and very

412
00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:11.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: be bad writing.

413
00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:17.119
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:18.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think it has worse combat and very worse writing.

415
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:26.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So first one. So my sister was the first one that you get to, she's

416
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So what's your what's your Hoyover's drink of choice?

417
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:32.160
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : started genshin near launch, I think. And I agree. It was very, very derivative at first.

418
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:38.240
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But I think it has kind of grown. But like, it's still probably the worst of the big three.

419
00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:46.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Like, we make the joke that she logs in to just do polls and not even play the statement.

420
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:51.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I have a friend who does that. She pays for the the welcome moon pass and I think like I don't think she plays most days

421
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:59.680
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. So she also plays Hongkai. That's like her main thing now.

422
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.660
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: She just signs in gets her gets her hit

423
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah

424
00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:01.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm

425
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.799
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I was eyeing Hongkai for a bit because like the turn-based thing appeals to me. But then when Zen

426
00:29:05.799 --> 00:29:13.839
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : less came in, oh, I was I was in Zen less is my drink of choice. And they just dropped the new

427
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:18.400
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : season and what's nice

429
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:27.279
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : so I think I've dropped maybe 20 30 bucks on the game since it came out like you said it's it's a game that incentivizes you to play daily and I have much to to my own

430
00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:29.779
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : trigger and but

431
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:34.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I'm very happy. I didn't spend a dime on Zenless.

432
00:29:30.599 --> 00:29:32.599
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but like

433
00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:36.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : yeah, yeah

434
00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:40.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I, for Genshin, I only bought the beginners pack when it first launched,

435
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, uh-huh

436
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.240
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and then after that, I became morally opposed to paying money for Gatcha Games.

437
00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:47.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, no, no, I generally

438
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, I, like...

439
00:29:47.000 --> 00:30:14.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I am too, but I move this, there's just like one one splurge, but yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And so like, and here's the kind of thing because not all these the gameplay fun and they continue to to release new characters that I find fun.

440
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, oh, don't worry, I'm not judging you for it or anything.

441
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: These are machines created to adapt.

442
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:05.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't fault anyone for paying into it, that's what they're for, that's what they're designed.

443
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But, you know, being again shined or a gacha gacha.

444
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:25.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I think he's coming out in like two weeks.

445
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

446
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : There's a character named Bonway.

447
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : He's a robot lion man with orbs kind of like Zenyatta.

448
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.839
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

449
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.599

451
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I'm partial to anyone who just fights with their fists and this is one of them.

452
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah

453
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So, I'm off.

454
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So I'm all... Yeah, that's...

455
00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:48.819
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Probably the least clothed character so far. He's only got a hoodie good for him

456
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's true. And it's wrapped around his waist.

457
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I support

458
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.859

459
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, absolutely. Oh, absolutely.

460
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, that's...

461
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So yeah, it's endless. It's dropped.

462
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And then they continue to play it.

463
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's... I enjoy it enough.

464
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But...

465
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay.

466
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So the listeners at home, they know me.

467
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : They know, I'm...

468
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : one of the greatest champions of curvy air ride and sequel curvy air riders.

469
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : What they don't, maybe know, is that there are three other people on this earth who I acknowledge loving the game as much as me.

470
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's it

471
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : One is my sister Melanie, who grew up playing with me. Second is Masahiro Sakurai.

472
00:31:35.079 --> 00:31:37.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mmm that makes sense

473
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And, yep, and third is you, Mr. Liam, because I am well aware how partial you are to this game.

474
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:55.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Thank you. Hey, I really appreciate it. It is one of my long time regrets that we didn't do an elaborate air ride video on best friends

475
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You're welcome.

476
00:31:55.299 --> 00:31:59.819
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's one of those ones that I always look back on and I'm like, why didn't that happen? I don't know

477
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah.

478
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I don't... Oh my gosh.

479
00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:04.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't know. I don't know. And if it did then I've just shut it out of my memory, but I don't think it did

480
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:12.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I believe, well, he said there was a recorded video, but it was one of the few that was lost if I recall.

481
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:15.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Right, that's true. We did do something and I think I think cranky construct

482
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I think I heard that tape bit.

483
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't know what he goes by now, but I think he had made an animation for us and everything

484
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, what?

485
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:27.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's crazy that you remember that. Yeah, like a little animated opening. It's crazy that you remember that cuz that totally jogged my memory and

486
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:40.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, I have an unhealthy amount of memory things of various new topics, but yeah, thank you

487
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Damn

488
00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:41.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, air ride kicks ass, man. You're you're you're right to acknowledge its greatness

489
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I love I love that people didn't understand there

490
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:53.819
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: ride the first time and so Nintendo and Sakurai just went we're gonna make you understand this time we're gonna

491
00:32:51.500 --> 00:33:00.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : What one of my favorite memes I've seen because I've been you know, I've seen a lot of traction from the new art medium that is Kirby a writer, but I've seen a meme here there

492
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm

493
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Back to the future. I assume you've seen back in the future

494
00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:07.900
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yes, yeah. Oh, I see where you're going with this. Yeah

495
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.160
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, so if you remember it

496
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.599
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I've one of my favorite memes is Marty at the end of his guitar song

497
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.140
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, I guess you aren't ready. You aren't ready for this and you see pervy air ride original with the 50

498
00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

499
00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:21.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Metacritic score, but your kids are gonna love it and you get air riders at the 80.

500
00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, for real

501
00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:28.259
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, it's it's so true, but you know, it's it's it's man the reviews

502
00:33:28.579 --> 00:33:34.339
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: For air ride. I've always found interesting because I have a hard time faulting

503
00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:44.339
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Any reviewers for scoring the original low, you know if you if you were if you were if you had that game plopped on your desk back then and

504
00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:52.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You didn't get a review guide back then it wasn't so common and you didn't have friends around to play with and you had

505
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:58.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Best a couple weeks to review it. I could totally see how someone would come away from that game

506
00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:05.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Being like there's nothing going on. There's like unless you become addicted to solo city trial

507
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:15.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, but it was, I can, you're right, you're right.

508
00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:14.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like I you know what I mean it seems ripe for like a tough tough situation a tough game to review

509
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Especially if the attitudes of gaming at that time, like I absolutely see that.

510
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Now that I think about like, I've never like, it was absolutely for me to part by never thought about how much.

511
00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:30.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But like I said, my sister enjoys it as much as I do and like I think a big part of it was because

512
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:47.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : it's so much together. One of our favorite things was just doing free try, free run in city trial, just running around the city and just, you know, just running around for machines and having fun. It was, it was a sandbox basically.

513
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:53.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: for real. That was the f**king VR chat of its time. Everyone, everyone running around with Kirby,

514
00:34:53.480 --> 00:35:01.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like doing the pitalyest platforming, attempting to climb up the skyscrapers with the poor feeling jump.

515
00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:11.719
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. That was it. That was the Fortnite hangout spaces of its time. Was you and three friends

516
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Trying to fight for the control of the sky island.

517
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You get it. You get it.

518
00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:12.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: or one sibling.

519
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: F***ing around city trial infinitely.

520
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, god.

522
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's so nostalgic.

523
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh my gosh.

524
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:33.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's funny because it makes me think of nowadays there are so many experiences that are like, quote-unquote, "liminal spaces" and stuff like that.

525
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:42.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And like that city trial experience, like playing with no timer, no rules, that's what that feels like to me.

526
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, Mark Zuckerberg and his billions of dollars

527
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Couldn't make this.

528
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : with his meta versus Kirby era, right?

529
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, for real, eh?

530
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's such a...

531
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm glad you had that experience as well because I had that same experience with my friends and my sisters as well.

532
00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, oh, I'm so glad you got it.

533
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, magical.

534
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, it's the most specific feeling,

535
00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:06.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but it's great, magical.

536
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, for real.

537
00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:09.320
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, so, and now here we are,

538
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : where the sequel to reality.

539
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

540
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, let's, I mean, you recorded, I think you recorded your reaction. You were watching a direct if I recall and you recorded it.

541
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

542
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:28.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah my my YouTube channel has become nothing but Kirby Air Ride videos the last five videos or Kirby Air Rider videos, so yeah

543
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:40.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay. So I, I've said this to people that have heard this on the show already, but I'm going to repeat it to you because I just want to describe my reactions.

544
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:53.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But, okay. Actually, no, no, what was in the office? I was in the office. It was like 9 a.m. I was in my office job, but I was watching the direct any care at this point at that time.

545
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: hahaha

546
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:09.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And so you see the trailer start and it's Carvy on the warp store, right? And so, you know, in turn, I think I was chatting friends on Discord. I'm pretty sure I was. I was just, you know, snarkily saying, Oh, is this the new Smash Bros?

547
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And then it lingers on curvy.

548
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And so I think it's not smash because it's a new curvy project, but it feels too soon for a new curvy game.

549
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So I again snarkily say is this the curvy air ride sequel?

550
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:31.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And then the second the exhaust like pipes form on the warp star.

551
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : My hands just go up to my mouth and I have to hold back the screen because I'm in the office.

552
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It is because I realized

553
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:51.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : it actually was, and I had to legit fight some tears back watching that trailer because I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it, it was really great.

554
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.780
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, so good.

555
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I never, I never really thought it would happen.

556
00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:00.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, after, after Neer Automata was announced years ago,

557
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

558
00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that was the most explosive reaction I ever had to a trailer.

559
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

560
00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:06.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That really like got me.

561
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Uh-huh.

562
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

563
00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:08.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was so specific at the right time of my life,

564
00:38:08.579 --> 00:38:11.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and God, I wish I had a recording of that, but I don't.

565
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But that, that was the one that hit me at a level

566
00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that I don't think I'll ever see again.

567
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And getting lucky with Streets of Rage 4

568
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and Neo the world ends with you.

569
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh my gosh, that was a good one, too.

570
00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:31.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know, I've come to a state of mind where as long as that director is like still in their position

571
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah, I guess so.

572
00:38:32.699 --> 00:38:40.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I just don't count anything out anymore. Everything's on the table. So for me, I didn't consider Air Ride 2 to be an

573
00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:48.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: impossibility, but I just thought like outside of Japan, it wasn't really a hit. So probably not, you know,

574
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: probably we'll just see it appear on the GameCube app.

575
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:56.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That'll be and I'll be happy enough with that, just being able to play the GameCube one.

576
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

577
00:38:56.659 --> 00:39:01.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I didn't really see it coming, but I'm very glad it did honestly.

578
00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:06.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I was very, I was also very happy, maybe not as explosive as you, but very happy about it.

579
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:15.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : we see we're fortunate that soccer I had that fire burning in him just like a

580
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I'm glad it was such a moment for you though honestly.

581
00:39:09.619 --> 00:39:22.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's a good feeling.

582
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I saw these years, that's really the best.

583
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:39.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Because it's so interesting, because I would have clocked that the other way, I would

584
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

585
00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:42.900
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: have thought, "Oh, Sacher, I want to take another go at it."

586
00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:42.059
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Absolutely, right

587
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I

588
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.019
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, evidently he did want to take another go at it, he accepted, but I would have thought

589
00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:46.780
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

590
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

591
00:39:47.019 --> 00:39:48.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: he would have been the origin point of that.

592
00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:52.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, the theory I subscribe to was that this was his

593
00:39:53.179 --> 00:39:55.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, I'll do smash again, but you give me one game

594
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm. Yeah.

595
00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's that's what I envision it, but yeah, that though he described that they came to him which boggles my mind

596
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, here's here's open. Maybe cheap. Oh, it isn't dead

597
00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:11.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's, um, it's so interesting because like they came to him, like, knowing that they had

598
00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:16.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mario Kart, like, you know, coming out just earlier. Well, you know, at the time, both of these

599
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.719
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: games were years away, right? But like, knowing that they kind of, and ending up releasing next

600
00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:25.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to each other in some way and they still did it, super interesting.

601
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm

602
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think he even made a joke about that in one of his presentations on it.

603
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, I believe he did and

604
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But yeah, I'm glad that whatever led us down this timeline, I'm glad that it happened.

605
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:43.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, and and an important thing like a little more objectively about air right that I don't think we

606
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.860
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's past around enough is is if you look back a lot

607
00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:53.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, Sakurai has a very stylized approach to his games with the checklist.

608
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.679
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And the menus and what the a lot of that you can see in air ride like you can really feel the genesis was there

609
00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:04.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Like it was kind of forming first and melee and stuff, but I think it really solidified there

610
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:26.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I agree, AirRide to Brawl, you can really see the close evolution there, whereas Melee is still a little bit more normal with the menus, like they're stylish, and you can use the C-Stick to look around a little bit, but yeah, AirRides, the real genesis of the menus that I think his wife designs, if I remember right.

611
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.280
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yep, absolutely

612
00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:18.280
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

613
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh really, it's so cool

614
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:35.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So they weren't married at the time, but they started working together at how, and she still...

615
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:49.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like, supervisors and does the menu designs, so it's like, so you're not wrong to attribute it to Sakurai, but it's the other Sakurai, because that is now her. That is now her last name.

616
00:41:38.000 --> 00:42:00.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : dang. That's a keeper. The other side. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that no. Yeah. I was about to say it's

617
00:41:49.000 --> 00:42:04.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But definitely, like, their style of menu is so good. I mean, you saw that I ripped it really hard for Garden Guardian. Yeah, yeah.

618
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:08.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : so good. It influenced other games that we might talk about. But will we?

619
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, we could talk about that later for sure, because that's real. Yeah.

620
00:42:08.639 --> 00:42:16.719
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. We'll get to there. Yes. Okay. Um, but all right. So, I mean, that that's the preamble. Tell me what are your thoughts on

621
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:23.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm I'm really happy with what it turned out to be which

622
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:33.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Not really a hot take, but like air riders feels to me more like curvy air riders like a curvy air ride 1.9

623
00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:38.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know like it doesn't it's like there's a bunch of new content

624
00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:43.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There's quite a bit of new content, but also all of the old stuff is back like all the old tracks are here

625
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : because soccer I

626
00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:46.780
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, right all the old tracks are here

627
00:42:47.500 --> 00:43:00.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The game the control model feels pretty much identical to how it originally was, you know, the only thing we're really missing is the original city trial map, which is a bummer

628
00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I would have I would have liked to see that, but

629
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:11.099
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I really kind of like that it feels like so much like the original, I guess it's so faithful

630
00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:17.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Again, I would have been perfectly content if they had just put the GameCube one out and that's

631
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:24.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: one had just been new stuff, but re-imagining and bringing over all the GameCube stuff as well,

632
00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:29.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm really satisfied with that.

633
00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:35.780
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Pretty much everything I like, like all the new vehicles are interesting, being able to

634
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: transform one of them.

635
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:42.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The Vampire Star being able to power itself up by hitting opponents.

636
00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:45.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like a lot of cool new interesting stuff there.

637
00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: new city trial map is great.

638
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm not sure about it.

639
00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:59.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm not sure about it, but it's just not my bag, so I'm probably never going to touch that and that's fine.

640
00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:17.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And the other riders, I felt spoiled having however many vehicles and just Kirby in the previous game.

641
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:24.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm not willing to pick anyone other than Kirby, because for me I just think of the vehicle pick, like I'm very boring like that right now.

643
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:44.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mean that I mean that's that's perfectly fine and understandable because the I mean really the the weapons gameplay wise mechanically it's the the the the vehicles that matter like that then all the characters have a few differences but it's the vehicle.

644
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:31.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I need to broaden my horizons on my rider picks for real because I have not been exploring.

645
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:49.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the specials are the thing that I really need to get my head around because that's

646
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:53.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

647
00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a whole world, but I do agree that the vehicle, yeah.

648
00:44:53.500 --> 00:45:12.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, absolutely. But I mean one thing I do love that because it's reaching a wider audience people not just in this game specifically but they're getting a taste of this cast really robust what I feel cast of Kirby characters.

649
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh-huh.

650
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:23.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know people learning Rick has cut is all on the rage now. You know star man rocky just just these rent little dudes.

651
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:49.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I get in some love and time in the light line line I'm very very happy. The roach I don't know why but I always get excited to see the roach maybe it's just because I like the hat like yeah yeah yeah I agree I haven't never played squeaks quack either but I love him when he's included so yeah.

652
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I don't even love the roaches game, but like the roaches funny, and I love the roaches name. I always it's

653
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:52.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Starman's the one for me where I'm like I want to play as you I actually think I still haven't unlocked Starman

654
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I really want to play as Starman

655
00:45:53.500 --> 00:46:00.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Star man okay two things about starment one have you seen his special.

656
00:45:58.119 --> 00:46:03.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Know I well, I might have seen it in like the sacrifice presents thing, but I don't remember like I do not know

657
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:11.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah yeah he he he literally just starts supermanning like he just starts flying.

658
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:12.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, that's great I I like Starman a lot because I think that

659
00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:18.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That first experience you get with the jump power fighting cracko is

660
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

661
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

662
00:46:18.639 --> 00:46:29.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: such an iconic an incredible Kirby moment, and it's just like a really powerful moment in in the canon of like Kirby gameplay experiences

663
00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:34.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: jump just like even though Kirby has such incredible

664
00:46:34.000 --> 00:47:04.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: vertical movement in the first place when you use jump and you get to an area that encourages you to continue going up and then you get to a boss like precision engineered to be targeted with jump like man it's satisfying so star man and cracko they they occupy like a really strong place in my love for Kirby stuff. Love it.

665
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, it's so good.

666
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.400
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Absolutely. And hey, cracko made it too high.

667
00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Is that on the bosses?

668
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, the other thing with Starman in city trial, if you you hop off the vehicle,

669
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:34.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hm. No kidding. That's really cool actually. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

670
00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:08.400
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : he actually does jump higher than everyone else.

671
00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:08.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's great.

672
00:47:09.679 --> 00:47:14.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, no, I mean, it's soccer. I write detention of detail, man.

673
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So there's no jocker there, but.

674
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:28.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's fantastic. Yeah, so the cast it's so fun to have all these characters and, and you know, would soccer just as a screw it. They can all have copy abilities with it. It's great.

675
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:35.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, that was that was amusing. I was wondering that when he was presenting the new characters like oh how did they how did they handle this?

676
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:42.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I mean I think just waving the hand and being like what ever I think that was the right call honestly, so yeah

677
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.940
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

678
00:47:43.099 --> 00:47:48.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The the only thing that I'm like oh, I'm not sure I like this change is

679
00:47:49.699 --> 00:47:56.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: in the original air ride you had to press you press the a button to press your vehicle against the ground, right and

680
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah

681
00:47:57.659 --> 00:48:03.599
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So if you wanted to hit a boost panel or like a switch on the ground, you had to press the a button

682
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

683
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to to to to physically touch it and I always really liked

684
00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:10.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: in the first air ride. There's this really

685
00:48:11.699 --> 00:48:19.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mechanically beautiful relationship between the vehicles and the things on the ground because you if you fly over a boost panel for anyone who hasn't played

686
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:17.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Mm-hmm.

687
00:48:19.579 --> 00:48:23.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Kirby air ride you do not boost you have to hit the break button

688
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The A button to smush your vehicle onto the ground and when you're

689
00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:32.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: vehicle touches it, then you get the boost. One of the things that's so

690
00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:36.099
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: beautiful mechanically about this relationship is there's like a class of

691
00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:41.400
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: vehicles, the bikes, that are always touching the ground and air-go, they just

692
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.280
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: get the boosts for free. That was like a really fun thing, like having to

693
00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:51.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: understand how to use the different vehicles and timing your your A button

694
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:57.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: presses for successive panels. I was quite surprised when I played the new one and

695
00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I saw that that's been removed and now you you just have to fly over them

696
00:49:01.659 --> 00:49:07.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: in order to get a boost. I don't think it is like so far from a deal-breaker. This

697
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:19.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:13.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is like just like a nitpick. Yeah, I always really admired that that design

699
00:49:13.519 --> 00:49:17.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: element in the original, so I was disappointed to see it go, but it really

700
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.219
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: doesn't matter. So now for anyone who hasn't played it when you fly over a

701
00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:26.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: boost panel, you're just boost and that's it's fine. It's fine. It doesn't it doesn't

702
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:34.559
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and I think it's a function. I think it's a function of the higher speed

703
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The bother me, I swear.

704
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm so unbothered.

705
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Sorry.

706
00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:41.599
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : because that's one big thing for me like it does feel a lot faster and maybe

707
00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:45.519
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : that's just compounded by the fact that you know you have more racers so

708
00:49:45.519 --> 00:49:53.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : the game feels more chaotic overall but yeah that doesn't bother me either

709
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but just like it is different.

710
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And then there's something charming about the slower pace of the original, especially when you play the old course like you're just blasting through them.

711
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: yeah, you wisdom. To your credit, though, I think that's a great observation. You're right,

712
00:50:07.519 --> 00:50:13.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: maybe the faster movement speed was a contributing element there, because that's kind of what I

713
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: liked about it, was you ate a time, you're pressed, right? But admittedly, now you're going like what,

714
00:50:18.639 --> 00:50:26.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 30, 40% faster, so like, you're right, that's a tougher mechanically for everyone to be able to

715
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

716
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:33.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: handle, so yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

717
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:37.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, um, my one great thing about the old courses. So my my brother Calvin who didn't exist

718
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.320
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: hmm.

719
00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : When the first air ride came out as of course been playing with me and my sister

720
00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:48.519
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And and you know, so some of the new courses he he got a winner too because you know

721
00:50:48.519 --> 00:50:53.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I was you know courses learning in the new speed and whatever but anytime we hit the old courses

722
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.480
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Smoke, it's just left in the test because smelling in and I just know these courses just

723
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm

724
00:51:04.039 --> 00:51:06.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Blodge deep in our brains

725
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:14.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. I totally know what you mean. I played a little bit with my wife and just like,

726
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:21.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: when you hit that bump in checker nights, like everything's, everything's right in the world.

727
00:51:18.239 --> 00:51:20.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

728
00:51:21.679 --> 00:51:25.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You're right back there when you were a kid. Like, yeah. Man.

729
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.639
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's been you're going down the grind rails for me and there's like the cities in the right. Oh, oh good

730
00:51:29.679 --> 00:51:35.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. Yeah. Man. The nostalgia comes right back.

731
00:51:33.559 --> 00:51:35.559
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Absolutely

732
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.320
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think it's really interesting. I didn't obviously, we can't open up switch to games and rip their files

733
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: or anything yet. But watching the trailers and comparing it to footage, like, I'm 99% sure they use the

734
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:55.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: exact same geometry for the, um, for the old stages. Like, they only updated the textures.

735
00:51:55.840 --> 00:52:00.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I think that's been bad. Like, that they still have a little bit of a lower,

736
00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:13.059
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, yeah. I, I agree. There's like, even just looking at like the outline on the minimap, either the just like simpler courses, you know, like just simpler shapes.

737
00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:03.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: lower poly feel even if the art has been overhauled.

738
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

739
00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:26.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's great. Absolutely. Oh, you know what? They're okay. So that's like general air ride, but there is one other change. I'm not grumbled, it's, it's, I definitely feel it's more old.

740
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:47.139
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : man. Like I just want the old way back. City trial. Like I don't want, I don't want anyone to be able to chew just deal with the game that you're handed. If you, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you get, you know, you have your sick Rex wheelie bike, but you get the flying mini game tough off.

741
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: [laughs]

742
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.320
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Random, random stadium.

743
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so like I I I probably feel the same way as you which is like

744
00:52:55.639 --> 00:53:02.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yes, and also no because like because yes like it's really hard to beat that like you and your friends

745
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Quick.

746
00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:09.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Play through a round of city trial and one of you just gets you have a maxed out Hydra and you can't do

747
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.739
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [laughs]

748
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know like

749
00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.360
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I agree like that's hilarious

750
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:17.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I must admit my

751
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: initial reticence to the change to like pick your stadium is offset by like understanding that like oh there's

752
00:53:27.119 --> 00:53:34.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a lot of like fun strategic value at the end that like wasn't present in the original because it's like oh my

753
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.900
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : There is no

754
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:42.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: vehicle could crush it this but also this one maybe and and so I like I totally see both sides of it and I

755
00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

756
00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think I'm totally on board with you, where I miss.

757
00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:49.280
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, I think it's two things like

758
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:56.360
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Option like giving people more options is always generally a better idea. So I get the I acknowledge that like I

759
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

760
00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And it's probably more appealing to most people to be able to choose their game.

761
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:06.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But like you said, there's a sort of that little mind game when you're picking a game.

762
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Sometimes it's even not just like what you're good at, but you saw oh no, there's like two or three other wing stars in this.

763
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

764
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I'm good at fly, but I don't know if I'm that good at flying.

765
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Let me pick another one.

766
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:27.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But what's nice, at very least, it's nice that the variety of the mini games has been updated enough to support that.

767
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Um, because, you know, all the other classes.

768
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:38.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But we get a lot of fun stuff, including all these bosses. He's thrown so many fun, like additions in there.

769
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:44.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. The new bosses are cool. I forget the names of these two events, but the avoiding the

770
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:54.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: laser hallway and the switches, like pressing the switches, I think those are great additions. Yeah,

771
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:53.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, the beam thing. Yeah, yeah, pressing the buttons. That's a great one

772
00:54:54.579 --> 00:54:56.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, they are

773
00:54:54.579 --> 00:55:03.139
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: yeah, big time. The new bosses is dope because like versus DDD was already really cool.

774
00:54:56.579 --> 00:54:58.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : absolutely

775
00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So having...

776
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:13.139
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a bunch of them now. So good. And they still come out rare enough that it's special kind of when it happens.

777
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:20.019
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, it is, and you know, even when it does come out, you know, who's it gonna be? Is it gonna be the the Robo Did is it gonna be nightmare?

778
00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.780
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm.

779
00:55:20.019 --> 00:55:22.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, and you never know. It's it's fun. It's great

780
00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm.

781
00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:24.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

782
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:29.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Um, and you know different vehicles dude differently against them. Oh, it's fantastic. Oh

783
00:55:27.539 --> 00:55:31.860
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely. I'm still making my way through road trip mode,

784
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: because I've been doing a playthrough of that, uh,

785
00:55:33.699 --> 00:55:35.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Uh-huh

786
00:55:34.179 --> 00:55:36.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and so I've only been playing it when I have the opportunity to.

787
00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:43.059
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to record so I've I've finished it once I got the normal ending. Have you have you

788
00:55:43.059 --> 00:55:47.820
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: gotten at least that far? I want to make sure I don't say anything. Let's.

789
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.559
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, well, okay. Well, here's the thing the switch to is actually my brothers. I don't have the switch to myself

790
00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:56.940
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Ah okay okay see you see. Mmm it's funny how that goes.

791
00:55:51.159 --> 00:55:53.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But the game is my

792
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:55.559
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But yeah, yeah

793
00:55:56.519 --> 00:56:02.059
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But so like and I'll unplay or whatever because I'm working and he's in college

794
00:56:02.059 --> 00:56:06.019
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's more free time than I do so as like, you know, go ahead

795
00:56:06.019 --> 00:56:11.679
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You can play road trip mode or whatever. I'll get to it when I can so we so he's played it

796
00:56:11.679 --> 00:56:14.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So I'm familiar with everything I haven't played it myself, but I'm familiar

797
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : with Story in LORWISER, whatever so, speak freely.

798
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Okay, cool. I will speak relatively freely. I've been playing through that and it's been really fun to

799
00:56:23.639 --> 00:56:29.559
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: encounter the bosses for the first time in that context. Not all of them have like a grand

800
00:56:29.559 --> 00:56:33.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: presentation or anything, like sometimes you just get to the end of an area and it's like,

801
00:56:33.239 --> 00:56:39.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: "Oh, nightmares here." And you're like, "Oh, okay, I guess nightmares here." But it's still fun

802
00:56:39.079 --> 00:56:44.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: getting introduced to these bosses in this solo setting where it's like, "Yeah, figure it out."

803
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

804
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, nightmares specifically, I lost a couple times because I was not respecting just how much

805
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:59.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: damage he does. But yeah, the bosses are, I find, quite enjoyable actually. Like Kirby Air Ride

806
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:53.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

807
00:56:59.639 --> 00:57:06.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is really suited to combat despite how, like, unwieldy it is. Like, you know, there's evidently

808
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:05.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

809
00:57:06.679 --> 00:57:13.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a ton of work put into making combat still feel fun in this weird car setting. And the bosses feel

810
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.719
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

811
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: super great to fight against.

812
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:24.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the- since you haven't played it, I won't ramble too much on this, but the- the new mode is really cool.

813
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:38.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's like- it's like if they took, um, Super Smash Bros. 4 Nintendo 3DS's classic mode, and they, like, super elaborated it out to, like, a- a long enough story thing.

814
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

815
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm. Yeah

816
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:45.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know, it took me, like, three to four hours to finish it the first time I want to say- I played through on hard, um,

817
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: which is totally managed.

818
00:57:47.000 --> 00:58:01.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think you'd totally be able to manage hard, but it's nice. It's not going to blow you away or anything like that, but it is a fun addition to the line up of modes.

819
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:10.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It definitely provides a solidly different experience, and the final boss was very cool.

820
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:17.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: One of the other legendary air ride machines there. I thought that was a very cool sequence that I did not.

821
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's just so big.

822
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. It's a huge.

823
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That mode is cool.

824
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:37.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: When you finish it, you get access to New Game Plus, which is the only way to unlock the true ending and stuff like that, or whatever it's called.

825
00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.019
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : frequent curvy fashion.

826
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:48.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And in New Game Plus, you unlock an additional difficulty called very hard, which uncharacteristically, I cowardly.

827
00:58:47.000 --> 00:59:06.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You're going to take forever if I have to deal with this, but very hard removes your ability to pay money to retry events that you fail, and you actually have to back up in the level to the last real checkpoint, and I was like, "Oh no, that's going to slow me down so much.

828
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:17.940
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah.

829
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm just not going to do this during the playthrough."

830
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:17.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It definitely seems like there's enough meat on these bones.

831
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:27.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't think anyone should buy this game for single player play and expect it to blow them away.

832
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:40.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I definitely think anyone who does buy it, you got a nice little depending on whether you want to see the true ending, a nice little 3-6-hour campaign, which is cool.

833
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:51.199
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : yeah yeah I agree and and again one of the the other nice bits of this having

834
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:46.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's not just better than nothing, it is genuinely a good one.

835
00:59:51.199 --> 00:59:59.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : go fairly large appeal um you know some people by Kirby standards this is I

836
00:59:59.039 --> 01:00:10.679
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : fairly light story I would say yeah right

837
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:08.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, I mean boy one of those cutscenes going hard, but yeah, it is reasonably light. I get what you mean

838
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:14.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but a lot of people are seeing these cutscenes though and and getting a taste

839
01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:19.320
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : like oh Kirby goes this hard and

840
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know, it's interesting cuz like my wife pointed this out

841
01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But she was like, you know, most curvy games only go this hard in the last like

842
01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:31.320
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 20% in the last like bit but in road trip where the campaign the normal ending is only like two three hours

843
01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:40.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like yeah, you see the fucked up stuff within our two, you know, like you get right to it. It's great

844
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mean, I mean, heck, even, you don't even have to touch the mode, you just tried the galactic

845
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Nova course, you see them genociding, you're playing it.

846
01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:17.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Sure. Yeah, Galactic Nova is just like this planet in particular. Yeah, Galactic Nova a little trickster guy, little awful, awful planet star, and he's got, I haven't finished Kirby Planet Robot actually. I'm really hoping that those rumors of a rerelease are true, but that game has a, a sibling planet to Galactic Nova, right?

847
01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.940
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and then you go kill as hard.

848
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.679
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

849
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:23.820
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : it yeah I yeah I think I don't remember the fully the Lord but I think it's

850
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Apparently who is also a big asshole, but I don't, I don't know.

851
01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:29.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : actually like for the robot like theme of mechanization it's like an upgrade

852
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:34.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : through Nova actually I think or it's Bay and or it's based off him or

853
01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.739
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : something like that but regardless yeah they the idea is right it's in some

854
01:01:38.739 --> 01:01:42.900
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : sort of no but upgrade to Jason thing.

855
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:46.900
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: cool. I really want to play that game. I played Triple Deluxe and I was so, I came away

856
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:53.719
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: from it so, eh, that I ended up skipping Robobot, which seems to have been a big mistake,

857
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:59.739
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, it was I mean I enjoy triple deluxe a lot, but probably because it'd been lost

858
01:01:53.719 --> 01:01:55.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: so.

859
01:01:59.739 --> 01:02:02.780
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I had sunk my teeth into a proper curvy like that, but

860
01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But you know, I'm robo. Yeah, but robo bot is

861
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Triple Deluxe is fine. It's fine. Oh

862
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.900
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : chef's kiss

863
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Man, I really hope those rumors are true

864
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh

865
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : If I didn't even know there's rumors, but oh, I'm so excited. Oh, um

866
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's

867
01:02:24.659 --> 01:02:28.260
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Furby carbier riders, and I'm trying to think like there's

868
01:02:28.699 --> 01:02:31.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's only I had to talk about the game for a good a little bit

869
01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:33.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But does is there any other thoughts that you

870
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.400
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, I got, boy, I got, I got topics, a really fun topic in Kirby Air Ride is like,

871
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you know, in like the Anglo sphere. So if you go on Twitter or your gaming form of choice and you

872
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Uh-huh.

873
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.599
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: discuss Kirby Air Ride, there's a lot of people who are like, this game was ass actually.

874
01:02:47.239 --> 01:02:48.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yes.

875
01:02:48.579 --> 01:02:49.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

876
01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:57.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: This game reviewed badly, this game sold badly, etc, etc. So obviously I disagree with them.

877
01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:52.900
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

878
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But one thing I find very interesting is the difference in reception between

879
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.280
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: English countries and Japan, because I live in Japan right now, and I have had the luck to

880
01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:18.480
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: talk to some Japanese gamers who like Kirby Air Ride, and everyone here likes it, and it

881
01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:25.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: reviewed well, like unambiguously well. It is a well-regarded game, and at retro game stores,

882
01:03:25.679 --> 01:03:31.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it's one of the most expensive, like, normal games in the library. Yeah, and when I say expensive

883
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Really? Hm.

884
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.900
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: of normal games in the library. I mean like I

885
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.360
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: know I'm not counting games with like Pokemon boxes like

886
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.219
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: really limited stuff. Just the normal stuff. And

887
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, oh my gosh

888
01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:46.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and GameCube game prices are a lot lower here. The market has

889
01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:50.679
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: not been ravaged by collectors. But this that game commands

890
01:03:50.679 --> 01:03:53.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like 7000 yen price tag here, which is quite a bit. That's

891
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:59.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: more than path of radiance here. The region locking really

892
01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:02.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Wow, that's that's all right yeah

893
01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:03.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: saved their asses on having the market destroyed, so.

894
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:17.280
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But Kirby Airide is like, that's a well-regarded game, whereas in English countries, it has a downright mixed, um, memory, or, you know, like mixed reputation, I should say.

895
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I find that so interesting.

896
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.719
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, that's why we get the angry Kirby in the U.S. on the box, it's

897
01:04:21.519 --> 01:04:22.559
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, right?

898
01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:26.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm sad we didn't get angry Kirby again, I should go graffiti on my cover.

899
01:04:28.719 --> 01:04:30.719
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But that's I mean

900
01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:36.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Like I mean obviously you're out there in Japan, but I'm huge. We a boo-too. Everyone knows this. Oh, yeah

901
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.760
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, it sounds about right to me

902
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:47.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I always just find that an interesting thing anyway that like the the sentiment is just so different around it here

903
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.679
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, well, I mean, I feel like curvy in general like you

904
01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:54.139
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah

905
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Repain it has a lot of love for curvy

906
01:04:56.059 --> 01:05:01.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Right like you you can see that from my way here in the States. No, not as much. It's a little more niche

907
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah, here, here he definitely feels like

908
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: one of Nintendo's A-listers.

909
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And, well, not that he's not an A-lister,

910
01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:10.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: either in North America,

911
01:05:10.619 --> 01:05:14.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but he doesn't, you can see Mario stuff at stores

912
01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:17.980
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: in North America, Zelda stuff, too, everyone known again,

913
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but Kirby slightly below that.

914
01:05:21.739 --> 01:05:25.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But in Japan, I mean, yeah, yeah, Kirby stuff all over.

915
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.099
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mean, you guys have the cafe.

916
01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I mean, I think there's two Kirby cafes even.

917
01:05:28.099 --> 01:05:29.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Probably.

918
01:05:28.619 --> 01:05:31.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I haven't been to either sadly,

919
01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.599
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but I would like to.

920
01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:34.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, I would as well.

921
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:43.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, yeah, um, other, other Kirby Airrider thing, uh, man, those amoebos are really expensive,

922
01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: eh?

923
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, okay. I wanted to bring this off since we're here. Talk about the merge

924
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: They're so expensive.

925
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:56.179
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's bad. It's really bad in the U.S. I don't know how bad it is in Japan, but it's bad out here

926
01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's bad.

927
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, yeah, what's the U.S. price?

928
01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Again, exactly, 'cause I don't, I don't know.

929
01:06:00.239 --> 01:06:05.780
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So oh, okay, so I have to double check, but I will say this I

930
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, actually, that's a good idea, double check.

931
01:06:06.519 --> 01:06:11.059
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Went I went I will say this I went to a big box store

932
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:12.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh-huh.

933
01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:14.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Target while my camera break big again

934
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : you know, which is generally MSRP. That was 50, 50 USD. Yup.

935
01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

936
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: $49.99.

937
01:06:20.539 --> 01:06:21.860
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Man, that's rough.

938
01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:26.179
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm checking the MSRP here because a lot of places in Japan,

939
01:06:26.179 --> 01:06:29.559
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: cool thing, electronic stores, they sell below MSRP

940
01:06:29.559 --> 01:06:32.139
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to try to compete, which is awesome.

941
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [laughs]

942
01:06:33.099 --> 01:06:35.400
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like the Kirby iRide, the game itself,

943
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I got it for like 800 yen cheaper,

944
01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: because that's just what electronic stores do anyway.

945
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [Laughter]

946
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Okay, so the MSR

947
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:51.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: here is 6600 yen for the Kirby's, which in normal financial times would be like 60 US dollars, but because the

948
01:06:51.239 --> 01:07:01.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: yen's so in the toilet right now, it is 4266. I had a touch cheaper, but still significantly more

949
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm

950
01:07:01.519 --> 01:07:07.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: expensive than the like, this is like double the price of most, most amiibo's nowadays.

951
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

952
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.260
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, and

953
01:07:09.539 --> 01:07:16.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Feels me because like that was a big fan of me, but when they came out I have many many of me, but more than I should admit

954
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I, I also have quite a few and I still partake, I, yeah.

955
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:25.719
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I do - I will partake - but I mean it's not just curvy right like the best

956
01:07:25.719 --> 01:07:28.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I think obviously switch to is coming out like the way

957
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:37.199
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : it's just been jacked up by ridiculous numbers for many reasons, I guess, but I haven't bought well

958
01:07:37.199 --> 01:07:46.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I haven't gotten one of the Kirby amigo, but when the Kawasaki amigo drops at the wagon star, I'm gonna break. I know I'm gonna break

959
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.599
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: [laughs]

960
01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:45.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

961
01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Oh, he's got the hop star, I think,

962
01:07:48.519 --> 01:07:50.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is what he's got in, for the amoebo.

963
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.760
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : We see the hop start thought it was wearing a...

964
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, usually Kawasaki goes with the wagon, right?

965
01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:55.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like you're totally right,

966
01:07:55.079 --> 01:07:57.320
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but I think the amoebo is the hop star.

967
01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the new one.

968
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.440
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I'm looking this up. Oh, it is hopstart. Okay. You're right. You're right. Okay. Well, either we

969
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, you should.

970
01:08:01.519 --> 01:08:02.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
01:08:02.519 --> 01:08:04.519
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But you're totally right to associate him

972
01:08:04.519 --> 01:08:07.360
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: with the wagon star 'cause that's, yeah.

973
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.360
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

974
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.400
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Anyway, sorry, go on.

975
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:14.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, but it's I mean first what's chef Kawasaki who's one of my favorite like side characters and

976
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm.

977
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:20.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : The functionality of being will swap them is pretty good. So I'm probably gonna crack with color

978
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

979
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.279
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I really think, like, fundamentally,

980
01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:27.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that's why these things cost, like, as much as they do,

981
01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:32.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 'cause the brass tax of it is you are getting to amoebo.

982
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.319
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It is. Yeah.

983
01:08:32.079 --> 01:08:32.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know what I mean?

984
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.479
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, it fundamentally, it's to amoebo.

985
01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:37.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: When you look at the two amoebo sets,

986
01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:39.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: they cost quite a bit more.

987
01:08:39.159 --> 01:08:42.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but the presentation of the Kirby

988
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:55.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: ones where they are only usable as a pair really changes the optics of that right because even though in your brain you know there's you're getting two amiibos they don't work or look good without the other half.

989
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:55.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : it does, they don't

990
01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:04.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So it's it's really quite unfortunate and like even as I say that I'm on Nintendo's website looking at the latest amiibo sets.

991
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:12.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So Nintendo Blade 3 and Splatoon 3 sets where you got two amiibos in each of those sets. You know those are only forty four hundred yen which is still

992
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:08.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

993
01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:31.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: only two thirds the price. So they're I've seen them in the stores and they are quite nice amiibo but even as someone who still buys amiibo I I can't and it sucks because I look at that wing star and I'm like oh my god it looks so good but

994
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

995
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Right, right. Like it's not only this curvier I

996
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : sequel out, but I could buy a Winkstar merch and one of myself. And I'm not getting it.

997
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, I -

998
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I was the same same here. I can't bring myself to do it.

999
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:49.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, bites and like I look at you know one of the ones that that I find crazy is like you know

1000
01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:55.819
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I look at you know Kirby and Waddle Dee at 6600 yen and then I look you know just to the left of them on the shelf

1001
01:09:55.819 --> 01:10:03.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I see the new Metroid Prime four Samus riding the Viola motorcycle which is a very large amiibo and that's 3500 yen

1002
01:10:03.939 --> 01:10:07.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That is only like 55% of the

1003
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:37.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: price I mean I know it's not too amoebos but in terms of plastic girth and it is it is totally right there with it and it's hard for me to understand why the price is specifically so jacked on these it's I know Nintendo has like I don't love the switch to era of pricing for Nintendo I think the console is expensive but like whatever reasonable but I don't love the other.

1004
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah.

1005
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, yeah, of course

1006
01:10:35.659 --> 01:10:37.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1007
01:10:37.500 --> 01:11:07.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know increases we've seen but like these Kirby amoebo are though I think these are the worst price changes we've seen on any Nintendo things since switch to launch and I find it brutal cuz I like you I'm like fingers on the glass like what do I do staring longingly into the eyes of waddledy and wingstar? Badanity excuse me bandanity

1008
01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : The accessories the game

1009
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Bro, boy!

1010
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:13.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and then you know like like to twist the knife more you know these work

1011
01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : better when you have more than one cuz then you can do the swat

1012
01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:30.100
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : to move here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1013
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah.

1014
01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Right, like the functionality is so nifty,

1015
01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but you're totally right,

1016
01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:23.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: unless you go 100 bones in the hole,

1017
01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you, all you can do is take them off and be like,

1018
01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: huh, and then put them back on, right?

1019
01:11:29.239 --> 01:11:34.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, yeah, it's, it, like, I think.

1020
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So one thing that I think is true,

1021
01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:40.720
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is that it probably would have been a very hard sell

1022
01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.279
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to sell them separately.

1023
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that the vehicle separately from the riders.

1024
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Because I think they would have run into problems. I think like the hop star would probably be less popular and

1025
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh yeah, yup, we're in Tennessee, which tells, just tells for a bit.

1026
01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.479
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Bandana D would probably also be less popular than yeah

1027
01:11:58.239 --> 01:12:00.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Plus only having one

1028
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know

1029
01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:06.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: They don't look good on their own. They don't really stand even the the riders

1030
01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.560
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't believe they stand properly on their own either because they don't have a real base

1031
01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, like, I'm willing to believe that there was probably a conversation.

1032
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:29.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: In Nintendo that was like we should let players mix and match and buy them as they want but like the finances of that don't make any sense to me because you just end up in a situation where you have a bunch of the less desirables.

1033
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

1034
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:45.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know when you end up with with when Nintendo ends up with an overstock of 400,000 hop stars, you know, like it's so I don't want to I don't want to come off like I'm like caping for Nintendo's price increases because I do not like.

1035
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:57.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That but I it's it's like it's the realities of of these Kirby ones are brutal in all directions and I hate it.

1036
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1037
01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:59.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, I mean, it's it's brutal. Yeah. No, and I mean, I'm in the same book

1038
01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:10.100
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Look at us two world's biggest fans of this game the series and we are buying the the amoebo the merch that we could have on our desk shelf right now

1039
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: If bites, and if they were like, I'm looking at the other new amoebos.

1040
01:13:15.659 --> 01:13:23.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So like, Donkey Kong from Bonanza and then Samus and Cylex from Metroid Prime for the normal

1041
01:13:23.619 --> 01:13:29.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Samus, not the motorbike one, those cost 2,500 yen, which is higher than amoebos used to cost,

1042
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

1043
01:13:29.699 --> 01:13:37.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you know, a while ago, but, you know, when I look at that next to 6,600 yen for one of these guys,

1044
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yes, yes, and honestly like even if it was just 10 USD cheaper just 20% like

1045
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 30 bucks.

1046
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : 30 or 40 even 40 you know 40 even 40 I

1047
01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Oh, sorry, sorry, right, right, right, 40 bucks.

1048
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah, 20, 20 apart.

1049
01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:51.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Sure.

1050
01:13:51.039 --> 01:13:54.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Could I think I could stomach it, you know like

1051
01:13:53.779 --> 01:13:58.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think so too, like bearing in mind,

1052
01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:01.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like, yeah, it's just because we're such big fans.

1053
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Like for me like me specifically, I don't I don't think that would be a good price

1054
01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

1055
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But me specifically I could study get out for it

1056
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: No.

1057
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

1058
01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, at least like when I'm rationalizing,

1059
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.779
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like I'm getting two parts,

1060
01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:13.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it's not as brutal as like,

1061
01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:16.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 300 yen for a bottle of bandana D

1062
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that I don't really want that much, you know?

1063
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

1064
01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:22.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I'll be curious if when Meta Knight

1065
01:14:22.699 --> 01:14:27.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and Kawasaki launch, if people may be start swapping,

1066
01:14:27.899 --> 01:14:29.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: trading amongst each other

1067
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: because these things are so expensive.

1068
01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:35.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So for that person who just wants Kirby on a shadow star,

1069
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:46.600
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, but just I mean keep an eye on me when you know Starman on the transform star releases and I just break again

1070
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: don't need Meta Knight, but yeah.

1071
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:53.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I have to I have to imagine they're not going to do more like I I

1072
01:14:51.039 --> 01:14:54.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, I don't either five seems like a good number

1073
01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think there's only four I think it's only these four right so

1079
01:15:08.979 --> 01:15:13.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Which is neat that is neat that is genuinely neat you're right there are five might be

1080
01:15:13.939 --> 01:15:15.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, I can't imagine

1081
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:21.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think the prices are just gonna do the min. I can't imagine they're gonna do well enough to justify but we'll see

1082
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:31.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I will say this, the Street Fighter and Miibo that came out, they were 35 USDs fairly high priced.

1083
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:31.720
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

1084
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : At one point, at least on Amazon, they were marked down to 15 USD, which was more standard.

1085
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

1086
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So, there's hope, there's just limbo.

1087
01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.720
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We didn't get that experience in Japan,

1088
01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but I did see that that all American retailers

1089
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

1090
01:15:45.039 --> 01:15:48.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: had a significant price drop on the Street Fighter ones.

1091
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

1092
01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I, yeah, those ones had an unusually high price as well,

1093
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, and I-

1094
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:58.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, they are. Yeah.

1095
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: even though they're quite large and nice,

1096
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.359
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: they were a bit too much.

1097
01:15:56.359 --> 01:16:00.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I'm looking at Nintendo's Amiibo page right now

1098
01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:04.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: upcoming Rosalina and Mario, the Galaxy ones.

1099
01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1100
01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And those have 4,000 yen price tags,

1101
01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:10.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I'm like, oh, they're really big amiibos,

1102
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

1103
01:16:10.239 --> 01:16:12.479
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but like looking at their bases, they're huge,

1104
01:16:12.479 --> 01:16:17.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but still, still, I, I yearn for the days of Smash 4

1105
01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:21.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: launching with 999 US amiibos.

1106
01:16:17.979 --> 01:16:23.119
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh my gosh, it's 10. Yeah, 10 years. Do you leave us so good?

1107
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, March space is fucked up.

1108
01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't give a f**k--

1109
01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I like it for that way

1110
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - I like it.

1111
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Stop.

1112
01:16:28.439 --> 01:16:29.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah.

1113
01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Ah, for real.

1114
01:16:30.899 --> 01:16:33.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, so that's okay, that's correct

1115
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Mm-hmm.

1116
01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:44.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, I'm happy, I finally will sit down, so I want to get exhausted about it, and I'm more than happy too

1117
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think, I think I got, I think I got most of my thoughts out. I mean, yeah, yeah. Definitely,

1118
01:16:44.539 --> 01:16:50.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, me too, I think so too

1119
01:16:48.239 --> 01:16:52.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: just didn't want to let it go without talking about those amoebos.

1120
01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:57.260
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, and true to curve, yeah

1121
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Everyone, everyone I talk to in my life about the amoebos, they go like,

1122
01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:04.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: yeah, I don't buy amoebos anymore. They're too expensive. So what's different about this one?

1123
01:17:01.579 --> 01:17:03.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Wow, yeah, I knew

1124
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:15.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, but me too in the same position

1125
01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:11.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I'm like, you're right, but you shouldn't say it. Anyway, so I'm glad I had someone to

1126
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: talk to who's also like struggling anyway. Now.

1127
01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:19.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Let's bear very specific

1128
01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:25.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And I just want to point out true to true to the curvy air ride experience

1129
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:30.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mean, no shade whatsoever, but we just spent one an hour talking, you know, you want that or whatever

1130
01:17:30.699 --> 01:17:33.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Whatever length of time we taught and we didn't mention top right.

1131
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:55.220
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah bringing bringing in the actual vehicle and I think was a smart call and the map feel good, but but it's top right.

1132
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:42.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I didn't didn't at all. I was literally thinking like should I bring up top ride like just just now when you said was there anything else it's better

1133
01:17:42.619 --> 01:17:45.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: They made it better. They did they did more

1134
01:17:46.659 --> 01:17:48.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah

1135
01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:56.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, oh dude when I was playing when I was playing

1136
01:17:57.699 --> 01:17:59.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Roadtrip and I got to a top ride

1137
01:18:00.619 --> 01:18:06.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: level where my currently equipped vehicle was

1138
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:13.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the swerve star, I was not prepared for how that feels like the first time trying to use the swerve star and top ride.

1139
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : DIE!

1140
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:20.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But like that was genuinely such a really fresh feeling curvy air ride experience.

1141
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:25.180
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah. That was, that is a good one. Absolutely. Okay. One, one more small note. Actually,

1142
01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:26.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, highly recommend it. Shoot, shoot.

1143
01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:31.020
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I'll on that note. Um, I think like, okay, it's been a while since I've touched the original

1144
01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:37.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : air, right? So maybe just because my memory is outdated, but I think he balance fixed some of the

1145
01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:43.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : balancing some of those machines on those original machines, bulk star. Right.

1146
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, you reckon

1147
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:48.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Rocket star, they feel feasible. Yeah.

1148
01:18:47.159 --> 01:18:54.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah bulk star when I started my playthrough, I kept referring to it as a lumber and piece

1149
01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:03.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And but like getting to use it again, I'm like oh wait hang on a formula star as well

1150
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, I

1151
01:19:03.319 --> 01:19:06.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I feel like formula star is more viable now

1152
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:10.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, it feels like fun. I feel like formula is almost the best star now. You can go so fast

1153
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:15.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Formula is strong that was what I used in like the last boss race stage

1154
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.260
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And swerves. Yeah, yeah

1155
01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:21.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I was like I just need to crush these straightaways, and it just did it right away. So, yeah

1156
01:19:22.619 --> 01:19:24.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Anyway, you're right

1157
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:30.819
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And swerve stardin nerf just just a hair to you know where it can other machines can't be with it

1158
01:19:30.939 --> 01:19:38.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Swerve star was disgusting. I once won a money match at Magfest one year

1159
01:19:36.279 --> 01:19:38.279
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, oh

1160
01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it was, uh,

1161
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:45.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: swerve star on machine passage against another guy.

1162
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:47.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, I mean that you mean you mean the swerve star map that that map

1163
01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The swerve star map. Yeah, he was good. It wasn't like a total stomp,

1164
01:19:50.939 --> 01:19:55.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but like I always remember that fondly. So yeah, um,

1165
01:19:51.279 --> 01:19:53.279
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1166
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah.

1167
01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:01.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: yeah, swerve star was like kind of kind of too much in the original.

1168
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:16.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, so yeah, good job, sucker. You fixed the ones that were kind of funky.

1169
01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:06.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm definitely, I feel a little sad that it's like, I don't feel quite as

1170
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:10.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: ridiculously powerful with it but it's understandable and it's where it

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:24.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think so. I think so. I still... I still hate writing. Turbo, though.

1172
01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:19.300
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, God.

1173
01:20:22.659 --> 01:20:29.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, it's it's a little weird. Um, okay. Well, all right. Okay. There you go, folks. Welcome to the

1174
01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Kirby here.

1175
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's not.

1176
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:37.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, but now let's, let's, let's move on to our, I want to talk about guarding Guardians for real because.

1177
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm. Sure.

1178
01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:48.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Putting it from my perspective as is someone who followed you for, you know, here's on super best friends and streams and whatnot.

1179
01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:58.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And you know, I've always known you to be a passionate guy about games and game design and so on. And so seeing you take the plunge into making the game is very exciting.

1180
01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Certainly, right.

1181
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:04.739
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And I mean, "Spry Snow" and "Game Devs Hard,"

1182
01:21:04.739 --> 01:21:06.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : like I saw "Her Journey" and "It's Hard."

1183
01:21:06.659 --> 01:21:09.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And I guess, I guess, you know,

1184
01:21:09.539 --> 01:21:11.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : "Elevator Pitch" for the listeners,

1185
01:21:11.699 --> 01:21:13.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : what is guarding Guardian?

1186
01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It is a, it's a, it caught me five bucks,

1187
01:21:16.859 --> 01:21:18.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : USD on the Switch, right?

1188
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.779
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So that's the, like, I'm just putting the scale,

1189
01:21:21.779 --> 01:21:22.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : 'cause that's, you know,

1190
01:21:22.939 --> 01:21:24.779
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I think that's a measuring stick of sorts,

1191
01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:27.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : like, for games, I think it's fair.

1192
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:31.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I priced it that way, I think feeling like it was a small game, so you're not wrong to feel that way.

1193
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah, yeah.

1194
01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.140
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not bad.

1195
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.819
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's by no means a bad game, quite satisfying.

1196
01:21:36.819 --> 01:21:40.220
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I've enjoyed it, my games that I've spent more on, absolutely.

1197
01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:45.220
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And the gameplay is both the legally distinct term,

1198
01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : use LCD games.

1199
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:56.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Health CD yeah, yeah, it fundamentally it comes from my love of game and watch games and

1200
01:21:55.779 --> 01:21:59.180
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, it's a gaming watch game.

1201
01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:07.779
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, and you know, I did my best to design an original game and watch game because a lot of

1202
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There's lots of game and watch games out there more than almost anyone

1203
01:22:12.859 --> 01:22:17.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It could ever possibly remember and there's lots of LCD games out there and a lot of them

1204
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:23.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Sort of copy each other's homework and like you know, the game will be arranged vertically or horizontally

1205
01:22:23.739 --> 01:22:29.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But there a lot of them can be quite similar to one another and so it was it was actually like a really good

1206
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:37.439
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There. They are.

1207
01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:32.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: game design challenge because like

1208
01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:40.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Game and watch games are so concise like there's so little and I really wanted to kind of like respect the rules

1209
01:22:40.979 --> 01:22:46.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I didn't want to have like a scrolling screen or I wanted to to design something that

1210
01:22:46.699 --> 01:22:49.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: existed in the same.

1211
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:59.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: In the same conversation and they didn't have to be a little but this game is kind of different because it's you know it cheats in such and such way or what have you.

1212
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm

1213
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:12.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So it was a really tricky exercise actually like making a game with such tight design limitations that still felt fresh and different from other game and watch games.

1214
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:18.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I mean as a as a kid I the first game I ever own.

1215
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:26.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And was game and watch gallery to my mom bought me a game boy color and game watch gallery to.

1216
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Too specifically. I had that one too. That was a good one.

1217
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:47.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: To specifically such a good game I played the hell out of it and I eventually played three I didn't really play four ever but to remain like a sort of beloved game and when I was when I went back to college a couple years back.

1218
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, I did too.

1219
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.439
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:55.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: During our last semester it was like pandemic we were all doing class from home and stuff.

1221
01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:08.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There was like a series of classes at the end where we were just kind of like going over some stuff that I kind of like kind of knew already like some sort of boilerplate kind of like here's how to save your game here's how to.

1222
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was good information for those who didn't know it in the class but I had a little more experience so I you know.

1223
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, bad student that I was, at some point I like picked up my game.

1224
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:25.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I started playing Game of Watch Gallery to, uh, during a couple of my lessons where I was like, "Okay, I kind of know what's going on."

1225
01:24:25.699 --> 01:24:36.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, and yeah, at some point during that experience, like, I mean, I always loved playing this game, and I still did, and I was like, "I should just make a game. I'll just make one of these."

1226
01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.779
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So that's the genesis I was curious.

1227
01:24:36.699 --> 01:24:47.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, that's the Genesis. Game of Watch Gallery to specifically playing it, well, having a lifetime is worth of affection for it,

1228
01:24:48.500 --> 01:25:05.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: during the tail end of my, uh, college program, engineered, or like, targeting game development. So, uh, it became like, "Okay, I'm going to make like a quick, like, month, month-long, development version of this game."

1229
01:25:05.899 --> 01:25:15.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, and it'll be what it's going to be, and at the end of the, well, before the end of the month, I was like, "Oh, this is actually like, quite fun."

1230
01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like this is actually like a really surprisingly good.

1231
01:25:18.779 --> 01:25:25.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Game and Watch game, so I was like, well, I should take this to its conclusion.

1232
01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:34.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I should really elaborate this out into like as full a game and so the development idea behind it

1233
01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:41.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: kind of changed a little bit. So from the beginning, the one development idea I had was I wanted to

1234
01:25:42.899 --> 01:25:48.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: take advantage of like a couple limitations being gone. I know I said like I didn't want to

1235
01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:55.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: this might be viewed as a cheat. But in old LCD games, you know, characters can only occupy

1236
01:25:55.539 --> 01:26:01.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like fixed positions on the screen. And they sort of like appear and they move in like in steps,

1237
01:26:01.699 --> 01:26:08.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you know, from position to position on the screen. And so I wanted to take advantage of

1238
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:15.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the fact that characters could move without having to take like these fixed steps. And I also knew

1239
01:26:15.539 --> 01:26:18.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I wanted an element of resource management.

1240
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:26.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Not because I think game and watch game fans are like hurtin' for resource management.

1241
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [laughter]

1242
01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But because it's not an element that I see in Game and Watch games very much.

1243
01:26:29.699 --> 01:26:31.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You see that in like oil panic?

1244
01:26:31.699 --> 01:26:34.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: A little filling up Mr. Game and Watch bucket, you know.

1245
01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:38.779
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You see that in oil panic, you know, filling the bucket and managing that.

1246
01:26:38.779 --> 01:26:41.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And you see it in like cement factory.

1247
01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:46.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But not too many Game and Watch games incorporate resource management.

1248
01:26:46.899 --> 01:26:48.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So that was like a big thing as well.

1249
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:55.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: collecting the food from the bugs that you shred.

1250
01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:01.760
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : because yeah the bugs yeah well I mean the resource management in gaming watches

1251
01:26:57.659 --> 01:26:59.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, go ahead.

1252
01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:10.359
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : stress that's what it really is magic is stress yeah yep yep

1253
01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Right, yeah, just increasing speed, yeah.

1254
01:27:07.739 --> 01:27:09.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was fun to like thread the needle

1255
01:27:09.699 --> 01:27:12.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: of like the normal stress of game and watch games,

1256
01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:16.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but also like manage your resources.

1257
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:18.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: for anyone who hasn't played it, you.

1258
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:27.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the enemies approaching your plants in order to collect food for your plants, you basically feed the plants, the guts of your enemies.

1259
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:36.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And by feeding the plants, they grow and you can pick them for additional points.

1260
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:47.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's a really fun little balancing act. If you carry too much food, your character slows down, and you need to either feed it to your plants, or you need to dump it all on their own.

1261
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:53.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and just throw away all the food you've collected, just to get your speed back.

1262
01:27:53.500 --> 01:28:00.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, that's what I refer to as the coward button.

1263
01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:05.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, well, ideally, ideally you never press it. Ideally, you feed every food as soon as you possibly can, but it's easier said than done sometimes, right?

1264
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1265
01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, no, no.

1266
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:06.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, it's...

1267
01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:12.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I say people know I'm a hard-nose for, it's hard challenges or what.

1268
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's what I say.

1269
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:19.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But no, it's appreciated that you have an option to just drop it because, you know, that's a good idea.

1270
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.520
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah, I try to never use it as well.

1271
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I really kind of like the purity of it

1272
01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: just being like a D-pad.

1273
01:28:25.119 --> 01:28:29.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But early on, I was like, I need to have this option

1274
01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 'cause it's too abrasive when your movement gets slowed down.

1275
01:28:32.979 --> 01:28:36.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's too abrasive to not have the choice or anything.

1276
01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:41.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So yeah, so that was like what the initial design idea was.

1277
01:28:42.779 --> 01:28:44.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's just I wanted to add some resource management

1278
01:28:44.859 --> 01:28:47.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I wanted to have like, you know,

1279
01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like accommodate for enemies being able to.

1280
01:28:49.500 --> 01:29:09.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So that led to the enemies also sort of making a mess on your screen with how they run at different speeds and stuff like that, which is tougher on the old game and watch games because you have to like the whole game's logic has to move in steps.

1281
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:18.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So you could have an enemy who moved every one step and then an enemy who moved every two steps, but they're still fundamentally moving at pretty similar, you know,

1282
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, there's a tempo right?

1283
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:26.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: there's a very rigid tempo and this says a much looser tempo, which I thought was fun.

1284
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It is I think that

1285
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:43.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And once I decided to thank you, once I decided to elaborate it out to like a fuller game, the the guiding light was like, okay, what if Nintendo made Game and Watch Gallery 5 for the Nintendo Switch at the time?

1286
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:49.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: What would what would that look like in my mind? And a part of that process was like...

1287
01:29:49.500 --> 01:30:02.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: just thinking about it from their perspective. So there's some stuff that like didn't make the cut for me. Like I think nowadays it would be 3D art Nintendo does use a lot of 3D art mostly, so it'd be 3D which is fine.

1288
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:06.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh yeah. Yeah. The... (laughs)

1289
01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But that was something that right away I was like, I can't afford to do that. That's not happening. So my buddy did the art with me and he did an amazing job, but neither of us could do 3D stuff.

1290
01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:19.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that that that wasn't on the table, but the main thing for me was like if

1291
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:27.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: one thing they would almost certainly add is like a bunch of to do for

1292
01:30:27.699 --> 01:30:32.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: each of the games because you know you go back to the Game Boy ones and even

1293
01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:37.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Game Boy Advance one, Game Watch Gallery 4 and like fundamentally like the

1294
01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:41.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: thing to do is get high scores in each game and that's it and that's great

1295
01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you can sync a lot of hours on that if you're into it but if you're not the

1296
01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:49.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: type of user who enjoys that experience, if you're more of a type of

1297
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:55.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: user who likes to make permanent progress or unlock things or work their way through something.

1298
01:30:55.060 --> 01:31:01.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The Game and Watch gallery games and Game and Watch games, indeed, I think are probably quite

1299
01:31:01.119 --> 01:31:08.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: unsatisfying for you. And so I felt like Nintendo would probably do that. They would

1300
01:31:08.739 --> 01:31:17.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: probably make an effort to make each game have a variety of things to do. So that turned into

1301
01:31:17.739 --> 01:31:21.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: things to unlock and

1302
01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:28.359
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: sort of mission types there's so so the game that I made Garden Guardian it has that endless mode which is like the classic experience and

1303
01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: then it has

1304
01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the trials mode where you have

1305
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Six sets of three levels

1306
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:40.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: increasing in difficulty and varying and objective and

1307
01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:45.819
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: My feeling was like you know when intent it if Nintendo made a game watch gallery five

1308
01:31:45.819 --> 01:31:47.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Obviously, they're gonna have like a bunch of games

1309
01:31:47.979 --> 01:31:49.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I only had the...

1310
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:56.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: band with to make one realistically, you know, and designing this was definitely tricky,

1311
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:01.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: because the Game &amp; Watch design space has been so thoroughly explored.

1312
01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:08.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I kept it to just making one game and elaborating it as much as I could for what was realistic.

1313
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:12.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I feel satisfied with how it came out.

1314
01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:18.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Even me, personally, starting from a new save, it takes me like...

1315
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:24.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: an hour and a half to two hours to, like, unlock and do everything.

1316
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:30.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Except for, like, one thing that's, like, tied to play time that requires two hours of play time.

1317
01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:34.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It still takes a reasonable amount of time to do it all.

1318
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:38.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I'm very satisfied with where it came out, because I was somewhat concerned.

1319
01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:43.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I wouldn't be able to get this thing the last half an hour.

1320
01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:49.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But, you know, it lasts, and it's good, and I've played an in order to...

1321
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:56.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I still play it regularly. Like, I really enjoy playing it on my switch light on the train.

1322
01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:00.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I love seeing the scores on Steam.

1323
01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:03.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, there are a couple people who still play it.

1324
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:08.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There are some people who have psychotic scores, and I love it.

1325
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Some people have posted scores.

1326
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:16.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think someone has over 9,000 points in one of the mode, which is crazy.

1327
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh my goodness.

1328
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't think I've ever posted a score.

1329
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:26.539
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like 3,000, and that already was a slog. It takes a long time even to get to that song anyway.

1330
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.319
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, oh my gosh

1331
01:33:27.819 --> 01:33:32.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Thank you for letting me rattle off about the inception of the game, but...

1332
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, no the good stuff that's what I want to hear about

1333
01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:40.680
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So so I want to share some my thoughts from you know the other side the consumer the player

1334
01:33:42.479 --> 01:33:44.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : so

1335
01:33:45.039 --> 01:33:50.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : For such a small game, there's there's a lot to unpack because you know, it's just the one-game plate

1336
01:33:51.079 --> 01:33:54.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : mechanic loop, but it's so well designed and satisfying.

1337
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:10.199
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I have it tired of it, and like on this show, we review a lot of games that we very quickly can tell this isn't going to last long. We're not enjoying this, et cetera, et cetera.

1338
01:34:10.199 --> 01:34:24.899
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And because again, game development is hard and there's so many different bits and pieces that can go wrong or or be weak in one area, sometimes a game can be really good and still have one big flaw, but the other areas are good enough.

1339
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:54.899
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and so on, but this game like it's it's such tight package like it runs well it plays well like and again, maybe that's my similar bias of having played the game and watch kids games and I was younger, but you presented the unlockables with the art, the trial missions to set, you know, clear objectives, I think all that plays really really well.

1340
01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:05.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and it's it's such an easy game to pick up and just play for a little bit to you know, we get a tight score try to be to mission or whatnot.

1341
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:19.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So it's really well done and you had enough sense to bring other people on board, you didn't do the the concern day thing solo, diving massive game.

1342
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: hahaha

1343
01:35:18.239 --> 01:35:23.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I mean yeah, I needed help

1344
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and and.

1345
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:42.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and I think the folks who pitched in all that a great job the the visual presentation, which is such a strong element or such a deciding element for so many games, especially feels like on this show the cottage course space.

1346
01:35:42.000 --> 01:36:10.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I mentioned a bit earlier when I talked about like it you you frame it in this huge protecting your little garden trying to grow fruits and you're killing bugs to to let it you know.

1347
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:17.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : grow and pick up fruits and and that I you hit the you head out of the park with that that cozy feeling of tending to your garden and you know just protecting it it's it's almost relaxing despite the stress or speed that you know that some of the levels can get to and whatnot.

1348
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:26.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But it's a lot of those game in launch games were actually put this oftentimes felt very.

1349
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:37.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : And it's a very divorced from the suppose it scenario you're in right like game in watch parachuting I don't I don't know why he's parachuting you I'm just pushing.

1350
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.640

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Parachute is weird, isn't it? Yeah.

1352
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:52.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I'm just moving the the controls whatever I'm just I just want the the points I know what it's supposed to do, but here you you really feel the like it's living up to the name garden guardian and a lot of that charm is also carried by the the our our.

1353
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : um snippy shear every the last

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: He did all of the, like, art for the game

1361
01:37:22.199 --> 01:37:24.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: with very few exceptions.

1362
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm

1363
01:37:24.039 --> 01:37:28.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So the menu art, I did 100% of the menu art,

1364
01:37:29.399 --> 01:37:31.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It shows which I say lovingly

1365
01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but, thank you.

1366
01:37:34.239 --> 01:37:36.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I did the menu art, but heated 100%.

1367
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:46.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: He did 99%. I had one friend come in to, there's an unlockable classic UI layout that makes it look like an older game and watch title.

1368
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, that's cute, I haven't gotten that much.

1369
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:54.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I had a friend who did the classic UI thing, but other than that, Phil did all the art, and he did the design.

1370
01:37:54.500 --> 01:38:03.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We worked very closely on the design, though. I was literally watching him draw, so it was a very collaborative process.

1371
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Nice.

1372
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, what a very great design Snippy is a fun, I believe,

1373
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : is that the correct term for a little goat girl, I think, is that what she is.

1374
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:20.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: um she so like right like a fawn is like that greek uh like myth thing right uh and in our so we

1375
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.439
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1376
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:26.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: didn't really like define it hard the guiding light for me was like this was supposed to take

1377
01:38:26.159 --> 01:38:36.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: place i'm like a savanna so she was supposed to be like a gazelle girl so yeah yeah yeah you're not the

1378
01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Oh, that's why her horns are kind

1379
01:38:32.479 --> 01:38:35.520
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : in that shape. I see it now. I was okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1380
01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:44.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think

1381
01:38:36.239 --> 01:38:40.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: first person to say fawn cuz like it the game never lays it

1382
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.720
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: out, and it's not like a million percent clear enough, but that's also why the her appearance

1383
01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like her her coloration varies a little bit. Yeah, uh, that's

1384
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:58.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, I get that makes a lot of sense now and I think some of the the artworks that you unlock or you know, you get a better view of her

1385
01:38:58.239 --> 01:39:00.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I think it really feels

1386
01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:07.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You see the idea of like you know, go person or whatever more but now you say in poly. Yeah, I totally see it because the the horns are

1387
01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:14.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Are very much indicative that I get it and and you get the little ants fighting them off in the Savannah. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense

1388
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:11.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yeah, yeah.

1389
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:20.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the, I'm glad you spoke about the gallery

1390
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: getting you a better look, 'cause I'm very,

1391
01:39:22.699 --> 01:39:25.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: very happy with how the gallery turned out

1392
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : The gallery is so good

1393
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:26.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: in terms of content.

1394
01:39:28.659 --> 01:39:30.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The, yeah.

1395
01:39:30.119 --> 01:39:34.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I mean for it so for people who will hopefully play like he

1396
01:39:34.359 --> 01:39:40.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's the gallery's you're more or less reward system as you clear objectives and you know

1397
01:39:40.039 --> 01:39:46.260
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Is that trophies you get little artworks and you get a little comment from snippy on them and oh, it's it's so cute

1398
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:50.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's great. I adore it. Some of the artworks are very very cute very fun

1399
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I like the one where she's sharing the cake.

1400
01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:24.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : or whatever the ants and the bugs. That's a fun one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, okay.

1401
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:03.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the first anniversary art, I think, was what that one was.

1402
01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:13.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the art gallery, it's presented with these drapes on the side, and the way Snippy gets up to explain stuff when you prompt her.

1403
01:40:13.979 --> 01:40:23.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was very inspired by Game of Launch Gallery, Mario walking between stuff and the gallery aesthetic.

1404
01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I'm very happy with how that turned out.

1405
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's great.

1406
01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:40.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Only regret with the gallery is I think I would have liked a menu like a grid or something instead of having to just scroll through them all, but that's a small potatoes. Honestly, I'm very otherwise very happy with it.

1407
01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:41.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I mean like for switch. I think it is

1408
01:40:44.899 --> 01:40:57.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I think so too. And one thing that I'm really happy about with the gallery is like Phil and I are great friends and we became friends through, like, Broadway.

1409
01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:25.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And he was a fan of our old YouTube channel, but we really became friends working on projects and like, he, when he throws himself into a project, he gets so into it and like, a lot of the illustrations in Garden Guardian are just concept pieces. But there's a bunch of them where Phil would, I just be the weekend and Phil would send me a picture of Snippy that he drew. And he's like, what do you think? And I'm like, this is cute. And he's like, yeah.

1410
01:41:25.899 --> 01:41:27.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Anyway, we just ended

1411
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.060
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's a literally just fan art in the game.

1412
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:36.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: up with a bunch of the art, there's a bunch of art that has different looking styles,

1413
01:41:36.859 --> 01:41:41.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and it's all fill, actually they all have credits attached, then you can see who drew

1414
01:41:41.739 --> 01:41:42.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: what.

1415
01:41:42.739 --> 01:41:53.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, he drew snippy and a bunch of different styles and presentations just for fun.

1416
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, I was wondering if that was one person or not, I didn't pay attention to that, that's impressive.

1417
01:41:53.579 --> 01:41:56.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So most of it is.

1418
01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:59.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is a set there's a

1419
01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:14.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a bunch of art I don't know I want to say like less than 10 pieces that are like guest pieces so a couple of my friends I commission them to draw a piece of art for the game just to like so I could have a bit more stuff in the gallery.

1420
01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:23.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And it's one artist I follow who I thought suited it and then there's a selection of art that is fan art that after the fact.

1421
01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:24.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, that's so cool!

1422
01:42:23.199 --> 01:42:27.279
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There's not a lot of it because it was not a super duper popular game sadly.

1423
01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:33.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: One of them in particular that I thought was so cool. This is guy on twitter.

1424
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:40.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I won't say his username in case he doesn't want me to put it out there, though he has credited in the game with it.

1425
01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:45.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: He made a 3D model of one of the enemies in the game with a little animation.

1426
01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Wow.

1427
01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:52.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And when I decided, like, oh, I want to put some fan art in the game, I worked with him to get it in the game.

1428
01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:57.479
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So in the gallery, the initial silhouette looks like every other thing where it's just

1429
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:05.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I haven't seen that. That's so cool.

1430
01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:02.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a silhouette, but when you unlock it, it's actually a 3D model that rotates and animates,

1431
01:43:02.979 --> 01:43:09.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I made a whole 3D model viewer just for that one piece of art, which was really way too

1432
01:43:09.899 --> 01:43:16.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: much work for what it was, but I'm so satisfied with the result when I look back at it.

1433
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, that's so cool.

1434
01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:24.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I'm rambling here, but I'm really glad you thought the gallery was neat because it was

1435
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, it's fantastic.

1436
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:25.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: really nice.

1437
01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.479
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: those features that I look at, like when I'm working.

1438
01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:34.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm working on newer projects and I'm like, how do I ever make something feel that lovely again, you know?

1439
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:40.699
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : well okay well first I want to go back to snippy for a second hats off to Elle's

1440
01:43:34.699 --> 01:43:42.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, anyway, yeah, please, yeah.

1441
01:43:40.699 --> 01:43:46.819
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Elle's Beth he spent it if I've grown that correctly fantastic add addition to the

1442
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:49.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah.

1443
01:43:46.819 --> 01:43:49.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : voice to making it charming very very critical

1444
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:57.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: She crushed it, like, I had, so I've known Elspeth for years before that because she did, like,

1445
01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:08.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like, voice acting and streaming and stuff, and I had listened to, I had worked with her a little on a project before where she actually did some music for me.

1446
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:16.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's not really something she does, she like stopped doing it, like, during after that project because it wasn't really vibing with her as, like, a thing to do.

1447
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:21.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But, like, I continued to be friends with her and I had heard her, like, voice reels and stuff.

1448
01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:27.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And when we were designing this character, I was like, who could do this sort of, like, nasally high?

1449
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:35.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Perky, like, happy character, and she came to mind, plucky, right? That's the word, plucky.

1450
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Flucky

1451
01:44:34.199 --> 01:44:39.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, as people on this show. No, yeah, she did as people on this show

1452
01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: See you next time.

1453
01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:41.640
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, I am a big fan of

1454
01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Flucky protagonists like little girls. I don't know why

1455
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:47.560
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : But just several games

1456
01:44:48.159 --> 01:44:50.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's sakuna

1457
01:44:50.479 --> 01:44:54.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : There's a game called Mika and the witches mountains, but anyways, but yes, I'll fuck it

1458
01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:51.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Mm-hmm.

1459
01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:55.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Mm-hmm.

1460
01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:56.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: She crushed it.

1461
01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:58.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: She, like, I sort of said,

1462
01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I like this clip in your voice reel.

1463
01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:03.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Can we get something like this and this and this?

1464
01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And like, I had like no notes.

1465
01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like she came back with like the test audio,

1466
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's done.

1467
01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:12.659
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and it sounded just like the snippet you hear in the game.

1468
01:45:12.659 --> 01:45:15.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And she just, she just like hit it out of the park

1469
01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:15.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: on the first go.

1470
01:45:15.939 --> 01:45:16.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I was like, oh, wow, okay.

1471
01:45:16.939 --> 01:45:19.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Well, that certainly went well.

1472
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:30.819
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: She made it easy and she was yeah, that was really good. I was very glad to finally get to work with her on something and like bring that through to the end

1473
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1474
01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:35.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: She adds I think

1475
01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:45.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: one of the big successes from my perspective is that I feel like snippy's personality really like permeates every area of the game from like gameplay to gallery

1476
01:45:46.539 --> 01:45:50.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and Elspith all the little voice clips of which there aren't

1477
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:55.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: as many as you might think, they really punctuate it so well. I was really happy.

1478
01:45:54.500 --> 01:46:01.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : They do I fully fully agree, and nominal phenomenal work

1479
01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:06.100
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So yeah, I mean like I

1480
01:46:07.699 --> 01:46:11.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Again, it's kind of a oh, you know, here's here's here's the thing

1481
01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.140
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I thought I mean, it's small and scale perhaps a game

1482
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:21.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : We could say although I spent a lot of time playing it and I have a tired of it, which is quite testament to your work

1483
01:46:21.979 --> 01:46:23.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but

1484
01:46:24.539 --> 01:46:30.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : the one criticism I would have and this is a loving criticism I've had for many games what more

1485
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm

1486
01:46:32.699 --> 01:46:36.760
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Have you ever had thought of you know and and you know that that's

1487
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, yeah

1488
01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:43.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : More trials more enemy types or maybe another game and watch have you given thought to

1489
01:46:43.779 --> 01:46:45.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Either adding more here or sequel

1490
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Yes, yeah.

1491
01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:49.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: - Well, I'm incredibly flattered that you liked it,

1492
01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:54.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I'm glad that there are dozens of people

1493
01:46:54.819 --> 01:46:58.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like you out there who really enjoyed it a lot,

1494
01:46:58.859 --> 01:47:01.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: 'cause I like it so much,

1495
01:47:01.859 --> 01:47:04.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I was so worried when I put it out

1496
01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:06.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that nobody's gonna give a shit about this game,

1497
01:47:06.899 --> 01:47:10.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and I'm glad it did reach a couple freaks out there.

1498
01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:14.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So in regards to like, more.

1499
01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:26.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, yes, and I'm like super down to talk about it, uh, some stuff, very much scuttled, but other stuff. Yeah. So like more for this game.

1500
01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:31.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, the, there was, there were two other enemy types.

1501
01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:38.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, one of which got cut early for good reason and one of which I regret and I would have liked to feature it.

1502
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, but it would have been a lot of works. The first one was a projectile enemy who came onto the screen and shot a projectile.

1503
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:58.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, towards down the lane. And the problem was, although like, although that would be kind of like visually different, like, it was a little unclear how snipy was supposed to interact with them.

1504
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:13.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, in the first place. Um, yeah, so that was kind of an early idea that kind of went nowhere. It was just a little different and I was, I was trying to figure it out, but like, it, and it wasn't meaningfully different.

1505
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah, that's my first thought. Like, "How's that going to be going to guard against this?"

1506
01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:43.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So it was still something just coming down the lane, right? So, uh, so that one got cut early. Um, and that was actually like part of the process of like, coming up with the enemies was realizing that like, although not having the limitations of game and watch is super real, like the, the game's design is very limiting in terms of like what you can do with enemies. You know, like they, all they can really do is like walk forward and they have to,

1507
01:48:44.500 --> 01:49:13.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: again, eventually get to snippy so she can engage them because she has like, you know, she can't move off of her place base. Um, so like, you know, the standard move forward, they like pause, then move forward really fast. And then the bruiser enemy who you have to deal with twice ended up being like the ones that stood tall as like, really understandable, functional things. And it became really, it became evident really quick that like it was going to be very difficult.

1508
01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: To design another enemy that stood up to these three. So the projectile one was the one that I took the most seriously otherwise and after scuttling that, I was like, you know what, threes a nice round number. I'll just, I'm just going to move on from enemies because those guys are good and they make a good team. They feel good next to each other, I think. Um, the fifth enemy, the one that I regret, sorry, I just bumped my desk. Um, the one that I regret,

1509
01:49:44.500 --> 01:50:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but like, it would have taken a lot more work is I really wanted to have like a boss monster that would occupy the left side of the screen and. Yeah, I would have liked to have that an oversized boss monster that fills the left side of the screen that use, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but uses appendages or something to attack lanes in a variety of ways and patterns. Um, and that one would

1510
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That feels like a natural progression.

1511
01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: involve like more involved patterns. So it would like do all the lanes from like top to bottom or bottom to top and you'd have to like keep up with it, you know, or it would do, you know, anyway, different patterns that you'd have to like respond to properly. And after you did, after you were able to respond effectively enough, you would get an opportunity to do like a finishing move like out of like revengeions where she'd like leap across the screen and like slice it. Um, I

1512
01:50:44.500 --> 01:51:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: really wanted to do something like that, but it was hard. It like, okay, it would have been a lot of art for Phil, which, you know, Phil, Phil also wasn't working for free and he was, you know, we, we work together very well and money is not an issue between us, but like, you know, I needed to be cognizant of like this game's no budget because it was all out of my pocket. Right. Um, but even just doing a basic version of it would have been a lot and.

1513
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:07.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah, yeah, should have just done like a three frame judgment cut.

1514
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like I, for better and for worse, like I, I really am a bit of a perfectionist and often that is for the worse, but in, you know, in this game's finished state, I'm sure you can see that everything is quite polished and getting that enemy to a, a level of polish where it would, it would really, um, stand tall as like a fun, cool boss enemy. Uh, would have been tough. And the other thing was like, does this 100%

1515
01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:52.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: suit snippy, this big leap across the screen, final attack, kind maybe. But it was it was

1516
01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:57.060
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: something that I would have had to massage and like work on a little bit to try to get it to like

1517
01:51:57.859 --> 01:52:03.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you know fit as far as the like narrative design of the world goes. It was like a little too

1518
01:52:03.859 --> 01:52:12.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: actiony and so for all of those reasons it ended up not happening. Mostly for budgetary and work

1519
01:52:12.579 --> 01:52:14.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: reasons. I also did all the animation.

1520
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:26.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : door right my the I agree fully you know

1521
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:25.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: for the game. And that was a lot as well. So I do feel that the roster is really strong. The three enemies complement each other really well.

1522
01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:38.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But yeah. As far as making more trials and stuff, it's something I've thought about like going back to Garden Guardian and adding more content to it.

1523
01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I'm in, to be honest, I'm in like a tough spot with Garden Guardian because there's some stuff I want.

1524
01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:52.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I want to add to it. I would really, above all, want to add other languages to it. It's only in English right now.

1525
01:52:52.500 --> 01:53:00.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And like, so like, I regularly meet people in Japan and they're like, oh, I want to play your game. It's on the switch, right?

1526
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:13.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And it's like, oh, yes, but you can't buy it on the Japanese shop. I routinely meet people who, like, I have to say, yeah, you got to get it on Steam and it's only going to be in English.

1527
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Nah

1528
01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:28.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm bilingual, right? Like, I'm French, I'm from Quebec. And so that was always something I was cognizant of. But like, when the game was originally made as this smaller project, I didn't put all the hooks in for language stuff.

1529
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:43.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And like, I tried to assess that before the last major update and it was overwhelming to put them in retro, spectra retroactively. So.

1530
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, how can it be just copying the code

1531
01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:43.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and based it in the Google Translate.

1532
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:44.579
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Boom, done, right?

1533
01:53:44.500 --> 01:54:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, no, definitely the text is the smaller problem. But like, for example, the, all the nice menu buttons, they have like text that animates on them. And like, that wouldn't fit all the other languages, for example. So there was, there's a variety of like challenges there. And anyway, when I was assessing this stuff, I was like, discussing with like a close friend of mine. He helped me publish this on Switch. It's published under his company on Switch, actually.

1534
01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1535
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And, you know, he gave me a bit of advice that I think is true, but it's like a painful bit of advice. And he's like, this game isn't selling at some point you have to move on. Like, at some point. Like, adding more, like he's like, I totally respect and love how much you want to keep adding to this game. But like, it's a lot of work for you. And like, it's very minimal return. And actually, like, I'm not sure

1536
01:54:44.500 --> 01:55:14.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: try to get into this, but like, I'm very glad the game did break even. And like, it broke even. That's, yeah, a lot of people don't get that. You know, so, but the budget wasn't high. It was like $3,500 Canadian dollars out of my pocket. And that was like with friend rates and stuff. You know what I mean? Like, you know, I think all said,

1537
01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:59.899
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, bro, even honestly, I think that's impressive. I like it. It's yeah, yeah

1538
01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:04.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1539
01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:44.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm incredibly proud of this game. And I love it. And I still play it personally because everybody on the project gets residuals because that's how I set it up. Personally, I've only probably grossed made like $6 or $700 Canadian dollars on it. And yeah, every time, every time someone buys the game of the money that, you know, gets through payment.

1540
01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - You should be, it's fantastic.

1541
01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:24.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yay!

1542
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:36.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, listeners, the onus is now on you.

1543
01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:53.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: processors and Steam or Nintendo. 40% of it goes to me. 40% of it goes to Phil who did all the art.

1544
01:55:53.300 --> 01:56:00.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And the other, the remaining 20% is split with all of the people who worked on the game.

1545
01:56:01.779 --> 01:56:07.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Which has not been much for them. Sadly, I'm sure you can work those figures backwards and see that

1546
01:56:07.619 --> 01:56:12.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: they've made very little in residual. They did get paid upfront just to be clear. But yeah,

1547
01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, sure sure sure.

1548
01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:14.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the residuals have not been as good as I ever thought.

1549
01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I believe in that.

1550
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:21.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I believe that everyone who works on something should have equity in it.

1551
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, good on you boy. What a concept.

1552
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:25.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, yeah, yeah, I know.

1553
01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:29.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We also, I shouldn't brag about this.

1554
01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I shouldn't, but I will.

1555
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, you probably should actually

1556
01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:35.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We also like, well no, that's a specific thing.

1557
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:40.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: We also like donate a bit of money to planting trees with every game.

1558
01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:40.460
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Add there you go

1559
01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:43.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like, I shouldn't brag about that because it's not.

1560
01:56:42.779 --> 01:56:44.779
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No

1561
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:57.560
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: point. I feel so icky even bringing it up like that. But yeah, it is cool. I'm proud

1562
01:56:46.699 --> 01:56:47.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I

1563
01:56:47.979 --> 01:56:54.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I get what you mean, okay, you know, I find all bragging and selling for you. I get what you mean, but that ain't no, so that's good

1564
01:56:54.979 --> 01:56:56.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : That's good. That's good cool

1565
01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:03.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that we're doing that. And I more than anything, I hope other developers will see that

1566
01:57:03.079 --> 01:57:08.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: we do that. And think, oh, hey, we can afford to donate, you know, a little bit off every

1567
01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: sale. That was how I got it. I saw another developer doing that. And I was like, hey, yeah,

1568
01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:14.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's not going to break the banks.

1569
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:22.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: For me, you know, but like the economics have been rough.

1570
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : well. Yeah.

1571
01:57:22.079 --> 01:57:24.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Game sells for $5, right?

1572
01:57:24.399 --> 01:57:27.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So 30% of that goes to steamer Nintendo.

1573
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So you're down to 350 left.

1574
01:57:31.439 --> 01:57:36.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And then there's usually some little other fees like payment process, well steam handles

1575
01:57:36.199 --> 01:57:37.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: payment process.

1576
01:57:37.199 --> 01:57:39.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There's other stuff anyway.

1577
01:57:39.399 --> 01:57:44.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So you get like maybe 3 30 per unit when it's not on sale.

1578
01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:48.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I get 40% of that.

1579
01:57:48.119 --> 01:58:01.279
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So like per unit, I'm seeing less than $2, you know, like it's, yeah, gosh, yeah, she's quite

1580
01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:59.859
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, so start doing the math on to see how much Liam needs. How many copies needs to be sold for Liam to get the Kawasaki Amiibo?

1581
01:58:01.279 --> 01:58:04.359
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a few, um, 6600 yen.

1582
01:58:04.359 --> 01:58:12.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So like less than $2 a piece, but you'd still need to sell, yeah, like 30 to 40, maybe 40 copies

1583
01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:14.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to be safe.

1584
01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:18.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, it's the economics of rough.

1585
01:58:18.199 --> 01:58:22.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And that was a really interesting and tough experience for me.

1586
01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: When the game launched, it was actually four US dollars.

1587
01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was cheaper because I had done a survey with a bunch of people,

1588
01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:34.880
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a bunch of students in my program and new students in the program,

1589
01:58:35.439 --> 01:58:38.359
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: where they like did a play test and I got a bunch of great feedback.

1590
01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:43.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I also surveyed on price and like the price survey was really depressing.

1591
01:58:43.279 --> 01:58:45.279
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: cuz like I

1592
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I was surprised that people were like yeah, I'd pay like two dollars for this. I'd pay like I

1593
01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:56.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Was like two dollars you guys are in this game design program really and that's and

1594
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Let's go! (laughs)

1595
01:58:57.199 --> 01:59:00.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I you know, I priced it at four which I felt

1596
01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:06.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like I I wanted it to be around like four five six dollars in the first place cuz I I

1597
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : you know

1598
01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:10.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like the idea of making art that everyone can enjoy

1599
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.039
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Sure, well, I mean

1600
01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I think I actually still went to.

1601
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:36.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: love because that bit me in the ass, you know, it was like at the time I was making even even less and I've raised it to five when the switch version came out and also on PC after that, but even that has unfortunate knock on effect. Sorry, you were about to say something.

1602
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:30.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah. Bye. Yeah.

1603
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:43.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : No, I just like from again from my perspective consumer gamer perspective

1604
01:59:44.039 --> 01:59:53.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Like I will say when you're under tent like ten and under becomes a very like I think it's very easy to scale like

1605
01:59:55.079 --> 01:59:57.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know from

1606
01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:03.880
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Not paying four dollars for a game. I have no problem paying five dollars. I can like never think of a situation where I wouldn't want that

1607
02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Um and even

1608
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:24.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : going up to ten right like if it's maybe for nine for sure if you're single digits you're fine I think but um so that's just some food for thought but I get it like it's it's tough that's that's a whole you know the economic part of it racing and all that.

1609
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:30.560
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mm-hmm, I definitely think overall I went too low and like I don't think I can do that again

1610
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:34.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So yeah I think you could have done higher. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1611
02:00:30.979 --> 02:00:36.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, I think so too. I'm not planning to change garden guardians price at this point

1612
02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But like yeah, it is what it is

1613
02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:46.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The other thing the really bad knock-on effect is like when you price that low like when you're at five dollars

1614
02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:51.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like imagine how the economics get when you want to put the game on sale

1615
02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:52.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you want to put that game half

1616
02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:53.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah

1617
02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:01.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: off not even making a dollar per unit, so some developers have the strategy of pricing

1618
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a little higher than they like and counting on the sales to get them.

1619
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: What they actually want, and I get it.

1620
02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.979
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah, now I get, I think so too.

1621
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:20.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I definitely think that the next game whenever I've managed to finish another game, I'd still like to price under $10

1622
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.279
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: bearing in mind, the scope.

1623
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I don't think I can go that low again, like I think that was a mistake.

1624
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:34.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I was a very well-intentioned mistake, but it bit me in the ass a little bit harder.

1625
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Well, I mean, as an engineer,

1626
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : we have the Agile,

1627
02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:44.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : that edge of fail faster,

1628
02:01:44.159 --> 02:01:46.239
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : not that I'm saying this was a failure,

1629
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:46.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

1630
02:01:46.239 --> 02:01:47.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but learn from your mistakes.

1631
02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:49.439
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You get better, you improve, right?

1632
02:01:49.439 --> 02:01:54.439
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So, I'll go, yeah, yep, yep.

1633
02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:51.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, absolutely.

1634
02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:55.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And this is just another one of those learning experiences, you know,

1635
02:01:57.239 --> 02:02:02.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to continue on your question from before, if you're still interested, um,

1636
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yes. Yes. Yes.

1637
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: about making other game and watch games or what have you, right?

1638
02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:12.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So the, there's like two that I have in mind.

1639
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:15.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: um the one that I wanted to make and

1640
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:39.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: kind of wanted to wanted to make it right after but it proved to be not the right project to work on at the time was I wanted to make a follow-up game to garden guardian that is like a companion piece to it that would have been like very similar so like like similar menus I would have reused a lot but it would have been it would have starred

1641
02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:46.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: snippy's girlfriend who has only mentioned a couple times in the art gallery snippy's girlfriend

1642
02:02:46.000 --> 02:03:14.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and is intended to be an albino lioness and she has a she has a big mane and she is a chef and she so it would have been a cooking themed one instead of gardening and all of her cuisine is made using like the fruits that snippy grows and stuff like that

1643
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.899
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Ooh, I like that.

1644
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.359
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [music playing]

1645
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, that's so good.

1646
02:03:14.399 --> 02:03:14.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um,

1647
02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:20.220
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Spanding the snippy cinematic universe here. I love it.

1648
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So the two games were, yeah.

1649
02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, the two games were kind of meant to go together, and I didn't really

1650
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: envision anything beyond that really.

1651
02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:31.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, but I wanted to do that and I worked on it a little bit,

1652
02:03:31.199 --> 02:03:36.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but I was so burnt out on Garden Guardian at the, like at the time.

1653
02:03:36.079 --> 02:03:38.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Like I had, I had worked on it.

1654
02:03:38.319 --> 02:03:42.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It took about, it took a bit over a year to get the game out, uh,

1655
02:03:42.199 --> 02:03:44.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: which is crazy for a game of that scope,

1656
02:03:44.199 --> 02:03:46.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I worked my ass off to go.

1657
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to get it to like the level of polish that it's at.

1658
02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:48.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah, that's about to say, that's crazy.

1659
02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:53.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's very polished though, and that took a lot out of me,

1660
02:03:53.079 --> 02:03:55.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: especially the menus was tough.

1661
02:03:55.119 --> 02:03:59.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But arguably, I spent too much time on the game.

1662
02:03:59.119 --> 02:04:00.640
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But that's besides the point, which

1663
02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:04.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is that I was a little burnt out on that style of game.

1664
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Sure, sure.

1665
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Sure, sure.

1666
02:04:04.159 --> 02:04:08.159
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And the idea of plunging back into this code base

1667
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Muh-huh.

1668
02:04:08.159 --> 02:04:10.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to make a direct follow-up was tough.

1669
02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:16.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I also hit some early design roadblocks.

1670
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:20.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: In the process of making a game-and-watch game around cooking,

1671
02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:23.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that really holds up.

1672
02:04:23.199 --> 02:04:28.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So that's still something that I have that pin on the wall

1673
02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: metaphorically.

1674
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Okay.

1675
02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:35.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I'd be interested to get around to that at some point.

1676
02:04:30.159 --> 02:04:31.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Right.

1677
02:04:35.199 --> 02:04:38.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The other thing that I would like to make at some point

1678
02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: is as far as game-and-watch games go.

1679
02:04:43.199 --> 02:04:46.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I would like to make like literally another go at go.

1680
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't know if I would call it garden guardian to but like garden guardian ex or whatever.

1681
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I would really like to do that game.

1682
02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:59.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's glam. It's right there. It's guarding Guardians. Snippys cut.

1683
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: What is it?

1684
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Snippy's cut.

1685
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So, so like I guess what I shouldn't be so mysterious.

1686
02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I guess what I mean about not making it a two is like I want to.

1687
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:14.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I don't want it to just be like a direct like sequel kind of.

1688
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I want it to like take

1689
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:22.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a different tack kind of. I have some out there thoughts for it.

1690
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:28.600
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Are you saying this is a garden guardian remake, but with the capital like in final fantasy remake

1691
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, like a like a gritty reboot kind of vibe kind of jokey vibe. No

1692
02:05:35.239 --> 02:05:37.460
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: No, I have various thoughts on it

1693
02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:40.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I've thought about just like a straight garden guardian - as well

1694
02:05:40.439 --> 02:05:46.760
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I really if I could do it - I would really want to like get 3D art in there so I could do a lot more

1695
02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:49.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: With the animation side of things

1696
02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:52.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's a limitation for me, right? Like if I

1697
02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:58.560
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Want to put something in the game. I need to work with Phil to make 2D art

1698
02:05:59.079 --> 02:06:04.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And then animate it but like there's only so much I can do with the 2D art that's provided, right?

1699
02:06:04.319 --> 02:06:05.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I

1700
02:06:05.199 --> 02:06:12.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: If I got a nice 3D model of snippy if Phil helped me design it and then I could work with a 3D artist to get a nice 3D model of snippy

1701
02:06:12.319 --> 02:06:16.560
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I would have a lot more latitude to put a lot more animation and stuff into the game

1702
02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:24.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So so I if I made like a sequel I would want to like have 3D art and try to push things a lot more

1703
02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah

1704
02:06:27.199 --> 02:06:29.199
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So those are my thoughts for like

1705
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:36.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: future game and watch games. I'm not presently working on a game and watch style game. I'm working on something different, but

1706
02:06:33.500 --> 02:06:39.899
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, that's the next follow-up question. What are you working on? What is cooking?

1707
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:43.119
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm working on something a little different right now. I'm sure you've

1708
02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:50.239
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Some people have noticed that garden garden garden was quite a while ago. It's a couple years ago now granted that switch version took an extra

1709
02:06:50.779 --> 02:06:55.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: While to materialize so it's not like I stopped working on garden garden after the launch date

1710
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:59.039
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, I've, like, worked on a lot.

1711
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:05.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a lot of projects over the last few years and, like, I've had a lot of, um, you've heard

1712
02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:11.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: of the idea of, like, post-launch depression with, like, games for game developers, you might

1713
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.399
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I'm sure right right yeah

1714
02:07:11.399 --> 02:07:12.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: have, anyway.

1715
02:07:12.399 --> 02:07:14.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But, like, I had a lot of that.

1716
02:07:14.399 --> 02:07:21.560
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Garden Guardians launch did not go as well as I hoped, like, uh, I hoped.

1717
02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:27.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I had hoped I would be able to move a thousand units in the first month, was the thought.

1718
02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:31.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it only moves.

1719
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:40.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and then on switch, I was like, okay, 300 in the first month, and it sold like almost 200.

1720
02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:46.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And so like, I went through a lot of sort of like, I was pretty depressed about the results.

1721
02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:51.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Even though I broke even, which was nice, and people pretty much, everyone who, well, everyone

1722
02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:56.800
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: who reviewed the game seemed to like it quite a bit, and I got very few refunds on Steam.

1723
02:07:56.800 --> 02:07:58.960
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like I think Jen...

1724
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:27.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I didn't really pause it if I was towards the game, but the main thing was like most of the vibes were just nothing. Like most people weren't playing it, you know, like even a lot of close friends of mine. I don't begrudge them, but like didn't play the game, didn't touch the game. You know, like I felt like I didn't make something exciting enough that even people close to, you know, necessarily liked it. Only people who were real freaks for Game and Watch, so it was...

1725
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Sure sure

1726
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, right

1727
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It was challenging cuz I was really happy I really

1728
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:36.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: reached people, but I was also really sad because there were people I wanted to reach that I didn't.

1729
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:47.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And after, you know, spending so much time and money and energy on it, it was really hard that most of the user response was just silence.

1730
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:55.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And then there was a small amount of like extreme happiness, which I'm so grateful for cuz like it really made all the difference.

1731
02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:53.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : - Yeah.

1732
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:59.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And there was very, very little negative, so I was very pleased with

1733
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:06.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that, but as a result, I know I'm kind of like taking a little while to get to the answer here.

1734
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I worked on a lot of projects over the past few years that started and stopped

1735
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and haven't meaningfully gotten off the ground. Now that I've made a game,

1736
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I understand how much work it takes to get it for nothing to game

1737
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: and then from game to the standard that I want to hit, where it's very, very polished

1738
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:37.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: fun. So I am currently working on a project that I feel really good about.

1739
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:44.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's a very simple action game where it's kind of inspired by like NES titles,

1740
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: like single screen action NES titles, where you will control a character

1741
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: who has a variety of objectives within a stage. And there's a gimmick,

1742
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: There's a gimmick. I don't want to give away the gimmick sadly, which is like the core thing so I

1743
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : sure sure sure

1744
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:28.399
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: think I have, I think I have very little to actually say, but it's supposed to take place in a darker world, not as much like levity and lightheartedness, something a little more like something a little more like Baroque or shadow tower that is supposed to be like a world of violent, and so that's what I'm plugging away at now, this mysterious world of violent pixies.

1745
02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.079
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, so I don't know.

1746
02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:39.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: think Shin Megami Tensei, Killer 7, or what would the other hang on? I have a list of

1747
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh snap.

1748
02:10:39.739 --> 02:10:49.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Shin Megami Tensei, Killer 7, Discroom, if you know that indie game, and I can't believe I'm

1749
02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:55.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: not remembering this list of all things, Bangayo, definitely Bangayo, and also the

1750
02:10:55.899 --> 02:11:00.300
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: achievement grid from Kirby Air Ride. Specifically, specific

1751
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:10.720
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : of course. Yeah. Yeah. The single I, you know what the single one is. I think I agree

1752
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:11.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: the one from the first game, because I really like the one, the single grid. As opposed to the...

1753
02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:22.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : with you there. Like, yeah. It's just the stringliness. Like, it's a V-go, right? Yeah.

1754
02:11:11.859 --> 02:11:23.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Something about it. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, if you've never played the indie game

1755
02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:29.220
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: disc room, I highly recommend that, because that's like, that game sometimes feels like what if we took the

1756
02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:32.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: achievement grid and

1757
02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:37.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: from Kirby Air Ride and we made it a level selector. It's pretty cool. So anyway, I'm working on

1758
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.600
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : All that sounds red. No?

1759
02:11:37.699 --> 02:11:44.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: that and I'm really sorry I don't have more to divulge but like it's actually really early in

1760
02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:52.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: development and I only even spoke to Phil about it for the very first time yesterday. So like...

1761
02:11:52.500 --> 02:12:16.539
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, oh dang that is really early. Okay, I mean, hey, sure sure sure sure. Well, I mean, at least I'm I'm certainly waiting for it to be to pray through your next entry because I mean guarding Guardian has clearly shown you

1762
02:11:54.739 --> 02:12:00.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's really it's really... I've been working on it for a couple weeks but like it's really early

1763
02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:06.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm positive so I don't want to make any promises but I'm trying to make this.

1764
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:22.100
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and put a lot of care and effort and polish into your game,

1765
02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:39.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and just hearing about the struggle with financial success and whatnot.

1766
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:34.439
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm really happy you felt that way because I definitely think that's true, but yeah, yeah.

1767
02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:44.600
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's so hard because it's certainly not our reflection on you.

1768
02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:52.800
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You know, that's a whole other world of PR marketing sticking out and, you know, the games.

1769
02:12:52.500 --> 02:13:17.100
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's a tough crowd right now. We'd say that because I mean even here just in the cottage course space, like the number of games coming out is just ballooning and how do you stand out? It's really, really tough. Mm-hmm. Now.

1770
02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:13.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's wild. It's wild. Everyone says this, so it's not like it's like a crazy observation,

1771
02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:21.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but you can't slack on the marketing at the end. You can't assume that you have a certain amount

1772
02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:27.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: of Twitter followers or whatever that's just going to work out. I don't want to say that that's what I

1773
02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:29.420
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah. Yeah.

1774
02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:35.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: did, assuming that just because I had Twitter followers that would work out. But like I did so much

1775
02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:41.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: on that project, like relatively solo. It was not a solo project. I think most solo projects are

1776
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.939
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, right, right.

1777
02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:51.100
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: not actually solo projects, to be honest, but hot take. But you know, I did most of it, like 90% on my own.

1778
02:13:45.539 --> 02:13:46.380
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Ooh.

1779
02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:51.920
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's short, isn't it?

1780
02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:59.260
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And by the time I got to release the idea of like running an extended campaign was not, I mean,

1781
02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:05.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it was not appealing. And like, the plan became, okay, I'm going to announce, and it's going to

1782
02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:13.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: two weeks after. And I thought if I do it so tight, like maybe I'll be able to. I didn't need this game

1783
02:14:13.739 --> 02:14:18.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: to sell 10,000 units. I didn't need this game to sell, you know, but I just need to, you know,

1784
02:14:18.859 --> 02:14:23.739
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: drum up the slightest amount of excitement for it. And I didn't, my two-week campaign did not

1785
02:14:23.739 --> 02:14:29.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: go as well as I'd hoped in any way. I like did not, I was like, I'll edit the trailer myself.

1786
02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:34.619
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I shouldn't have done that. At the end of the project, I was so done. And the budget was so

1787
02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:41.899
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: which was tough. So like hiring someone to do a good trailer, even among the people I know that would have been,

1788
02:14:41.899 --> 02:14:48.140
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: you know, I should have done it in retrospect. But it was, I didn't have the energy left to succeed

1789
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : off.

1790
02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:53.180
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: at this, that marketing this game. And I think that bit me in the ass. So hopefully next time,

1791
02:14:53.180 --> 02:15:00.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'll have more for some. Can I, yeah, can I share an amusing anecdote about Garden Guardian?

1792
02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:01.439
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : learned and might play all means. Yep, go for it.

1793
02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:05.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Cutting a trailer for Garden Guardian was a pain in the app.

1794
02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:23.380
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And I was so exhausted by all the circumstances.

1795
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Heh heh heh heh

1796
02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.140
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, yeah

1797
02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:32.859
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's why the trailer came out so, so slap-dash, honestly, because I don't really want to do this.

1798
02:15:32.859 --> 02:15:34.699
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But I got to do it and I'll do my best.

1799
02:15:35.699 --> 02:15:45.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: This massive problem and I was like, okay, and I ended up like basically phoning it in, which is so unfortunate, because I didn't phone anything in for the actual game itself.

1800
02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.960
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Uh-huh, right. It's clearly in hot.

1801
02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:48.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, but...

1802
02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:51.119
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, look, me can still fix this.

1803
02:15:51.659 --> 02:15:57.739
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Soaksong is still hot. Reach out to Team Cherry. Get the colab going, re-skin the bugs.

1804
02:15:58.300 --> 02:15:58.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: God.

1805
02:15:58.340 --> 02:15:59.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Boom.

1806
02:15:59.699 --> 02:16:02.939
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hollow Knight, Hollow Knight Edition, Garden Guardian Hollow Knight Edition.

1807
02:16:01.539 --> 02:16:02.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : There you go.

1808
02:16:03.119 --> 02:16:04.159
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, there you go.

1809
02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:05.420
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Man, I, yeah.

1810
02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:07.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's so funny.

1811
02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:13.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I, I, I thought about like adding hats to the game at one point. Team Fortress 2 changed the game.

1812
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: But hats never happened, but that would have included hats for the bugs, of course, so.

1813
02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:22.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh

1814
02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:27.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: One problem I ran into when I was adding features post-launch, because I added quite a few.

1815
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:34.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Was that like adding stuff to the menus was too labor intensive, because the menus are pretty nice.

1816
02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:46.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So I was like, oh, I can't add a new button to the main menu, huh? Like, that's actually like removing a button and replacing it with a different shaped one and adding a new one next to it.

1817
02:16:46.500 --> 02:17:04.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's actually too much work, huh? Like, I can't realistically do that, and I, I myself a little bit in that regard, which is why the extra's menu has totally uniform buttons, because it became, it was the only place where I could like, put stuff in.

1818
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Mm-hmm

1819
02:17:04.659 --> 02:17:06.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Score

1820
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:16.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: The first game I ever made a menu for, by the way. And that, I think, shows in my mistakes. I did a good job, I think, but my mistakes are definitely ever.

1821
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.280
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Sure, well, I mean you still killed it

1822
02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:16.340
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : You did

1823
02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:24.659
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, just call up either the the people does the menu for persona games or or soccerize wife take your pick

1824
02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:30.299
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah. I'll call Ms. Sakurai, I've got, if only, if only, if only, if only. I'm happy with how

1825
02:17:30.299 --> 02:17:36.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: it turned out. And genuinely, I did not expect to get to talk about it so much tonight, and I'm

1826
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:43.020
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: really grateful that you wanted to, because I always feel like I have a lot to say about it, and I'm

1827
02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:45.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: very proud of it, and it's nice to speak about it.

1828
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:54.440
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : as as you should be like it's so I should I put this like again it's it's game and watch

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : s games so a little smaller in scale than say full farming game but I can't stress enough like

1830
02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:08.280
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : how you can feel the polishing quality on this game right um and it just when because we look at

1831
02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:14.280
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : a lot of games on the show and so it's it's tough I get I don't mean to throw shade on anyone

1832
02:18:15.639 --> 02:18:21.879
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I think you you you set a high bar for what you put out

1833
02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:27.979
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Thank you. I'm I'm really glad you think so and I'm I to be honest. I'm terrified of that bar

1834
02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:35.079
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : mmm yeah oh yeah yeah I get that I get that

1835
02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:32.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's a

1836
02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:34.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's a

1837
02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:44.959
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's a problem now. It's like I spent spent such a long time to put the bar so high and now I have to do better with less money

1838
02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:44.840
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah.

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : All up the Hollow Knight people.

1842
02:18:51.739 --> 02:18:58.700
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Call up the hall on at your right, you're right, but no, well, thank you. I'm really glad. It's very flattering to hear

1843
02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:58.680
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's literally a pair of guys.

1846
02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:15.940

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's an easy buy and an easy recommend you'll get enjoyment out of this game, I guarantee.

1849
02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:22.500
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Thank you.

<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: You know, I really didn't have the impression we were going to talk about Garden Guardian

1851
02:19:26.139 --> 02:19:29.579
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: all that much tonight, so I'm just very flattered by the whole thing.

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Oh, I mean, like, oh yeah, no, that was more or less the point of my duty to our cottage

1853
02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:38.459
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : core nature and I always find it fascinating.

<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : What are you going to talk to developers in the whole creative process.

1855
02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:56.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : All right, but that said, though, is there anything else you'd like to plug to add to say to our audience, where to find you, not to find you, find other things, whatever you want to say.

1856
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:57.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Hmm. Well, the main plug, the most important plug is always garden garden for sure. I was actually,

1857
02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:03.299
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : the absolutely on switch and steam

1858
02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:04.319
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I did actually have that in mind, but that's on, that's on Switch and Steam. It's also on itch.io,

1859
02:20:04.319 --> 02:20:13.120
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: but like, buy it wherever you like the best. Um, the, yeah, um, Steam version has great Steam deck support.

02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:19.600
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Switch version just kicks ass. I, I did the port myself actually. I'm really proud of it. It came out really well.

1861
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:25.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : It's great, ooh what you should be because that's always well in this space that's always that's often a problem to switch forward

1862
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:33.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: It's not a given, eh? Like, you know, you do need to opt even even a game like Garden Guardian there were some optimizations. I had to make

1863
02:20:34.079 --> 02:20:41.440
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: uh, and I I used to had the opportunity to work on some Vita games in the past that never never shipped sadly

1864
02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:46.739
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : that's the go home on that's our goal when do we get guarding Guardian on the

1865
02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:43.920
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: uh, but I

1866
02:20:46.559 --> 02:20:53.200
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Garden Guardian on the Vita man. It was one of those things I wanted to do, but it wasn't realistic. So, you know

1867
02:20:46.739 --> 02:20:49.260
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Vita

1868
02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, but anyway, I did.

1869
02:20:56.799 --> 02:20:59.360
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Optimization stuff back then. So I'm thankful I did.

1870
02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:11.840
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, other than that, um, I occasionally write on a little blog, you can find at rising superblog, which is rising super dot blog is the website.

1871
02:21:12.319 --> 02:21:18.879
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm currently writing a, uh, I write basically reviews, but they don't have scores on them.

1872
02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:25.680
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, I guess that still counts as review. I did two with scores, because when you get a key from someone, they kind of expect

1873
02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:46.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I'm currently writing an article on the recently released fire emblem shadows, the, uh, mobile social deduction game, which I've enjoyed quite a bit in spite of its problems that are maybe only evident to people who play it for longer than, you know, one match in this game sucks.

1874
02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:37.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [laughs]

1875
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : [Laughter]

1876
02:21:46.319 --> 02:21:53.639
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, other than that, I mean, I have a near dead YouTube channel called rising super stream.

1877
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Uh, I really only...

1878
02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:04.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: do, like, reaction videos to, like, Nintendo Directs and, uh, recently some Kirby-Air Ride videos.

1879
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:09.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: And you can find me on Twitter and Blue Sky at Liam Allen Miller.

1880
02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:06.500
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Hey, keep that going. That's so hot.

1881
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: So...

1882
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah.

1883
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's me.

1884
02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Garden Guardian's the number one thing.

1885
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Um, and if...

1886
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: If you enjoy it, if you enjoy anything I ever made, I will feel very flattered.

1887
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Cause I'm...

1888
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I feel like I'm just...

1889
02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: I feel like I've just had, um...

1890
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:30.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: been so lucky to be able to entertain people.

1891
02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:40.219
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : All right, well, thank you so much, Liam for coming on and chatting to the point where I'm clearly losing my books.

1892
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:48.200
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: That's no problem. Oh no.

1893
02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:50.959
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Um, that that is irrelevant to this conversation. I've been sick and I think it's hitting me right now, but, um, that it's fine. It's my, um,

1894
02:22:51.700 --> 02:23:02.479
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : but I, this is a fantastic chat. You heard of folks go, go, finally a mallet Miller up in, in the tweeters and the blue sky. Go check out guarding Guardian more than anything. I cannot.

1895
02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:16.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : I would recommend enough. Um, and since presumably this is and the episode, uh, unless all you're going to cut it out, I don't know, but, uh, until next time listeners have a good harvest.

1896
02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:25.780

<v 0503BB9B-BDF7-4CB9-BD09-E8B91317FC95>Theme Tune: discussed in this episode.

1901
02:23:49.000 --> 02:24:02.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So, one of the things on this podcast, we do a site show called The Green House where we talk about non-cottage court, whatever, just anything we want.

1902
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:06.340
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Is there such a thing? Is there such a thing outside of cottagecore?

1903
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:08.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So, what?

1904
02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:13.879
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Other media out there in the world is the listeners of this podcast having their innocent ears exposed to

1905
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:18.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Well, look, sometimes it's Eurovision, there's annual Eurovision episodes.

1906
02:24:13.879 --> 02:24:18.799
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: a lot? Right, right.

1907
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:28.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : One of my favorite episodes of The Green House was one of the co-hosts, his name is Johnny.

1908
02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:38.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : He's a lot more pragmatic and maybe cynical, I guess, about things. He's a little harsher on judging media.

1909
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:49.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : So, like Sonic games, he's fairly harsh on. So, one of my favorite episodes of The Green House was just going down the list of Sonic characters introducing him to the art.

1910
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:55.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : and having him rate the characters without knowing who they were really.

1911
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.959
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Mmm, that's a good little premise.

1912
02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:06.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Yeah, that was a fun time. We both at least agreed cream and cheese were like, you know, S5 star tier. So, I felt good about that.

1913
02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
<v D211A3EE-9975-4DC0-A619-9C737CB9C459>Liam: Yeah, those hold up

1914
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:17.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay. Anyway, so, I brought that up because we go through long session sometimes when we'll do an episode and then a greenhouse and they'll take a break. But so, it's totally fine.

1915
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : Okay, but let's

1916
02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
<v E02CEF00-6127-4A29-BAFF-94FB576CC849>Kevin : let's get back to it.
