## Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al,
(0:00:36) Codey: and my name is Kody.
(0:00:38) Al: and we're here today to talk about Cutscore Games.
(0:00:43) Codey: A woo woo woo, ow, ow, ow.
(0:00:46) Al: And also about how tired I am because I was up late watching Eurovision last night.
(0:00:50) Codey: We don't talk about that right now.
(0:00:52) Codey: We did talk about it, listeners, so check that out but,
(0:00:56) Codey: or maybe not, or maybe, no, check it out, check it out.
(0:01:00) Codey: Here's some of our,
(0:01:00) Al: Oh yeah.
(0:01:02) Codey: here's some of our very deeply held beliefs.
(0:01:08) Al: This episode, however, we're going to talk about Ever After Falls. Well, I'm going to talk about
(0:01:12) Al: Ever After Falls, and then probably Cody will ask me some questions about it, because good.
(0:01:16) Codey: I'm going to ask questions about it because I did not.
(0:01:20) Al: Obviously we have the news, etc, etc. Also, just a piece of housekeeping. There will be a short
(0:01:30) Al: podcast for a couple of weeks after this episode. Life gets in the way, and I realized I haven't
(0:01:34) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:01:36) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:01:39) Al: actually had an episode off in the entire time that I've been on. So for four years it was every
(0:01:45) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:01:45) Al: single two weeks without a break, and then for two and a half years it's been every single week
(0:01:51) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:01:51) Al: for that time. So I'm going to take a couple week break, and we'll see how that goes.
(0:01:55) Codey: Yeah, you you deserve it
(0:01:59) Codey: Yeah for folks who might be like what I'll hasn't been on some episodes he still edits them
(0:02:01) Al: That prepares them. The news is a lot... Again, the news is a lot of work.
(0:02:05) Codey: And prepares them and does everything
(0:02:10) Al: So yeah, we'll see how that goes. Apologies if this is an important part of your week.
(0:02:17) Al: You're going to even have to deal with it for a couple of weeks. That's life.
(0:02:23) Al: So yeah, we're going to talk about Ever After Falls. We've got a bunch of news. But Cody,
(0:02:26) Al: what have you been up to?
(0:02:28) Codey: I wrote stuff down, I should reference that.
(0:02:35) Codey: I have been up to not taking my medication yesterday
(0:02:38) Codey: on accident, so I'm a little crazy right now.
(0:02:40) Al: - Oh no.
(0:02:44) Codey: Normally I'm normal, but I'm not, that's a joke.
(0:02:47) Codey: I have been playing Breath of the Wild.
(0:02:50) Codey: I have now done All But the Camel to Find Beast,
(0:02:56) Codey: and I have the math.
(0:02:58) Codey: Master Sword. Though I... it's like saying that it's it's Eepy right now. Do I just have to leave it alone for a while? Like, like when the when it's, you know, the Master Sword, when the Master Sword's like...
(0:03:07) Al: the divine beast? Or the master sword? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so you can only use it
(0:03:16) Al: until like, it's essentially, it breaks, but differently from the other ones, and then after
(0:03:19) Codey: Yeah, air clothes, yeah.
(0:03:22) Al: a while it rejuvenates and it's fine. You can do, there is a thing you can do where you'd,
(0:03:29) Al: if you do the trial of the sword, it's like a big, long, difficult challenge. And if you do that,
(0:03:35) Al: than your master sardoke beach.
(0:03:37) Al: I think you can charge all the time. But it is very difficult.
(0:03:38) Codey: Ooh, okay, I gotta find that. Cool. Yeah, because that's one thing. And then I went to the I went
(0:03:47) Codey: to the Deku tree and he was like, sup, looks like your sword's tired or whatever. Or like,
(0:03:53) Codey: if it happens, you need to give it time to recharge. And I was like, does that mean
(0:03:57) Codey: I need to like, put it back in the stone, but then I couldn't figure out how to do that.
(0:03:59) Al: No, you just wait. Just leave it where it is and it's all good.
(0:04:02) Codey: Okay, cool. Uh, yep, other than that, I'm just kind of exploring in that game.
(0:04:08) Codey: So just like jump on and be like, I'm just gonna strike off in this direction. And then, oh, look,
(0:04:13) Codey: my Sheikah thingy is like, there's a shrine over here. Or like, oh, look, that's clearly a little
(0:04:20) Codey: Korhok puzzle. Yep, and I'm finally getting, I'm also like, starting to try and min max my,
(0:04:22) Al: Yeah, it's kind of what the game is for.
(0:04:30) Codey: and by that, I mean, just upgrade all of my clothing. So I've, I've started a notebook of
(0:04:37) Codey: what uh...
(0:04:38) Codey: items I need to upgrade my clothing um yeah so i'm doing that I still play honey grove
(0:04:47) Codey: is that what it's called I don't know it's a little bee a little bitty game on my phone
(0:04:52) Codey: yeah honey grove I still play that uh they've had a good update recently which is super cute
(0:04:56) Codey: um this isn't like in the news or anything it's just it it's been updated um
(0:05:02) Codey: and yeah my one comment to them is every week they have these like weekly tasks there's
(0:05:08) Codey: ladybug that comes and you she can you can get like really good stuff if you plant stuff for her
(0:05:14) Codey: I should do that right now um and uh if you don't make it then you're kind of just screwed
(0:05:22) Codey: but sometimes I like like it's she's like oh I want these beefsteak tomatoes and so i'll grow
(0:05:26) Codey: like a million of them but then she won't want any more and so then I just have grown a bunch
(0:05:32) Codey: and then the next week next time she comes and she wants those like it's just back to zero
(0:05:37) Codey: which is stupid because i'm like
(0:05:38) Codey: I know that I grew a lot of these and I had a bunch extra so if you're listening honey grove
(0:05:45) Codey: developers please let that roll over that would be great because otherwise it's almost impossible
(0:05:51) Codey: to get the thing and I really want this bee windmill that i'm trying to go for right now
(0:05:59) Codey: and then finally the other the last thing that i've kind of been doing on top of research is
(0:06:04) Codey: and dog sitting is gardening. So legitimately in...
(0:06:08) Codey: the soil gardening I have some peppers and stuff in pots now. Next week it's
(0:06:16) Codey: supposed to get kind of chilly so instead of putting them in the ground
(0:06:20) Codey: I have left them... I up potted them from the little things containers they came in
(0:06:26) Codey: from the garden center and I'm gonna buy some raised bed soil but I'm gonna give
(0:06:31) Codey: it a hot minute and then after it is done being 50 degrees
(0:06:38) Codey: slash it's probably like what like nine degrees for y'all. Cold. Once it's done
(0:06:46) Codey: doing that then I will finally put things in the ground and I'm preparing
(0:06:49) Codey: my raised bed. I've been going out and weeding it every week. Yeah. That's
(0:06:54) Al: Nice
(0:06:56) Codey: pretty much it. What about you?
(0:06:58) Al: What about me I've done I have played a lot of ever after falls less so this week I
(0:07:06) Al: Stopped playing it for something else
(0:07:08) Al: I can't remember what the other thing was I was playing. Oh, yeah, I was playing the ratopia demo for last week
(0:07:15) Codey: Mm-hmm. I still need to listen.
(0:07:15) Al: That's what it was. Um, and I haven't got back into ever after falls, but I've still got lots talk about it
(0:07:23) Al: like 60 hours in.
(0:07:24) Al: Or something, so plenty to talk about.
(0:07:27) Al: And then today I just started my Pokémon Shield save file.
(0:07:33) Al: So you might remember that I have been, you know,
(0:07:35) Al: doing lots of living DEXs and the Pokémon home DEXs,
(0:07:42) Al: and I have previously done Professor Oak Challenges.
(0:07:46) Al: And the one game that I hadn't got a postgame save file
(0:07:55) Al: was Pokémon Shield, and the Sword and Shield DEX is the one I don't have a living DEX for,
(0:08:01) Al: nor do I have the Pokémon home version finished either, for which you get the shiny Keldio,
(0:08:04) Codey: Mm.
(0:08:08) Al: which I need for my shiny living DEX.
(0:08:11) Al: So I started that today.
(0:08:14) Al: I've been feeling a little bit like I'm not sure what to do game-wise,
(0:08:17) Al: because we're so close to the Switch 2 coming out,
(0:08:20) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:08:20) Al: and I know that I'm going to be all in on Mario Kart when that comes out.
(0:08:25) Al: And so I'm just like, I'm not really sure what to do.
(0:08:27) Al: So I was like, let me just do this for just now.
(0:08:29) Al: And I'm just going to set myself a deadline of when the Switch 2 comes out,
(0:08:34) Al: and we'll just see how much I get done by then.
(0:08:37) Al: And I've undecided as to whether I'm doing it as a Professor Oak Challenge.
(0:08:42) Al: I guess maybe I'm going to start that, and if I get bored, I'll stop.
(0:08:47) Al: It's hard to know whether I'll want to or not, because I've done so many of them.
(0:08:52) Al: We'll see.
(0:08:54) Al: I've started it.
(0:08:55) Al: I've not really done much yet.
(0:08:56) Al: I'm just kind of getting through the boring beginning of Pokemon game stuff
(0:09:00) Al: that you always have, like, oh, here's all these people, and here's this stuff,
(0:09:03) Al: and you go do this random tiny fetch quest to get your Pokemon, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
(0:09:09) Al: Just give me my Pokemon.
(0:09:10) Al: Let me go catch some more, please.
(0:09:14) Codey: >> Mm-hmm.
(0:09:14) Al: That's the game.
(0:09:14) Al: I want to get into the game loop.
(0:09:16) Al: I don't want your tutorial at the beginning.
(0:09:19) Al: So yeah, we'll see how that goes.
(0:09:22) Al: we got two and a half weeks.
(0:09:24) Al: Till the switch to comes out, I think. One, two. Yeah, two and a half weeks till it comes out.
(0:09:31) Al: Although, technically, I won't be getting it until two days later, because I will be in the Isle of
(0:09:35) Al: Man when it comes out, and I don't have it shipping to the Isle of Man. Because that would be silly,
(0:09:40) Al: because it would almost certainly be late, and then I would leave the island, and it would arrive
(0:09:45) Al: after me. And that is not what we want. So it is coming to my house, and I will get it when I get
(0:09:46) Codey: Yeah.
(0:09:52) Codey: That'll be good. I don't have any plans to get that.
(0:09:58) Codey: So.
(0:09:59) Al: So yeah, that's what we've been up to, woo!
(0:10:02) Codey: Oh
(0:10:03) Al: Let's talk about some news.
(0:10:05) Al: So first up, we have Chill Town have announced that their 1.0 is out now.
(0:10:10) Codey: yep, that's the tweet.
(0:10:13) Codey: They did say that if you're a turning player,
(0:10:15) Codey: so if you've played the early access
(0:10:17) Codey: and you have a save file,
(0:10:18) Codey: save file is still compatible,
(0:10:20) Codey: but that they still recommend starting a new game
(0:10:24) Codey: for the quote unquote safest experience
(0:10:27) Codey: because they say it avoids any unforeseen issues.
(0:10:29) Codey: So it is possible for you to do so
(0:10:32) Codey: to just keep going with the save file that you had,
(0:10:35) Codey: but maybe start with a new one,
(0:10:36) Codey: just to be on the safe side.
(0:10:39) Al: I don't know who you're talking about.
(0:10:40) Codey: Some people feel strongly about that kind of stuff.
(0:10:44) Codey: Okay, is it not you?
(0:10:46) Al: Well, yeah, it is me.
(0:10:48) Codey: It is you, I thought so.
(0:10:49) Al: Of Life and Land have also announced that their 1.0 is also out now.
(0:10:54) Codey: Oh, woo, and that on their page,
(0:10:57) Codey: it says something like,
(0:10:59) Codey: it's now available to buy it for yourself or for a friend.
(0:11:03) Codey: And you know what, Al, you've got a friend in me.
(0:11:06) Codey: I am a friend, someone should buy me this game.
(0:11:10) Codey: No, there's a 40% introductory offer right now on Steam
(0:11:15) Codey: and the Steam has it on Windows and Mac.
(0:11:20) Codey: And so it's only 15 bucks.
(0:11:22) Codey: And then there's a bundle that has the supporter edition,
(0:11:32) Codey: Um, but that one comes out, uh, or that's also 14% off.
(0:11:38) Codey: Um, the supporter pack gives you wallpapers, digital art posters.
(0:11:42) Codey: That's really cute.
(0:11:43) Codey: Digital art poster paper Fox folding instructions.
(0:11:47) Codey: Holy heck.
(0:11:48) Codey: I want the paper Fox.
(0:11:48) Al: Amazing, just just what you need.
(0:11:49) Codey: Uh, I legitimately do want that paper Fox.
(0:11:54) Al: You can just buy this a quarterback if you want.
(0:11:54) Codey: Um, which is only $3 right now.
(0:11:59) Codey: I might buy that.
(0:12:00) Codey: I'm not going to lie.
(0:12:01) Codey: Uh, so yeah, this is.
(0:12:02) Codey: Porter edition bundle is also 40% off, which is so it's just 18%, $18 US.
(0:12:08) Al: It is very funny because they're both they're 40% off individually and together.
(0:12:13) Al: So it shows the bundle is like, oh, of life and land 40% off of life and land supporter
(0:12:18) Al: back 40% off price of individual products 15 pounds 16 bundle discount 0% your cost
(0:12:24) Codey: Yep. Yeah, right now the bundle is not a deal. I'm assuming it will be eventually.
(0:12:25) Al: 15 pound 16 it's just very funny the way that it's worded yeah presumably once the initial
(0:12:36) Al: discount comes off, then the bundle...
(0:12:38) Al: But obviously, they don't want to have an additional discount on top of 40%,
(0:12:43) Al: because 40% is quite a significant discount especially.
(0:12:47) Codey: Yeah, no, this is something I definitely want to play at some point, probably going to happen
(0:12:52) Codey: in the fall, TBH, because that's something that I am not going to put a game on my lap.
(0:13:01) Codey: There's only one game that I'm putting on my laptop, and now it's Mudborne, and then
(0:13:06) Codey: past that, no more games on my laptop until I have become a doctor of bugs.
(0:13:11) Codey: So yeah, be cool.
(0:13:14) Al: And there are 221 people currently playing this game, it has 148 positive
(0:13:22) Codey: It's 221 opportunities for people to be my friend.
(0:13:27) Al: Next we have Grimshire. I have announced that their early access is releasing on the 22nd of July.
(0:13:34) Al: I honestly cannot remember this game but it was on my list. We've apparently talked about it.
(0:13:39) Al: Oh no! A deadly plague threatens the village of Grimshire. Manage your farmland,
(0:13:45) Al: forage the bounty of the wild to prevent your harvest from rotting away and keep the root
(0:13:49) Al: cellar full. Can you help bring the community together and survive?
(0:13:50) Codey: The roots seller bring the community together.
(0:13:58) Al: I don't... I don't like the...
(0:13:58) Codey: Yeah, I-- you don't or you do.
(0:14:03) Codey: Oh, no.
(0:14:04) Codey: I don't hate it.
(0:14:05) Codey: I-- I mean, it's giving Redwall to me.
(0:14:10) Codey: What?
(0:14:12) Al: Redwall is a series of children's fantasy novels.
(0:14:14) Codey: How?
(0:14:16) Codey: How do you, someone who lives in that?
(0:14:20) Codey: That country of the world, that part of the, that, that content, content island, not know what Redwall is.
(0:14:28) Codey: I am shocked. Redwall is like a staple of American childhood, or at least it was when I was growing up and I'm ancient.
(0:14:36) Codey: You're also ancient though, so it's fine.
(0:14:38) Al: And yes, I think I think we've been over this, yes.
(0:14:38) Codey: AKA we're the same. I think we're about the same age.
(0:14:44) Al: I have never heard of this.
(0:14:44) Codey: Oh, dude, I loved Redwall, and they had a TV series.
(0:14:50) Codey: Yeah, it's pretty much just some animals are good animals, and they do good things, and some are bad animals, and usually it's like the rodents and the prey animals are the good ones, and then the ones that eat other things are the evil ones, and they just want to do evil for evil things.
(0:15:06) Al: Yeah, I don't know what it is about the graphics of this game.
(0:15:08) Codey: But, listeners chime in here if Redwall is cottagecore. I think Redwall is cottagecore.
(0:15:11) Al: It's just something...
(0:15:12) Al: Yeah, I'm not a fan.
(0:15:20) Codey: Um, I think it was, it was also a TV show for a while, but I think there is a Redwall game. Uh, yeah, no, I like this. Maybe, maybe Watership Down? I don't know. That's also animals, isn't it? I've never read it, though. I could be way off base right here right now.
(0:15:38) Codey: Is it? Okay, it's another animal one.
(0:15:40) Al: I have no idea.
(0:15:43) Al: I've heard of it.
(0:15:44) Codey: Yep, so I think I have it because I wanted to read it. I was like wanting to read it.
(0:15:50) Al: Anyway, Grimshire.
(0:15:50) Codey: Yep. Yep. July 22nd. And that's for the early access. What's just windows? Lame. Okay.
(0:16:04) Al: Yeah, they say that they're estimating early access will be about a year, possibly longer.
(0:16:13) Al: It's always, it's always longer.
(0:16:16) Al: Galactic Getaway have announced their big pet update.
(0:16:22) Codey: Yep, this is also a game that I didn't know existed and I looked at it and I was like meh.
(0:16:26) Codey: But I kind of just wrote down a little bit of of what the big pet update includes. It includes
(0:16:33) Codey: pet stations, which I guess is like where you can you can choose which pets you want
(0:16:38) Codey: to be roaming around. Which to me is does not spark joy that like where are the ones that you
(0:16:46) Al: They go in the
(0:16:48) Codey: you don't want. What happens to the ugly pets?
(0:16:52) Codey: But then when they come back out, they're just, are they going to be like skin and bones? Are they, are they just in pet jail?
(0:17:02) Al: Yeah it does say instead of just being put away in store.
(0:17:03) Codey: Um, oh, I mean, that doesn't, there's, there's not really a difference though, is there?
(0:17:12) Codey: Okay. Uh, and then you can also feed them. And then they have an egg.
(0:17:12) Al: Well, some you see, some you don't.
(0:17:22) Codey: Uh, egg system that is like breeding system. Basically you can put two, two together and they'll breed and you get an egg and then you get another pet out of it.
(0:17:33) Codey: Is this just Pokemon actually?
(0:17:36) Al: Yeah I mean the game as a whole gives me very Animal Crossing vibes, cross with like I guess
(0:17:44) Al: if Animal Crossing had Miis instead of the Animal Crossing characters. It's a thing,
(0:17:48) Codey: - Mm-hmm, fair.
(0:17:52) Al: there seem to be many games as well. We have talked about it before but
(0:17:59) Al: Forget there's too many games
(0:18:00) Codey: Yep, there are. If you're not a very few games that we've been really looking forward to,
(0:18:07) Codey: Kofkof, Snacko, we forget, though I really am excited for Lens Island. I want to play
(0:18:14) Codey: Lens Island again. I don't think that's on our list, is it? No. Thanks to talk about
(0:18:17) Al: our list of what? Not today, no. Next we have Fantasy Life Eye, The Girl Who Steals Time.
(0:18:19) Codey: today. Nope, it's just on my mind.
(0:18:29) Al: They have announced that their physical release outside of Japan has been
(0:18:35) Al: cancelled. So I guess if you were wanting the physical release for Fantasy Life Eye,
(0:18:42) Al: I, the girl who steals time, sorry.
(0:18:46) Codey: also so okay I have a couple I have a couple comments here first of all the eye
(0:18:50) Codey: is not like an eyeball it is the letter I lowercase letter I which is just
(0:18:56) Al: Yeah.
(0:18:57) Codey: confusing to me like are they trying to say what is an eye one
(0:19:03) Al: I don't know, this is a super bad name.
(0:19:05) Al: It's a super bad name because the eye is like unique to it's like this
(0:19:11) Al: is the first fantasy life that has the eye in it, right?
(0:19:14) Al: Like it's not.
(0:19:15) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:19:15) Al: This is the second fantasy life game.
(0:19:18) Al: The first one was called Fantasy Life.
(0:19:19) Al: And this one's called Fantasy Life Eye, the girl who steals time.
(0:19:23) Al: So even if the eye does mean one, it's it's wrong.
(0:19:26) Al: It's not the first game, not the first game.
(0:19:28) Codey: second one yep uh so that's my one of my comments
(0:19:31) Al: Oh, actually, no, it's not.
(0:19:32) Al: There was a second. This is the third one.
(0:19:35) Al: There was Fantasy Life 2, Two Moons in the Village of God, which was a mobile game.
(0:19:39) Codey: The only thing I can think of an I being acceptable here
(0:19:44) Codey: is if it's meaning, like, 9, I think it is.
(0:19:48) Codey: Whatever number in the alphabet an I is.
(0:19:52) Al: or me. Fantastic. Hi, hello, hi over here. Yeah, well.
(0:19:57) Codey: But it's a lowercase i.
(0:20:01) Codey: It's a lowercase i.
(0:20:04) Codey: OK, so I was looking at this.
(0:20:07) Codey: This is a Reddit post.
(0:20:08) Codey: and I...
(0:20:09) Codey: started going down the rabbit hole of comments because it's hilarious.
(0:20:12) Codey: Uh, and this little exchange made me cackle.
(0:20:15) Codey: Um, so someone said, "I feel like all the news about this game has exclusively made it lamer for Switch fan."
(0:20:22) Codey: Which is crazy considering it was an exclusive at one point.
(0:20:27) Codey: Level 5, which is a developer, really fumbled a version that probably would have sold the best.
(0:20:33) Al: find this a funny thing to say, considering it's not like they cancelled the Switch physical version
(0:20:39) Al: and kept the PlayStation physical version, they just cancelled all the physical versions.
(0:20:43) Al: And in Japan, the physical version is Switch and PS5. It feels like a weird thing to say.
(0:20:50) Codey: I just laughed at the every update has made this lamer.
(0:20:54) Al: Yeah, I mean, that's fair, right? But like, why specifically the Switch version?
(0:21:00) Al: like I just thought this is nothing to do with the switch
(0:21:03) Codey: because yeah the next comments yeah it just made me laugh the next comment down on this
(0:21:03) Al: like this is such a weird comment
(0:21:07) Al: because yeah I saw that one as well I just rolled my eyes at it
(0:21:12) Codey: shred says level five is a company that has been fumbling since the mid 2010s and very few people
(0:21:18) Codey: are talking about it uh I just love the idea that they've been fumbling um and then I don't know
(0:21:25) Codey: just I don't know why that one made me laugh probably because then the next one is it's the
(0:21:30) Codey: the universe punishing them for not making a proper
(0:21:33) Codey: Professor Layton sequel in nearly a decade.
(0:21:36) Al: Aren't they making one this year? Yeah.
(0:21:38) Codey: Is it them making one?
(0:21:40) Codey: Well, I think he's also saying they also said proper.
(0:21:44) Al: Of course, no true Scotsman.
(0:21:44) Codey: So perhaps they're basically yeah.
(0:21:49) Codey: It's not a main series.
(0:21:50) Al: No one's ever happy with anything, ever.
(0:21:53) Codey: It's not a main series Professor Layton game.
(0:21:56) Codey: I don't know.
(0:21:57) Codey: It was just this that this is like the top most upvoted
(0:22:01) Codey: conversation on this.
(0:22:03) Codey: It's just on this game that no one's really heard about.
(0:22:03) Al: Also, it looks like the last Professor Layton game was a decade ago, so that's probably
(0:22:12) Codey: Oh, okay. It just is.
(0:22:13) Al: what the talk about this is, but yeah, I feel like the reason, reading up on this, the reason
(0:22:19) Al: they haven't done one in the last 10 years is probably because the puzzle designer for
(0:22:23) Al: the previous Professor Layton games died in 2016.
(0:22:27) Codey: Yeah, that would that would do it. That's a reason.
(0:22:33) Al: But it takes a while to kind of rethink what you want to do when your main puzzle designer
(0:22:39) Al: in a puzzle game dies.
(0:22:42) Codey: Well, I'm trying to figure out how to like still make it feel true to the brand
(0:22:48) Al: Anyway. Fun times. Yeah. So there we go. Yes, if you wanted the physical release of this,
(0:22:50) Codey: Also, there was a plague there was a plague in there somewhere. Yeah, so
(0:22:57) Codey: No physical no physical release for you
(0:23:01) Al: I'm sorry. Too bad. I think this game comes out as we're recording in like three days.
(0:23:07) Al: I think it comes out on the 21st, so the day this episode comes out is when the game comes out.
(0:23:08) Codey: Hmm. Well, it's available now digitally.
(0:23:12) Al: Tiny Garden. Tiny Garden. They have...
(0:23:18) Al: ... announced a quality of life patch, and they announced that controller support is
(0:23:26) Al: incoming for their game. I played this a little bit on the Steam Deck, but it didn't have controller
(0:23:33) Al: support. However, it was okay using the touchscreen. It wasn't amazing. I think it could be a little
(0:23:41) Al: bit better, but it was doable. It didn't feel like a lot of games without controller support,
(0:23:46) Al: where you're just like using the touchpad.
(0:23:49) Al: Which is just the absolute worst way to interact with anything ever on the Steam Deck, but I'm very happy that they're adding
(0:24:00) Codey: Yep, sorry, my brain was trying to think of an analogy for using touch screen to try and do a mouse and my brain was thinking, trying to make a fork with your fingers.
(0:24:14) Codey: It's like you don't need to be stuck with the tool, aka the fork or the mouse, when you have a perfectly good other way to do it. Just eat with your fingers.
(0:24:26) Al: I understand what you're trying to say, yes.
(0:24:30) Codey: This is the hashtag, just I was off my meds for a day folks thoughts.
(0:24:38) Codey: That was that was what came up. They also said that they did say the tutorials thing that you can do the tutorials at any time now.
(0:24:46) Al: No, I did not.
(0:24:48) Codey: Yeah, that was another thing that they announced. And then, and then the switch port is being discussed.
(0:24:51) Al: That's good.
(0:24:55) Al: They're also releasing Mac very soon.
(0:24:58) Codey: Well, I might play it, but not until the--
(0:25:00) Codey: I do think it's a really cute game. I like the concept.
(0:25:05) Al: Well, maybe by the time you play it, the summer update will be out then.
(0:25:12) Al: And our final piece of news, Dolok Town have released their Early Access Roadmap.
(0:25:19) Al: So it's out in Early Access now, and they have given a Roadmap, and it's pretty vague
(0:25:29) Al: in terms of timelines, but it has an update. Late summer.
(0:25:35) Al: This year with ranching and main story updates, and then fall/winter with the gene system and
(0:25:43) Al: another main story update, and then first half of 2026 with a new map, farming automation,
(0:25:50) Al: my favorite thing, and the main story concluded. It then says to be continued, so I'm guessing
(0:25:57) Al: that means that that update is not the 1.0 and the future one will be, but it's not.
(0:26:05) Al: To be continued could mean we're 1.0, but we're still going to add stuff.
(0:26:12) Codey: >> Mm-hmm. This is a very cute Roadmap too.
(0:26:12) Al: You never know with people in their Early Access and version.
(0:26:20) Codey: They drew a lot of hand-drawn things in it.
(0:26:22) Codey: It's very cute. I really like the,
(0:26:24) Codey: in the first late summer 2025 ranching system update,
(0:26:27) Codey: they've got a couple of really cute llama drawings.
(0:26:31) Codey: I'm assuming it's a llama.
(0:26:34) Codey: But then they say regarding community feedback,
(0:26:38) Codey: and this just makes me feel like they've gotten
(0:26:40) Codey: a lot of--
(0:26:42) Codey: bad.
(0:26:44) Codey: Because they say, as first-time developers,
(0:26:46) Codey: we've been humbled by the incredible volume of feedback
(0:26:49) Codey: this past week.
(0:26:49) Codey: The game certainly has its flaws,
(0:26:52) Codey: and we've made our share of mistakes.
(0:26:53) Codey: But we're thankful to everyone taking the time
(0:26:55) Codey: to share their thoughts.
(0:26:56) Al: That's a yeah we know it's not perfect stop telling us.
(0:26:57) Codey: We believe that--
(0:27:00) Codey: we get it.
(0:27:02) Codey: It's Early Access.
(0:27:03) Codey: Leave us alone.
(0:27:05) Codey: We believe the Early Access period
(0:27:07) Codey: is all about listening and improving based on player input.
(0:27:09) Codey: So they're doing that, which is great.
(0:27:12) Codey: So yeah, that's Dallat town.
(0:27:18) Al: Whoo. All right. We're going to talk about Ever After Falls.
(0:27:22) Codey: So again, you have played it, I have not.
(0:27:27) Al: Yes, I have played it. I've put 60 hours or so into it, which is a good amount of time.
(0:27:35) Al: It's now in my top five games on Steam, I think, with 60 hours.
(0:27:35) Codey: Mm hmm. Wow. What's your top game? Okay, that makes sense.
(0:27:43) Al: Stardew. So I guess a quick introduction to this.
(0:27:49) Al: Essentially, it is, it's a Stardew clone, right?
(0:27:54) Codey: Right.
(0:27:54) Al: Like, it's not, there's nothing in it that would make it significantly like this is a selling point, right?
(0:28:03) Al: It's not, oh, it's Stardew, but it is, it's Stardew, I guess, but they've changed a bunch of small things.
(0:28:12) Al: It feels like they're trying to do to Stardew what Stardew did to Harvest Moon, right?
(0:28:18) Al: Let's make one. And these are like the 20 things that I don't like about it.
(0:28:23) Al: Here's how I change them sort of thing.
(0:28:26) Al: Whereas a lot of farming games nowadays are it's Stardew, but in space or it's Stardew, but prehistoric or, you know,
(0:28:38) Al: instead, it's Stardew, but insert specific thing here.
(0:28:42) Al: It's not that it is very much it's Stardew.
(0:28:47) Al: but we've improved a bunch of
(0:28:48) Al: things. Which is not a bad thing, I think it's just important that people are aware
(0:28:55) Al: of that's where we are. So if you're looking for something unique, that is not this. If
(0:29:02) Al: you're like, I love Stardew, but I'm done with it, I've had enough time in there and
(0:29:06) Al: I want something similar, this could be what you're looking for. And I've got a lot of
(0:29:11) Al: stuff to talk about it. Because there's, as I say, there's lots of little things that
(0:29:14) Al: make it different, I think most
(0:29:18) Al: of it is mostly in good ways, but we can get there when we get there, go for it.
(0:29:19) Codey: okay okay I'm going to read the little blurb real quick blurb rediscover the
(0:29:29) Codey: simple life farm fish forage and fight to restore the piece in an all-new
(0:29:33) Codey: farming adventure features split screen co-op a helpful pet automated drones
(0:29:39) Codey: resourceful pixies a card eating progression system and dangerous
(0:29:43) Codey: dungeons to delve into they put a lot of alliteration into that that was kind of
(0:29:49) Codey: hard to read so as I was looking at some other stuff like some videos and
(0:29:56) Codey: stuff about this game a couple questions popped up ready are you ready for some
(0:29:59) Codey: quick rapid-fire questions oh just before we jump in okay first question in
(0:30:01) Al: Oh, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
(0:30:08) Codey: their gameplay trailer they say that this game is an irreverent farming
(0:30:14) Codey: simulator. To remind people, the definition of a reverent is one
(0:30:19) Codey: lacking or exhibiting a lack of reverence or disrespectful to
(0:30:23) Codey: critically critical of what is generally accepted or respected
(0:30:27) Codey: or satirical and three showing a lack of reverence.
(0:30:32) Codey: That's so stupid expressive of a lack of veneration.
(0:30:35) Codey: That's a really stupid definition.
(0:30:37) Codey: We're just going to go with satirical or disrespectful.
(0:30:40) Codey: Does this game feel satirical or disrespectful?
(0:30:44) Al: No.
(0:30:44) Codey: Okay, cool.
(0:30:46) Al: I mean, it's not trying to be serious, right?
(0:30:52) Al: So it's not like, oh, it's the serious farming sim, like a lot of farming sims are nowadays.
(0:30:58) Al: But yeah, it's not like, I feel like to be satirical or disrespectful, there has to be
(0:31:05) Al: something you're, you know, reacting to.
(0:31:10) Codey: Yeah and it's not doing that.
(0:31:10) Al: It's not, it doesn't feel like it's, it's not, it's not going.
(0:31:14) Al: Oh, we're not paying respect to stardew, right?
(0:31:18) Al: Like, I don't, it doesn't, there's nothing there.
(0:31:21) Al: It doesn't, it is lighthearted in most of what it does.
(0:31:25) Al: It's not trying to be the serious one, but the problem is that farming
(0:31:29) Al: Sims didn't start out serious and this isn't the lighthearted satirical version of that.
(0:31:36) Codey: pottagecore is the most serious genre ever actually and I can't believe that you disagree with that
(0:31:44) Codey: statement um okay my next question um they said in that trailer all the cardboard upgrades
(0:31:52) Codey: you can eat and then they also say that again and I think what
(0:31:56) Al: Yeah, I mean this is just their skills, upgrades you get by consuming cards, and like the consuming
(0:32:06) Al: part of it doesn't really mean much. You eat them technically in-game, but like it may as well be
(0:32:13) Al: something else, right? It could just be like a button you press, right? It's just like you get
(0:32:16) Codey: Like, you learned it.
(0:32:18) Al: cards that give you an upgrade, like it might give you more attack when you're in the dungeons,
(0:32:24) Al: or it might give you more.
(0:32:26) Al: Things you can water at one time, something like that.
(0:32:30) Codey: are cards you can play at any time. Oh, it's permanent. It's not like a cool down. Are
(0:32:32) Al: Yeah, it's like a permanent upgrade to your skills though.
(0:32:37) Al: Yeah, no, they're permanent skills.
(0:32:41) Codey: there things? Are there cards that you can eat that are not other cards for anything
(0:32:46) Codey: else in the game? Like, is there a card that's just like, here's a cute card?
(0:32:47) Al: What do you mean?
(0:32:51) Al: No, they're all they're all skill upgrades.
(0:32:54) Al: They're quite varied, though, right?
(0:32:56) Al: Because obviously there's ones relating to combat.
(0:33:00) Al: So increased attack, increased attack speed, increased movement speed.
(0:33:05) Codey: Mm-hmm, right.
(0:33:06) Al: And then there's farming related ones.
(0:33:09) Al: But then there's also like unique ones, which, you know, for example,
(0:33:13) Al: one of the things you can do in games is you can have a drone following you.
(0:33:16) Codey: Mm-hmm, mmm.
(0:33:17) Al: Cards allows you to have a second drone following you.
(0:33:20) Al: And there's like just stuff like that.
(0:33:22) Al: There's there's nothing.
(0:33:26) Al: It's nothing like, oh, wow, this is the most amazing idea that someone's put in a game.
(0:33:31) Al: It's just like small improvements in in the game.
(0:33:36) Al: It's like how in Stardew you increase your skill level in something.
(0:33:39) Al: And then suddenly you can do more stuff one way, right?
(0:33:43) Al: Like you increase your your stamina or whatever.
(0:33:43) Codey: Yeah, I was just wondering if there's like already a card collecting system or something and it's just sometimes it's like, oh, wow, this one does something like this does gives you
(0:33:53) Al: No, no, no, no, they're all, they're all, I guess you're technically collecting them,
(0:34:00) Al: but like it's you get it and then you eat it and that is marked as in your stats, right?
(0:34:08) Al: Like it's not, yeah, it's, they're all, the entire point of it is your stats upgrades.
(0:34:08) Codey: how do you get okay okay I see that and I was like we got to put that in the
(0:34:14) Al: There's not, there's no other cards you get for stuff.
(0:34:17) Al: If you weren't collecting, there is...
(0:34:24) Codey: notes it's already there how do you get the cards
(0:34:25) Al: Well this is an interesting part of the game. So there are three ways I've found of getting
(0:34:37) Al: the cards, one of which is when you complete museum collections you get credits towards
(0:34:45) Al: a shop in the museum and then you can buy cards that way. That I've found is the easiest
(0:34:52) Al: way to do it because there's like lots of - it's not just like
(0:34:55) Al: oh you've done all the bugs you get credit it's like oh you've done the butterflies you
(0:35:00) Al: get credit or you've done the starfish you get credit or you've done this the spring crops you
(0:35:02) Codey: - Oh, cute.
(0:35:05) Al: get credit so there's quite a lot of different ones that you can do obviously some of them are
(0:35:06) Codey: Okay.
(0:35:10) Al: harder than others but you get quite a lot of cards that way you can also get them through quests
(0:35:16) Al: that's a another way of getting them and there are a few of them but obviously you don't really
(0:35:21) Al: have control over when you get them you just get the quest and then you do it you get it
(0:35:25) Al: the third way however is is interesting so when you get a when you get a letter in the mail and
(0:35:32) Al: you read it that letter stays in your inventory right you just have a letter in your inventory
(0:35:39) Al: and then you can either sell it or put it in your storage or you can recycle it and if you
(0:35:46) Al: recycle the letter you get a scrap of paper and once you have well you you I think it takes six
(0:35:52) Al: sliders to get scrap of paper.
(0:35:55) Al: Three scraps of paper, you can create a base card, and then you can go to the printer.
(0:36:00) Al: When you go to the printer, you can print out a card on that card, the blank card.
(0:36:06) Al: So you take the blank card to the printer and choose which card you want to print on it,
(0:36:11) Al: and that's how you get that card.
(0:36:12) Codey: Mm-hmm interesting that is it
(0:36:15) Al: Yeah, I think it's interesting because I've never really played one where the letters you get are
(0:36:19) Al: just a thing you have in your inventory, and then you have to do something with,
(0:36:21) Codey: Yeah
(0:36:23) Al: and they gave you something to do with that.
(0:36:25) Al: And it means that you're then like, oh, how do I get more of these, right?
(0:36:29) Al: Because I want to get as many bits of paper as possible.
(0:36:31) Al: And so you're trying to like do more quests and stuff to get more letters,
(0:36:34) Codey: have people write you letters.
(0:36:38) Al: which is an interesting way of doing things.
(0:36:40) Codey: Yeah, I mean that's unique.
(0:36:42) Al: Yeah, it's interesting.
(0:36:43) Al: Yeah, I don't think it's that like, if you've not,
(0:36:46) Al: if you don't, if you're not looking for a farming game,
(0:36:49) Al: it's not going to be like, oh, this is a game I must play now.
(0:36:52) Codey: - Final question that I have before we just dive into like a general overview of the game
(0:36:52) Al: But it does like lots of other things I'm going to talk about.
(0:36:55) Al: There are lots of little things like that that I feel are really nice
(0:37:00) Al: quality of life improvements over other farming.
(0:37:08) Codey: provided by you. Why are some of the bees red? Okay. Additional question. Why are some
(0:37:11) Al: They're not. They're pink.
(0:37:17) Codey: of the beast.
(0:37:19) Al: I don't know why is anything anything, Cody?
(0:37:21) Al: I don't know. They're just they're pink bees.
(0:37:23) Al: And how else are you going to get pink honey if you don't have pink bees?
(0:37:26) Codey: So it's only pink or black, which is ridiculous because bees aren't yellow, but OK.
(0:37:28) Al: Well, pink or black and yellow, yellow and black.
(0:37:35) Al: OK, orange, whatever, I don't know, pink or normal bee color.
(0:37:36) Codey: I'm getting pedantic. You started the pedantry with the pink comment.
(0:37:41) Al: There's bees and then there's pink bees and bees make honey and pink bees make pink honey.
(0:37:47) Codey: OK. Is pink any more valuable? Are pink bees more difficult to raise?
(0:37:49) Al: Yes. They're not they're not more difficult to raise.
(0:37:55) Al: They're just rarer to find.
(0:37:57) Codey: Okay. And do you, like, find them in the wild and then bring them to your hives?
(0:37:58) Al: So like I have, I think, 16 bees and I only have two pink bees.
(0:38:06) Al: Yeah, you shake trees and the bees fall out the trees.
(0:38:09) Codey: That is horrifying. Okay. Well, those are my questions.
(0:38:11) Al: OK, so I guess I've done a bit of an intro.
(0:38:19) Al: We've done some Cody questions.
(0:38:22) Al: Let's go through some of the mechanics.
(0:38:24) Al: So one one thing about this game, I think I mentioned this last week.
(0:38:29) Al: You won't have heard of this, Cody, because you said you haven't listened to that episode yet.
(0:38:32) Codey: Correct. How does it limit you?
(0:38:32) Al: But there is no stamina in this game and time, just time.
(0:38:39) Al: So I actually quite like this.
(0:38:41) Al: I did this in the last week's episode, but I'm going to say it again, because it feels it feels relevant here.
(0:38:45) Al: I like what one of the things that I've I've always felt a little bit weird about farming games is how you have two limiting factors.
(0:38:52) Al: You have the time and you have the stamina.
(0:38:54) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:38:55) Al: And I've always felt frustrated by that, where, you know, you're you're like, oh, I have done everything I can do.
(0:39:02) Al: Early game, I've run out of stamina.
(0:39:05) Al: There's nothing left to do.
(0:39:06) Al: I have most of the day left because you have such low stamina at the beginning.
(0:39:11) Al: And you're like, I can either, I don't know, go and buy some food to eat or I can just go to bed and do the next day.
(0:39:18) Al: Right. So that's why I quite often at the beginning of farming games speedrun these things.
(0:39:22) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:39:22) Al: Right. Because there's nothing to do.
(0:39:24) Al: You can't do anything once you've run out of stamina.
(0:39:26) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:39:26) Al: But the nice thing about this game is that you can just fill your day with doing things.
(0:39:32) Al: You can go mining or you can go bug catching or, you know, lots of other things.
(0:39:42) Al: And not worry about your stamina.
(0:39:43) Al: You're just caring about the daytime.
(0:39:46) Al: I quite like that because you're still not you know, you're still limited by money as well.
(0:39:52) Al: Right. So like I can't immediately go and make this massive farm full of crops.
(0:39:57) Al: But being able to go fishing the entire day allows you to have a different way of doing things or going in mining because I'll talk about the dungeons later.
(0:40:07) Al: they're quite a, quite different compared to other front.
(0:40:11) Al: farming games, and it's quite fun to be able to go through them and spend the entirety
(0:40:16) Al: of your day once you've done your daily tasks, and just go see how far you can get through
(0:40:21) Al: the dungeon. I quite like that. Obviously, there was the other option if you don't want
(0:40:27) Al: to, if you want to change that, so you only have one limiting factor, and you don't want
(0:40:32) Al: to get rid of stamina, the other option is you do a Shookajoo Island, and you only have
(0:40:37) Al: stamina and the time is based on just when you say.
(0:40:41) Al: Okay, I'm done. The day's done. And I would like to see that in another game that is actually in
(0:40:43) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:47) Al: a good game. I don't think that was the problem with that game. There were many problems with
(0:40:50) Codey: That's fired.
(0:40:51) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:52) Al: that game. I don't think that was the problem. I would like to see a game try that again.
(0:40:58) Al: But I like this as well. I think I like games when they try different things. And I think
(0:41:03) Al: I think this is better. I'll put that out there. I think Stardew would be better if it was like
(0:41:04) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:41:08) Al: like this as well.
(0:41:08) Codey: Is there a way to slow down time, okay
(0:41:11) Al: No, give me two seconds and I'll check because I've never cared about that in a game because, like, if you reduce the time, you still have a certain amount of time, right? Like, you're still, well, it's not even just that, right? Like, even in this game when you don't have stamina, right? If you reduce the amount of time in the day, you still got a limited amount of time, right? It's not like you can just infinitely grind
(0:41:26) Codey: The stamina issues. Yeah.
(0:41:42) Al: And I've always just found it funny because it's like, oh, oh, no, I don't have enough time to do everything that I want to do in the day. I've done my dailies, right? There's plenty of time to do what I need to do every day.
(0:41:53) Al: And those are the only things that actually matter getting done today because then there's always tomorrow, right? These games never have a time limit. It's not like, oh, I'm sorry, you've done X number of days, you can't play the game anymore.
(0:42:00) Codey: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:42:07) Al: and even stardew which has the try and get a certain progress.
(0:42:11) Al: end of two years, if you don't manage it, you can just do it again. You can at any point
(0:42:17) Al: go and do the, you know, talk to grandpa shrine and get your, I can't even, oh yes, you get
(0:42:26) Al: a statue if you have hit the certain amount. You just get it later, right? Like that's
(0:42:30) Al: the whole point of these games is they're not meant to be stressful. They're meant to
(0:42:33) Al: be do what you want to do and continue. And so I've never felt the need to go, oh no,
(0:42:38) Al: day needs to be longer because I need to spend more time in the
(0:42:41) Al: line before going back to bed. Why? The only time I've ever found that to be an issue
(0:42:48) Al: is in Stardew when you're going down Skull Cavern because that resets if you leave. That's
(0:42:57) Al: the only time that that's a problem. You can change the day length. You can do 100%, 125%,
(0:43:00) Codey: Yeah. I think for me. OK.
(0:43:05) Al: 150 percent, 200 percent.
(0:43:08) Codey: OK, sweet. Yeah, my thing is like sometimes I just would rather have like
(0:43:14) Codey: the day go a little bit slower so that I can make sure to get
(0:43:19) Codey: because there's been a lot of times in a Stardew or Coral Island or whatever
(0:43:22) Codey: where I'm playing and then I lose track time because hot ADHD.
(0:43:27) Codey: and then suddenly it's like too late like the
(0:43:30) Codey: the places are closed.
(0:43:32) Al: Do you think a longer day would actually help with that or would it just mean that you're
(0:43:35) Al: forgetting about the day length for more time?
(0:43:38) Codey: You know, it might shift the baseline, you're not wrong.
(0:43:41) Codey: But I think that usually it's like
(0:43:46) Codey: after I'm in the mine for a certain amount of time
(0:43:50) Codey: or in the ocean for a certain amount of time or whatever,
(0:43:52) Codey: I just kind of have like a sense.
(0:43:53) Codey: I'm like, I should, like, it's time to stop doing this.
(0:43:57) Codey: And I don't think that that would change.
(0:43:59) Codey: Like, I don't think that's based on the time.
(0:44:00) Codey: I think it's just like, okay, I'm done now.
(0:44:03) Codey: Like this, I've been doing this for 10 minutes
(0:44:05) Codey: and I feel like this is a good amount of...
(0:44:08) Codey: time to be doing all this stuff in these little caves in the sea or whatever in Coral Island.
(0:44:16) Codey: Or I run out of inventory space is another thing and that usually takes a certain amount of time.
(0:44:21) Al: Oh, yeah, inventory, remind me about that in a minute, I've got to talk about the inventory
(0:44:25) Al: in this game. Yeah, I just I just feel like you'd get used to that. I feel like you would
(0:44:25) Codey: No, no, okay.
(0:44:30) Codey: Okay.
(0:44:32) Al: just it would just be the same problem. It's just instead of instead of wasting 15 minutes,
(0:44:37) Al: you'd waste 30 minutes. But I mean, I don't know. I feel it is it is there. Yeah.
(0:44:40) Codey: But the option is there for people who might want to feel as though, as though they're not stuck in a, in a hellscape of a mental. Yeah.
(0:44:49) Al: Yeah, I'm not saying this option shouldn't be there for the record. I just don't think
(0:44:53) Codey: Yes.
(0:44:54) Al: it actually would solve anybody's problems with these games.
(0:44:58) Codey: Yep, I agree. You're probably right. Cool.
(0:45:02) Al: So yes, inventory. It's hard to talk about inventory without talking about a lot of other
(0:45:08) Al: things, so I'm trying to figure out where the best time to talk about that would be.
(0:45:13) Al: Let's talk about the pet, and then I'll talk about inventory, and then I'll talk about
(0:45:18) Al: by farming, but those things are all
(0:45:19) Al: very connected, and you'll understand why in a minute.
(0:45:20) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:45:21) Al: So one of the big things about this game is you have a pet and your pet is very
(0:45:22) Codey: OK.
(0:45:24) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:45:26) Al: functional, so the moment that you start the game,
(0:45:29) Al: you have to go and get a pet and you choose what pet you want.
(0:45:32) Al: And that is your pet.
(0:45:33) Codey: What are the options?
(0:45:34) Al: It is kind of the well, so it's not like a cat or a dog.
(0:45:39) Al: It's just it's it's this kind of it almost looks like a hybrid cat dog.
(0:45:46) Codey: Okay.
(0:45:47) Al: it's it's got some kind of feline features and some
(0:45:49) Al: canine features. Well, no, not really. Go look at some
(0:45:51) Codey: So it's a fox.
(0:45:56) Al: pictures of it. You can get different colors, I think, but
(0:45:56) Codey: I will, I will.
(0:45:58) Codey: Okay, but it's a pet.
(0:46:00) Al: it's it's not yeah, it's not meant to be this is a specific
(0:46:02) Al: animal. It's just called a pet. And I think you'll
(0:46:06) Al: understand when you look at it what I mean. And your pet is
(0:46:11) Al: very functional. There are certain things that are required
(0:46:19) Al: pet. So, for example, your pet is your watering can, right? You
(0:46:25) Al: don't have a watering can. Your pet is the thing that does the
(0:46:27) Al: watering. You say water this square and it waters that
(0:46:30) Al: square. Your pet does a bunch of other things as well. For
(0:46:35) Al: example, your pet can give you extra inventory space. Your pet
(0:46:39) Al: can attack enemies. Your pet also, as well as watering, does
(0:46:43) Al: the digging up the ground so that you can you can.
(0:46:49) Al: Place seeds. So it replaces a bunch of tools in the game and
(0:46:56) Al: is required for that. But that means that when you're
(0:46:57) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:46:59) Al: upgrading those things, you're essentially upgrading your pet's
(0:47:03) Al: ability. So say you start out, I can't remember how many
(0:47:08) Al: spots it is, but your pet has like a queue of things that
(0:47:14) Al: you've told it to do, right? So say you say dig this square up,
(0:47:20) Al: it takes time for them to do it and you can give it a certain
(0:47:24) Al: number of things before you can stop. You can't give it any
(0:47:28) Al: more things to do. And it's kind of like if you're if you
(0:47:33) Al: press and hold and drag, you can say do these nine squares and
(0:47:39) Al: that adds all of those nine squares to its queue. So it
(0:47:39) Codey: Okay.
(0:47:42) Al: allows you to say, you know, you increase that queue over time
(0:47:45) Al: and that's the upgrade to your watering can.
(0:47:49) Al: If you will, right, so initially, I think it's maybe four, you can say like, do these four squares, and then you have to wait until one is done before you can do that, you can add another one to the queue.
(0:48:01) Al: I think the maximum is 36, no 49, 49 is the maximum, so that's seven by seven.
(0:48:13) Al: Which is not too bad, but one problem I do have with this is that it doesn't--
(0:48:19) Al: it doesn't speed up watering at all. It only increases your queue, and so if I-- the more crops you get, the more time it takes for you to do these things, and there's no way to speed that up without your drones, which I'll get to them in a minute.
(0:48:33) Codey: And time is the...
(0:48:38) Al: But it's like how when you're upgrading a water cam in Stardew, you like do a three by three square, and it happens in the same time as it would have taken to do a one square at the end.
(0:48:48) Codey: Yeah, so it's increased the amount that can be done in the same amount of time.
(0:48:49) Al: No, it's not, that's not-- yeah, yeah, yeah, so that doesn't happen in this game. So it just means that you are spending less time telling it what to do, but realistically being seven by seven being the max you can do, there's-- you can't just say, like, do all of my crops and then go off and do stuff for the rest of the day, you have to kind of hang around and wait until it's the point where you can then tell it to do another group of crops.
(0:48:53) Codey: And that does not happen in this game.
(0:49:20) Al: And that just-- it just means that you're not-- like in Stardew, you're-- even if you don't use sprinklers, you can still massively reduce your amount of time doing your dailies as you upgrade your watering can, and that is just not an option here. The only way to reduce the amount of time doing those things is by-- is by making the drones, which, although I like them, they are very intensive in terms of how much they--
(0:49:49) Al: to make them like I am halfway through year two I've got 60 hours in the game and I currently have
(0:49:55) Al: six drones and they are currently covering a five by five square each I think which is not a lot
(0:49:57) Codey: Okay, yeah, I know.
(0:50:04) Al: it's not a lot of stuff for being halfway through year through year two right like in in Stardew I
(0:50:10) Al: would easily have you know like 12 covering the same sort of space easily and in Coral Island it
(0:50:19) Al: think you even more so I feel like there's something there they could do either to allow
(0:50:25) Al: you to increase the queue more right so like I don't care how fast the pet is doing it if I can
(0:50:32) Al: say do everything and then I can go off and do my own stuff except that I don't want to go in the
(0:50:38) Al: dungeon without my pet because my pet is an important part of my dungeon because they attack
(0:50:42) Al: enemies but that's a side point so I just feel like I need to be investing even more
(0:50:49) Al: in the drones but it's just it takes so long um which I'll get I'll get to that I'm a big
(0:50:52) Codey: Yeah, and you're a big automation person
(0:50:55) Al: automation person and I do like the automation uh let's talk about the drones because the drones
(0:51:02) Codey: Can I have a, can I, can I have one question first?
(0:51:04) Al: yes it no so it just it does this like focused face and then like a little rain cloud appears
(0:51:05) Codey: How does your pet water? Like what, does it have a little watering can that it like trots along with?
(0:51:15) Al: above it and waters the ground on that square.
(0:51:18) Codey: Oh, so it's magical. Okay.
(0:51:19) Al: Yeah, it's very much magic.
(0:51:23) Al: So no, before we get to drones,
(0:51:25) Al: let's talk about the inventory then,
(0:51:27) Al: 'cause that is important to talk about with the pet.
(0:51:29) Al: So your, I think your pet starts off
(0:51:32) Al: with four extra inventory slots.
(0:51:35) Al: You have like 10 slots in your normal bag
(0:51:38) Al: and then your pet gives you like an extra four
(0:51:40) Al: and then you can upgrade it to 10, but then that's it.
(0:51:45) Al: And then there are other ways to get more inventory,
(0:51:48) Al: but realistically you.
(0:51:49) Al: You can't rely on them, so you can only really rely on your 20 inventory slots, which
(0:51:55) Al: is not a lot of slots.
(0:51:59) Al: And if your pet isn't with you, so say I set up my pet to water, and then I go to the dungeons,
(0:52:06) Al: I can't use my pet's inventory slots.
(0:52:09) Al: So I only have my 10, or more if I have the other the other ways, but those are like quite
(0:52:15) Al: late in the game to get those ones, because you have to have your personal drone, and
(0:52:18) Al: and then you have to upgrade your personal.
(0:52:19) Al: And I just feel like there's no permanent inventory additions.
(0:52:24) Al: Like all of, yeah, exactly.
(0:52:24) Codey: There's no like backpack or something
(0:52:27) Al: Every way of adding inventory is a choice.
(0:52:31) Al: You either do this or you do something else.
(0:52:33) Al: So you either have your pet with you, in which case you can use the inventory,
(0:52:37) Al: or you don't have your pet with you in which case you can't use the inventory.
(0:52:40) Al: And with your personal drones, there's two types of drone.
(0:52:43) Al: Well, there's three types of drones.
(0:52:44) Al: One of which I've not used because I don't see any point in investing in it.
(0:52:48) Al: I'll get to that in a minute.
(0:52:49) Al: The personal drone, which follows you around,
(0:52:54) Al: you have to choose either its inventory or it's a weapon, like attacking the
(0:53:02) Al: monsters in the dungeon.
(0:53:03) Al: And the problem is that unless you have really put effort into your attack,
(0:53:13) Al: realistically, you need the drone to be in attack mode if you're in the dungeons.
(0:53:19) Al: The dungeons are also for gathering lots of things, right?
(0:53:22) Al: That's where you get your ore.
(0:53:23) Al: It's where you get lots of things.
(0:53:26) Codey: where you need your inventory the most.
(0:53:27) Al: You need your inventory space, but you also need it to be attacking.
(0:53:31) Al: And so there's no way to get more than the 10 spaces without sacrificing something.
(0:53:37) Al: And I'm not a huge fan of that.
(0:53:37) Codey: Yeah, yeah, it needs to be like a backpack or something.
(0:53:40) Al: I would like a permanent inventory increase.
(0:53:45) Al: I like this being an option as well,
(0:53:47) Al: I would like more than ten.
(0:53:49) Al: Default inventory to upgrade, it becomes really painful at certain points to deal with your inventory space. Not a fan of that.
(0:53:58) Codey: I can't even imagine like going through Stardew with only 10 like the
(0:54:04) Codey: Like first two levels of the dungeon you'd be you'd be like, well, I'm done. I
(0:54:09) Al: Yeah, yeah, especially as there are so many different things in this game, right? You've
(0:54:10) Codey: Gotta go home
(0:54:15) Al: got like four different ores, but then you have a whole bunch of other things as well,
(0:54:20) Al: like you've got your gems and stuff like that. And you also have, I don't think the monsters
(0:54:22) Codey: Well, and then the monster parts, I'm assuming.
(0:54:27) Al: drop specific monster parts, but they can drop other things. But you also have rings
(0:54:33) Al: and necklaces that give you extra things, like those drop very frequently, so that can
(0:54:39) Al: quickly clog up your inventory. It just becomes, yeah, just there's so much. Exactly, exactly.
(0:54:44) Codey: Inventory management.
(0:54:48) Al: So I would like a permanent inventory upgrade, but it's not too bad now, because I do have
(0:54:54) Al: two personal drones. So I have one that's my inventory drone and one that's my attacking
(0:54:58) Al: drone. But I would, I'd still, I'd like something permanent as well. So that's, I think, probably
(0:55:04) Codey: Yeah, that's the inventory.
(0:55:06) Al: my biggest complaint about the game.
(0:55:10) Al: So I've mostly done the farming stuff,
(0:55:14) Al: but there's a few more things to talk about.
(0:55:16) Al: So obviously, as I said, you use your pet for, you know,
(0:55:20) Al: cutting up, digging the ground and also for watering.
(0:55:24) Al: Other than that, there's not a huge amount
(0:55:26) Al: to talk about other than the drones, which I'll get to in a minute.
(0:55:29) Al: I guess one thing I really like is you can have multiple greenhouses.
(0:55:34) Al: So a greenhouse is just a it's just a building you can buy and put down in your
(0:55:39) Al: not buy, but well, you do buy it, but you also build.
(0:55:46) Al: I really like that.
(0:55:47) Al: So I have three greenhouses just now and they're not all full because I'm
(0:55:51) Al: refusing to use a greenhouse unless I'm using the watering drones because
(0:55:59) Al: this is one annoying thing with the pet.
(0:56:02) Al: If you tell it to go water stuff outside
(0:56:05) Al: and then you go into the greenhouse, you have to wait till it's finished before
(0:56:09) Al: it's queued inside the greenhouse.
(0:56:11) Al: It has like separate queues and you can only have one at a time,
(0:56:15) Al: which is just a little bit annoying.
(0:56:16) Al: It's like, why can I not add these ones to the queue?
(0:56:19) Al: Because it's like, because I'm not right next to my pet.
(0:56:22) Al: That seems like a weird restriction.
(0:56:24) Al: But anyway, whatever.
(0:56:26) Codey: They need to hear your command, Owl. They can't hear it if they're outside.
(0:56:30) Al: I mean, let me shout at it and then run inside.
(0:56:33) Al: I just it feels like such a weird restriction gameplay wise.
(0:56:35) Codey: Yeah. It's not like your pet is magic.
(0:56:37) Al: So I'm refusing.
(0:56:39) Al: I'm refusing to use the greenhouse unless I'm using the drones.
(0:56:43) Al: And so I've got my second greenhouses.
(0:56:47) Al: I think I need one more, one more drone for that one.
(0:56:51) Al: So the drones are interesting in a couple of ways.
(0:56:54) Al: So the if you think about Stardew sprinklers, you have different sprinklers
(0:57:00) Al: that have different space, size that they cover.
(0:57:05) Al: With the drone, they have a similar thing,
(0:57:07) Al: what you do it by.
(0:57:09) Al: If you're upgrading your drone with drone parts, so you have a default drone, and then it does, I think, a two by two space.
(0:57:18) Al: If you, you can then also create drone parts to it which upgrade it, but those are like hot swappable.
(0:57:26) Al: So if you have a drone, you can say, oh, I want this three different kinds of levels of drone parts, and there's blue, red and gold, and they are an increasing.
(0:57:32) Codey: Mm-hmm, skill, uh, quality.
(0:57:39) Al: Yes. And so if you say if you put two blue parts in, it will now be up to five by five.
(0:57:46) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:57:47) Al: But if you can then say this drone, I want to take out those blue pieces and put in gold pieces, and then suddenly it's I don't know even what it is like 10 by 10 I don't know I made that up.
(0:57:53) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:57:58) Codey: Okay
(0:57:59) Al: But you see my point like you don't have to the thing that I always annoys me is when you've got a sprinkler, and then you're like okay now I want a better sprinkler. And now what do I do with these sprinklers.
(0:58:00) Codey: Yeah
(0:58:09) Al: I just have I either put them somewhere and I'm like not using things efficiently, or I sell them or I just put them in a box. It's always annoying whereas the way this works is like you hot swap them out with your drone parts.
(0:58:18) Codey: Yeah, so those are drone parts.
(0:58:23) Al: So I really like that. It's quite cool.
(0:58:28) Al: The same drone.
(0:58:32) Codey: Another question that popped into my brain.
(0:58:34) Codey: So the upgrades to your pets and stuff like that,
(0:58:37) Codey: or to your little drones--
(0:58:40) Codey: I guess you don't upgrade them.
(0:58:42) Codey: You just choose.
(0:58:44) Al: No you do upgrade your personal drones with the drone parts as well
(0:58:44) Codey: Does your pet--
(0:58:48) Al: and that gives you more so you say like your drone can either be storage or attack or what
(0:58:56) Al: was the third or healing it can heal you as well and I think by default you've got like four
(0:59:03) Al: four things you can split between those things so you can say like give me one set of inventory and
(0:59:09) Al: one two attacking and one healing and then as if you
(0:59:12) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:59:14) Al: add drone parts that adds more to that so you can like go up to 10 or something and you can say like
(0:59:20) Al: I want four additions to my inventory plus I want four attacking plus two healing
(0:59:28) Codey: Okay. That's pretty neat. But the things that are just straight up upgrades,
(0:59:33) Codey: like not drone parts and stuff, but like the upgrades to your pet and stuff.
(0:59:36) Codey: Do you eat the card or does the pet eat the card? That's lame. Okay.
(0:59:38) Al: You eat the card.
(0:59:41) Al: Weird, I know, I don't know why.
(0:59:43) Codey: I think the pet, the pet should eat the card. Okay.
(0:59:45) Al: It should, it should.
(0:59:47) Al: But there's also ones like one of them gives you an additional drone slot so you
(0:59:51) Al: can have two personal drones.
(0:59:53) Codey: Okay. So you eat that card,
(0:59:54) Al: You eat that card, yeah.
(0:59:56) Codey: but your pet should eat the cards that refer to your pet.
(0:59:57) Al: I get that, I get that, but that's not how it works.
(0:59:58) Codey: This poor pet is probably starving. Do you feed the pet?
(1:00:03) Codey: Yeah, starving.
(1:00:03) Al: No, I like to think that I like to think
(1:00:07) Al: pet survives on.
(1:00:08) Al: Oh, one really nice upgrade is you can add, so there's two really nice upgrades
(1:00:09) Codey: Spite? Okay. On the dirt that it's digging up for you every day.
(1:00:22) Al: for your pet.
(1:00:23) Al: One is teleporting, so you can get your pet to teleport you to certain points.
(1:00:23) Codey: Okay, ooh.
(1:00:29) Al: So you like put down these base stations and you say teleport me to base station one.
(1:00:35) Al: So I have one at my house.
(1:00:37) Al: I have one
(1:00:38) Al: next to the beach and I have one next to the post office and it's just really nice
(1:00:45) Al: to be able to like just teleport between those things.
(1:00:48) Codey: And do you get to choose where you put those?
(1:00:50) Al: Yep.
(1:00:51) Codey: That's nice.
(1:00:53) Al: You can only have three, which is sad, especially annoying as you can buy a fourth one, you
(1:00:54) Codey: That's okay.
(1:00:57) Al: just can't use it.
(1:01:00) Codey: Wait, what?
(1:01:02) Al: You can buy as many as you want, you just can only put down three of them.
(1:01:06) Al: If you try to put down a fourth one, it says,
(1:01:06) Codey: Only why are you letting me buy more?
(1:01:08) Al: "Put down three," and you're like, "OK, why did you let me buy this?"
(1:01:14) Al: And they're expensive.
(1:01:18) Al: The other one is you can send your pet off to put the stuff in its inventory into the shipping box.
(1:01:29) Codey: Mm-hmm. How long does that take depending is it?
(1:01:30) Al: So it's pretty quick because it teleports.
(1:01:34) Al: So it's useful in two ways one.
(1:01:38) Al: I find it quite useful for three ways, I guess.
(1:01:42) Al: So one, I find it useful for after I've done all of my harvesting for the morning,
(1:01:46) Al: I'll just go right, go sell those and it disappears off and then it comes back
(1:01:51) Codey: >> Mm-hmm. Yeah.
(1:01:51) Al: without the stuff that I wanted to sell.
(1:01:54) Al: Another one is in mines.
(1:01:56) Al: Obviously, if you're quite if you're
(1:01:57) Al: nearly full of of inventory, you can send it off to sell stuff that you don't care
(1:02:01) Al: about. And the third one is fishing, like how many times are you fishing?
(1:02:05) Al: And your inventory fills up really quickly because it's all different kinds
(1:02:09) Al: but you don't want to trek all the way over.
(1:02:11) Al: You can just like send it off to sell the fish you don't care about and then keep
(1:02:14) Al: fishing. I really like it.
(1:02:16) Codey: So for fishing and the, not gardening, well, I guess it is gardening, farming,
(1:02:23) Al: There is not. It is just the base, base level stuff.
(1:02:25) Codey: is there quality to the stuff? Okay. Okay. That's fine.
(1:02:32) Al: What else talk about farming? I feel like that's mostly it. Recurring, so you know, the plants
(1:02:40) Al: that give you something and then you harvest it and it continues growing and giving you
(1:02:45) Al: another one. They will only die because of a change of season, so if they go in the greenhouse
(1:02:50) Al: still stay forever, which is, I always like that. I know it doesn't-
(1:02:53) Al: like, you can have an argument about, you know, whether that's a good thing or not,
(1:02:59) Al: but I really like it. So yeah, I don't know, I like it. So my greenhouses are full of like
(1:03:02) Codey: Why would it not be a good thing?
(1:03:06) Codey: Okay.
(1:03:09) Al: a winter berry, which is a specific crop that gives you five per harvest. And it's like,
(1:03:16) Al: they're quite expensive as well, so you get so much money. It's like every eight days I'm getting
(1:03:21) Al: getting 200 grand just now, which is really great.
(1:03:24) Codey: Wow. Okay. That's a good, good cash, cash crop there.
(1:03:28) Al: I love Dimin Maxx.
(1:03:32) Al: I feel like that's most of the farming animals, I guess, as well exist.
(1:03:37) Al: They're fine.
(1:03:38) Al: They're a bit different in that you don't have to feed them.
(1:03:42) Al: They will produce crops anyway, but they all have a preferred food, a favorite food.
(1:03:48) Al: And if you give them the favorite food, which is the only thing they'll eat,
(1:03:52) Al: if you give them their favorite food, they will give you an extra egg or milk
(1:03:57) Al: will that day.
(1:03:59) Al: So that's fine, I don't have a huge number of them because I feel like there's so much effort
(1:04:07) Al: compared to how much money you make. Yeah, exactly.
(1:04:10) Codey: Mm hmm. Especially if there's not a change in quality.
(1:04:14) Codey: I mean, is there like a crafting or cooking minigame or something?
(1:04:17) Al: There is, there is, there is. I've not done much of that because I never find the cooking hugely
(1:04:18) Codey: OK. Mm hmm.
(1:04:22) Al: fun but it's, it's fine. It's kind of standard. You put in the thing.
(1:04:28) Al: Things and it makes something. I do think it airs too much on the, if you put things in that don't
(1:04:35) Al: make a meal, it'll give you something, it'll give you a wasted thing. And the only way to get rid of
(1:04:42) Al: a wasted thing was with a kitchen bin. You can't sell it and you can't throw it on the ground. Oh,
(1:04:46) Al: yeah, that's one thing to think about. If you lose items, you can get them back. So if you like drop
(1:04:53) Al: something in the mine and then don't come back for it. There's this weird giant fruit.
(1:04:58) Al: A frog that lives in one part of the village and if you go talk to him, he'll have all your lost
(1:05:01) Codey: Okay, I did see him.
(1:05:04) Al: items and you can just buy them back. I quite like that because it means you, if you fill in the mines
(1:05:06) Codey: Okay, yeah.
(1:05:12) Al: and you don't want to send your pet off to sell stuff, you can just leave and then go buy them
(1:05:16) Al: back off this giant frog. I think if you have 20 items, it's like 400, it's really not expensive.
(1:05:18) Codey: I mean... what's the cost?
(1:05:27) Al: It's difficult early game.
(1:05:28) Al: But there's no time limit for it. The only thing is, he has a maximum of 20 different items.
(1:05:33) Al: So if you lose more than 20 items, then one of them is gone. For good.
(1:05:38) Codey: Yeah. Well that seems seems like it's another way to try and get away from the inventory issues.
(1:05:38) Al: But like, be careful with stuff, right? Don't be throwing stuff away all the time.
(1:05:48) Codey: Like oh just set it down!
(1:05:48) Al: Yeah, yeah, I don't know if it is that or not.
(1:05:53) Al: But anyway, I kind of like it.
(1:05:55) Al: It's a nice little thing.
(1:05:56) Codey: Okay
(1:05:59) Codey: You were talking about farming and then cooking and setting things down
(1:06:06) Al: Oh, yeah, yes, yes.
(1:06:07) Al: So that if you cook something that isn't
(1:06:09) Al: actually a menu, you get this spoiled meal.
(1:06:12) Al: If you drop it, then it goes into the the giant frogs thing.
(1:06:17) Al: And then you either buy everything or buy nothing.
(1:06:19) Al: So if you buy everything, then you have the spoiled meal back.
(1:06:20) Codey: Oh, you you get it
(1:06:23) Al: So you have to go and buy this kitchen bin specifically.
(1:06:26) Al: This is the only way to put spoiled food in.
(1:06:29) Al: And I feel like it's it's there's
(1:06:32) Al: If you don't have specific menu items, then you just.
(1:06:36) Al: End up making spoiled food and I feel like it could air more on the oh,
(1:06:39) Al: this is just like generic food or like it's not great.
(1:06:43) Al: But like, why is it either you've made a perfect cake or it is literally
(1:06:47) Al: inedible, right, like that's not how cooking works.
(1:06:53) Al: So I just don't bother cooking because I just I just don't particularly find that
(1:06:57) Al: fun anyway, and it's not the most it's not unique or different in a good way.
(1:06:58) Codey: Yeah, that's fair.
(1:07:06) Al: Fishing, the fishing minigame I absolutely hated initially.
(1:07:12) Codey: Okay
(1:07:13) Al: So this is going to be really hard to explain on our podcast, but let me try.
(1:07:19) Codey: Especially for someone that has aphantasia
(1:07:22) Al: Well, yes, so you have two spinning concentric circles with a cut out in each
(1:07:29) Al: of them and in the middle of those concentric spinning circles is the fish.
(1:07:36) Al: And your fishing line hook is at the top of the screen.
(1:07:40) Al: And what you do is you press the button and that will stop the outer concentric
(1:07:46) Al: spinning circle and then you press the button again and it will stop the inner
(1:07:50) Al: spinning contents concentric spinning circle and then your hook will drop down
(1:07:52) Codey: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(1:07:55) Al: from the top and if it manages to pass through the cutouts in both of those
(1:08:01) Al: circles, and into the middle, then you catch the fish.
(1:08:06) Al: It is the most over the top and completely ridiculous fish fishing minigame, and I absolutely
(1:08:11) Codey: Yeah. Oh.
(1:08:12) Al: hate that it took me about 20 times before I even caught one fish. However, there's two
(1:08:19) Al: points to this. One, you can turn the minigame off, and you just press it's just like then
(1:08:25) Al: Animal Crossing fishing. The disadvantage to that is there's actually two fish you can
(1:08:30) Al: catch with every fish. So if you get through the first circle and not the second, you catch
(1:08:36) Al: more common fish, and if you get into the middle, you catch the more common and the rare fish, you
(1:08:37) Codey: Oh, does it tell-- just the common one, or--
(1:08:40) Al: get both fish. If you turn off the minigame, you only get one of those fish, not both of them.
(1:08:48) Al: I don't know. I don't know. I didn't look into that. So there's that. And secondly,
(1:08:50) Codey: OK.
(1:08:53) Codey: Or it's probably just random.
(1:08:56) Al: you can very quickly upgrade your fishing line to slow down the spinning, and that makes a massive
(1:09:02) Codey: Oh.
(1:09:04) Al: difference.
(1:09:06) Al: I can't decide if I like this or not. It's the same as the Stardew one where it's really
(1:09:08) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:09:13) Codey: OK.
(1:09:17) Al: frustrating to start with but once you upgrade your fishing rod and you get better at it,
(1:09:19) Codey: Yeah.
(1:09:22) Al: it suddenly is less of a problem and you're then just catching fish.
(1:09:24) Codey: I also didn't realize until I finally
(1:09:28) Codey: listened to that Eric Barone interview
(1:09:31) Codey: that there is a training rod.
(1:09:32) Al: Yeah, that was added in 1.5, I think.
(1:09:32) Codey: Okay, but yeah, I didn't know that that was a thing either.
(1:09:38) Al: Yeah, you can only catch common fish with that, but it allows you to increase your fishing skill,
(1:09:45) Al: which then increases the bar that you can you use, so it makes it future fishing easier.
(1:09:52) Al: Yeah, it's fine. I don't hate it now, but is that because I'm just used to it now? I don't know.
(1:10:02) Al: I like that you can turn off the minigame, but there's also an advantage to having the minigame on,
(1:10:08) Codey: Yeah. Yeah, there's like an option.
(1:10:09) Al: right? I think that's a good balance of things. Maybe.
(1:10:16) Codey: I mean, that's basically you just have to like, there's a benefit for doing the game,
(1:10:20) Codey: but you still get a fish like you still you can't you can do it without the mini game,
(1:10:27) Codey: but there is a benefit. Like I like that. I like that option.
(1:10:30) Al: It feels like the nicest balance for these things.
(1:10:33) Codey: Yeah, I feel like I probably like that mini game. It sounds like a timing thing.
(1:10:34) Al: So.
(1:10:37) Al: It is, yeah, instead of like with the stardew one, it's like
(1:10:42) Al: you have to like guess when it's going to be going up and down and try and
(1:10:47) Codey: Yeah
(1:10:47) Al: figure that out, and yeah, that becomes really awkward.
(1:10:51) Al: This is purely a timing thing.
(1:10:52) Codey: Mm-hmm, which is nice
(1:10:54) Al: Yeah.
(1:10:56) Al: What else have I got?
(1:10:58) Al: Let's quickly do bug catching.
(1:11:00) Al: You see a bug, you use your net, you've got the bug.
(1:11:00) Codey: Yeah, the important part.
(1:11:07) Al: You can't scare them away, like in Coral Island.
(1:11:09) Al: It's literally just if you walk up to it and press A, you get the bug.
(1:11:13) Al: It's very simple.
(1:11:14) Al: There is one cool thing in that you can have terrariums and if you put, you can get, I can't remember what they're called, but they're essentially like cocoons or whatever, like a little, they sometimes fall out of trees.
(1:11:25) Codey: A pupa a pupa a chrysalis
(1:11:30) Al: Yeah, I think they call them chrysalises.
(1:11:32) Al: I think that's what they were called in game.
(1:11:34) Al: They fall from trees sometimes, and if you put that in a terrarium, it'll hatch into a bug of some kind.
(1:11:38) Codey: Mm-hmm. We actually are doing that right now in the real
(1:11:44) Al: So, I mean, that's cool.
(1:11:46) Al: The bug catching is obviously not particularly interesting, but it's a collection based thing, so it's not a skill based thing, so fine, sure, whatever.
(1:11:53) Codey: Mm, it should be a skill-based thing.
(1:11:57) Al: I think what I would say is the.
(1:12:00) Al: The percentage of spawning of bugs is really low, like sometimes you'll go around in a day and you'll maybe see like two bugs in the whole day and it feels a little low, especially if you're trying to get them for specific things like you need.
(1:12:14) Al: You need silkworms to get silk for some things and you need bees to get honey for things and there's a few different bits and pieces like that and it's a bit frustrating going through a whole week and not seeing.
(1:12:22) Codey: Mm hmm. That's weird. I mean, does it depend on the weather at all? Or is it just kind of?
(1:12:32) Al: I don't think it does, I don't think it does.
(1:12:34) Al: I found that the best way to find bees is by shaking trees.
(1:12:37) Al: But like you can easily shake 20 trees and still not see a bee.
(1:12:41) Al: But after a while you get quite you get enough bees.
(1:12:43) Al: It just takes some time.
(1:12:45) Al: So I guess it's not the end of the world.
(1:12:46) Al: It's just frustrating when it's the one thing that's standing in your way is you
(1:12:49) Al: need honey. Like this is the one quest that's restricting every other quest.
(1:12:53) Codey: Yeah, I think it would be so cute.
(1:12:54) Al: And you need honey and you're shaking every tree every day.
(1:12:56) Al: And there's not a single bee that can be frustrating.
(1:13:02) Codey: It's just like brain blasted.
(1:13:03) Codey: I just thought of this to have a game where you don't see insects unless you
(1:13:08) Codey: slow down because that's kind of real life.
(1:13:11) Codey: Like we're usually walking so fast that you don't really see them unless there
(1:13:14) Codey: are these big, huge ones that like get in your face, but if you slow down and
(1:13:18) Codey: you just kind of like, watch the world around you, there's
(1:13:23) Codey: are bugs everywhere do this friends do this to go outside, go to an area and just walk
(1:13:30) Codey: slow or just stop and watch an area. There's always stuff happening. That would be cool.
(1:13:37) Al: Yeah, fair.
(1:13:40) Codey: I doubt that that's what's happening here. But that would be cool. How realistic do they
(1:13:41) Al: No, I don't think it is.
(1:13:43) Al: I don't think it is.
(1:13:45) Al: Any bug questions?
(1:13:47) Codey: seem? Also, when you catch them, is there like
(1:13:48) Al: Not particularly, because like they're quite.
(1:13:54) Codey: Wow, you caught a whatever magic. Okay.
(1:13:56) Al: No. It's actually very anticlimactic, because I don't know whether this is a bug or not,
(1:14:05) Al: but you don't even, if you successfully catch it, you don't even swing the net. You only
(1:14:09) Al: swing the net if it's unsuccessful. So you're like, you see a silkworm, you go out to catch
(1:14:14) Al: it, you press A, and then the silkworm just like turns into an item that then you suck
(1:14:20) Al: up and it adds into your inventory. It's the most anticlimactic thing in the world.
(1:14:25) Codey: Which is wild, because thinking about actually swinging a net, after you got the thing in the
(1:14:32) Codey: net, the fun has begun. Because then you got to try and get it out of the net without either
(1:14:37) Codey: harming it or getting harmed by it. Especially if it's B. I think that'd be really fun.
(1:14:42) Al: Yeah, I don't think I want more realism for that bit, though, let's be honest.
(1:14:47) Al: You press A to catch it and then you have a minigame to try and get it out of the net.
(1:14:52) Al: No, thank you.
(1:14:53) Codey: I would love that.
(1:14:56) Codey: 'Cause that's so legit.
(1:14:59) Al: So they have bees, they have pink bees, they have silkworms.
(1:15:01) Al: They have dragonflies, a few different types of dragonflies.
(1:15:06) Al: They have not butterflies, but flutterflies.
(1:15:11) Codey: Okay, they got sued by a big butterfly.
(1:15:12) Al: I have no idea why everything else is named normally, and then this is not.
(1:15:16) Al: It is such a bizarre decision to make.
(1:15:25) Al: And you can catch caterpillars or get cocoons from shaking trees,
(1:15:29) Al: and they can all be put into rariums to turn into different types of flutterflies.
(1:15:30) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:15:33) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:15:34) Al: And then you can also get frogs,
(1:15:37) Al: which are not bugs, but you can catch frogs for some reason.
(1:15:38) Codey: They count
(1:15:41) Codey: They're honorary
(1:15:42) Al: You can also get tadpoles and put them in a terrarium and grow up.
(1:15:48) Codey: I do not recommend doing that, friends.
(1:15:54) Codey: Are there different kinds of frogs?
(1:15:56) Codey: Or is it just you've caught a frog?
(1:15:56) Al: There are different kinds of frogs. Yeah, there's quite a lot of different kinds of frogs.
(1:15:59) Codey: OK.
(1:16:00) Codey: This person likes frogs.
(1:16:01) Al: They are not realistic frogs though. It's like blue dino frog, arrow grey frog, golden idol frog,
(1:16:04) Codey: Yeah, I figured.
(1:16:10) Codey: I mean, those could be legit frog names.
(1:16:14) Codey: I'm not going to lie.
(1:16:15) Al: killer whale frog. I like the frogs. The frogs are nice designs, I would.
(1:16:17) Codey: It, I'm,
(1:16:18) Codey: yeah, that's good. Frogs are cool. So other than silkworms and bees, I mean, do these
(1:16:29) Codey: things serve a purpose or is it just for funsies? Oh, but you put them in the museum. You mentioned
(1:16:32) Al: written, yeah, no, they're just the rest of them are just collection. Yeah.
(1:16:36) Codey: a museum earlier. Tell me about the museum.
(1:16:39) Al: It's a pretty standard museum. You go up and you donate something and then once you've done
(1:16:45) Al: specific collection, you get the credits that I was talking about where you can then get cards.
(1:16:51) Codey: So it's, but it's like a museum plus a community center.
(1:16:56) Al: No, it's more like just like, "Oh, you've finished the Flutter Flutter."
(1:17:02) Al: You get a credit. Yeah, but they're in the museum. I don't know. I didn't set the museum up.
(1:17:04) Codey: But you mentioned spring crops.
(1:17:08) Codey: Why?
(1:17:11) Codey: I don't...
(1:17:12) Codey: Well...
(1:17:13) Al: But it is very much you're adding them into the museum for some reason.
(1:17:17) Codey: Do you get to go then look at them?
(1:17:19) Al: I think so. I've never actually done that.
(1:17:22) Codey: Oh my gosh.
(1:17:23) Al: Look, Cody, I don't care about going to the museum. I'm just setting up.
(1:17:27) Al: Let me go have a look. Give me two seconds.
(1:17:30) Codey: I'm always curious. Everything needs to live up to the standard of New Horizons Museum.
(1:17:38) Codey: That museum is so cool. The fossil part?
(1:17:40) Al: I mean, it is nowhere near as good as that.
(1:17:43) Al: Okay.
(1:17:43) Al: So it's very much like, uh, say the, the Stardew library, you know, where you're
(1:17:50) Al: like, add the, the different antiques and it's just like, there's the, the tables
(1:17:57) Al: with all this stuff on it.
(1:17:58) Al: It's basically that, but there's a couple of different.
(1:17:59) Codey: - Okay.
(1:18:01) Codey: - Sounds like they need a designer.
(1:18:05) Codey: - Are the bugs alive or are they dead?
(1:18:08) Al: I'm guessing they're dead because they're just sitting on tables, not moving.
(1:18:12) Codey: Okay, that's that's a museum versus a vivarium.
(1:18:14) Al: Yeah, it's.
(1:18:17) Al: Yeah, yeah, it's it's very much like bare minimum museum.
(1:18:24) Codey: Okay, but you need those cards to eat, so makes sense.
(1:18:25) Al: Yes, well, that's that's the reason I'm doing it.
(1:18:31) Al: OK, two more things I want to talk about mining.
(1:18:35) Al: So you've got dungeons.
(1:18:36) Al: the interesting thing about the dungeons.
(1:18:38) Al: Dungeons is they're very much dungeons rather than mines.
(1:18:41) Codey: Okay, so you're not, like, going deeper.
(1:18:43) Al: So you're not going deeper, you are going sideways, essentially, right?
(1:18:48) Codey: Yeah, further in, yeah.
(1:18:48) Al: Like you go in and there's a room and you have to defeat the monsters in the room,
(1:18:53) Al: and then you can move on to the next room.
(1:18:55) Al: And there's branching paths, but essentially it's,
(1:18:59) Al: yeah, you're getting from the start of the mine all the way to the boss at the end.
(1:19:04) Al: and then there's a boss at the end or and you
(1:19:08) Al: um you kill the boss and then you get access to the next dungeon there are four different
(1:19:13) Al: dungeons um so it's it feels a bit more kind of explorationy because there's the branching paths
(1:19:21) Al: rather than like a mine is just dig until you find a ladder and then go down and then every
(1:19:27) Al: five levels you can you get a checkpoint um there are like portals within the dungeon so you don't
(1:19:35) Al: You don't have to always go from the start to the end.
(1:19:38) Al: It's kind of like the elevator in Stardew Mine, but it's very much like a map based
(1:19:48) Codey: Mm-hmm a mine, but there's mining in it
(1:19:49) Al: dungeon rather than a level based mine.
(1:19:55) Al: It fulfills the exact same purpose as the mine in Stardew, it's just it's a dungeon
(1:20:00) Codey: Okay.
(1:20:01) Al: rather than a mine.
(1:20:02) Codey: Except the--
(1:20:03) Al: I think it's fun, a fun different thing.
(1:20:04) Codey: Yeah, and the stardew doesn't have, like, bosses.
(1:20:08) Al: Yeah, and these and these bosses are pretty like I got through the first dungeon to the
(1:20:08) Codey: There's just, like, monsters that are thicker and stuff, but, like...
(1:20:17) Al: boss pretty quickly without having to really worry about my attack level.
(1:20:21) Al: And then I went into the first boss and died almost immediately.
(1:20:24) Codey: Bye.
(1:20:25) Al: So it's it's quite yeah, you have to then increase your attack and you have to give
(1:20:30) Al: your pet some ability to attack and you have to get your your drone and then it becomes
(1:20:36) Al: more of a challenge.
(1:20:38) Al: And then once you've got those skills up,
(1:20:40) Al: it's incredibly easy, but yeah, it makes you think about these things.
(1:20:47) Al: You can't just go swinging wildly.
(1:20:49) Al: You have to do a little bit of tactics.
(1:20:52) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:20:54) Al: I like it, though, it's kind of fun.
(1:20:56) Al: You've also got a couple of mining
(1:20:57) Al: tunnels that you unlock later on in the game, which are just every season they
(1:21:02) Al: respawn some some nodes which are fine.
(1:21:08) Al: But this leads into the final point, which is the pixies.
(1:21:12) Al: Now, you might be thinking, oh, pixies, they just like the harvest sprays.
(1:21:12) Codey: Okay. Yeah. Okay.
(1:21:16) Al: These are very unique.
(1:21:17) Al: This is the most unique thing, I think, in this game.
(1:21:21) Al: So you have pixies shrine.
(1:21:24) Al: And if you put a crop on it,
(1:21:27) Al: there's a percentage chance depending on how expensive the crop is
(1:21:33) Al: because these pixies are apparently capitalists.
(1:21:36) Al: there is a
(1:21:38) Al: chance that a pixie will spawn on that shrine the next day.
(1:21:42) Al: If there is, you can then put it in a bottle and you can do a number
(1:21:45) Al: of different things on it, depending on what that pixie is.
(1:21:48) Al: So there are four different kinds of pixies.
(1:21:51) Al: There's green, red, blue and rainbow.
(1:21:53) Codey: Mmm, okay.
(1:21:55) Al: The green ones you can place on a tree
(1:22:01) Al: and every day it will give you some wood from that tree without the tree being
(1:22:08) Al: put down. The blue ones you can put on an ore deposit in these mining tunnels
(1:22:15) Al: and every day it will give you some of that ore without destroying the ore deposit.
(1:22:22) Al: And red ones you can put on any of your
(1:22:27) Al: no, any of your machines.
(1:22:31) Al: On on your farm and it will speed up that machine.
(1:22:38) Al: You can put it on a glass maker.
(1:22:40) Al: It will take half the time to make glass.
(1:22:44) Al: And then if you don't have it on.
(1:22:48) Al: What I will say is I have found the only
(1:22:51) Al: thing I have used the red ones for is for my tappers for getting stuff from trees,
(1:22:56) Al: because that is you need there's so many different types of trees.
(1:23:01) Al: And one of them is that water tree and you get water sap from that.
(1:23:08) Al: days to get water sap from a water tree, and you need water sap to make the watering drones.
(1:23:15) Al: You're now seeing where my whole thing is right now and why this is taking so long to get these
(1:23:18) Codey: Yeah. Yeah.
(1:23:19) Al: drones. So yeah, if you put a red pixie on a tapper and put it on a water tree, you will then
(1:23:33) Al: get one every five days rather than every 10 days, so that massively speeds that up.
(1:23:38) Al: But you have to have like an expensive tapper which uses
(1:23:42) Al: maple syrup to do it, and so you have to like tap. You end up in this classic thing in farming
(1:23:48) Al: games where it's like this massive chain to get to what you actually want. But yeah,
(1:23:55) Al: that's what use the red ones for. The rainbow ones can do any of them, and they do it slightly
(1:24:00) Al: faster, I believe, but I have not had a single rainbow.
(1:24:04) Codey: So how common are they like how likely are you to get this kind of like
(1:24:11) Codey: gambling right like you
(1:24:13) Al: Yeah, so I think there are exact numbers on the wiki, I think, but from what I can tell,
(1:24:20) Al: I'm roughly putting on a winter berry, which is the one I get so many of. I'm getting one
(1:24:24) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:24:27) Al: pixie roughly every three days. Yeah. So, yeah, it is definitely a, it takes a lot to
(1:24:28) Codey: So you put it on every day, okay
(1:24:38) Al: get them, but at the point that I'm at, it's really worth it.
(1:24:39) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(1:24:43) Codey: And is it random?
(1:24:43) Al: It's not early game.
(1:24:45) Codey: What color do you get?
(1:24:46) Al: Yeah.
(1:24:47) Al: Yeah.
(1:24:48) Al: The other thing you can do with them if you don't want to use it for something,
(1:24:50) Al: because there's like a maximum number of pixies you can use on your things.
(1:24:53) Al: I think it's like nine and then you can increase it.
(1:24:56) Al: Is there's like a pixie cave and you can take it and set them free in the pixie
(1:25:01) Al: cave and after you've set a certain number of pixies free in the pixie cave,
(1:25:06) Al: you get certain upgrades.
(1:25:09) Al: So one of which being you can have your own personal little pixie that follows
(1:25:13) Al: like a little light source.
(1:25:16) Al: But yeah, it's a, I think it's a fun little additional thing because it means
(1:25:20) Al: that, you know, it's trying to lean into the sustainability aspect of things.
(1:25:24) Al: And it means that like, I have the most expensive ore.
(1:25:28) Al: I'm getting like 10 of them every single day without doing anything.
(1:25:32) Al: And the rare types of wood, I'm getting 10 of them every day without having to
(1:25:38) Al: do anything and obviously speeding up my, my tappers to get the stuff that.
(1:25:43) Al: The sap that I need for other things is really good because one of the saps
(1:25:48) Al: takes 14 days to get so you really want to use the red pixies for that.
(1:25:53) Codey: Yeah.
(1:25:55) Al: So it's a fun additional thing in the game.
(1:25:58) Al: I think it makes, I like that you can then kind of, I've never seen another
(1:26:05) Al: farming game allow you to passively get ore and wood.
(1:26:09) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah, like have something that will get it for you. Yeah. So I've got a question. So you've
(1:26:10) Al: I think that's quite fun.
(1:26:20) Codey: talked about there's pixies, there's drones, there's a pet, there's like all these things
(1:26:28) Codey: you're interacting with that are not human.
(1:26:32) Al: Oh I see where you're going with this.
(1:26:35) Al: You can tell my priorities in game. I haven't even mentioned that there are
(1:26:39) Codey: Okay. Okay. Well, not, yeah. Things. Okay. Yeah.
(1:26:39) Al: other characters in this game. There are other characters in this game.
(1:26:43) Al: They're also not human, but that's like they're bipedal and they talk to you.
(1:26:52) Al: I don't find them particularly interesting, but also I don't think any farming game has ever made
(1:26:58) Al: made them interesting except Stardew.
(1:27:02) Al: I mean, the premise behind this game is like, you die, but it turns out that your life was just a simulation, and you're instead this character in this world, and that's just a thing you do for fun is go and do simulated worlds for some reason, and it's very weird, but you are the only human, it's animal crossing-esque in that way, like you are for some reason a human, but everyone else is an animal, and they're all different animals, and it's like...
(1:27:20) Codey: Okay. Yeah.
(1:27:32) Al: but you're also raising animals? I don't know why they're animals. I don't... I don't know why they're animals. It doesn't... there's no story-based thing that I found that explains why they're animals, and I'm not an animal, but we're all raising animals as well.
(1:27:32) Codey: Yeah.
(1:27:38) Codey: Well, it's...
(1:27:50) Codey: Well, it's a simulation so none of it's real.
(1:27:55) Al: No, this isn't a simulation. This is not the simulation.
(1:27:58) Codey: Oh, are you sure?
(1:28:00) Al: - No. (laughs)
(1:28:02) Codey: What if at the end of this you're still, you simulate again?
(1:28:07) Al: - I have no idea.
(1:28:08) Codey: So, okay, so they're all animals.
(1:28:09) Codey: Is there a romance system?
(1:28:11) Al: - No, I don't think so.
(1:28:13) Codey: Okay, that would make sense because they're all animals.
(1:28:15) Al: There are romances between some of the villagers
(1:28:20) Al: that you help facilitate.
(1:28:21) Codey: That's cute.
(1:28:22) Codey: Okay, but you are just lonely with your automated,
(1:28:26) Al: Independent, I think is the word you're looking for.
(1:28:29) Al: Independent.
(1:28:29) Codey: you're right, that is the word.
(1:28:34) Codey: I mean, I'm in the real, I'm fairly outgoing,
(1:28:38) Codey: but then I just pretty much just, it's just me and Jeff
(1:28:40) Codey: and I can live with just only ever seeing him.
(1:28:45) Codey: So yeah, independent, that's fine.
(1:28:50) Codey: That's totally fine.
(1:28:51) Codey: I was just curious because I was like,
(1:28:52) Codey: oh, we've been talking a lot about these.
(1:28:54) Al: Yeah well I mean I guess that just shows my biases right like I don't actually care about
(1:28:58) Al: characters in games generally but yeah I don't think they're they're not particularly interesting
(1:29:03) Al: but there is like some story stuff around them and you unlock it with quests and stuff like that.
(1:29:07) Al: There's like this really weird storyline where you help someone create a a potion that makes
(1:29:13) Al: them fall in love with them by stealing their hair and putting into it but then but then you
(1:29:19) Al: realize that it's wrong and you manage to convince them to reverse it so.
(1:29:20) Codey: Yep.
(1:29:24) Codey: Good.
(1:29:25) Al: But it's all very weird.
(1:29:26) Codey: Yeah.
(1:29:28) Codey: 'Cause that's weird, people.
(1:29:30) Al: You're essentially peer pressured into doing it but you give them
(1:29:34) Al: the hair of a different person than the one that you said you were going to.
(1:29:38) Codey: Ooh, that, I don't like that.
(1:29:39) Al: It's very weird, it's a very weird story. I guess to summarize I enjoy this game,
(1:29:47) Al: it's very good in my opinion, it is very much a stardew but here's a bunch of different things
(1:29:53) Al: that we do.
(1:29:54) Al: And I like that, but as I say, if what you like about Stardew is the characters then this probably isn't the game.
(1:30:02) Al: But if what you like about Stardew is the repetitive nature of building up a big farm, give it a go.
(1:30:08) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:30:10) Al: It's good fun. I have...
(1:30:11) Codey: Unless you hate inventory management
(1:30:13) Al: Well, I mean, it does get better over time with, you know, once you've got, like, your pet and you've got two of the drones and you've got them both on the inventory and blah blah blah blah.
(1:30:25) Al: Whatever, then you do end up with a decent amount of space. It's just having to decide whether you want that to be the inventory space or not. I just don't like that option. I'd like it to be permanent, but...
(1:30:36) Al: No, I think it's fun. I mean, obviously, I do have put in 60 hours into it, right? Like, I don't put 60 hours into a game I'm not enjoying.
(1:30:41) Codey: Yeah, I think it has a cute little art style.
(1:30:47) Codey: And I think that if I were in the market
(1:30:50) Codey: to play a cute little sturdie like I would play it.
(1:30:55) Al: Cool. All right. Well, thank you, Cody, for joining me to listen to me talk about Ever After False.
(1:30:56) Codey: So cool.
(1:31:04) Codey: Thank you for playing it so that we could talk about it.
(1:31:07) Al: Yeah, it was accidental. I just kind of opened it up and started playing it, and before I knew it,
(1:31:11) Al: I was like tens of hours in. Oopsie. Yeah, there we go. I guess we got a podcast episode.
(1:31:14) Codey: And you're like, well, might as well cover it now.
(1:31:20) Codey: Yeah, that's cool.
(1:31:22) Al: Where can people find you on the internet, Cody?
(1:31:24) Codey: Hey, can you find me at hiking beagle be eagle on Instagram at Cody Mathis,
(1:31:31) Codey: which is my name on the blue skies, uh, and then also on the slack,
(1:31:38) Codey: which you will talk about in a bit.
(1:31:40) Al: Yes, you can find me on mastodon.scot and on blue sky at the Scott bot.
(1:31:45) Al: Not that I do much on either of them.
(1:31:46) Al: You can find the podcast on Tumblr and on Blue Sky at THSPod.
(1:31:51) Al: You can send us feedback from our website, harveyseason.club, where you can also find
(1:31:56) Al: links to everything to do with the podcast, including our Patreon, patreon.com/thspod,
(1:32:00) Al: where you can get access to the Slack, as Cody mentioned, and talk to people about things.
(1:32:05) Al: he's talking about bugs today. Or...
(1:32:06) Codey: - Mm-hmm, yep.
(1:32:10) Al: You can also get access to our bonus podcasts, including we've just released our Eurovision
(1:32:17) Al: Predictions episode. We've just recorded our Eurovision reaction, which ended up being about
(1:32:22) Codey: >> Mm-hmm.
(1:32:24) Al: 90% politics. So there you go. Maybe you want to hear that, maybe you don't. Who knows?
(1:32:32) Codey: Are you curious? Then go to patreon.com/yasias for that!
(1:32:37) Al: And as I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast, there will be a couple of weeks.
(1:32:40) Al: After this episode, whether there will be no episode.
(1:32:43) Codey: Take a break.
(1:32:44) Al: I think that's everything. Thank you again, Cody, for joining me.
(1:32:47) Codey: Of course.
(1:32:48) Al: Thank you listeners for listening. And until next time, whenever that might be, have a good harvest.
(1:32:53) Codey: Have a good harvest.
(1:32:54) Theme Tune: The harvest season is created by Al McKinlay, with support from our patrons, including our
(1:33:04) Theme Tune: pro farmers, Kevin, Stuart and Alisa.
(1:33:08) Theme Tune: Our art is done by Micah the Brave, and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
(1:33:13) Theme Tune: Feel free to visit our website harvestseason.club for show notes and links to things we discussed
(1:33:19) Theme Tune: in this episode.
(1:33:36) Codey: Yeah, sorry, Chloe was a lot barkier today than normal.
(1:33:40) Al: I didn't hear anything, so...
(1:33:42) Codey: Oh, well, that's good.
