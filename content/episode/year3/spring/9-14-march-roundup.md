# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Al,
(0:00:36) Kev: My name is Kevin.
(0:00:38) Al: and we are here today to talk about cottagecore games.
(0:00:42) Kev: Woo! A lot of them.
(0:00:45) Kev: A lot of games to talk about.
(0:00:45) Al: So many cottagecore games. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So, we just had a Nintendo Direct.
(0:00:56) Al: By the time you hear this, there will have been another Nintendo Direct,
(0:00:58) Kev: Haha sick. Oh my gosh. It's that close. Oh my gosh. I'm not ready. I'm not ready
(0:00:59) Al: But...
(0:01:00) Al: We won't be talking about that one.
(0:01:02) Al: Not in this episode.
(0:01:04) Al: Yeah, yeah. I think it's the day of. Yeah, it's the second. We release on the second, which is when the...
(0:01:10) Kev: Yeah
(0:01:11) Al: So, yeah.
(0:01:14) Al: Let's see how this goes. But we are...
(0:01:16) Kev: So thank you for tuning in when even we're not caring about this episode
(0:01:22) Al: Hey, hey, I care. I care.
(0:01:23) Kev: No, that's not true
(0:01:26) Al: So yeah, we're going to talk about the switch direct this
(0:01:30) Al: well, so we have a greenhouse episode where we talk about the switch direct in its whole,
(0:01:35) Al: but we skip over the stuff that we're going to talk about in this episode,
(0:01:39) Al: specifically, it's cartridge core games.
(0:01:40) Kev: Because there was stuff for us.
(0:01:43) Kev: Episode, entire episodes of the horror season were announced in that direct.
(0:01:49) Al: You're not wrong, I will say. So we're going to talk about that. We've got some other news,
(0:01:56) Al: Because people decided to send out other news as well this week.
(0:02:00) Al: And that wasn't just all in the Nintendo Direct.
(0:02:03) Al: We've also got the roundup of March because it's a new month now.
(0:02:08) Al: Almost. It will be a new month now.
(0:02:10) Al: This is one of those weird months where we are recording in a different month
(0:02:14) Al: than we're releasing, and I was like, do I wait till next week?
(0:02:16) Al: But I decided, no, let's do it in this one, because I'm sure nobody will announce
(0:02:18) Kev: Sure.
(0:02:21) Al: and release their game in the next two days. Right?
(0:02:24) Kev: Oh, oh, oh, oh.
(0:02:26) Al: We'll see.
(0:02:27) Kev: There's you.
(0:02:28) Kev: There's you.
(0:02:28) Al: We'll see.
(0:02:31) Al: So we're going to talk about what released last month, in March.
(0:02:35) Al: And we've got some feedback that we're going to talk about as well.
(0:02:39) Kev: Oh, oh, that's that's a genuinely exciting. I didn't know that I'm excited
(0:02:43) Al: But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:02:46) Kev: Uh
(0:02:48) Kev: Gosh, I can't believe it's actually been a week since I recorded and it feels like so much has happened
(0:02:54) Kev: I got sick in between then and there it was rough
(0:02:54) Al: No, no.
(0:02:58) Kev: I don't know if I thought it was a common cold at first. It might have been something a little last year. That's
(0:03:05) Kev: Yeah, the uncommon cold. That's correct. Um, I
(0:03:09) Kev: was breaking it off. Thankfully, but uh, yeah, that that took me down a few pegs over the week, but uh, I
(0:03:16) Kev: When I was able to I squeezed in its usual say so on and so forth, but the big one wonder stop I finished it
(0:03:25) Kev: I'm just holding up my thumb. You know one can see it, but I am and and that's all I'm going to say on that because
(0:03:33) Kev: One you people should play it because it's a good game and two
(0:03:37) Kev: Maybe who knows I will talk
(0:03:39) Kev: about it somewhere in detail, somewhere, someplace, maybe, I don't know.
(0:03:43) Al: So, obviously, not spoilery, but nothing to change on what you said about it in the last
(0:03:49) Kev: nope my nope my that is correct it did not crash and burn did not you know
(0:03:49) Al: episode.
(0:03:50) Al: You've not changed your mind.
(0:03:58) Kev: scald my I and games there are games that will do that right the last second
(0:04:02) Kev: just just ruin everything nope it stumps up all the way yeah so wonder stuff good
(0:04:12) Al: Oh, nothing big, I've been continuing on Pokemon GO despite everything, because I still genuinely
(0:04:12) Kev: stuff what about you well what's been going on
(0:04:23) Al: enjoy that game, and the new TCG Pocket expansion dropped a couple of days ago, so I've been
(0:04:26) Kev: Now, you know, that's fair.
(0:04:32) Al: opening some packs, getting some cards, I got a shiny something, was that charming?
(0:04:33) Kev: Uh, it's...
(0:04:35) Kev: Oh.
(0:04:36) Kev: What?
(0:04:38) Kev: Uh.
(0:04:39) Kev: Okay.
(0:04:40) Kev: Like, I, I, I am...
(0:04:42) Kev: ...interested in...
(0:04:45) Kev: ...because, you know, in the standard TCG, a new...
(0:04:49) Kev: ...set, or expansion, or whatever...
(0:04:52) Kev: ...usually has...
(0:04:55) Kev: ...stuff.
(0:04:55) Kev: Well, it has.
(0:04:56) Kev: Certain expectations or expectations are set.
(0:04:59) Kev: Let's say that right sometimes.
(0:05:01) Kev: Yeah.
(0:05:01) Kev: I mean, yes, there are cool arts that people can want that and so on and so forth.
(0:05:06) Kev: Sometimes to ridiculous scalpery like insane levels of the expectations, but there's gameplay stuff to lots of times, right?
(0:05:17) Kev: Like we're getting the Team Rocket Pokemon are coming back soon in the TCG and that's cool or you know, we got styles or whatever.
(0:05:25) Kev: I like to, there's, there's.
(0:05:26) Kev: Oh, okay. There you go. That's a big one. All right. All right.
(0:05:35) Al: No, it is. It is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
(0:05:37) Al: So the last the last set included tools, which they hadn't had before.
(0:05:43) Al: Pokemon to and I and also the there's like Arceus Link.
(0:05:52) Al: I don't know if you know about the Arceus...
(0:05:53) Al: Like that was a thing in the physical TCG years ago.
(0:05:56) Al: I don't know if you know what that is.
(0:05:56) Kev: Okay, I'm not. I heard whispers of it, but I didn't look at it.
(0:06:01) Al: It's like abilities that affect Pokemon,
(0:06:04) Al: but only if you use--
(0:06:05) Al: Arceus, so it's like if you have Arceus on the field then this happens sort of thing.
(0:06:06) Kev: Huh, okay.
(0:06:09) Kev: Yeah.
(0:06:11) Kev: Oh, that's a pretty cool idea. Actually, I like that. That's fun.
(0:06:15) Al: It's very tied to Arceus which obviously limits your deck abilities but--
(0:06:19) Kev: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:06:21) Al: And then this set there-- I mean there's obviously always cards that have like
(0:06:26) Al: new abilities and stuff like that. There's a different Charizard which-- I haven't looked
(0:06:28) Kev: Sure, sure.
(0:06:31) Al: into what people are saying but I think looks like a much better Charizard than the previous
(0:06:36) Al: one. There is a Giratina that is interesting. Both of those cards are heavily based around
(0:06:45) Al: attacks that add energy to them so that then you can use the more powerful attack quicker.
(0:06:51) Kev: Hmm, okay
(0:06:54) Al: And they did just launch a ranked in pocket as well. So I will not be doing that but that does exist.
(0:06:59) Kev: Oh dang pocket pocket going all in all right no longer just the collector app good good for you pocket again
(0:07:10) Al: So yeah, yeah, there's always stuff and then obviously there's the shinies in the new the new set
(0:07:15) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:07:17) Al: Which are fun they are they added new missions that get you
(0:07:23) Al: You're able to unlock full decks as well. So you can say like oh I want the Tinkitung on
(0:07:28) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:07:29) Al: EX deck and you get all the cards from that which is cool
(0:07:32) Kev: Oh, that's nice.
(0:07:33) Al: Yeah
(0:07:34) Al: So yeah, yeah, they're adding stuff
(0:07:36) Al: I don't expect big changes every set because they've
(0:07:40) Al: basically released a set every month, which is fast.
(0:07:44) Kev: That's that's a lot. That is a lot. I'm exhausted just hearing that Wow
(0:07:49) Al: With with the trading, I am managing to keep up with the
(0:07:52) Al: standard cards, obviously not with the secret rares. But yeah,
(0:07:56) Kev: prayers and all that, yeah, yeah, sure.
(0:07:58) Al: but like with the standard, they call them diamond rarity. I'm
(0:08:03) Al: managing to keep up to date with that. So I'm missing two
(0:08:06) Al: from the last set and three from the previous set, but I'll get
(0:08:10) Al: to easily if actually put in the effort to look into trading.
(0:08:14) Kev: Okay
(0:08:15) Al: So that's not very many. So yeah, I'm just exclusively
(0:08:18) Kev: All right, that's not bad all right
(0:08:20) Al: opening the new set just now.
(0:08:23) Al: I think that's everything. I don't think I've been playing
(0:08:24) Al: anything. And this is why we're not talking about Mika this
(0:08:26) Al: week. We've had a week, but it's fine. Because we were given
(0:08:28) Kev: Yeah, it's it's been a week
(0:08:35) Al: quite the list of news to talk about. So we didn't even need to
(0:08:37) Kev: Yeah
(0:08:39) Al: have an alternate.
(0:08:41) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I like
(0:08:41) Al: So let's see how long this takes us.
(0:08:45) Kev: So I like how that happened cuz it was like
(0:08:48) Kev: Just two days ago something you reached out like hey, I haven't touched
(0:08:53) Kev: Oh, you might we just do news episode. I'm like, that's great. I have also not touched me good
(0:09:00) Al: I was like I really should play the game and then I was like it's Thursday. I'm not gonna be able to play this enough
(0:09:02) Kev: Yeah, but
(0:09:07) Kev: Yeah
(0:09:08) Al: And it's not that I don't want to play the game. It's just this week has been very busy and very tiring on so many levels
(0:09:16) Kev: a lot of levels, I agree, for different reasons for both of us, but somehow, um, law, very
(0:09:24) Al: It was Craig, my youngest, he's really into Astrobot just now and he's been, he's really
(0:09:29) Al: good at it but he can't do everything and so there's a few things he's been, like he's done
(0:09:34) Al: some of the really hard bosses but there's like some speed run levels that he's struggling with
(0:09:39) Al: and so he's been asking me to help him with those ones. But he's improved so much since he started,
(0:09:45) Al: like he's I think legitimately better than like most adults now, like he's actually really good,
(0:09:50) Kev: Oh, dang!
(0:09:51) Al: like he defeated the final boss.
(0:09:54) Al: Um, in the game, which is really good.
(0:09:54) Kev: Oh, dang!
(0:09:56) Kev: Way to go, kid!
(0:09:56) Al: Um, I need, the game is now a hundred percent.
(0:09:59) Al: He, as I say, he, I've done, I did some of that for him, but his save file
(0:10:03) Al: is at a hundred percent now, which is wild.
(0:10:07) Al: So yeah, but yeah.
(0:10:09) Al: So we were sitting down this afternoon after we'd spent the day in Edinburgh.
(0:10:13) Al: And he was like, Oh, Daddy, could you help me with this bit?
(0:10:16) Al: And I'm like, honestly, Craig, my brain can't deal with that just now.
(0:10:20) Al: Like, it's just there is too much to deal with in a platform.
(0:10:24) Al: platformer that I do not have the energy to focus on that.
(0:10:29) Al: So he was like, OK, that's fine.
(0:10:30) Al: I'll do something else then.
(0:10:32) Al: And it wasn't the problem.
(0:10:33) Al: But yeah, it's just like when your brain can't even do a 3D platformer,
(0:10:37) Al: you know that you've had a week.
(0:10:40) Kev: Yeah, absolutely
(0:10:43) Al: So let's see how this episode goes.
(0:10:45) Al: I hope you're excited for whatever this is.
(0:10:46) Kev: Yeah, oh
(0:10:49) Al: Let's talk about some feedback.
(0:10:51) Al: got another Spotify comment, uh, from our,
(0:10:53) Kev: Yeah, oh I'm so excited
(0:10:54) Al: only Spotify commenter, Jack, but thank you, Jack, for the comment, uh, Jack says,
(0:11:01) Al: excellent job on the Grimoire Groves. Um, I think I might try it sometime in the future.
(0:11:05) Al: Do you feel the next Coral Island update with children will be a good time to hop back in?
(0:11:10) Al: My answer to that is I think it depends. Like if you played the game at 1.0, um,
(0:11:16) Al: I think it will be a good time to jump back in. If you played 1.1, probably not. Like I think
(0:11:21) Al: Anybody who's played the game was
(0:11:24) Al: 1.0 or before should be probably not now. Until we knew that 1.2 was coming out in the summer,
(0:11:32) Al: I would have said just go for it now because 1.1 is such a good update for it. But obviously, if you're
(0:11:39) Al: happy with waiting another couple of months, it's definitely a good time to jump in. And if you're
(0:11:44) Al: not super interested in multiplayer, I don't think that other update gives you anything.
(0:11:50) Al: so yeah get the get the children go for it
(0:11:54) Al: get the children that was weird
(0:11:56) Kev: The children
(0:11:58) Kev: The children I'd you kids hide your wife
(0:11:59) Al: goodness me
(0:12:02) Kev: My my opinion is you should wait for the coral island update called fungi store
(0:12:08) Al: oh dear
(0:12:13) Al: um also has anyone on the team played bookbound on steam? I haven't heard of anyone saying it,
(0:12:19) Al: uh but uh good one to add add to the list it's a cozy game where you operate
(0:12:24) Al: a big store. I was curious about your thoughts if anyone has played it so I yeah interesting
(0:12:28) Kev: Yeah, same thing here.
(0:12:32) Al: maybe we need to get uh nami on for that episode it's a big store not a library but
(0:12:32) Kev: Oh, that would be fun.
(0:12:38) Al: they're basically the same thing right a big a big store is just capitalist version of a library
(0:12:40) Kev: Yeah, it'd be.
(0:12:45) Al: right libraries are socialism big stores are capitalism that's how you understand the difference
(0:12:46) Kev: It is, yes.
(0:12:50) Kev: There you go.
(0:12:54) Al: thank you for your comment jack and this is just a reminder that if you comment on spotify or you
(0:12:58) Al: send us feedback from our website we will probably mention you on the podcast because we don't get
(0:13:04) Al: enough to to get it too busy like I mean if we ever get popular then i'm not promising that we'll
(0:13:09) Kev: that's right
(0:13:09) Al: do that for everyone but when we get one every three months i'm gonna mention it on the podcast
(0:13:18) Al: uh kevin it's time for I know what you released last month
(0:13:22) Al: I've settled on that name.
(0:13:24) Kev: Did you decide?
(0:13:24) Al: We have quite the list of games that came out in March.
(0:13:28) Al: So we're starting off with Grimoire Groves.
(0:13:30) Al: Obviously, we've covered that.
(0:13:32) Al: That came out in March.
(0:13:34) Al: Desktop Cat Cafe came out in March.
(0:13:36) Al: That was the Cat Cafe Rusty-like.
(0:13:40) Al: I don't know anyone that's tried it yet, but...
(0:13:40) Kev: all right
(0:13:44) Kev: yeah I i don't either
(0:13:46) Al: Believe it or not, Sugardew Island came out in March.
(0:13:48) Kev: uh... i've heard the rumors that
(0:13:50) Al: I was going to say it feels like longer than that,
(0:13:54) Al: but that's because I played it in February, so that'll be why.
(0:13:58) Kev: hmm
(0:14:00) Al: Wonderstop came out, obviously.
(0:14:02) Kev: died
(0:14:02) Al: We had the fantastic episode about that last week.
(0:14:04) Al: Good job.
(0:14:04) Kev: go one, play it, go, go play it
(0:14:08) Al: Mudborne came out.
(0:14:08) Al: That's the Frog Apical.
(0:14:10) Kev: good name
(0:14:10) Al: Apical, but frogs.
(0:14:12) Kev: still great name, little bit
(0:14:14) Al: I know somebody who will be playing it.
(0:14:18) Al: I don't think they have started playing it,
(0:14:18) Kev: da, ah, ah, ah, ah
(0:14:20) Al: but I know someone who will be playing it.
(0:14:24) Kev: secrets
(0:14:26) Kev: it's not me
(0:14:26) Kev: Hope it's not me.
(0:14:28) Al: Maybe it is, nothing you know who it is anyway, but honeyman sir, early access released as
(0:14:29) Kev: It's news to me if it is.
(0:14:37) Al: well, as well as galactic getaway early access, apparently I backed that one on Kickstarter
(0:14:43) Al: because I got a key in an email yesterday, which was like, oh, I don't remember backing
(0:14:45) Kev: Hahaha, surprise!
(0:14:50) Al: this, but fair enough, I've got a game, it's a little present to me from two years ago.
(0:14:58) Al: Technically will be last month by the time this episode comes out, Space Sprouts came
(0:15:03) Al: out on the 31st of March. Thankfully they announced it before we recorded the episode
(0:15:08) Al: so we could include it. Busy month, biggest month of the year so far. Let's turn it down
(0:15:16) Al: a little bit because that's too many games. Thanks, please and thank you. Oh, a lot of
(0:15:18) Kev: No, Nintendo finally said no.
(0:15:26) Al: games. Let's see how that
(0:15:28) Al: continues. But that's what released last month. Are you
(0:15:32) Al: playing any of these other games that you that aren't
(0:15:36) Kev: uh if any of them probably be mud born because I like frogs it's a good name I don't know i'll
(0:15:44) Kev: see how it goes though but there it's not high on my priority list other ways
(0:15:48) Al: It's fair enough. Fair enough. Let's talk about the game news then. So yeah, we're going to start
(0:15:54) Al: with games that we know about that have announced something new. So first up, Distant Bloom. It's out
(0:16:03) Al: on PlayStation and Switch. So it was already out on Steam, but now it's out on PlayStation 4,
(0:16:04) Kev: There you go go
(0:16:09) Al: PlayStation 5 and Switch. So if you were wanting to play it, but you're waiting for it to be on
(0:16:10) Kev: There you go, I
(0:16:13) Kev: I I didn't even remember this game to be honest, but I looked up. It looks fine
(0:16:13) Al: console, there you go.
(0:16:21) Kev: I'd like yeah
(0:16:22) Al: This is the game where you are cleaning a planet, I think,
(0:16:28) Al: and you have to save plants.
(0:16:28) Kev: Yeah
(0:16:31) Kev: I do like that
(0:16:34) Kev: I think
(0:16:35) Kev: Yeah, I like that kind of terraforming or nature restoration
(0:16:40) Kev: Sort of premise more than just your standard farm generally speaking. I think so that is cute. I like
(0:16:48) Al: Well, this game came out almost exactly a year ago on Steam, 27th of March last year.
(0:16:54) Kev: Wow.
(0:16:55) Kev: Why?
(0:16:56) Kev: Well, it's not too bad if I turn around to get your ports out.
(0:16:58) Al: Yeah, yeah, not bad.
(0:17:01) Al: Next, we have Monster Patch.
(0:17:03) Al: The Kickstarter is live and we therefore have a lot more information about Sean
(0:17:08) Al: Young's upcoming Monster Collector game.
(0:17:11) Kev: Not just out of the things dang funded of course
(0:17:16) Al: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:17:17) Al: It's currently sitting--
(0:17:18) Al: so it's doing pretty good, doing pretty good.
(0:17:22) Kev: Yeah, that's correct Shocker
(0:17:27) Al: I have backed it.
(0:17:28) Al: Have you backed it, Kevin?
(0:17:29) Kev: Not yet
(0:17:30) Al: Are you going to?
(0:17:31) Al: Or are you going to wait till it's out?
(0:17:35) Kev: I don't know how to think about it. Maybe not bad. What do I get for backing? Yeah, I don't know
(0:17:39) Al: A future present. This is the thing. If you think you'll have more money in the future,
(0:17:44) Kev: The future present
(0:17:51) Al: don't back the game, right? Because why would you pay for a game now when you'll have more money in
(0:17:52) Kev: You know, you know.
(0:17:57) Al: the future? If you think "I won't have more money in the future" or "I have enough money to buy it
(0:18:03) Al: just now", back it because it's fun to get a free game later on. Yeah, there you go.
(0:18:10) Al: And you don't have to worry about it not being funded because you didn't support it,
(0:18:14) Al: because it's already funded. Assuming 90% of people don't pull out. Because you can,
(0:18:16) Kev: yeah fair I guess
(0:18:20) Kev: yeah that would yeah
(0:18:21) Al: but they won't. 2,000 people have backed it so far. Fair.
(0:18:24) Kev: i'll wait i'll wait to see because I need I want to see more
(0:18:29) Kev: about the game I guess like how is
(0:18:32) Al: Well there's another good reason to wait, as well as the Kickstarters only for a Steam key.
(0:18:39) Al: He's not promising it'll be on Switch, and it'll be later on. So if you want Switch,
(0:18:41) Kev: but yeah yeah probably and and there's
(0:18:45) Al: don't back it, because that'll just be a separate thing later on. Which I'm going to guess he will
(0:18:51) Al: do it, because Littlewood went to Switch, and you know, people like Switch.
(0:18:58) Kev: money when people like things
(0:18:59) Al: That too. That too. That too. What I find really fun about this is that he's doing the thing where
(0:19:09) Al: he's trying to create a save file, because he has both versions of it. So it's a fun little nod to
(0:19:12) Kev: Yeah.
(0:19:23) Al: how Pokemon games do that, but without actually the negatives of it.
(0:19:26) Kev: yeah bless you um that yeah that like it's kind of dumb to think about that it wasn't
(0:19:34) Al: Yeah.
(0:19:35) Kev: part like but I just never even considered that we had the technology we're here this is the future
(0:19:42) Al: Here's a secret for you. The actual, the Pokemon games are both versions as well. They just
(0:19:43) Kev: but um but that is a very cool thing to do um yeah yeah
(0:19:51) Al: have a config in them that says which version is and you can't change it. Because of course
(0:19:54) Kev: Yeah, I forgot about that. You're totally right.
(0:19:56) Kev: That's super true.
(0:20:01) Al: they are. Why would they actually make two different games? It's the same game.
(0:20:02) Kev: Yeah, you're super right.
(0:20:06) Kev: Good stuff. Good times.
(0:20:10) Kev: But yeah, very cool, though, that he does that.
(0:20:12) Kev: And you can trade with yourself.
(0:20:14) Kev: You can become that one penny arcade panel.
(0:20:18) Al: Yeah.
(0:20:18) Al: Yeah.
(0:20:23) Al: I don't actually know if it has trees.
(0:20:28) Kev: I read somewhere you could trade between your save files.
(0:20:31) Al: trade Mons and interact with your other save files through trading version
(0:20:36) Al: exclusive Mons items and turn decorations player will be players will
(0:20:39) Al: be able to 100% their save files in either version there will also be unique
(0:20:43) Al: game mechanics that utilize characters from different saves like battling your
(0:20:46) Al: character from past playthroughs and that's cool so it's try interact with
(0:20:51) Al: your other save files that yeah so that means you don't you can just do it on
(0:20:54) Al: one one device as well you don't even have to have two devices to save which
(0:20:56) Kev: Yeah, mhm
(0:20:58) Al: which is probably actually simpler than trading between
(0:21:02) Al: devices, right? Because he can just modify the saves on this one thing
(0:21:02) Kev: Yeah, oh it probably actually is
(0:21:10) Al: rather than dealing with that inter-device communication.
(0:21:12) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a very good point. Yeah, it's shocker. It's actually easier.
(0:21:14) Al: It's very clever.
(0:21:19) Al: It's quite cool. I like it. I'm looking forward to this. And I think I like the
(0:21:25) Al: monster designs. Almost said Pokemon. The monster designs.
(0:21:28) Kev: Hahaha, she's already getting in their crosshairs we go we care
(0:21:31) Al: Yeah, you play as Gary.
(0:21:37) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:40) Kev: You're playing as as Gary Powell, I believe his name is
(0:21:41) Al: The monster designs are fun and unique, but also feel distinct from other monster collecting games.
(0:21:54) Kev: Yeah, it's such, I say this as someone who's fooled around with trying to design fake mods like it's so difficult because the bar is so clear and and you know, it's set. So, you know, how do you stand out but there's there's some fun ones. There's definitely some fun ones in here.
(0:22:19) Kev: I like, I like little shark guy.
(0:22:22) Kev: That's a whooper though, that's still just a whooper.
(0:22:24) Kev: I'm sorry. (laughs)
(0:22:26) Al: shh. There's also collecting and crafting and magic, which is, is, oh, I like it. Some
(0:22:37) Al: people don't, but I like collecting and crafting in games.
(0:22:40) Kev: Yeah, let's let's see how it goes. The animations. It looks good because it'll very much. It's fascinating because he got the aesthetic of the, you know, the Game Boy color, Pokemon games, but the animation looks pretty dynamic and fluid and it's nice. You can move your house and stuff around.
(0:23:02) Al: Yes, yes, town building mechanics, like in Littlewood. I haven't seen anything as to
(0:23:08) Al: whether they have terraforming or not, because Littlewood did, but that feels a more complicated
(0:23:15) Al: thing to do in a game where you're like exploring and catching monsters and stuff like that.
(0:23:18) Kev: <v ->Yeah.</v>
(0:23:22) Al: So maybe it won't have terraforming, but there is at least some level of town customisation.
(0:23:27) Kev: yeah the four team battles that's a fun little thing that's different and then
(0:23:34) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm looking forward to this and trying very hard not to buy the physical
(0:23:36) Kev: you make carts
(0:23:43) Al: edition of both versions because I don't need it.
(0:23:47) Al: I don't need it.
(0:23:48) Kev: Is that, are you sure?
(0:23:50) Al: I don't need it.
(0:23:50) Kev: You don't need it, no, but it'd be nice.
(0:23:52) Al: I don't need it.
(0:23:53) Al: All right.
(0:23:55) Al: I'm sure we'll talk about this game much more in the future.
(0:23:58) Al: Next we have the most pointless piece of news ever, but I'm going to talk about it anyway.
(0:24:02) Al: outbound the campervan game have said that
(0:24:04) Al: we're going to have some news on the 10th of April.
(0:24:06) Al: That's it. We're done. Great.
(0:24:07) Kev: It's it's the teaser for two days before the trade the teaser trailer that movies do now
(0:24:12) Al: It's news about news, it's an announcement of an announcement.
(0:24:14) Kev: Yeah
(0:24:17) Kev: Yeah, I'm excited. Oh
(0:24:18) Al: And it's not even before the next episode.
(0:24:20) Al: We have to wait two episodes to talk about this.
(0:24:22) Al: What is this nonsense?
(0:24:27) Al: Anyway, will it be a release date?
(0:24:30) Al: That's my guess.
(0:24:31) Kev: Probably boy be you better be something good if it's not
(0:24:38) Al: Well, so I don't think it will actually be the release date,
(0:24:40) Al: because the alpha isn't even out yet, which is coming in April.
(0:24:42) Kev: Well, I bet I meant the release date for the alpha
(0:24:45) Al: That's so anticlimactic, if it's that. Like, I don't care. Go away.
(0:24:49) Al: Come back to me with a finished game. Come on.
(0:24:54) Al: We have some release dates from the Nintendo Switch Direct.
(0:24:59) Al: Fantasy Life I The Girl Who Steals Time is coming on the 21st of May.
(0:25:04) Kev: I'm so excited. My brothers excited fantasy lives. There's a lot going on here
(0:25:11) Kev: Like are you familiar with the original fantasy life at all?
(0:25:15) Kev: okay, um
(0:25:16) Kev: so the original conception for
(0:25:19) Kev: the original fantasy life was a
(0:25:22) Kev: single-player
(0:25:24) Kev: Non-violent MMO that was like literally the the pitch for it
(0:25:30) Kev: um and it uh they didn't go the non-violent thing in the end they ended the combat
(0:25:34) Kev: classes but uh but they did keep the single-player aspect it's a single-player
(0:25:41) Kev: MMO basically with different classes and you can switch between them and you do different
(0:25:45) Kev: things and yada yada it's very gr- and very grindy sort of game like MMOs um uh but uh
(0:25:54) Kev: very cute very charming by level five the professor late in the okai watch people
(0:25:59) Kev: they're very good at writing so uh very enjoyable game in my opinion um Calvin
(0:26:04) Kev: my brother plays a lot too um so you know we got a lot of mileage into that um and but they're
(0:26:09) Kev: really ramping it up here because we're going way past the the MMO skeleton um we we we got
(0:26:16) Al: Yeah, this is a life seminar, basically.
(0:26:18) Kev: basically because you you're now and there were some aspects of that you could decor your house
(0:26:22) Kev: but now we're terraforming we got the animal crossing terraforming in here which is wild to me
(0:26:28) Kev: um I don't even know how that's gonna fit in like i'm sure you can
(0:26:34) Kev: terraform the whole world it's probably just like maybe your home plot or something but uh
(0:26:39) Al: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, uh, what's it called? What was the game? Um, the Dragon
(0:26:47) Al: Quest was a Dragon Quest game builders. Yeah. They, you could terraform the whole world
(0:26:48) Kev: Builders yeah
(0:26:51) Al: there. Couldn't you possible.
(0:26:52) Kev: Yeah, you could oh man, that'd be wild if he could
(0:26:56) Kev: Maybe I it's possible either way fantasy life sick. I'm looking forward to it. It's coming real soon. May 21st
(0:27:04) Al: The Wandering Village is coming to Switch on the 17th of July, so that's cool.
(0:27:10) Al: I still haven't played this game.
(0:27:12) Kev: Yeah, me neither
(0:27:14) Kev: Will I now I don't know maybe
(0:27:18) Kev: Well idea you're playing on a big dinosaur
(0:27:21) Al: And Luz Lagoon have announced that their Switch release is coming in the summer of this year.
(0:27:28) Kev: to have alloy at home over the summer now
(0:27:34) Al: Yeah, so that's all of the news about games that we already know about.
(0:27:39) Al: So we're now going to talk about new games that we didn't know about,
(0:27:43) Al: and all of these were announced in the Nintendo Direct. So here we go.
(0:27:51) Kev: Let's do this!
(0:27:51) Al: Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar. This is a remake of Harvest Moon DS Grand Bazaar.
(0:28:02) Al: If you don't understand why a Harvest Moon game is now called Story of Seasons,
(0:28:06) Al: I don't have time to explain that to you just now. It is how it is, right? Harvest Moon is now Story
(0:28:08) Kev: that's that's that long and short of it yeah
(0:28:12) Al: of Seasons, and Harvest Moon is not Story of Seasons. It wouldn't be confusing if they just
(0:28:19) Al: renamed it.
(0:28:21) Al: The confusing thing is that Harvest Moon still exists, that's what's confusing about it.
(0:28:25) Kev: Yeah, yeah, and the worst part is it works, right? Like the other Harvest Moon series,
(0:28:34) Kev: it's still kicking. They're still pumping stuff out.
(0:28:38) Al: So, this is coming in August, the 27th of August, a little birthday present for me.
(0:28:46) Al: I'm excited because, I mean, this is one that I never played and the graphics, I think this
(0:28:53) Al: looks gorgeous.
(0:28:54) Al: It looks, it's kind of similar to "Story of Seasons - Pioneers of All the Times" graphics,
(0:28:58) Al: but it's definitely nicer, I think.
(0:29:01) Al: Yeah, I like the look of it.
(0:29:05) Al: I guess when you get close up to the characters, they look very much like.
(0:29:08) Al: I'm not a huge fan of how close up you get in those discussions, but when you're zoomed out and you're seeing the world and it looks really fun, I need to figure out what the deal is with the traveling in this game, because it looks like someone has a paraglider.
(0:29:28) Kev: it very much looks like the the Korok Lee from Wind Waker that you're flying around with.
(0:29:34) Al: Yeah.
(0:29:36) Kev: I don't know. There is you've got your cows so you know all the base is covered. We've got the
(0:29:38) Al: Looks like there's a good amount of character customization.
(0:29:46) Kev: bazaar thing itself is an interesting mechanic right the the Moneco night market style set your
(0:29:53) Kev: stuff and sell your wares.
(0:29:56) Al: Yeah, we'll see. I worry it'll feel like I'm not on...
(0:30:03) Al: Maneko, I quite enjoyed because of how fast paced and how limited it was.
(0:30:08) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:30:09) Al: And I think it worked really well.
(0:30:12) Al: I'm worried I wouldn't enjoy it in this one because it feels much more frequent and slower.
(0:30:16) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:30:20) Kev: That's very possible. I understand your concern.
(0:30:24) Al: Yeah, this is 100% just a paraglider. He jumps off a cliff and he's got the paraglider.
(0:30:31) Al: Fine, sounds great. Why have we not had that in other three seasons games?
(0:30:36) Kev: I mean, I don't think-- has there ever been a need?
(0:30:38) Al: What's this nonsense?
(0:30:42) Al: There's always a need. Trio of Towns did a fun thing where you could jump,
(0:30:46) Al: and you could jump up things. I really liked the movement in that game, and then they kind of just
(0:30:52) Kev: Hmm
(0:30:53) Al: just stop doing that as well.
(0:30:54) Kev: That's wild
(0:30:55) Al: Yeah, I would just like, I don't even care necessarily about it speeding things up.
(0:31:01) Al: I just find it fun to be running around and jumping at the same time.
(0:31:04) Kev: Yeah, you know that's very fair. That's very fair
(0:31:05) Al: But it's just fun to do that.
(0:31:09) Al: The blurb for this.
(0:31:11) Al: Searching for a peaceful farm life?
(0:31:13) Al: A fresh mountain breeze and your own market stall?
(0:31:16) Al: Look no further than the friendly community of Zephyr Town.
(0:31:18) Al: Here you'll grow crops and raise animals.
(0:31:20) Al: Get to know the locals and sell your wares at the town's bazaar
(0:31:25) Al: to its farmer glory.
(0:31:26) Al: Everything is always being restored to its farmer glory in these games.
(0:31:29) Kev: always always good girl yeah basically oh that's story of seasons like it's it's
(0:31:32) Al: Make Zephyr Town great again.
(0:31:42) Kev: you know it's it's the standard it's gonna be good like standard for a reason right like
(0:31:50) Al: OK, so it says use windmills to create new products to sell and effortlessly travel
(0:31:57) Al: across the town on your glider.
(0:31:59) Al: I have a question. Do they not understand
(0:32:01) Al: how windmills work and they are implying that the windmills are creating the wind
(0:32:05) Al: for you to travel with? I don't know.
(0:32:08) Al: That's what it sounds like to me.
(0:32:09) Kev: Maybe, you know, that's how it works now.
(0:32:11) Al: It feels like it's a cause and effect
(0:32:14) Al: sentence, but that doesn't make any sense, right?
(0:32:16) Al: that use the wind for both of those things but not the wind.
(0:32:20) Al: I mean, Tree of Towns was a 3DS game and this was a DS game, so I guess maybe it sounds
(0:32:28) Kev: Probably from what you describe. I'm gonna guess yes
(0:32:34) Kev: Yeah
(0:32:35) Al: like they were continuing that from this to Tree of Towns.
(0:32:37) Kev: That's what I'm thinking
(0:32:40) Al: Well, I'm going to buy it, right?
(0:32:44) Al: I'm not going to pretend.
(0:32:47) Al: The question is, will I buy the...
(0:32:56) Kev: The Deluxe Mega Collector's Rare Edition.
(0:33:06) Al: platforms, which retailer, Amazon Boo, is the only retailer, 65 pounds.
(0:33:14) Kev: That doesn't sound that bad.
(0:33:15) Al: The standard is 45 pounds, so it's 20 pounds difference for the limited edition.
(0:33:22) Al: The limited edition doesn't mention what it actually does.
(0:33:25) Kev: I was about to ask but wait was that included is in cow does it include a cow plush at all because that's
(0:33:31) Kev: That's the real money maker
(0:33:32) Al: I had this in a link, and I now no longer have it in the link, and I'm really annoyed
(0:33:36) Al: about that. Here we go. I've got it now. Fantastic. Fantastic. The limited edition copy includes
(0:33:46) Al: The Game, a plush Suffolk sheep, so not a cow, but a Suffolk sheep, a poster, a physical
(0:33:54) Kev: No, that's alright.
(0:33:57) Al: art book with over 115 pages of cosy art. Why is the art cosy? I don't know.
(0:34:02) Kev: That's a lot of art. That's a pretty decent sized art book.
(0:34:02) Al: And an original soundtrack CD. The digital deluxe version includes the trunk of transformation
(0:34:07) Kev: Not bad overall.
(0:34:14) Al: DLC, and the super deluxe digital edition includes a digital art book and soundtrack
(0:34:19) Al: app in addition to the items from the deluxe version. And that is the same cost as the
(0:34:25) Al: physical limited edition. Will the physical limited edition not come with the DLC? That
(0:34:31) Al: That feels weird.
(0:34:32) Kev: that'd be wild nope you don't know nothing
(0:34:33) Al: We don't know anything about that DLC.
(0:34:38) Al: Well, I guess we'll find out in time.
(0:34:41) Kev: yeah all right the plush questions answer that's all I needed though i'm probably not gonna get
(0:34:47) Kev: it right it's like oh yeah or I mean the physical whatever edition will I get the game so yeah maybe
(0:34:48) Al: Fair, fair, fair, fair, maybe, maybe.
(0:34:55) Kev: I do enjoy story of seasons
(0:34:58) Al: Next we have Witchbrooke.
(0:35:01) Al: Discover magic and mystery in Witchbrooke, a spellbinding witch life sim
(0:35:04) Al: for up to four players.
(0:35:06) Al: Start your life as the newest resident of witch in the bustling seaside
(0:35:11) Al: city of Mossport.
(0:35:12) Al: Make friends, find love and discover a world filled with wonder and charm on
(0:35:16) Al: the road to graduation and beyond.
(0:35:19) Al: Look, you can, it's a 2D witch game where you can write a broom.
(0:35:22) Al: That's, do I need to tell you anymore?
(0:35:22) Kev: I was about to say finally Cozy Games and Witchcraft at long last!
(0:35:29) Al: I don't really care about the witchcraft part of it.
(0:35:31) Al: What I care about is the broom.
(0:35:33) Al: I've, if I can write a broom in your game, I'm probably going to buy it.
(0:35:36) Al: I want to be able to fly.
(0:35:39) Al: Just let me fly.
(0:35:40) Kev: yeah that's a pretty good one um I like the graphics they're going for a
(0:35:47) Kev: 2d isometric like pixel gba ds era graphic style I like it um uh well I play it I don't know
(0:35:58) Kev: because I got a slot but but it looks well done very true very
(0:36:01) Al: Will I buy it? Probably. Will I play it?
(0:36:03) Al: We'll see. Those are two different questions.
(0:36:10) Kev: true um
(0:36:12) Al: um yeah no I i I i i'm I think it's I think it looks great and is getting a lot of buzz online
(0:36:17) Kev: yeah no it looks it has all your your staples and all the all the good stuff you want your marriage
(0:36:24) Kev: and your your relationships and crafting and things
(0:36:30) Al: Apparently, this game was first announced seven years ago, and then they've never said anything about it ever again.
(0:36:36) Kev: That's wild I didn't know that that's wild
(0:36:40) Al: Someone in the YouTube comments says, "7 years of radio silence for it
(0:36:44) Al: finally to surface on a Nintendo Direct."
(0:36:48) Kev: and is a silk song of an earlier generation. Yeah, Jack.
(0:36:54) Al: Yeah, I really like, I really like the graphics.
(0:36:59) Al: Tomodachi Life, not Tamagotchi Life, Tomodachi Life.
(0:37:03) Kev: That's that's another one
(0:37:08) Al: I googled, I started googling Tamagotchi Plaza, which is the the other game we're about.
(0:37:14) Kev: Yeah, and you discovered a whole list of new episodes, let's talk about that vape sometime.
(0:37:16) Al: Hey Google, shut up.
(0:37:20) Al: And I, yeah, one of them was Tamagotchi life.
(0:37:24) Al: Someone just doesn't know how to spell Tamagotchi, right?
(0:37:27) Al: They heard it and thought it was Tamagotchi life, or just confusing the games.
(0:37:33) Al: Anyway.
(0:37:34) Al: Tamagotchi life.
(0:37:35) Al: No.
(0:37:36) Al: Yes, that's what we're talking about just now.
(0:37:37) Al: Tamagotchi life.
(0:37:38) Al: I got confused myself, because I wasn't sure which one we were talking about.
(0:37:42) Al: After over 10 years, Tamagotchi life is back and coming to Nintendo Switch.
(0:37:46) Al: So this is like me, Animal Crossing, right?
(0:37:50) Kev: of sorts gets a bit more wild than that it's more like somewhere between Animal
(0:37:58) Kev: Crossing and the Sims I would say that's it's closer to the sims I think even
(0:38:04) Kev: because you don't actually control a character you're just watching the the
(0:38:10) Kev: drama that ensues when you put all your friends and me's and oh you not play
(0:38:12) Al: Oh, you're not actually controlling any of these characters.
(0:38:17) Kev: Like Tomodachi?
(0:38:18) Al: I have not, no, no.
(0:38:18) Kev: Life or familiar?
(0:38:20) Kev: Okay, yes, no, no you are not controlling the characters or okay to be fair. I'm not played myself
(0:38:24) Al: Not directly controlling them.
(0:38:26) Kev: Yeah, not directly controlling them
(0:38:26) Al: You mean like in the Sims, you like can tell them what.
(0:38:30) Kev: Okay, yes, um I to be fair
(0:38:32) Kev: I'm not played myself, but I've watched my sister and Sami familiar with the the thing and it's more or less
(0:38:37) Kev: Yes, just you have a whole bunch of me's you're letting them into
(0:38:41) Kev: You letting them loose into the house and watching all the hijinks that ensues as they do things as they if all in love
(0:38:50) Kev: Become friends throw
(0:38:53) Kev: Sports balls at each other. I don't know
(0:38:56) Kev: It's a zany game and this one's turning up the zany up to 11. We got we got giant people
(0:39:03) Al: Yes, that was very funny at the end. It's just like the person running towards the camera and
(0:39:08) Al: then they just get bigger and bigger and bigger. You're like "oh my word, what's happening here?"
(0:39:09) Kev: Bigger, yeah
(0:39:14) Al: I legitimately thought this was just like Animal Crossing. I'm now watching a gameplay video
(0:39:17) Kev: No, no, no
(0:39:20) Al: of Tamadachi Life from the 3DS and I have no idea what's happening.
(0:39:23) Kev: Yeah, that's that sounds correct. I don't think you you're even if you were
(0:39:28) Al: Is any of this gameplay or is this just like a film? Are we just watching a really weird
(0:39:33) Kev: a little bit maybe a little bit, but it's
(0:39:33) Al: film? Is this like The Sims Cross with WarioWare? Because it feels like some of it's like minigames.
(0:39:40) Kev: Maybe a little bit
(0:39:44) Kev: And it's a little bit some stuff will pop up you never know in the Tomodachi, huh?
(0:39:48) Al: What is happening in this game? A pretzel appeared. What will Big Bad Pig do? What is this?
(0:39:56) Al: I'm so confused. Yes, now I need to buy this game.
(0:39:59) Kev: Well, aren't you curious that's
(0:40:03) Al: Anyway, it's coming next year. This is like an actual Nintendo game though, right? This isn't
(0:40:03) Kev: See you got to know what happens with the pretzel
(0:40:09) Kev: You
(0:40:11) Al: like third party. Nintendo make this. It's coming in 2026. People are excited. I'm confused.
(0:40:11) Kev: Yeah, it is
(0:40:14) Kev: Stage on smash
(0:40:25) Al: I clearly completely misunderstood what this game was and I am so confused. Okay, look.
(0:40:33) Al: We'll talk about it I'm sure. Why are these characters throwing items at each other?
(0:40:35) Kev: ha ha ha ha oh i'm excited oh why why not they might be playing games they might be if you
(0:40:44) Kev: think it's unsure you have to play the game to get your answers it's the only way to know could be a
(0:40:50) Kev: talent competition possibilities are endless yeah toma means friend I think in japanese i've heard
(0:40:52) Al: Tomodachi means "friends" and Dachi is plural, so it's "friends".
(0:41:02) Kev: yeah okay that's fruit so yeah
(0:41:06) Kev: put you all your oh man you know what this means we can put all the I other ths hosts
(0:41:13) Kev: into one tamodachi life house and watch the drama that will unfold
(0:41:18) Al: Oh so you like actually get your "me's" from other people.
(0:41:21) Kev: you can yeah or yeah or I i mean I don't know how
(0:41:22) Al: Oh my word.
(0:41:24) Al: "The game follows the day-to-day interactions of "me" characters," referred to as the Islanders.
(0:41:29) Al: "They build relationships, solve problems, and interact with the player."
(0:41:32) Kev: The possibilities are endless.
(0:41:34) Al: Oh goodness sake, I hate that I have to buy this game now.
(0:41:39) Al: It looks like it's very tied into StreetPass, so how are they going to replace that?
(0:41:44) Kev: I don't know. That is the big question because obviously, I guess so. I guess so because obviously,
(0:41:46) Al: Just internet connection.
(0:41:48) Al: And I guess, like, you can connect and share your Miis that way.
(0:41:54) Kev: yeah, the 3DS was a lot more suited for me stuff and that sort of connectivity. I don't know how
(0:42:02) Kev: they're gonna handle it, but we gotta stay tuned. Just wait. We'll find out. Somebody will do the
(0:42:10) Kev: the day again by which I may meet somebody who'll play.
(0:42:14) Al: All right last but not least in the games we have Tamagotchi Plaza not to be confused with
(0:42:20) Al: Tamagotchi Life. The fact that they announced both these games on in the same direct is just so mean.
(0:42:20) Kev: Yeah, no, it's great, it's what I want.
(0:42:32) Al: Although I feel like we knew about Tamagotchi Plaza and see I'm doing it again Tamagotchi Plaza.
(0:42:34) Kev: Probably, maybe, I don't know.
(0:42:38) Al: I think we knew that this game existed I feel like but not a lot about it.
(0:42:44) Al: Let me check. Oh no maybe not no the internet does seem to think it was this was the first
(0:42:49) Al: announcement of it. It's another shop simulator game but with Tamagotchi characters.
(0:42:57) Kev: Yeah, that's all I need.
(0:43:00) Kev: I've never had a Tamagotchi in my life.
(0:43:04) Kev: There's some dope ones out there.
(0:43:07) Kev: The Digimon crossover ones are good.
(0:43:07) Al: I yeah yeah I love I love Tamagotchis as well not actually using them but I
(0:43:13) Al: like I used to use them as a child but now I just collect some um I have a Pac-Man one
(0:43:19) Al: and I have a Gugitama one um
(0:43:20) Kev: Ooh, where's this updated shadow labyrinth?
(0:43:26) Al: um but I don't I don't think I want to play another shop game
(0:43:30) Al: do you have to do the shop but I think so it seems like it's pretty core
(0:43:32) Kev: You do you must
(0:43:37) Al: in June 27th of June for the first time in the series an offline two-player mode is now available
(0:43:39) Kev: Be excited
(0:43:43) Kev: No, why did it know there were other times in the series, okay? Oh
(0:43:43) Al: collaborate or compete with other
(0:43:49) Al: yes it's the newest in the Tamagotchi corner shop series
(0:43:53) Kev: Okay shows me what I know how much apparently
(0:43:58) Al: over a hundred Tamagotchi in total.
(0:44:00) Kev: I
(0:44:03) Kev: Okay, good. I didn't I didn't even consider the number would be an issue, but all right. I just thought it was just like
(0:44:08) Al: Well it's not, because there's a hundred of them, it's not an issue. Yeah I don't think
(0:44:13) Al: I'm gonna play this game but I'm excited for those who are excited by it. Oh you can be
(0:44:13) Kev: I'm not I
(0:44:16) Kev: Mean I I heard Mike gets cheers of joy in the distance is watching the direct. So, you know, oh
(0:44:23) Al: a dentist. You can run an afternoon tea shop. Okay so this is when they say shop simulator,
(0:44:25) Kev: Hold a hold the phone now or talk
(0:44:31) Kev: Oh, that's cute.
(0:44:34) Kev: I thought...
(0:44:35) Al: This is just a bunch of minigames.
(0:44:37) Kev: Okay, yeah, yeah, you're...
(0:44:38) Al: You're not actually have to get the stuff and stock the shop.
(0:44:41) Al: You just go and like run the shop.
(0:44:41) Kev: It's not Grand...
(0:44:43) Kev: It's not...
(0:44:44) Kev: It's not Tamagotchi Grand Bazaar.
(0:44:46) Kev: You can...
(0:44:46) Al: Well, now I'm interested.
(0:44:47) Kev: Live your dreams.
(0:44:49) Al: Make the tone vibrant and full of life.
(0:44:51) Kev: Restore it to its former glory!
(0:44:54) Kev: Now we're talking!
(0:44:58) Al: Probably still not going to play it, but.
(0:45:00) Kev: I probably will not either.
(0:45:01) Al: More more interested in it now than I.
(0:45:03) Kev: Unless they get those crossovers like the Godzilla and the Digimians.
(0:45:06) Al: Look, look.
(0:45:08) Al: Luke, Luke, Luke. If Gudetama's in it, then yes. I will play it.
(0:45:11) Kev: Nah, see, that's what I'm talking about.
(0:45:15) Al: We need our Sanrio characters. Oh wait, that's just...
(0:45:16) Kev: Dope.
(0:45:17) Kev: Yeah.
(0:45:20) Kev: Panda to our brand.
(0:45:21) Al: That's just Hello Kitty Island adventure then.
(0:45:27) Al: Oh goodness, we're nearly there. We're nearly done with the news
(0:45:31) Al: and the episode, but we have one more thing to talk about.
(0:45:35) Al: Kevin. Nexus Mods.
(0:45:38) Al: A website for mods for games.
(0:45:42) Kev: They are unleashing the dogs of war.
(0:45:44) Al: They have and they've finally announced their open source cross-platform Nexus Mods app,
(0:45:51) Al: which includes support for Stardew Valley. Now this is exciting because this is a very easy way
(0:45:59) Al: to add mods to games compared to how you previously had to add mods to games. It is
(0:46:06) Al: is an app that shows you
(0:46:08) Al: what games you can add mods to, and it allows you to search for mods and add them with
(0:46:12) Al: the click of a button, which is excellent. Do you know what's even more excellent about
(0:46:15) Kev: Yeah, what is tell me
(0:46:16) Al: it? It has support for Linux, including the Steam Deck, which has been even harder to
(0:46:21) Kev: Oh
(0:46:23) Al: do mods on because they didn't really have any apps to help with the process before now.
(0:46:28) Kev: Oh, that is exciting.
(0:46:30) Al: So there you go. That's exciting. So it has support for Stardew Valley as of now, which
(0:46:38) Al: listeners of this podcast will be interested in that. They're also working on support for
(0:46:43) Al: Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, and Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord. I've never heard of that game.
(0:46:50) Kev: Okay, I don't know what those are
(0:46:52) Kev: Where's the harvest season host as the start of NPC mod? Where's that mod?
(0:46:58) Al: Well, someone just needs to make the mod then. Nexus mods don't actually make the mods, they're
(0:47:03) Al: just the marketplace for the mods. Easy and reliable mod installation.
(0:47:05) Kev: I know, I'm just saying, someone out there, it's gotta happen.
(0:47:10) Al: Collections easily turn them on and off, allowing you to experiment with using mods in conjunction
(0:47:14) Al: with collections so you can configure perfect setup. So that's cool. So you could say, "Oh,
(0:47:19) Al: I want to play the game with these five mods," and then you're like, "Oh, I want to play with
(0:47:23) Al: these different 3 models.
(0:47:25) Kev: That is pretty handy dandy so you know as someone who's never even been much of a PC gamer to begin with like obviously mods have never been my thing but it sounds like they can be a handful and this sounds quite nice.
(0:47:39) Al: Yep, yep, it's cool. I like it. Obviously they have to do it game by game, right like
(0:47:47) Al: Because games are complicated and unique right so you can't just go oh any mod will work on any game
(0:47:54) Al: That's not how that works
(0:47:54) Kev: What I don't see why not it's literally ctrl C ctrl V into the folder. That's all it is
(0:48:05) Al: So obviously it'll take time for other games to be supported, but hey the most important
(0:48:09) Al: one is up there, Stardew Valley.
(0:48:11) Kev: go good stuff playing your steam deck yeah I'll can play his favorite take out
(0:48:18) Al: It's very cool. I think it's cool. I'm excited.
(0:48:21) Kev: the love and don't pet your animal mod
(0:48:27) Al: Oh, dear. I don't know what to say.
(0:48:31) Al: All right. Well, I'm tired. That was a lot of news.
(0:48:35) Al: I think we're pretty much done.
(0:48:36) Al: Is there anything you want to you want to mention about all of the news
(0:48:40) Al: that we had or anything else?
(0:48:43) Kev: Are you excited for next week when we have to do it again when all these things are not sure switch to order something when Stardew Valley 2 is announced for the switch to know.
(0:48:54) Al: Look, I don't know how many games we'll get, and I don't know if we'll get any that are
(0:48:57) Al: related to the podcast, but I am excited to finally get some information about the Switch
(0:49:01) Al: 2. All I really want is I want a release date, I want a price, I want a date for when I can
(0:49:08) Al: pre-order, and then I want a couple games. I think if we don't get those things it will
(0:49:10) Kev: Those are safe beds probably.
(0:49:15) Al: be very disappointing. And if we get those things I'll be pretty happy.
(0:49:20) Kev: what if you don't get them but then it's released on the nintendo direct app or whatever that thing's called
(0:49:26) Al: Well...
(0:49:27) Kev: download your app
(0:49:30) Kev: do it
(0:49:34) Kev: we're done here folks
(0:49:37) Al: Kevin, where can people find you on the Internet?

(0:51:04) Kev: not children, but
(0:51:04) Al: No, it's worse when they're not children, right, because then they eat more food.
(0:51:06) Kev: it's

(0:52:14) Kev: I had something clever, but I forgot it so goodbye everyone yeah
(0:52:16) Al: Well, so here's something, right? Mario Kart, we're going to get Mario Kart, obviously.
(0:52:22) Kev: Yeah
(0:52:23) Al: But I also want the new 3D Mario announced as well. That's what I really want.
(0:52:26) Kev: You okay now you're crazy
(0:52:29) Al: Well, there's going to be something, and that's the something. That's what would make it from a good...
(0:52:34) Al: Right, they give me the date, the price, the pre-order date on Mario Kart. That's a good direct.
(0:52:40) Al: That's like bare minute, that's good. They give me a 3D Mario, that's great.
(0:52:41) Kev: okay yeah you know you're gonna get mark are you
(0:52:46) Kev: it's not gonna happen crazy you get splatoon
(0:52:46) Al: I want. Well, something's going to happen sometime. Why not now? Why not now? It's been years.
(0:52:51) Kev: get excited for splatoon because splatoon first
(0:52:55) Al: Look, I just want more Bowser's Fury. That's what I want. I want more Bowser's Fury.
(0:52:59) Kev: now you were extra extra crazy no i'm playing it actually no i'm not
(0:53:00) Al: Give me more Bowser's Fury. Bowser's Fury, best Mario game.
(0:53:08) Al: You have not played Bowser's Fury? What? And you host a Mario podcast. Let me tell you, Mario.
(0:53:11) Kev: hey the records clearly show I didn't play a lot of mario
(0:53:17) Al: Bowser's Fury is so good. I love it so much. I don't even care about open world, right?
(0:53:28) Al: Like, I think if it was open area, like Odyssey is, that's fine. I don't particularly care about
(0:53:35) Al: it being open world. But the fluidity of Bowser's Fury, the fun of like Giga Bowser and the Giga
(0:53:45) Al: a bell and becoming Giga Mario.
(0:53:46) Al: It's just so much fun, it's just a really cohesive, small world, but everything about
(0:53:55) Al: it feels really nice and I'm still fascinated by the existence of that game. It's not big
(0:54:03) Al: enough for them to feel like they can sell it on its own, but they've never expanded
(0:54:06) Kev: Well, I mean, I can, I can tell you what my theory is, like, from the evidence I've seen over the years, it was a, someone was toying around with the idea of a Sunshine sequel, no, no, no joke, actually a Sunshine sequel, because there's stuff, there are a lot of Sunshine heavy stuff in those files.
(0:54:07) Al: on it. It's been multiple years, we must be close to something.
(0:54:30) Kev: Um, and I don't think it went full fruition, so they kind of scraped it together.
(0:54:36) Kev: It, maybe, like, I don't think explicitly, like, I don't think we're gonna see, I don't think they designed it with anything in mind for the future, like, we might see in the future, like, oh, this came from Bowser's Fury, sure, but I don't think that, um,
(0:54:40) Al: You don't think it's an experiment for future games?
(0:55:00) Al: It's been four years now, that's wild. Is that why I like it so much? Because it's Sunshine 2.
(0:55:06) Kev: very possibly, yes. It's great. I will gladly agree with this sentiment.
(0:55:08) Al: Sunshine's fantastic. Sunshine, most underrated Mario game.
(0:55:17) Al: Like Mario 64 and Galaxy and Odyssey, they get their props. People love them
(0:55:22) Al: and they're constantly lauded as being great. Sunshine, I think, is better than all of them.
(0:55:24) Kev: Yeah.
(0:55:29) Kev: I mean, I will actually agree. Well, yeah, probably.
(0:55:31) Al: I mean, it's definitely better than Mario 64. I get what Mario 64 does and I get why people love it.
(0:55:38) Al: It's mostly nostalgia now, right? Like what it did for the future of platformers in general,
(0:55:43) Al: or 3D platformers in general, it obviously is important and we need to celebrate it for that.
(0:55:50) Al: As a game, it is not fun to play.
(0:55:53) Kev: I know you're being crazy, you know
(0:55:56) Al: Mario Galaxy gives me motion sickness.
(0:55:59) Kev: That's very fair
(0:56:00) Al: I don't get me wrong, I like it, and Galaxy 2, they are fun to play, but I cannot play
(0:56:07) Al: them for long because I get motion sick. I hate it.
(0:56:10) Kev: I love how you can die in the home base in Galaxy.
(0:56:13) Al: Isn't it wild that Galaxy is the one 3D Mario game that got a sequel? That's weird. Unless
(0:56:15) Kev: I just jump wrong.
(0:56:24) Kev: Yeah, yeah, well they just
(0:56:25) Al: you count Bowser's Furious, but I don't think it counts as a full sequel, because you don't
(0:56:28) Kev: No, you can't
(0:56:30) Al: get it, right? Odyssey, good game, Cappy is a fun gimmick, but I just think Sunshine's
(0:56:31) Kev: Yeah
(0:56:32) Kev: Yeah, no, like yeah. No, you don't have blood exactly Oh flood
(0:56:45) Al: better. There, I'm gonna say it.
(0:56:47) Kev: Oh, whoa, heighten words.
(0:56:49) Al: When you consider how quickly, when you consider how soon after Mario 64 Sunshine came out,
(0:56:55) Al: when you consider how close they came out together, that is an incredible jump in...
(0:56:56) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:56:57) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:56:58) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:56:59) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:57:00) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:57:00) Al: in playability, in graphics, in literally everything. It is, it doesn't, like, let me
(0:57:01) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:57:07) Al: double check the dates, but like, it is absolutely insane to me how quickly those came out.
(0:57:13) Kev: Yeah, you tell them I'm not gonna stop you
(0:57:14) Al: So, Mario 64 was 96, and Sunshine was 2002, so that is six years between those games.
(0:57:19) Kev: Yep
(0:57:23) Kev: Yep
(0:57:23) Al: Those games feel a decade or longer apart, to me. It's absolutely wild to me that they
(0:57:27) Kev: That is correct
