# Transcript

(0:00:30) Kev: Hello farmers and welcome to another episode of the harvest season. My name is Kevin and with me today is Kevin
(0:00:38) Kev: But in Spanish
(0:00:40) Kev: No, come on. Come me us. Yes. Yeah
(0:00:44) Kev: Hello everyone, it is a solo Kevin episode again. I'm just one of those
(0:00:50) Kev: weeks slash weekends where a
(0:00:54) Kev: bunch of schedules played a little bit of hot potato and well
(0:00:58) Kev: in case of emergency.
(0:01:00) Kev: break out the solo kevin episode.
(0:01:30) Kev: he was right on in.
(0:01:32) Kev: well actually before that
(0:01:34) Kev: stuff i've been up to
(0:01:36) Kev: nothing terribly interesting
(0:01:38) Kev: busy work week
(0:01:40) Kev: allergies are bad out here
(0:01:42) Kev: the pollen has been bad
(0:01:44) Kev: but we got ray
(0:01:46) Kev: and i'm thankful for that
(0:01:48) Kev: but in terms of fun stuff
(0:01:52) Kev: playing some marvel rivals
(0:01:54) Kev: the new season is coming out in a couple of days
(0:01:56) Kev: we're getting emma frost
(0:01:58) Kev: to hold X-Men Hellfire Galath.
(0:02:00) Kev: I'm going to go back to the last themed season.
(0:02:02) Kev: That'll be fun.
(0:02:04) Kev: And yeah, I'm just racing, scrambling to get the final missions to get the last costumes and unlocks from the current season pass or whatever.
(0:02:13) Kev: But so that's been fun. Nothing terribly new, but still a very solid game.
(0:02:20) Kev: Let's see, Marvel Snap also in my rotation.
(0:02:24) Kev: Fun game. A new season just started.
(0:02:28) Kev: the cards good
(0:02:30) Kev: Actually, I haven't bought the season new season fast. I can't talk about Captain Carter
(0:02:34) Kev: It's a what-if themed season for people who are familiar with the Marvel Disney Plus series. What if?
(0:02:44) Kev: And so I haven't played with Captain Carter, but the the other card injuries thus far Goliath he's been pretty good
(0:02:50) Kev: But yeah
(0:02:51) Kev: One interesting thing about Marvel snap is that I see a lot more bots right now
(0:02:57) Kev: and it's not just because of a new season although that's also common.
(0:03:01) Kev: It just really feels like the player base has kind of tapered off a bit.
(0:03:08) Kev: Which works in my favorites and easier on the ranked ladder.
(0:03:13) Kev: But that's just interesting.
(0:03:16) Kev: I get it. It's a game that demands a lot of your time because it's just constantly pumping out new things every single week.
(0:03:24) Kev: So it's just a treadmill and it can be exhausting a lot to keep up with.
(0:03:30) Kev: But here I am. I kept up with it. I still like it.
(0:03:34) Kev: So yeah, that's good stuff. Marvel Snap.
(0:03:39) Kev: Other than that, nothing terribly interesting. I picked up some Minecraft because sometimes I just get niche for the Minecraft movies.
(0:03:48) Kev: Is it related to the movie news? Maybe. It's the subconscious, the name thing, I guess.
(0:03:54) Kev: I don't know, but I don't know. I just like firing it up starting a farm and little, you know, settlement.
(0:04:00) Kev: That's always fun.
(0:04:03) Kev: But yeah, that's what I've been up to, more or less. Nothing terribly interesting.
(0:04:09) Kev: Oh, and Mario Odyssey, like Kingdom, that's working on Rainbow Road radio stuff.
(0:04:16) Kev: Let's keep an eye out for that. It's a good game and I like water levels, Waterworld, so yay.
(0:04:23) Kev: Okay, yeah, but that about sums it up.
(0:04:25) Kev: So now let's actually dive into Cottage Core game news.
(0:04:30) Kev: Oh, I don't know if you guys heard me, that was my cat, my teddy, he's chilling out back there.
(0:04:35) Kev: He probably wants some food. I'll feed you in a little, buddy.
(0:04:40) Kev: But after the news, let's see here.
(0:04:44) Kev: First up, oh, we're starting with the showstopper, I see.
(0:04:49) Kev: "Rusty's retirement cross vampire survivors."
(0:04:55) Kev: You've gotta love an April Fools joke that, oh wait, no, this is real, actually.
(0:05:01) Kev: Because it's so wild and ridiculous, I adore that sort of April Fools joke/news drop.
(0:05:08) Kev: That's how we got Yakuza like a dragon, if I recall correctly.
(0:05:14) Kev: But yeah, April 1st, they announced a crossover.
(0:05:18) Kev: Specifically, vampire survivors coming into Rusty's retirement, which is hilarious, really.
(0:05:24) Kev: So vampire survivors is the "bullet heaven" game where you're just...
(0:05:30) Kev: power up and power up, and just shooting waves and waves of enemies and whatnot, horror/vampire/Castlevania
(0:05:39) Kev: themed, and they've done a handful of crossovers, including with actual Castlevania, so no surprise
(0:05:46) Kev: from vampire survivors, they've done very well.
(0:05:50) Kev: But somehow, the guys over there at, what is it, Ponkle, I believe the studio is called?
(0:05:57) Kev: They heard of Rusty, and they reached out to...
(0:06:01) Kev: Rusty's retirement, and we have a new skin pack/map, what would call you, of Rusty's retirement, where the
(0:06:13) Kev: titular character...
(0:06:15) Kev: What was their name? Po. Oh, there we go. Po, what if they retired? And so now they're just farming up a storm.
(0:06:22) Kev: And
(0:06:25) Kev: Yeah, it's it's fun. They introduced a new mechanic
(0:06:29) Kev: Where you grow
(0:06:31) Kev: To keep away bats from stealing your crops, which is fun, right?
(0:06:35) Kev: It's still a relaxed, you know laid-back game, but now you just have this new little flavor
(0:06:46) Kev: uh... elements so I i like that that's very cute
(0:06:49) Kev: uh... overall like that the graphics look great
(0:06:53) Kev: uh...
(0:06:55) Kev: uh...
(0:06:56) Kev: the trailer itself is is pretty
(0:06:59) Kev: pretty great uh...
(0:07:03) Kev: yeah the the skins look great and and
(0:07:05) Kev: you know what this one is tempting me to to download it because this is such a
(0:07:10) Kev: fun crossover
(0:07:11) Kev: uh... well I guess we do it I don't know
(0:07:14) Kev: uh...
(0:07:16) Kev: yeah good
(0:07:17) Kev: good on you both vampire survivors and rusty's retirement
(0:07:21) Kev: people

(0:07:42) Kev: uh... and uh... there are more
(0:07:44) Kev: Crossovers to come, which is exciting.
(0:07:47) Kev: Will it I have no idea with the you know, these kind of indie games you never know
(0:07:52) Kev: Will be other indie game. So we get
(0:07:56) Kev: retirement
(0:07:57) Kev: Necro dancer mid proper. Yeah, that's what is right. Yeah, the Nick grow dancer Nick grow retirement, whatever you want to call it
(0:08:05) Kev: Possibly we get shovel knight retired. Maybe
(0:08:10) Kev: Will we get David actually David ever feels very likely?
(0:08:15) Kev: You know very
(0:08:16) Kev: Exciting who knows it feels like anything is possible with this so
(0:08:20) Kev: Definitely keeping my eyes
(0:08:23) Kev: Peeled my you know looking up for more
(0:08:26) Kev: News on these crossovers today all sound very fun
(0:08:32) Kev: Okay, so yeah, let's see here next up we have
(0:08:37) Kev: monster patch
(0:08:39) Kev: So yeah last time we talked to it. I mean it was already funded with we talked about it
(0:08:45) Kev: But
(0:08:46) Kev: They have passed the 150,000 USD mark and we they have revealed the Nintendo switch stretch goal
(0:08:57) Kev: And so let's see here that is exciting we they reached a goal for a museum
(0:09:04) Kev: That the structure you can unlock and you can donate the monsters
(0:09:09) Kev: and read interesting facts
(0:09:12) Kev: That is pretty cool
(0:09:16) Kev: They'll probably be a special collection that's interesting right because you always have the Pokedex in these monster claking games
(0:09:22) Kev: But an actual museum dedicated to that that's fun
(0:09:27) Kev: Let's see here
(0:09:29) Kev: But yes, Nintendo switch was at two hundred thousand dollars
(0:09:35) Kev: Let's see where they are currently they're at 182. They already passed the battle tower
(0:09:40) Kev: Stretch goal, so yeah that switch support is very likely
(0:09:46) Kev: Yeah, so
(0:09:48) Kev: Probably keep an eye out. We'll have a something's release. I don't know
(0:09:54) Kev: But I'm if it's I'm definitely getting if it's going to switch so keep an eye out I
(0:10:00) Kev: certainly am I mean we'll hear about it because this thing's just
(0:10:04) Kev: Blasting through these stretch goals and and you know the way kickstarters work
(0:10:08) Kev: The the the biggest pushes are at the start and at the end so whenever this thing
(0:10:13) Kev: Which is the end which is in two weeks, roughly
(0:10:16) Kev: I will get another big blast, so I wonder how far we'll actually go
(0:10:22) Kev: Yeah, so good on you monster pets and senior Sean young. I believe it is doing good. Yeah, that's the guy's name all right
(0:10:30) Kev: Let's see here next up
(0:10:32) Kev: Room Factory Guardians of Azuma the new room factory game with dance the power of dance
(0:10:39) Kev: It's it's just a new flavor room factory
(0:10:42) Kev: They have announced that they are moving the release date from
(0:10:46) Kev: May 30th to June 5th. Why? Well because there's a Switch 2 coming out on June 5th, and that makes a lot of sense.
(0:10:53) Kev: That's only a week and a week, you know, as I'm playing this release of the two versions, or multiple versions.
(0:10:59) Kev: The Switch 2 version with the other ones. So yeah, only a week difference. I don't think anyone's going to mind to play on their Switch 2 if you're getting it.
(0:11:08) Kev: Okay, let's see here. Next up...
(0:11:16) Kev: Reverse of Delay. It's an out now, I guess I would call it. Artisan Story.
(0:11:24) Kev: So for this game, I don't know if we've talked about it, but you play as an artisan blacksmith type character.
(0:11:34) Kev: It's that sort of 2D HD octopath look. A lot of minigames for crafting different weapons and tools.
(0:11:43) Kev: Um... I was... some...
(0:11:46) Kev: emphasis on combat it looks like to make use of all the blades and weapons you're
(0:11:51) Kev: making with different combat styles which actually looks pretty fun. I quite
(0:11:55) Kev: like the look of this game. It's got a pixel look that's a little simplified
(0:12:03) Kev: maybe but against the 2D HD thing where they're out in a 3D space and it looks
(0:12:09) Kev: like some of the weapon styles could be even fun maybe a little different from
(0:12:12) Kev: your standard cottagecore fare, so that'll be cool.
(0:12:17) Kev: There's plenty of characters and what not to talk to.
(0:12:19) Kev: Is there romance? I don't know.
(0:12:21) Kev: Maybe.
(0:12:23) Kev: We'll see.
(0:12:25) Kev: Anyways, the primary news story is that Early Access is out now.
(0:12:32) Kev: They are aiming to be in Early Access for a year.
(0:12:40) Kev: There's a whole post on Steam.
(0:12:43) Kev: I'll just read the quick little blurb about explaining why it's Early Access.
(0:12:47) Kev: We're bringing this vision to life with your help.
(0:12:51) Kev: By launching Early Access, we aim to refine gameplay mechanics,
(0:12:55) Kev: expand crafting possibilities, and ensure that every aspect of the world
(0:12:59) Kev: from farming to monster taming feels truly rewarding.
(0:13:02) Kev: Your feedback will shape the future of the game,
(0:13:04) Kev: helping us create the best artisan experience possible.
(0:13:07) Kev: If you have the idea of crafting farming
(0:13:09) Kev: and raising dungeon monsters, join us on this journey.
(0:13:11) Kev: Be the first to experience new features.
(0:13:13) Kev: Share your thoughts and help us build something truly special.
(0:13:17) Kev: So yeah, it is currently just out on Steam.
(0:13:20) Kev: It is $20.
(0:13:22) Kev: There is a free demo you can download.
(0:13:24) Kev: But Early Access is $20.
(0:13:26) Kev: They mentioned the price could change,
(0:13:28) Kev: especially when the full release comes and whatnot.
(0:13:33) Kev: They list the whole slew of features currently available in Early Access.
(0:13:42) Kev: Early Access makes a lot of sense for a lot of people.
(0:13:45) Kev: or, you know, the--
(0:13:46) Kev: developers, I've-- oh, I forgot to mention, yeah, the monster taming thing. That's an interesting aspect.
(0:13:53) Kev: It looks a little passive, like you take care of your monsters, and they generate materials for you, kind of like
(0:14:00) Kev: Moonstone Island, similar to that game, but fun touch nonetheless.
(0:14:06) Kev: Am I getting the early access, infinously? No, I'm not an early access guy, but
(0:14:13) Kev: It's a good it is out. That is a good first step, right?
(0:14:16) Kev: So hopefully we'll see if we'll release within a year like they're aiming to and
(0:14:21) Kev: Yeah, check it out. If you are interested that is artisan story. Oh, oh one more important note
(0:14:27) Kev: The blank story naming scheme is yeah. I'm that that's it. I'm drawing another line in the sand
(0:14:33) Kev: There's a lot of lines around me, but come on. Come on. Let's put a little more effort into the title at least a
(0:14:41) Kev: Subtitle something give give throw me a bone people we can do better than this
(0:14:47) Kev: The game looks pretty good
(0:14:51) Kev: Okay
(0:14:54) Kev: Speaking of things that look pretty good and this one
(0:14:57) Kev: Yeah, it's story of seasons. Let's talk about Grand Bazaar
(0:15:01) Kev: We got the switch to version confirmed during the direct. It'll be $10 more on switch to
(0:15:09) Kev: We they let's see RPG site net. I was able to get a like preview copy and then post all
(0:15:16) Kev: Thing about it
(0:15:19) Kev: It looks it has you know, this standard
(0:15:25) Kev: Story of seasons fair, you know all your villagers the romance the farming all the good the animals all the good stuff
(0:15:34) Kev: It does have some of the earth would say more modern innovations from the series like you can grow plants in all seasons
(0:15:42) Kev: Some specifically from pioneers of all of town
(0:15:47) Kev: Raise buffalo beekeeping mushrooms and flowers
(0:15:51) Kev: And perhaps the most interesting bit is that there is no shipping bin in this game
(0:15:58) Kev: Only the weekly bazaar similar to mannequins night market
(0:16:04) Kev: Yeah, that is an interesting mechanic is just fun as mannequins I don't know but
(0:16:10) Kev: That's interesting because you don't have your daily, you know shipping bin revenue. You gotta wait every week
(0:16:17) Kev: But yeah, I mean overall it's a story of seasons game, right? So
(0:16:21) Kev: You know the the the
(0:16:24) Kev: Title the pedigree is there and I'm sure it will be a quality game nonetheless
(0:16:29) Kev: So, yeah, that's uh, that's good stuff
(0:16:35) Kev: Let's see here
(0:16:44) Kev: I don't know, oh I apologize, no I was just looking, there is uh, Fogoo.com also had um,
(0:16:52) Kev: thoughts on the game, but you will post the link um, uh, on all sorts, you know, the kind
(0:16:58) Kev: of comp of the trailer and had everything.
(0:17:01) Kev: Um, but uh, but yeah, there's also some interviews with the director talking about the game for
(0:17:08) Kev: the, again this is a remake um, of Grand Bazaar.
(0:17:12) Kev: So it looks pretty good.
(0:17:14) Kev: Overall, though, like all the stuff they're integrating, all the new things.
(0:17:18) Kev: OK.
(0:17:21) Kev: Let's see here.
(0:17:24) Kev: Next up, we have-- oh gosh, I still don't know how to say this.
(0:17:29) Kev: Opidum?
(0:17:29) Kev: Opidum?
(0:17:31) Kev: Opidum, perhaps, even.
(0:17:34) Kev: This is the three-- we've talked about it before.
(0:17:39) Kev: It's a 3D-- I'm just going to say it looks like Breath of the Wild.
(0:17:44) Kev: Oh, Minecraft-- more Minecraft-y Breath of the Wild, because you're out there building settlements
(0:17:52) Kev: and whatnot.
(0:17:53) Kev: Looks combat-heavy.
(0:17:54) Kev: The character-- the player character kind of looks like Link, at least the one they're
(0:17:59) Kev: using.
(0:18:00) Kev: I don't know if it's customizable or not.
(0:18:03) Kev: But yeah, that-- they have-- excuse me.
(0:18:10) Kev: They are release-- release date.
(0:18:12) Kev: That's the big news.
(0:18:14) Kev: But that is very close.
(0:18:15) Kev: That's what-- at the time you guys are listening, about two weeks, I would say, ish?
(0:18:22) Kev: Yeah.
(0:18:23) Kev: Oh, there it is, character creation.
(0:18:25) Kev: Yep.
(0:18:26) Kev: OK.
(0:18:27) Kev: You don't have to be faux-link.
(0:18:28) Kev: You can be your own thing.
(0:18:29) Kev: Yeah.
(0:18:30) Kev: They announced this release date.
(0:18:33) Kev: They got a trailer.
(0:18:35) Kev: It is co-op.
(0:18:36) Kev: You can have up to three friends playing with you.
(0:18:39) Kev: Adaptive storytelling.
(0:18:40) Kev: That's an interesting buzzword or cue.
(0:18:44) Kev: I think if I were to guess, that's just like Breath of the Wild, where you can do stories if you want to, you know, do certain temples and learn certain stories.
(0:18:53) Kev: Or you can just ignore it.
(0:18:55) Kev: But regardless, you can experience yourself April 23rd.
(0:19:01) Kev: That is coming very soon. I think I was just on Steam for now.
(0:19:06) Kev: But yeah, look forward to that.
(0:19:10) Kev: Um, okay, here's...
(0:19:14) Kev: Uh, this is an interesting one because it's...
(0:19:19) Kev: A...
(0:19:22) Kev: E-A, um...
(0:19:26) Kev: Okay, well, let's get into it.
(0:19:27) Kev: So, Chronomon was going to launch full, you know, full 1.0,
(0:19:32) Kev: but they have pivoted to making it to an early access launch.
(0:19:36) Kev: Um, this will be on May 8th, 2025, just about a month away.
(0:19:41) Kev: Um...
(0:19:44) Kev: It is interesting because they do go into the details why they decided to move this.
(0:19:48) Kev: Um, they're pivoting to because they want to show their commitment to working on it more.
(0:20:02) Kev: And, of course, as usual, they'll take feedback and refine things and whatnot.
(0:20:12) Kev: They are planning, again, for about a year for early access.
(0:20:26) Kev: And, uh, the- the one nice, uh...
(0:20:36) Kev: the full main campaign is fully playable you're right because they they were more
(0:20:46) Kev: or less playing a full release so they they're pretty much the full campaign
(0:20:49) Kev: there so that that is nice I will say that right having early access game
(0:20:52) Kev: with an actual finish point that's good and of course a lot of the features of
(0:21:00) Kev: this is again this is chronomond it's a 2d pixel mod
(0:21:06) Kev: taming and farming all the bells and whistles of both of those genres it's
(0:21:14) Kev: pretty cute I like the the dungeon design some of them are a little more
(0:21:18) Kev: urban your modern looking than just a cave which I think is a little
(0:21:22) Kev: refreshing they have a deep suite of RPG elements and customizations for your
(0:21:28) Kev: monsters and skills and everything battles are in the overworld which is a
(0:21:32) Kev: This is a nice little touch, not a separate Pokemon screen.
(0:21:36) Kev: It does look robust, I will say, for an early access.
(0:21:40) Kev: Again, that is May 8th when it's coming out, and yeah, hopefully within a year they'll have a full 1.0.
(0:21:49) Kev: I'll definitely be interested in seeing what that looks like.
(0:21:53) Kev: Okay, let's see here, next up we have a game that is also an early access.
(0:22:05) Kev: honey man through the
(0:22:06) Kev: bear witch game
(0:22:08) Kev: they have a big update
(0:22:10) Kev: announcing mac support
(0:22:12) Kev: which is great
(0:22:14) Kev: I know a lot of mac people
(0:22:16) Kev: I never used a mac I'm not one of them
(0:22:18) Kev: but hey now you guys can enjoy the
(0:22:26) Kev: But yeah, that's that's a big one. But of course that comes the whole slew of
(0:22:30) Kev: Additions changes balances, etc. You can check out the link for all that but
(0:22:37) Kev: That is good. And that is out. I believe yes
(0:22:41) Kev: Then only a week after early access good on them
(0:22:47) Kev: Let's see here. Oh
(0:22:50) Kev: Goodness. I can't believe almost skip to the story tales of the shire. Um, so they released
(0:22:56) Kev: a a very in-depth a
(0:23:02) Kev: Very in-depth
(0:23:05) Kev: Game or look at the game
(0:23:08) Kev: How long is this thing? Um
(0:23:10) Kev: Ten minutes long which is fairly decent
(0:23:13) Kev: Um, it's it's not just looking at the game or but talking to the devs and the and whatnot or how their
(0:23:20) Kev: inspiration I like him about whatnot
(0:23:22) Kev: And I'll be honest. I think this is a
(0:23:26) Kev: very good trailer. It's probably got me the most excited about the game out of anything I've seen.
(0:23:34) Kev: I think they put a lot of emphasis on how they keep going back, not just to the source material,
(0:23:44) Kev: but actually looking at Tokien's inspirations, how he wrote The Hobbit, the Middle-earth and what.
(0:23:56) Kev: A lot of the trailer discusses the "conflict" because in so many games you need some sort of
(0:24:07) Kev: conflict or issue to resolve. And so they go back to one of the main themes from All Middle-earth,
(0:24:15) Kev: which is Tokien's issues with urbanization and modernization. As I mentioned, he bemoaned the
(0:24:24) Kev: urbanization of his
(0:24:26) Kev: childhood home and what not
(0:24:28) Kev: trees and forests he was so fond of becoming modern and urbanized
(0:24:34) Kev: and so we were seeing that reflected in this game with certain characters pushing for more modernization
(0:24:40) Kev: and other characters standing against it trying to maintain the shire as it is
(0:24:48) Kev: and so yeah they go into a lot of detail over that
(0:24:54) Kev: uh... it's it's it's fast
(0:24:56) Kev: how much they researched on the right they reached out to actual artisans and
(0:25:00) Kev: blacksmiths how would things look like and and again not just the the actual
(0:25:06) Kev: middle you know middle earthworks but the these stories are inspirations
(0:25:14) Kev: behind them I think that's a that shows a lot of dedication and yeah the the
(0:25:20) Kev: actual gameplay in the this trailer looks pretty good I think I think
(0:25:26) Kev: it kind of shows off its identity finally because that was I think
(0:25:30) Kev: something that was kind of lacking right like was this gonna be some sort of you
(0:25:34) Kev: know weird Lord of the Rings skin on Animal Crossing and whatnot right and I
(0:25:40) Kev: mean to be sure right like they're still aiming for the cozy very clearly and
(0:25:44) Kev: explicitly there's the farming and the the fishing and and and crafting and
(0:25:49) Kev: all those standard hallmarks you know interacting with the town but you can
(0:25:54) Kev: You
(0:25:56) Kev: Can Really See how it's all coming together here all right like they mentioned the the sense of community is important not just as a gameplay mechanic
(0:26:03) Kev: But like thematically for the the the Shire the the the setting they're trying to create here
(0:26:11) Kev: So yeah, you're gonna have relationships with
(0:26:15) Kev: Not so romantic relationships, but it's just like you know friendships and and relationships with characters
(0:26:22) Kev: Well, you know, all dead-named characters and whatnot.
(0:26:26) Kev: Who influenced the story, um, so yeah, it looks pretty good.
(0:26:30) Kev: I'm, uh, I'm actually pretty interested in this now.
(0:26:34) Kev: Um, I really suggest you guys check out the, uh, the link and take a look at the
(0:26:40) Kev: video, um, because it is, uh, I think it looks quite, this video is quite nice.
(0:26:47) Kev: Um, yeah, so that is again, tales of the Shire.
(0:26:50) Kev: Um, I don't think we still have a, um, excuse me,
(0:26:56) Kev: a date or anything for it.
(0:26:58) Kev: Um, oh, oh, I'm wrong.
(0:26:59) Kev: July 29th, uh, release date.
(0:27:02) Kev: Um, so the couple of months, uh, all right.
(0:27:06) Kev: Uh, looking forward to it.
(0:27:07) Kev: Um, that sounds pretty specific.
(0:27:10) Kev: So I, and from the, where the video, the game looks like in the videos, I believe
(0:27:16) Kev: that date, um, so yeah, let's keep an eye out for, uh, tales of the Shire.
(0:27:22) Kev: Good stuff.
(0:27:24) Kev: Um
(0:27:26) Kev: and lastly but certainly not leastly we have Maneko's night market out in the
(0:27:32) Kev: news again let us not forget that it was that last year's game of the year or is
(0:27:38) Kev: that the year before I know the year but yes the year before 2023 yes harvest
(0:27:44) Kev: season's game of the year 2023 no one can stop me they've released the soundtrack
(0:27:54) Kev: It's 20 bucks.
(0:27:56) Kev: It's on Steam, I think it's on Spotify in other locations as well.
(0:28:00) Kev: Um, that is, I don't know if we harped on that to cover the game.
(0:28:04) Kev: But the game has a banger soundtrack.
(0:28:08) Kev: Um, it goes the whole gamut of emotions.
(0:28:12) Kev: You have very, like, relaxed, nature-y music.
(0:28:16) Kev: You have very joyous, happy music.
(0:28:20) Kev: A lot more melancholy or reflectful tunes.
(0:28:26) Kev: A lot of, you know, bits and pieces of kind of Japanese-style music kind of influence and whatnot,
(0:28:34) Kev: given the setting of the game and whatnot, kind of.
(0:28:38) Kev: It fits.
(0:28:40) Kev: Um, so yeah, I cannot recommend enough that you check out the soundtrack, right?
(0:28:46) Kev: That's one thing about me, I'm a big soundtrack guy, like, maybe not by the soundtracks,
(0:28:50) Kev: but I'll look up soundtracks online and listen to them and whatnot.
(0:28:54) Kev: Because games, quality games have a good time.
(0:28:56) Kev: I love good music, y'know? And so, another game I can put into that library rotation, I'm always down for that.
(0:29:02) Kev: Um, so yeah, go out there, buy it, support Mineko's Night Market, Harvest Season 2023, Game of the Year, because it's a good one.
(0:29:10) Kev: _laughs_ I've gotta go back and finish it.
(0:29:14) Kev: Um, and, y'know, maybe I will. Maybe that's... I've been itching for something, and I feel like that could be it!
(0:29:20) Kev: That could be it!
(0:29:22) Kev: Um...
(0:29:24) Kev: Ugh, okay.
(0:29:26) Kev: Um, but, uh, but yeah, that's, uh, that's kind of it.
(0:29:31) Kev: That's the news.
(0:29:32) Kev: Um, let me be covered a little fast since it's just me, but, uh, but it was
(0:29:36) Kev: still a beefy gamut of stories there.
(0:29:40) Kev: Um, I'm, I've got to say, like, just looking down this list, it's a
(0:29:45) Kev: healthy diversity of games, right?
(0:29:47) Kev: Like, yeah, you know, we've been us being at this for so long, right?
(0:29:53) Kev: We've seen trends come
(0:29:56) Kev: and go and what not right so many stardew clones and so on and whatnot but
