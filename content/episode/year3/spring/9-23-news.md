(0:02:48) Kev: Good stuff
(0:02:51) Kev: Okay, so with that that said Cody Cody, what have you been have you gotten married in the last week?
(0:02:57) Codey: I unfortunately have not. My ring finger remains empty. But that is something that might happen
(0:03:08) Codey: this year. But we're not like we're just gonna go do it. Like, so it's not. Yeah, well, yeah.
(0:03:15) Kev: Ah, shotgun wedding?
(0:03:19) Codey: So it's, I don't know, it's one of those like, we feel like it, but we just haven't done
(0:03:27) Codey: the place yet. And I don't know if he's I think he might be waiting to like, do a special proposal
(0:03:28) Kev: Yeah, there you go.
(0:03:32) Codey: or whatever, which is a little silly, because we kind of already know it's gonna happen. But at the
(0:03:37) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:03:38) Codey: same time, like, I'm not gonna say no to being hampered for a moment or something. So, but no,
(0:03:45) Codey: so not getting hitched, not getting engaged, none of that I have just been dissertationing and
(0:03:50) Codey: dog sitting. So and chickens, chickens are the dog sitting. Yeah.
(0:03:52) Kev: And chickens, apparently, you use these.
(0:03:57) Codey: So dissertation, I am trying to defend this upcoming fall. So within the next like,
(0:04:06) Codey: within the next six months, it's horrifying. And so I have a lot to get done. And I finally
(0:04:13) Codey: got money to hire people. So I have people that are helping me now. And so they I'm like, in the
(0:04:22) Codey: lab a lot because I'm getting them to help me. I have people only through
(0:04:27) Codey: July so with the in August I'm back to being by myself so these next few
(0:04:30) Kev: Oh, oh you gotta squeeze out what you can. Yeah, oh you gotta move on.
(0:04:33) Codey: months yeah these next few months are like as much as possible um so I
(0:04:40) Codey: haven't been dog sitting actually that much because I've been kind of switching
(0:04:43) Codey: into like being on campus but I am dog sitting at this present moment my
(0:04:47) Codey: advisor goes on a couple different summer vacations and I always like watch
(0:04:53) Codey: his dogs and stay at his house and he also has chickens.
(0:04:54) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:04:57) Codey: the chickens come in he has I think four hens and then he bought seven baby chicks
(0:05:06) Kev: okay
(0:05:08) Codey: like right before he left one of them did not make it so far but I mean that's they kind of just do
(0:05:09) Kev: Yeah
(0:05:12) Kev: No
(0:05:15) Codey: that it's not uncommon for that to happen so about all the other ones are doing great so I had to
(0:05:16) Kev: Yeah
(0:05:19) Kev: Yeah
(0:05:23) Codey: Just kind of check on them and refill their water.
(0:05:24) Kev: Can't great good stuff
(0:05:26) Kev: It's it's always surprises me how like affordable and easy it is to get into chickens if you have the space for it
(0:05:32) Codey: He was like, it was so funny because we were texting about it. And he was like, he was
(0:05:39) Codey: doing the whole like, back in my day, they used to be like a dollar each. And now they're
(0:05:44) Codey: $4, I guess. When you buy them, and he was like, it's just so like, why is it selling?
(0:05:45) Kev: Haha, yeah.
(0:05:50) Codey: They used to be so much less expensive. And I was like, yeah, 100%. Um, but it's fun.
(0:05:52) Kev: Well, general gestures at the world, I guess.
(0:06:00) Codey: So that I've also been doing
(0:06:02) Codey: actual gardening at my house.
(0:06:04) Kev: No, what's growing?
(0:06:04) Codey: So I have a bunch of peppers coming up,
(0:06:08) Codey: some romaine, some kale, some tomatoes, and then I planted.
(0:06:13) Codey: So all of those that I just mentioned
(0:06:15) Codey: were like starts already.
(0:06:17) Codey: So they were already like a little seedling.
(0:06:20) Codey: They already have stuff going on.
(0:06:20) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:06:23) Codey: But I had these zucchini seeds that weren't ready,
(0:06:28) Codey: like weren't started.
(0:06:30) Kev: I know.
(0:06:30) Codey: And so I put those, and they were,
(0:06:32) Codey: actually, a little old. So I was like, I don't know if this is gonna work. So I put the seeds in the ground, and low and behold, they are a bump in. So I actually need to thin those. Yeah, they actually, I actually need to thin those. And then in game news, I beat Breath of the Wild. And I started Tears in the Kingdom, and I did not get very far. I fell to the, to the ground, and then
(0:06:42) Kev: life sprung forth.
(0:06:52) Kev: Yo, congrats, okay.
(0:07:03) Codey: immediately tried to make a wagon out of, because it's like, there's like parts all over the world. And there's like, clearly, what are wagon parts. And I got almost all the way, and then I messed something up. And I like tried to shake it off. And it just broke the whole thing.
(0:07:09) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:07:18) Kev: Oh, ha ha ha ha! Yeah! Yeah!
(0:07:21) Codey: I haven't really gotten back into that.
(0:07:25) Kev: Oh, too disheartening.
(0:07:26) Kev: Uh, um, okay, well, alright, there's a lot here, so let's back up one sec.
(0:07:32) Kev: Okay, birth of the wild, what are your overall thoughts?
(0:07:36) Codey: I really liked it. I think the story was don't don't look too hard at it, you know, like
(0:07:41) Kev: Yeah, that's correct
(0:07:43) Codey: It's pretty see-through, but it was a solid game. I had a lot of fun
(0:07:46) Codey: I still have so much that I could do if I wanted to 100% it but I
(0:07:51) Codey: Do not want to do that. So I'm not gonna do
(0:07:53) Kev: Yeah, understandable.
(0:07:56) Kev: Yeah.
(0:07:57) Codey: Maybe it's something I'd go back to later, but I just have I'm in this like
(0:08:02) Codey: Purge mode where I'm like, I need to get through things. So I'm like purging my book
(0:08:06) Codey: shelf. Like, I've been going through books that are on my bookshelf instead of buying
(0:08:06) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:08:11) Codey: books this year and getting rid of a lot of that. I've been just going through like boxes
(0:08:11) Kev: Mm-hmm. That's good
(0:08:18) Codey: that I've had for forever and I just need to get rid of them. So yeah.
(0:08:20) Kev: Yeah
(0:08:22) Kev: Yeah, okay
(0:08:25) Kev: Understandable, okay, uh tears of the king. All right, you know what?
(0:08:28) Kev: I think it's probably for the best you take a breather because tears the I mean
(0:08:32) Codey: Yeah.
(0:08:33) Kev: There's a lot new and like it's sequel worthy
(0:08:37) Kev: But it's still you know, the the breath of the wild skeleton is there, right? So
(0:08:38) Codey: Yeah.
(0:08:40) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:08:42) Kev: That's a lot of breath of the wild at once and here's the kingdom just like the predecessor is beefy
(0:08:47) Kev: So, you know what, it's probably for the best you take.
(0:08:48) Codey: I think that's the thing is like I started playing Tears of the Kingdom and I was like
(0:08:56) Codey: I can see how this is going to be the same but also I'm not emotionally ready for these
(0:09:01) Codey: changes like there was so much that like powers are different and I'm just struggling and
(0:09:02) Kev: Yep. Oh, yeah. Yep.
(0:09:09) Codey: so I yeah I needed to take a step back but yeah we.
(0:09:11) Kev: Understandable, but it'll be there when you're ready. It's good. It's a thumbs up as well.
(0:09:18) Codey: Yeah we've been doing a lot of stuff around the house and I've been trying to get rid
(0:09:19) Kev: But yeah, I'd take a breather because it.
(0:09:27) Codey: of a bunch of my specimens. I have like bugs that are that I caught like on my own that
(0:09:32) Codey: I don't actually they're not part of anything that I just wanted to go through and I'm so
(0:09:38) Codey: I'm finally starting to go through some of those so that my partner and we can have my
(0:09:45) Codey: My partner and my roommate can have a freezer again.
(0:09:48) Kev: Hmm
(0:09:48) Codey: Everyone wants to be with the weird bugs early until they realize it means no freezer space because your freezer is all bugs.
(0:09:56) Kev: that's good good stuff
(0:09:58) Codey: So yeah. What have you been up to though? How's the pup?
(0:10:04) Kev: oh the pup the pup is is he's got healthy six seven months old he's I mean he's full size
(0:10:11) Kev: he's gonna be a little guy forever he's toy variety of poodle but he still is energetic
(0:10:12) Codey: Yeah.
(0:10:16) Kev: and chaotic as always um still very much puppy um yeah um but uh but he's yeah he's a lot of fun
(0:10:25) Kev: and still a lot of work, a lot of energy.
(0:10:26) Kev: but it's good.
(0:10:29) Kev: Let's see, other thing, non-puppy things.
(0:10:32) Kev: So, I got Kyle and his late birthday gift to Switch 2 on just Friday.
(0:10:40) Kev: That was a wild ride because, so the week, Switch 2 is a week out now, basically.
(0:10:48) Kev: And I heard people, you know, I didn't hear any horror stories of PS5, like, oh, it's not available anywhere.
(0:10:54) Kev: I heard everyone was getting it fine and so on.
(0:10:56) Kev: And then later in the week I heard, "Oh, this is now the fastest selling console of all time ever."
(0:11:06) Kev: And then when Friday came and I got my paycheck, I was like, "Okay, so where do I get my Switch 2 for Calvin?"
(0:11:12) Kev: And, "Oh, oh, it is now sold out everywhere. Oh, and so I'm sweating here."
(0:11:18) Kev: And then I reached out to someone who's never done me wrong.
(0:11:24) Kev: me wrong, someone all reliable.
(0:11:26) Kev: you know I heard it was going in and out at stock in some places so I called
(0:11:29) Codey: - Ah, yeah.
(0:11:35) Kev: my local Costco and sure enough they got him so I was like well you going to
(0:11:40) Kev: Costco and so I picked up you know my like switch to and four dozen eggs and
(0:11:46) Kev: lemonade you know as one does at the Costco
(0:11:48) Codey: Yeah, Costco. Costco also one of the only corporations that did not back off of their queer and diversity stuff when the new administration came in so great, great business to support.
(0:12:00) Kev: Yup, yup, yup, Costco generally one of the better ones, not as horribly monstrous as
(0:12:11) Kev: other corporations, um, you know, there's still corporation or whatever, but generally
(0:12:17) Kev: I hear good things, um, but anyway, so yeah, so Costco's great, their food court's still
(0:12:22) Kev: great, um, that I got to switch to at Costco, it came in a bundle, I, I, I drew to Costco,
(0:12:28) Kev: There was a discount.
(0:12:29) Kev: You get a...
(0:12:30) Kev: You get the Switch 2.
(0:12:31) Kev: You get the Mario Kart World and a year of the Nintendo Online, the expansion, the better
(0:12:37) Codey: live or whatever oh
(0:12:40) Kev: one.
(0:12:41) Kev: I forget the final price, but it is at a discount, all the stuff all together.
(0:12:46) Kev: So that was nice.
(0:12:51) Kev: And yeah, so we fired it up, Calvin played a lot of Mario Kart World with Calvin, I see
(0:12:56) Kev: for myself, um, it, Mario Kart world is, you know,
(0:13:00) Kev: interesting. Like now, now I can understand the process on the stuff Al said.
(0:13:05) Kev: So like the Grand Prix is the biggest change because, um, you know,
(0:13:09) Kev: in, in all the other Mario karts, it's okay. Here's your four courses.
(0:13:12) Kev: You run three laps in them or whatever, right? That, that's just how it is.
(0:13:16) Kev: Okay. Now here, it's not so much like you're driving to,
(0:13:21) Kev: I mean, you are kind of driving to the next track technically,
(0:13:23) Kev: but really that's just part of the Grand Prix. Like instead of three laps,
(0:13:28) Kev: There's three sections and the first section is...
(0:13:30) Kev: Okay, drive to, you know, the next track or first or part of it or whatever, so
(0:13:36) Kev: It's less lab continuous laps around a single track and more just going across this entire island in bits and chunks
(0:13:45) Kev: So yeah, that is different
(0:13:49) Kev: Overall it's solid. It's Mario Kart. What can I say?
(0:13:52) Kev: But but yeah, it did
(0:13:55) Kev: One thing I will say that the huge cast and roster is actually it's pretty awesome
(0:14:01) Kev: just
(0:14:02) Kev: Yeah, like cow cow is great actually
(0:14:06) Kev: Yeah, and just other random weirdos and losers like the fishbone or pianza
(0:14:11) Kev: And even the the main roster that you know the named characters they they have their costumes and a lot of those costumes
(0:14:18) Kev: They're pretty good. I won't lie
(0:14:22) Kev: You get Luigi dressing up like a like a was they called the gondolas in Venice and like one of those guys the gondola
(0:14:28) Codey: Oh yeah, yeah, Donna Lear, yeah.
(0:14:30) Kev: Yeah, there you go. That's the word
(0:14:33) Kev: Yeah, you get biker characters and just oh, it's fun
(0:14:37) Kev: There's it's it's a lot to see and do
(0:14:42) Kev: So yeah, oh, that's good and the switch to in general
(0:14:47) Kev: Holy moly that the technical upgrade is very not just palpable like it's it's it's clear like night and day
(0:14:56) Codey: I would hope so. It's been like 5 years, right?
(0:14:57) Kev: And not
(0:15:00) Kev: Yeah, no, it's been almost ten
(0:15:04) Codey: Oh my god.
(0:15:08) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:15:08) Codey: That's... I blinked.
(0:15:12) Kev: 2016 or 27th, I can't write the double check but one of those two that's almost 10 years
(0:15:14) Codey: Holy heckaroo.
(0:15:18) Codey: Oh my gosh. Yeah, so it sure as heck better be an improvement.
(0:15:21) Kev: Yeah, it is
(0:15:23) Kev: But what's nice is you don't like cuz you know, there's the whole switch to upgrades for all these games or whatever
(0:15:28) Kev: You don't even have to get it
(0:15:30) Kev: I mean it's like my brother Calvin, he played Splatoon
(0:15:32) Kev: And so one of the first things he did was like
(0:15:34) Kev: Okay, I'm gonna play Splatoon 2 or 3 or whatever on the new Switch
(0:15:38) Kev: And oh yeah, you can see right away
(0:15:40) Kev: Dang, look at those frame rates
(0:15:42) Kev: They're real now
(0:15:44) Codey: as with the like switch copy, the old copy, it's backwards compatible. Yeah.
(0:15:47) Kev: Yeah, with his Switch copy
(0:15:49) Kev: Yeah
(0:15:50) Kev: Yeah, it's backwards compatible
(0:15:52) Kev: And he didn't get an upgrade pack or whatever
(0:15:54) Kev: Just running on the better hardware
(0:15:57) Kev: like you can do the games just there
(0:16:00) Kev: they just run better so very very cool but but yeah so switch to it's it's it's
(0:16:07) Codey: Yeah, good that good that you got one. So I was last week
(0:16:12) Codey: Last weekend was go fest. I believe question mark
(0:16:16) Codey: Yeah, last weekend was yeah last weekend was go fest and so a bunch of us were running around, New York City
(0:16:17) Kev: this weekend I i heard
(0:16:23) Kev: oh oh new york city go fest yes okay
(0:16:23) Codey: and
(0:16:25) Codey: friend of friend of the pod Chris Rivate
(0:16:29) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:16:29) Codey: Was trying to find one man
(0:16:34) Codey: And he could not find one
(0:16:35) Kev: Yeah.
(0:16:37) Codey: He went to some targets. He went to the Nintendo store. He went he couldn't I don't know if he's found one that by now but
(0:16:40) Kev: Yeah.
(0:16:41) Kev: Yeah.
(0:16:42) Kev: Ooh.
(0:16:44) Kev: Yeah, ooh, they didn't have the Nintendo Store.
(0:16:46) Kev: That's rough, 'cause the Nintendo Store
(0:16:48) Kev: generally is pretty stocked with these things.
(0:16:48) Codey: Yeah
(0:16:50) Codey: Well and my partner's uh
(0:16:52) Codey: The building he works in is right is like the Nintendo building. Basically. It's like right there
(0:16:58) Codey: And he said the week before like all leading up to it
(0:17:01) Codey: They had like 30 stations where you could play switch to out like just on the sidewalk
(0:17:05) Kev: >> Yeah. Oh, that's cool.
(0:17:07) Codey: Um, and yeah, and and those were all gone because i'm assuming they probably still
(0:17:15) Codey: Uh, but yeah, it was it was crazy. Um, so many people would switch to stuff and and Pokemon people and
(0:17:25) Kev: that's that's cool that's cool but hey um I like I hope chris finds it soon um I i know they're
(0:17:32) Kev: actively trying to you know they're trying to feed the machine and get restocks everywhere
(0:17:36) Kev: I don't think this is a ps5 situation where it'll be gone for a year but you know fast to selling
(0:17:43) Kev: cons of all time like holy mackerel I don't think anyone expected that it's it's there's demand for
(0:17:48) Kev: it I guess um 10 years yep um
(0:17:55) Kev: yeah that's that's good I mean overall thumbs up what can I say you know um prices it is what it
(0:18:01) Kev: is but you know it's it's still good like in a vacuum um oh oh you know what i'm going back
(0:18:07) Kev: to mario kart world first because I just remember two other thoughts I want to add first of all um
(0:18:10) Codey: Okay.
(0:18:11) Kev: so the race is now 24 people in a race right which is kind of insane um but this actually
(0:18:18) Kev: had some upsides because the tracks are now really wide generally speaking
(0:18:24) Codey: - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay.
(0:18:26) Kev: which you know there's still turns that are unforgiving and you'll fall off or whatever
(0:18:30) Kev: but like the golden like the golden mushroom you know the one you can just spam and go go go go
(0:18:36) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:18:36) Kev: like that one's really good now because you can actually just stay on the track instead of just
(0:18:40) Kev: flying off in his space yeah so I i actually like that part of it um and then one of the new modes
(0:18:40) Codey: You're not gonna bump off of things yeah
(0:18:48) Kev: it's called knockout rally um I think I like it better than the standard grand prix it it feels
(0:18:56) Kev: so how it works is you have your 24 racers and they give you like an eight section chunk of the map
(0:19:03) Kev: like okay here's point a here's point b c yada yada yada and so every checkpoint the bottom
(0:19:10) Kev: four people are eliminated from the race so you start at 24 and at the end of it you're it's the
(0:19:16) Kev: top four racing for first place of the overall thing um and that's a fun mode I guess because
(0:19:21) Kev: Because as you get towards the end, it feels a little less chaotic and more like the...
(0:19:25) Kev: Classic Mario Kart, which is nice because you get a taste of both ends of the spectrum.
(0:19:33) Kev: Because yeah, let me tell you, the 24 racers, it's insane because if you're in first place or dead last, it's caught anywhere else.
(0:19:42) Codey: Yeah.
(0:19:42) Kev: It's it is blink and you're 10 places back. It's insanity. But um...
(0:19:46) Codey: Yeah, I used to play track media and it had a thing like that.
(0:19:51) Kev: Oh!
(0:19:52) Codey: Yeah.
(0:19:53) Kev: Yeah, it's good. I like it a lot.
(0:19:55) Kev: Good stuff. Um, I don't know. Yeah, switch to like I said overall thumbs up Mario Kart. Good stuff
(0:20:02) Kev: Alright, let's see other than that like so that was Calvin's thing my own things
(0:20:06) Kev: I've continued to play unicorn overlord the strategy game with a million layers of strategy
(0:20:11) Kev: I don't think I mentioned it so that you can adjust the logic of your your actions, which is insane to me
(0:20:19) Kev: So like you'll have an let's say an archer, right? They fire an arrow
(0:20:22) Kev: oh well, you can set conditions on
(0:20:25) Kev: the attack like okay use an arrow on people in the back row or people only flying units or people that have health so on and so forth. It's just more and more layers on complexity like good complexity of stuff you can do. It's insane. It's for crazy weirdos like me. I love it so much. It's called Unicorn Overlord. It's on Switch, PS5, Xbox. It's on all sorts of things. I found it for cheap on Switch like 30 bucks. It's on the
(0:20:55) Kev: It was a $60 full price game when it came out, but it's it's cheap now. It's it's so good. And I reached the what I forget the name of the place. I reached the country of the beast people. It's a whole country of like can have human anthropomorphic beast people. You got werewolf people, the bear people, owls, what else? Foxes and cats. I don't remember. It's a whole zoo of
(0:21:25) Kev: beast people, which is really fun. I don't know like and they're you know, they're kind of their own variation of classes. Like the bears are huge. They have a huge shield and a huge hammer. Oh, I love it. I like it's it's fun. It's a lot of fun. It's it's flavorful. But yeah, Unicorn Overlord is good. It's great for a freak like me. Another than that, the big one in line with the Switch 2. We got back the interwebs. I have internet running in my
(0:21:55) Codey: Yay!
(0:21:55) Kev: house and recording. I'm catching up on stuff. Zen la zone zero had its big 2.0 update while I was gone. And I floated that it's a lot of stuff. It's Zen la zone zero. I'm into it. And you know, it's for me. But but oh my gosh, so much stuff to catch up on. And then that's true for like all the other stuff that you know, my usual online haunts and whatnot. But um, but yeah, it's nice to have that. At least I can watch videos at home now. But yeah, that's
(0:22:25) Kev: That's what's going on with me a lot of stuff. I guess works busy. Oh, oh, you know what minor little golf clap for myself here
(0:22:34) Kev: so I
(0:22:36) Kev: The company I started a couple months ago in February
(0:22:40) Kev: My role is now sales engineer
(0:22:43) Kev: So I am technically part of sales team a salesperson making sales or should be I made my first sale
(0:22:49) Kev: It's a little one, but it is a first sale. So yeah a golf clap for me. I did a thing
(0:22:55) Kev: So yeah, there's that. Okay. All right, Kevin's done. All right
(0:23:00) Kev: Let's let's get into it. All right next stuff. All right, what do we what do we got here?
(0:23:04) Codey: Yeah, next is, "I Know What You Released Last Month," so this is the every month we have a segment at the beginning of the first episode of the month or something which we're doing it now.
(0:23:20) Codey: We just talked about things that came out last month. So this is stuff that might have slipped under our radar, might have been on your radar, but you also have not noticed that it came out.
(0:23:30) Kev: Yeah, I see one at least one
(0:23:32) Codey: Um, so these are these
(0:23:34) Codey: are the things so we oh I do see one too. So we have ratopia to pixellia franamon ea
(0:23:40) Kev: That's okay, okay
(0:23:44) Codey: pixelshire or ea being early access pixelshire dole octown early access of life and land 1.0
(0:23:53) Codey: fantasy life I the girl who steals time and battle country do any of these jump out to you
(0:23:58) Kev: Okay
(0:24:00) Kev: Well, I got one ratopia. It's a good game. We did the Kelly and all the nepsilon it you go listen to it
(0:24:07) Kev: So that's a thumbs up from me. Um
(0:24:09) Kev: The fantasy life I've talked about that. I played the DS once good game gonna get the sequel eventually. I'm
(0:24:17) Kev: Not yet, but I will get it. But the big one that I missed I didn't realize it was out cattle
(0:24:24) Kev: cattle country
(0:24:26) Kev: Good mood, you know
(0:24:29) Kev: I want to do that
(0:24:31) Kev: So yeah, I'll be looking at that. I didn't realize it was out
(0:24:35) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(0:24:36) Kev: What about you anything catch your eye
(0:24:39) Codey: Of Life and Land caught my eye.
(0:24:41) Codey: So that's a game that I've been wanting to play,
(0:24:43) Codey: but it's a terrible time, terrible time to come out.
(0:24:47) Codey: So anything could come out for the rest of the year
(0:24:51) Codey: and it would be a terrible time.
(0:24:51) Kev: No, it's gonna be so we're gonna need I know what you released last year
(0:24:53) Codey: It's just gonna be a bad time for me.
(0:24:58) Codey: Yeah, and then I can go, it'll be at the end of the year
(0:25:01) Codey: and that's when I will just have it.
(0:25:03) Codey: I will have all the money
(0:25:05) Codey: and a big fat job with all those jobs that still exist.
(0:25:07) Kev: You go
(0:25:09) Codey: Ha, ha, cry.
(0:25:14) Kev: Man
(0:25:14) Codey: And I'll have so much money
(0:25:15) Codey: and I'll be like, oh, what can I spend money on?
(0:25:18) Codey: No, so, okay.
(0:25:19) Kev: Well, I
(0:25:20) Codey: Yeah, that, but what?
(0:25:21) Kev: Just I just want to add on on that note
(0:25:24) Kev: so the company I work for their headquarters is actually in China and
(0:25:30) Kev: Our products are manufactured in China with steel from China
(0:25:35) Kev: And again, I started this and
(0:25:37) Kev: February right like right early February. So like too much jobs into my or two weeks into my job
(0:25:44) Kev: You know things happened and then I was like, well, I might be screwed
(0:25:49) Codey: Yeah, it's just up in the air.
(0:25:52) Kev: Yup, no, I say that so much jokingly so far it's okay
(0:25:56) Kev: I did not felt shaky security or anything but still the the timing of that was oh
(0:26:02) Kev: That was that was wild. Huh? Anyways, but like I said general
(0:26:05) Codey: Yeah, it's a great time to work in conservation, tell you what.
(0:26:08) Kev: Oh
(0:26:13) Kev: It's it's general gestures at the world, right?
(0:26:18) Codey: We are here for escapism.
(0:26:22) Kev: Yeah, oh, yeah, I want to escape there's a bandit
(0:26:29) Codey: You want to be a bandit? Is it bandit like Bluey's dad?
(0:26:34) Kev: no not that bandit you know we had um momo con in atlanta one of our big cons that one's very
(0:26:41) Kev: like anime focused for whatever reason they brought uh the voices of bandit and chili
(0:26:45) Kev: I didn't go see them but they were here and like dang that was a good get they were they're like
(0:26:52) Kev: the the headlines they're like top of billing of the the guest list yeah yeah they would be um
(0:26:54) Codey: they would be. We have right now, we have a convention near us that has a giant reunion
(0:27:04) Codey: of people from Twilight. There's also Dante Basco, who plays Zuko in Avatar. He has some
(0:27:06) Kev: Oh!
(0:27:13) Kev: Yo. Yo, we...
(0:27:15) Codey: other roles, but my favorite role of his was Rufio and Hook. But yeah, that's there's some
(0:27:23) Codey: good names in it.
(0:27:25) Kev: Yeah, MobileCon was strong this year. They had some good names. I think they also had some Avatar people, um...
(0:27:32) Kev: I know, but yeah, but Band and Chili were another like, "Oh, here's the ones we were highlighting on. Here's the, like I said, top building and a little guest list or whatever."
(0:27:41) Kev: Um...
(0:27:42) Kev: Ah, Louie's so good.
(0:27:45) Kev: We, we gotta, we still have to do a greenhouse episode of How We Talked About It, and I'd love to do it.
(0:27:46) Codey: I just need it back.
(0:27:49) Codey: Oh my gosh, I'm not ready to cry.
(0:27:51) Kev: Just...
(0:27:53) Kev: Well, now we...
(0:27:56) Kev: Yeah, there's a lot of episodes that get emotional reactions, more than you'd think.
(0:28:04) Codey: - Yeah, there was one that just like out of nowhere,
(0:28:06) Codey: hit me and I was just sobbing.
(0:28:07) Kev: Alright, which one?
(0:28:10) Codey: No, I'm not, wait, it's a great way for the greenhouse.
(0:28:12) Codey: I'll tell you not on the, yeah.
(0:28:13) Kev: Alright, we'll stay on the greenhouse, okay?
(0:28:15) Kev: You know, look, it's not my number one, but any time they show an older, bluey, I just scream.
(0:28:16) Codey: We'll do a greenhouse sometime soon without that.
(0:28:24) Codey: - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:28:28) Codey: With the tree and the camping and the,
(0:28:29) Kev: Alright.
(0:28:30) Kev: Oh, that was a good one.
(0:28:32) Codey: that was a good one.
(0:28:34) Codey: So that is what released last month.
(0:28:35) Kev: Alright, you know what else was good?
(0:28:39) Codey: Are you gonna talk about the wholesome directs?
(0:28:40) Kev: I was, because that was...
(0:28:42) Kev: Yeah, oh yeah, okay, well yeah.
(0:28:43) Kev: But that was the stuff that came out.
(0:28:45) Kev: Was there any, you know, I'm going too fast here.
(0:28:47) Kev: Is there anything else you wanted to talk about on the stuff that came out?
(0:28:49) Codey: - No, no.
(0:28:50) Kev: Okay, now, I mean, I'd have to...
(0:28:53) Kev: I don't remember all these names off the top of my head
(0:28:55) Kev: So maybe a missing one, but I mean either anyways, but yes wholesome direct that was also good Cody
(0:29:00) Kev: Do you have any thoughts on the wholesome?
(0:29:02) Codey: So, uh, the question that I'll pose specifically was did I have anything that you guys didn't say I didn't listen to last week's episode yet
(0:29:10) Codey: I'm sorry, so
(0:29:10) Kev: That's fine. No, that's fine. I'm usually a couple weeks behind myself.
(0:29:13) Codey: But
(0:29:14) Codey: but also I just um, I just like
(0:29:20) Codey: Watch the first like I watched the whole host and direct but a lot of it was I was just like I
(0:29:26) Codey: Expected that yep. Okay. Yeah, I've heard this is coming out. Okay, this this is to be expected
(0:29:30) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:29:32) Codey: The only thing that I was super stoked about and I wrote a note down and I put underlined an exclamation point
(0:29:38) Codey: Was leaf-blowing games
(0:29:40) Kev: Yeah
(0:29:42) Kev: So I'm like
(0:29:42) Codey: Um, yeah
(0:29:44) Kev: Powerwash simulator has established a genre like it's wild but here we are
(0:29:51) Kev: It's it's just that satisfaction of I don't know clean like sing something becoming clean. I guess like I
(0:29:59) Kev: Guess that's I mean I so one of my little habits quarks. I am infamous for
(0:30:08) Kev: adjusting like
(0:30:10) Kev: If I'm just standing by some are just like waiting for something or whatever and I see like a dusty area I will start
(0:30:17) Kev: dusting that thing cuz I
(0:30:18) Codey: Yeah, I do stuff like that too. And then it's really awkward when I'm doing it. And I'm waiting for my friend to get like ready to go do something and then I'm like cleaning up their house and they're like, Oh, I'm sorry. Am I dirty? And I'm like, No, I just need to do this.
(0:30:20) Kev: That's that's
(0:30:29) Kev: Yeah
(0:30:38) Kev: Yeah
(0:30:40) Kev: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, so it's no I'm not trying to shame or do anything just I can make like there's an opportunity to make a dust
(0:30:47) Kev: Bunny here, and that's that's that that's a good one
(0:30:48) Codey: Or like, I'm sorry, I looked and this plant, uh, like I checked it and it desperately needs water. So I don't say that. Oh, that was a big.
(0:30:56) Kev: Yeah, oh
(0:30:59) Kev: Okay, you know that that one might be a little harder like I could see it cuz you know that that one's like
(0:31:06) Kev: Active care of a living thing right like the dust thing that that just happens passively
(0:31:11) Kev: But like I get it and I'm like I'm this. Oh, that's that's rough. But um
(0:31:17) Kev: But yeah, but it's the same thing. Yeah, just just chicken something offer, you know
(0:31:22) Kev: Hi, yeah, you know what hydrating a plant that is a good one right like seeing the water
(0:31:26) Codey: Yeah and like you can, especially like I know how to, I've had a lot of these plants like I
(0:31:26) Kev: Go in and the soil absorbs it
(0:31:32) Codey: go to a friend's house I see their pothos is looking kind of sad and then I can also first of
(0:31:37) Codey: all pop those you can just water the crap out of those they're fine but like or a monstera or
(0:31:42) Codey: something and I you can check the soil you can just dip a finger into the soil and if it is bone
(0:31:46) Codey: bone dry just pour a little water and just give her a little love. Especially as grad students like
(0:31:50) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:31:53) Codey: we usually have so much going on like
(0:31:55) Kev: Yeah
(0:31:56) Codey: it's good to just like take care of something for someone so yeah that
(0:31:58) Kev: Yeah, yeah for sure yeah, absolutely I get that and like us
(0:32:03) Codey: leaf-blowing game though so it was funny because like I was listening to this
(0:32:04) Kev: Yeah. Oh, yeah
(0:32:09) Codey: while I was the wholesome direct in the um in the museum that I worked in and
(0:32:14) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:32:14) Codey: people that were working in the museum were like what are you freaking out
(0:32:17) Codey: about I'm like this is a leaf-blowing game and like someone was like what do
(0:32:21) Codey: you mean and then someone else started explaining they're like yeah it's like
(0:32:24) Codey: Like, it's like--
(0:32:26) Codey: like, leafblowing, or, like, there's a power wash one.
(0:32:29) Codey: But, like, why don't you just, like, get one in real life?
(0:32:33) Codey: Why don't you just go get a leafblower?
(0:32:35) Codey: And I'm like, first of all, that's money.
(0:32:36) Kev: It's money.
(0:32:37) Codey: Second of all, I can't--
(0:32:38) Kev: Yeah!
(0:32:42) Codey: like, it wouldn't take me that long to leafblow my yard.
(0:32:45) Codey: And then it would be done.
(0:32:46) Kev: Yeah
(0:32:46) Codey: And then I would have nothing left to leafblow.
(0:32:49) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:32:50) Codey: So I also actually have a leafblower already.
(0:32:53) Codey: But we--
(0:32:55) Kev: Yeah
(0:32:56) Codey: Yeah, this is different.
(0:32:57) Codey: Like, I can power wash a children's playground
(0:33:01) Codey: as a Stegosaurus, and I can try and get the soccer ball
(0:33:03) Codey: to go up the slide and get extra points.
(0:33:05) Kev: Yeah, that's true man, so you know, I live in an apartment so I get even less leaf blower powerwash opportunities or whatever, but
(0:33:07) Codey: Like, that's just-- that's just fun.
(0:33:10) Codey: That's just pure fun.
(0:33:21) Kev: The one thing I'll do on I don't even do it out of like generous and most times I do out of spite or impatience
(0:33:29) Kev: There'll be shrubs or trees that are just they're just growing way too long
(0:33:33) Kev: Like actually interferes
(0:33:35) Kev: Like I need extra clearance for walking or I have more of a hassle for me to go under so I'll go out and trim him up and oh there we go
(0:33:36) Codey: Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
(0:34:02) Kev: I can now walk without having to bend.
(0:34:05) Kev: That's why leaf blower simulator exists for these exact reasons.
(0:34:09) Codey: It's intruding on public space.
(0:34:11) Codey: They needed to take care of it and they didn't.
(0:34:35) Kev: Let's start with updates to games that exist going from old to new.
(0:34:40) Kev: We are going to start with Critter crops.
(0:34:44) Kev: The witchery born. What a name for an update.
(0:34:48) Kev: The witchery born.
(0:34:48) Codey: Yeah, that's a pretty, pretty, like, metal name, yeah, exactly.
(0:34:51) Kev: Metal.
(0:34:56) Kev: It's a very cute, cozy art style on critter crops.
(0:34:59) Kev: It's very adorable. I love it.
(0:35:01) Kev: called the witch reborn you know it's the fear street
(0:35:03) Codey: Yeah.
(0:35:05) Kev: three three four um it. Mm hmm.
(0:35:09) Codey: Yeah, so this one adds a new vendor,
(0:35:12) Codey: which I'm assuming is the witch, a new grimoire, new UI.
(0:35:16) Codey: It adds new turn by turn combat and different customization
(0:35:21) Codey: options.
(0:35:22) Codey: But I think the biggest thing for y'all, for you and Al,
(0:35:25) Codey: and probably for our audience, is complete controller support.
(0:35:30) Codey: And they say, quote, this one was a doozy to.
(0:35:33) Codey: Implement. Unfortunately, it's not perfect.
(0:35:35) Codey: So we recommend not swapping back and forth between joystick and mouse and keyboard.
(0:35:42) Kev: Are there people who do that?
(0:35:44) Codey: I thought that's a choice.
(0:35:49) Kev: You know what, that's fine. Let those people- I think those people deserve it, if that's what they want to do.
(0:35:54) Kev: Let them- we're introducing updates to make their lives more miserable.
(0:36:00) Kev: Freaks!
(0:36:04) Kev: I'm kidding. Obviously there's- I'm sure- I look- I don't mouse and keyboard at all in general, so...
(0:36:10) Codey: Or maybe your controller's dead.
(0:36:11) Codey: Maybe you have ADHD and you forgot to charge it.
(0:36:12) Kev: Yeah.
(0:36:15) Codey: Can't relate, but--
(0:36:15) Kev: Yeah, look, the obvious use case is you need to type something, you know, a thing pops up, well...
(0:36:20) Codey: Oh, true, true.
(0:36:22) Kev: Just keyboard away, like, yeah. No, I'm sure it exists, but...
(0:36:24) Codey: Multitasking.
(0:36:28) Kev: Yeah, alright, but that- that- like, I'm just looking at this big list, um...
(0:36:33) Kev: That- that's a lot of stuff, um, like, holy mackerel, that is- they just had a truckload of updates on their little steam blurb,
(0:36:42) Kev: like, revamp combat, that's huge, holy mackerel.
(0:36:46) Codey: >> Mm-hmm.
(0:36:47) Kev: Um, good for them, um, and controller support, yeah, that's a big one.
(0:36:48) Codey: >> Yeah. Go for them.
(0:36:51) Codey: So this is technically their 2.0 update.
(0:36:53) Codey: So it's already out, it's 1999,
(0:36:55) Codey: it's only on Windows.
(0:36:57) Codey: So this just adds some new content and updates some things.
(0:37:03) Codey: No, sir. I'm not sure if you heard the dog.
(0:37:06) Kev: I might want to play this. This game is so cute. I'm just looking at this art style. It's it's
(0:37:11) Codey: I think when we initially looked at this,
(0:37:11) Kev: adorable
(0:37:14) Codey: of the art style was not my favorite.
(0:37:16) Codey: But it's growing on me. It's growing.
(0:37:17) Kev: I
(0:37:18) Kev: like it and these these
(0:37:21) Kev: Everything's kind of bouncing cute. I look just look at it people to go click on the link in the show notes. It's good one
(0:37:28) Kev: That's critter. Yeah, it's 2.0. You're right
(0:37:30) Kev: Um, I buy will likely especially now has controller support. Yeah, this one's on my list now
(0:37:36) Kev: officially oh
(0:37:39) Kev: All right, um, what do we have next?
(0:37:44) Codey: Next up is Travelers Rest, so they have a new thing called Pet Party,
(0:37:54) Codey: which is an expansion, not an expansion, a DLC question.
(0:37:58) Kev: I have pet parties at home. It's called lucky wants to just jump on me and lick my face a lot and man
(0:38:04) Codey: So this is the 0.7, 0.1 update, so this is still in early access, still earlier on, and they basically
(0:38:11) Codey: we just added a pet. I think he had a cat before, but I'm
(0:38:14) Codey: going to have a dog, dog will follow you around and it'll
(0:38:17) Codey: dig things up. And when you see like the little they dig and
(0:38:22) Codey: there's a little symbol, you can also dig and you can get stuff
(0:38:25) Codey: out of the ground. It also adds the artifacts table. So you
(0:38:31) Codey: might uncover some archaeological things. And then
(0:38:35) Codey: you can use the artifacts table to make them into things to
(0:38:39) Codey: decorate your home. So I think the dogs are cute.
(0:38:44) Codey: They have a lot of options for it. Also, yeah, also in the
(0:38:48) Kev: Yeah, this is Saint Bernard, that's wild.
(0:38:53) Codey: building. So you get these in the from a new building with
(0:38:57) Codey: new NPCs, they're called the buildings called the burrow is
(0:39:01) Codey: basically an animal shelter. They have like a red panda in
(0:39:05) Codey: there. They have some other stuff that currently you cannot
(0:39:10) Codey: get, but it it there it would be nice. It would be
(0:39:14) Codey: nice to get some of this stuff. Yeah.
(0:39:16) Kev: Yeah, I can't have a breadband in real life, so you know I'd like one virtually
(0:39:22) Kev: That they have a dog with a cone on it
(0:39:24) Kev: I don't think I've seen that before in a game or you know one of these cottagecore games so props to them for that
(0:39:30) Codey: I don't think I've ever seen it in a game.
(0:39:33) Kev: You might be right I don't think I have either
(0:39:36) Codey: I can't believe Sims hasn't done that yet.
(0:39:38) Kev: Yeah, I'm surprised Sims hasn't done that for people
(0:39:45) Codey: I wonder if that's a choice you can have.
(0:39:46) Kev: You
(0:39:49) Codey: And then, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.
(0:39:49) Kev: Know
(0:39:51) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I don't I'm never surprised by anything in Sims. I was just like yeah sure I believe they'd do it
(0:39:58) Kev: You know I've always been a little hard on travelers rest because it's you know so
(0:40:04) Kev: Star Dewey, but man they've really made this game robust. They're supporting it law is strong like good for them
(0:40:13) Kev: Yeah, it's impressive. I you know to the tip of my head
(0:40:16) Kev: Cuz that's a that's good work
(0:40:20) Kev: Is it is it changing my mind? Maybe a little I'm impressed
(0:40:23) Codey: Well, it's not at 1.0 yet, so you've got some time.
(0:40:27) Kev: It is not one but you know what yeah, that's right that that is my general bar
(0:40:32) Kev: So what you know, but you've caught my interest, you know 1.1 drops. Maybe I'll pick it up. Remember
(0:40:40) Kev: All right, you know what is past 1.0 pixel. Yeah is we talked we actually mint
(0:40:46) Kev: Didn't we mention it? Yeah
(0:40:47) Codey: Yeah, so it came out last month, and they have now brought out Steam Deck and controller support and key rebinding support.
(0:40:59) Codey: And here, Al has a comment.
(0:41:05) Codey: Al, not on the pod, but he commented, "Both of these should have been there at launch."
(0:41:10) Codey: Quote.
(0:41:10) Kev: You know what, yes, and you know what, I'm going to say that as a blanket statement for any game on a PC.
(0:41:11) Codey: Yeah.
(0:41:18) Kev: Like, okay, maybe not every, there's like, I'm sure there's a 1% like, this game does not need a controller, but if your game could use a controller at launch with controller support, please, please.
(0:41:30) Codey: Yeah, so this is what Al said, and I am going to retweet, share, like, subscribe to this comment.
(0:41:37) Codey: Quote, "I am not going to stop complaining when games launch without even the most
(0:41:41) Codey: basic controller or remapping support. It should be built into games from the very first time
(0:41:47) Codey: you do any key mapping in the first place. It is not just for Steam Deck users, it is an
(0:41:52) Codey: accessibility feature. Granted, they did add both within two months, but they should have been there
(0:42:00) Codey: version." Yeah.
(0:42:00) Kev: yep yep and you know what like I for those early access or betas like I you know I can get it you
(0:42:07) Kev: know how to control support but if you do 1.0 you're crossing that line you you gotta do it just
(0:42:08) Codey: Yeah.
(0:42:13) Kev: come on you gotta look a little professional right like and I get it can be hard I get it that can
(0:42:19) Kev: be worked the what was it the the other critter crops they said that was hard and you know what
(0:42:24) Kev: they're probably right but you just
(0:42:27) Codey: - Oh yeah, you're basically like releasing your game
(0:42:31) Codey: or just some people, but like for some of your base.
(0:42:38) Codey: But if there are people who are reliant on controller
(0:42:42) Codey: support or keyboard remapping to be able to play a game,
(0:42:46) Codey: period, then you're basically limiting,
(0:42:51) Codey: those people can't play your game at launch.
(0:42:53) Codey: And so everyone else is gonna be off playing it
(0:42:55) Codey: and enjoying it.
(0:42:57) Codey: They're going to be Squidward in his house, looking at SpongeBob and Patrick running around, having fun.
(0:42:58) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:43:07) Kev: That meme is so good
(0:43:08) Codey: I love that meme. I post that meme all the time.
(0:43:11) Kev: So, I mean really, you know like I mean you and me are roughly in the same age
(0:43:17) Kev: Group, right? So, you know those first two seasons spongebob that we know when they kind of defined a large part of our brain and life
(0:43:25) Kev: and vocabulary on but
(0:43:28) Kev: But the memes are very strong from spongebob. That's such a good one
(0:43:28) Codey: - Yeah, they are, they're endearing.
(0:43:34) Kev: Yep, oh
(0:43:36) Kev: But okay. Well that all said it is out on pixalia. Um, so good for them for finally getting it out
(0:43:44) Kev: You know just a few warning to you know using our
(0:43:49) Kev: Influencer power here on all these games that clearly listen to us
(0:43:53) Kev: Game devs listening to us put your put your controls report at once
(0:43:57) Codey: - I mean, I will, I'll jump on a high horse.
(0:43:59) Codey: I think that like these games are geared
(0:44:02) Codey: for neurodivergent folks towards like,
(0:44:05) Codey: they are for people who are different.
(0:44:06) Kev: Yeah. That's a good point.
(0:44:10) Codey: And so it's something that like, yeah,
(0:44:13) Codey: like not having that out at the jump is like kind of weird
(0:44:19) Codey: to exclude basically your biggest fan base.
(0:44:22) Codey: It's like, if they were like, oh,
(0:44:24) Kev: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah.
(0:44:24) Codey: we're going to make a new harvest moon.
(0:44:27) Codey: game but you can only be a boy and then a month in suddenly you can be a girl and you can be
(0:44:33) Codey: a different race and you like so I it's it's 2025 y'all we are past this I thought
(0:44:42) Kev: Yeah.
(0:44:44) Codey: but yeah good on them for getting it out ASAP but uh just to be warned else um please have this out
(0:44:52) Codey: like after Trump
(0:44:56) Kev: All right, what do we got next?
(0:45:00) Codey: Next up, sorry, next up is Lightyear Frontier.
(0:45:03) Codey: They have their new ELC slash what it called,
(0:45:08) Codey: just content update.
(0:45:09) Codey: Yeah, it's just content update.
(0:45:11) Codey: It's the shipping gear update.
(0:45:13) Codey: It just adds a lot ton of new content.
(0:45:18) Kev: settings and things.
(0:45:18) Codey: So yeah, settings, there's modular building,
(0:45:21) Codey: there's new tools, there's new types to cross and mounds.
(0:45:26) Codey: There's mech, there's health.
(0:45:28) Kev: health? What do you mean adding mech health? There's an inn already?
(0:45:30) Codey: And your mech, yeah, it's true.
(0:45:36) Codey: New minerals to the game world, a day length setting,
(0:45:40) Codey: a setting where you can auto hide the heads up display,
(0:45:43) Codey: which is super dope, adding a quick deposit accelerator
(0:45:46) Codey: in storage contract menus,
(0:45:48) Codey: 100% love whenever you add quick deposit things.
(0:45:52) Codey: You don't have to click a button a million times.
(0:45:55) Codey: Um, I mean, it seems like, uh, it's, it's, uh, yeah.
(0:46:00) Codey: It's an update that kind of fixes a lot of the small little, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, they
(0:46:04) Kev: they're literally changing physics in the game that's there's several bullets on physics
(0:46:12) Codey: also have, uh, some changes to physics and some bug fixes and they have a new roadmap
(0:46:17) Codey: and the new roadmap, um, includes, so in development, so we're still in early access for this game.
(0:46:24) Codey: The things that are in development, so they are happening, um, are
(0:46:30) Codey: more mech customization, more ruins and lore, biome, building pieces, um, in exploration
(0:46:37) Codey: stuff they're thinking about doing, but, uh, is not quite on the horizon, is mech powered
(0:46:44) Codey: resource hauling, so I guess your mech's carrying resources for you, new hazards and terrain,
(0:46:51) Codey: and then some other things for consideration, if I see controller support in here, I'm gonna
(0:46:56) Codey: can lose it. Um, multiplayer.
(0:46:58) Kev: Hahahaha at least
(0:47:00) Codey: Or expanded automation, uh, creative mode, fast travel, mod support. Okay, cool.
(0:47:07) Kev: Mm-hmm. Well, I'd say yeah
(0:47:11) Kev: Yeah, do you think road map should have at least target tentative dates?
(0:47:16) Kev: I feel like they should because I don't know that that feels like the map part to me, but
(0:47:23) Kev: That's just like a general statement like a month
(0:47:26) Kev: You know, because they list all this, but there's no dates or anything.
(0:47:28) Kev: You know, again, I know that work is hard. They'd probably be wrong anyways, but...
(0:47:35) Codey: It's nice to give people some idea because their plan could be for this to be out in five years.
(0:47:47) Codey: And how would we know that?
(0:47:48) Kev: I get, yeah, yeah.
(0:47:50) Codey: That's clearly not likely, but that could be what they were wanting.
(0:47:55) Kev: You yeah, you know what I'll make us I think an easier target like when your next update when do you plan and what's something you're going to do right like the next step.
(0:48:06) Codey: - Yeah, just give us a day of like,
(0:48:08) Codey: when's the next time we'll hear from you with new,
(0:48:10) Kev: And what to expect like there's got to be at least one thing you know we'll probably drop in your next up day when you try and hit that can give us that throw us a bone here.
(0:48:20) Kev: But, uh, but that, I mean, you know, that said, this was a huge update.
(0:48:25) Kev: Your frontier is still early access, still growing, figuring it out.
(0:48:28) Codey: Yeah. And speaking of teasing updates, we have a whole category called teased updates this time around because the bunch of games just mentioned that there are updates that are coming, but they did not give dates.
(0:48:34) Kev: That's very specific.
(0:48:43) Codey: Oh, I guess one of them gave days.
(0:48:46) Codey: The first one gave it gave a date, which is Moonstone Island, June 16, they have a new update that is free. It is called evolutions.
(0:48:55) Codey: And I love this, I just needed to quote this.
(0:48:58) Codey: Quote, "Let me guess, you want to be the very best, perhaps like no one ever was."
(0:49:02) Kev: There you go.
(0:49:06) Codey: I hear you loud and clear, pal, that's why we're adding a brand new but also not new at all feature to Stone Island.
(0:49:14) Kev: Heh heh heh heh!
(0:49:17) Codey: Yeah, and it's basically that your little spirits can evolve.
(0:49:22) Kev: So they showed a, you know, image with all sorts of new creatures or evolutions.
(0:49:28) Kev: The fish bow evolution is on this image. We know what fish bow will turn into.
(0:49:32) Kev: For people who don't remember, fish bow is the, it's literally like a goldfish in a fish bowl with legs.
(0:49:40) Kev: Though like the glass jar has like robot legs
(0:49:42) Codey: but his legs have been replaced with a rocket to the moonfish bow.
(0:49:46) Kev: With like a rocket
(0:49:52) Kev: Yeah, there there are there are multiple things with rocket propulsion in this image
(0:49:59) Kev: Which is cool
(0:50:03) Kev: Moonstone Island is such a fast because I played that game I played that game as a completion something rare on this show
(0:50:10) Kev: And maybe that's why it feels so weird to me like I hit the Ed point
(0:50:14) Kev: That was a full game. Like, you know, maybe it had some issues or whatever, but that was a game and now they're updating it with so much like my
(0:50:23) Kev: like evolutions now like my playthrough will feel incomplete that which is weird to think about but
(0:50:29) Kev: But here we are right? Like I feel and especially like in a creature collector like it's it's when you release batches like this
(0:50:37) Kev: I really wish they'd give me you know, a
(0:50:40) Kev: little campaign or quest line or something to go back in to feel like
(0:50:44) Kev: something new to do right um because yeah but that's probably something very
(0:50:47) Codey: Yeah, they just say that there's a new quest that teaches you about evolution, but that doesn't seem yeah
(0:50:54) Kev: short term right it's not a full little story thing right um I just because like
(0:51:00) Kev: you know I'll give Pokemon credit for that right when they drop their DLC is
(0:51:05) Kev: there's a whole new little story campaign whatever and then that's you
(0:51:08) Kev: know a genuine reason to go back not just I'll load up the save catch the new
(0:51:13) Kev: Okay, I'm done and peace out.
(0:51:16) Kev: But, you know what, I'll give Moonstone Island credit, the updates are going to be free, they're already saying it, so good on them for that.
(0:51:24) Kev: Oh well, that's a big one.
(0:51:26) Kev: Yeah, and all my, like I said, as weird as it is, I did enjoy Moonstone Island because I actually beat it.
(0:51:32) Kev: So, will this maybe one day result in another playthrough? Maybe, I don't know, we'll see.
(0:51:38) Kev: They're updating a lot, so I can't wait to see when that should be.
(0:51:44) Codey: June 16th is when this is coming out, so by the time folks have listened to this, it'll be out.
(0:51:50) Kev: Oh, that's that's too close. I don't know. Wow. Wow.
(0:51:54) Kev: Aislinn is evolving like this update. Wow.
(0:51:58) Codey: Well, the next one is Sun Haven.
(0:52:01) Kev: All right. What what else do we got? What other?
(0:52:06) Codey: So they have a new update.
(0:52:07) Kev: I know that game.
(0:52:10) Codey: It's called the Festivals and Crafting update.
(0:52:13) Codey: And it is on their public beta environment.
(0:52:16) Codey: So it is playable.
(0:52:19) Codey: It is the second patch on the public on the PPE.
(0:52:24) Codey: And this is PC only.
(0:52:27) Codey: and it just adds.
(0:52:28) Codey: And the first thing that they mentioned is the Wither Ball, which is with a monster city,
(0:52:40) Codey: you need a monster party. Come what one come all to the one night only Wither Ball to witness
(0:52:45) Codey: the benevolent demon king recrowned from mysterious. Dance with elites from Withergate or assist
(0:52:48) Kev: Oh don't get caught that's the only caveat that oh see they showed like an image of catching
(0:52:50) Codey: Donovan in playing an epic prank. Don't get caught. Yeah.
(0:53:02) Kev: apples I thought that was a game called wither ball about apples yeah now I go confused yeah
(0:53:04) Codey: Oh, no, that's the next, that's the next.
(0:53:08) Kev: wither ball as in a dance ball not not a sports ball that's kind of cute though that's
(0:53:17) Codey: So that's out, or yeah, it's on the public beta right now,
(0:53:22) Codey: but they don't have a date yet
(0:53:24) Codey: for when it's just gonna be out of public beta.
(0:53:27) Codey: The next thing is the Snack Hoon Festival.
(0:53:30) Codey: So Snack and Raccoon put together Snack Hoon.
(0:53:35) Codey: We get it.
(0:53:36) Codey: After all of the Snack Hoon's you helped feed,
(0:53:39) Codey: they want to give back to the festival.
(0:53:42) Codey: As the honored guests, the Snack Hoon's have much
(0:53:44) Codey: to offer you delicious snacks,
(0:53:47) Codey: clothes that are possibly made with snackoons, furniture possibly also made with snackoon fur,
(0:53:55) Codey: and wigs that come with the smallest snackoons on top of them.
(0:54:00) Kev: Uh, okay, I don't know what a snakuen is, but okay. It's good. Yeah.
(0:54:03) Codey: It looks like a little raccoon guy, could also be like a cat, I don't know.
(0:54:09) Codey: They also are adding new weapons, either great swords and hammers,
(0:54:14) Codey: Simple ones that you can then I believe
(0:54:18) Codey: updates and upgrade and new furniture monster elven monster furniture and elven furniture tables that you can use to make specific types of furniture. Oh, and then the picture there is I promise to me these are all snackkins in this very purple.
(0:54:37) Kev: yeah they're purple yeah that's a lot of there's a snakoon inside like a teddy bear
(0:54:45) Kev: costume thing that's that's a lot um that's a lot of purple
(0:54:46) Codey: you know, I like the little, I like the background, the little wolves, picking the phones out.
(0:54:53) Kev: yeah that big image that that is just a big the cat color palette don't don't try to hide it
(0:54:57) Codey: Right? I'm not. 400 new furniture items. And this game is 50% off until June 26. So it's currently
(0:54:59) Kev: don't not hide your inspiration you will not get past me on this show
(0:55:06) Kev: Ugh, uh oh.
(0:55:14) Kev: Yeah, that's that's exciting
(0:55:14) Codey: only $12.
(0:55:17) Kev: Go go of all the 1250 you too can have
(0:55:20) Kev: Live the dream of a room that largely resembles big the cat and and all the other things you can do instant Sun Haven
(0:55:25) Codey: Yep. Yep.
(0:55:30) Kev: Yeah, good good on you at 12 feet that's good price for all that
(0:55:35) Kev: But dude, this is only like a week. Those are hurry go go go
(0:55:41) Kev: All right, mm-hmm
(0:55:41) Codey: The last teased update--
(0:55:45) Codey: because it's just a teased release date.
(0:55:50) Codey: So it is for Research Story, which
(0:55:54) Codey: I'm very excited to play, on 1.0.
(0:55:56) Kev: Ahhh?
(0:56:00) Codey: So this is the final--
(0:56:01) Codey: the current dev log is the final one for Early Access.
(0:56:06) Kev: Oh, that's, oh, what...
(0:56:06) Codey: So the next, the next.
(0:56:08) Codey: They're going to update. So release the.
(0:56:13) Kev: That's some pressure, you know, that you, you have drawn a target.
(0:56:18) Kev: Like, you, you know, you've pointed your bat at the sky.
(0:56:19) Codey: Well, I mean, they can just not release a dev update for a while, but I think they're
(0:56:24) Kev: Well, yeah, exactly, though, that's the pressure, right?
(0:56:28) Kev: You're going to pull a scar.
(0:56:29) Codey: pretty, they're doing pretty good.
(0:56:31) Kev: No, I do. I do.
(0:56:32) Kev: Like, I'm not saying anything about research story in specific, just like,
(0:56:33) Codey: Vamish.
(0:56:36) Kev: they're going to pull a scong and not release for six years or whatever.
(0:56:37) Codey: Yeah, and then they have, they've mentioned some things they've updated so far.
(0:56:46) Codey: the thing that I love the most is
(0:56:49) Codey: they've been listening to us complain about these games
(0:56:54) Codey: and how our spouses just do nothing
(0:56:57) Codey: and they become homebound and stuck after we marry them
(0:56:58) Kev: Yeah, as it does, sorry, Aislinn.
(0:57:02) Codey: and we deprive them of life
(0:57:04) Codey: because the research story devs have added
(0:57:07) Codey: it does
(0:57:09) Codey: the research devs have added "spouse routines"
(0:57:10) Kev: Oh, that's great.
(0:57:13) Codey: "spouses will pass from their new home to their regular workplaces
(0:57:18) Kev: Yeah.
(0:57:20) Codey: "spouses will have new dialogue in certain scenarios
(0:57:23) Codey: "and there will also be small cutscenes on your birthday and wedding anniversary"
(0:57:28) Kev: Oh, that's good stuff. The anniversary. What a time
(0:57:32) Kev: Yo, I don't think i've ever seen that before that's oh, hmm. I like that good
(0:57:35) Codey: you can also show "affection"
(0:57:37) Codey: so you can go to them throughout the day and give them
(0:57:40) Kev: Yep
(0:57:42) Kev: That's that's good. That's good stuff, you know
(0:57:45) Kev: I complained about I was complaining that you don't need a romance thing in every game
(0:57:50) Kev: But if you're going all out like this, all right, you know, good
(0:57:54) Kev: thumbs up for that, uh, wedding anniversary, I like that a lot, stardew desert.
(0:57:58) Kev: Uh, that's good stuff. Good for you. Research story. Um,
(0:58:01) Codey: Yeah, so we
(0:58:05) Codey: Yeah, we have one new game
(0:58:09) Codey: And that game is called seeds of calamity
(0:58:13) Codey: Quote take part in healing after the great calamity. I
(0:58:14) Kev: The debt
(0:58:18) Kev: It's a breath of the wild spin-off we're thinking it I didn't say it
(0:58:19) Codey: know
(0:58:22) Codey: Is this the time is this like right after is this for the is this the in-between
(0:58:28) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:58:30) Kev: Yes
(0:58:31) Codey: And your farm, okay
(0:58:32) Kev: Well, look the Hyrule has been ravaged by Ganon, you know, Calamity Ganon for so long
(0:58:38) Kev: So now link has to help farm and regrow the, you know store the Hyrule
(0:58:42) Codey: Does it look like Ling?
(0:58:44) Kev: That's that's how it works
(0:58:45) Codey: Doesn't really look like Ling.
(0:58:47) Kev: I played this game by the way
(0:58:48) Codey: The little cat thing is cute though.
(0:58:49) Kev: Yeah
(0:58:51) Kev: Yeah, that that that looks like a little like Imogon. It's a little there's an owl here. Okay, what are we talking about?
(0:58:51) Codey: Yeah, yeah, so yeah, "Take part in healing after the Great Calamity, tend your farm,
(0:58:57) Kev: I just look at this video. It's very nice
(0:59:05) Codey: complete quests for the villagers and explore dungeons filled with challenge and treasure
(0:59:08) Codey: in this cozy, solo developed farming sense.
(0:59:12) Kev: Oh my god
(0:59:13) Codey: Build a new life in a recovering world with your fluffy spellbook and companion.
(0:59:19) Kev: oh my gosh you know all the complaints I have about any stardew like or other
(0:59:28) Kev: cottagecore or whatever like anytime you hear solo dev it's like oh I can't it's
(0:59:32) Codey: I can barely take care of myself, let alone build a whole thing that other people, and
(0:59:33) Kev: a little harder to complain cuz you know like geez you're you're a mom you're a
(0:59:37) Kev: beast doing all of this hats off to you
(0:59:50) Kev: Some people forget to water their plants.
(0:59:54) Codey: then I have to water their plants for them.
(0:59:57) Kev: And you're out here developing a whole system with ba--
(1:00:01) Kev: There's a boss frog in there.
(1:00:03) Kev: Monst--
(1:00:04) Codey: I think the biggest thing is like the fact that someone's gonna like play this like
(1:00:09) Codey: So my dissertation for example, I'm putting a lot of time and energy into that but I don't really think it's gonna do
(1:00:16) Kev: it's not going out until the open world it's I mean it is well the general open
(1:00:19) Codey: It will but it's but it'll be
(1:00:23) Codey: Yeah, it's not
(1:00:24) Kev: internet which podcast is going to cover it that's the question
(1:00:25) Codey: It's only gonna impact like a hundred people
(1:00:28) Codey: It's only gonna impact like a hundred people well and probably like from the
(1:00:34) Codey: It'll trickle down into like management. But like this is these games are you're developing these for possibly millions of people, which is nuts. So
(1:00:43) Codey: Good on you. Let me figure out the developer laborious. No. Yeah laborious Lark studios
(1:00:54) Kev: lark that's a bird
(1:00:54) Codey: And this appears to be it is it is the word this appears to be their first game
(1:00:59) Kev: well hats off to you like oh my god I I've looked and you know kind of dipped
(1:01:07) Kev: my the edge of my toe into dame dev it's very scary so hats off to these people
(1:01:13) Kev: see that's it's only $14.99 USD am I looking at that right into the right one
(1:01:22) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah. It's and it's already out. It's May 20. It's in early access. Sorry, it's in early access.
(1:01:24) Kev: that's that's good price it's out you know what okay oh well okay but still
(1:01:33) Kev: that's a that's still impressive it's a functioning game of to some degree for
(1:01:38) Kev: that price that's impressive good for you laborious lark person
(1:01:41) Codey: So on on the Steam when they say why early access
(1:01:46) Codey: They say that they want to bring in fresh players and hear feedback to shape the game into the best thing it can be
(1:01:51) Kev: Yeah
(1:01:52) Codey: They think it's only going to be an early access for eight to nine months
(1:01:55) Kev: Which is impressive if true
(1:02:00) Codey: They are
(1:02:02) Codey: Saying that the full version will differ by having more farming animals new quests including seasonal ones and enemy wave
(1:02:11) Codey: which is wild
(1:02:14) Kev: Oh my gosh
(1:02:14) Codey: New crops to grow and harvest and playing more surprises
(1:02:18) Kev: Yeah, that's that's a lot I mean they have a road map - there's stuff for the ranch combat village farm
(1:02:25) Kev: That's all there's a lot of stuff. They they you know, they're they're they're thinking ahead good for them
(1:02:30) Kev: Yeah, and you can get the early access part of some bundles with let's see do lock town again called bika
(1:02:38) Kev: Small spaces that those are different games. Yeah, these are great prices like the most
(1:02:44) Kev: Do lock town it's still less than $30 for two games. That's impressive
(1:02:48) Codey: Laika is also adorable. I'm going to take a pivot here.
(1:02:53) Kev: What is I do I know like I don't know if I know like I'm
(1:02:54) Codey: I don't think so. It just came out as well.
(1:02:58) Codey: Laika is "a small, relaxing, incremental game about restoring a barren wasteland into a lush meadow.
(1:03:04) Codey: Help the magical wolf Laika run through the land, gather resources, and unlock a vast upgrade."
(1:03:10) Kev: Whoa what's going on like I'm watching the first year you'd see a wolf and grasses sprouting but
(1:03:16) Codey: Wolf is just running through and restoring a meadow, basically.
(1:03:19) Kev: Yeah, and then there's a skill tree and then all of a sudden birds are flying all over
(1:03:25) Kev: This is a lot of stuff. I don't know what's going on. That wolf is magical. That's cool
(1:03:33) Kev: Check these games out. They're cool. Good for you seeds of calamity
(1:03:36) Kev: So you taught me about like, well, let me cut it, but you're not helped in that.
(1:03:40) Kev: You let you open the conversation.
(1:03:46) Kev: Oh, let's see here.
(1:03:47) Kev: Um, all right.
(1:03:50) Kev: So, you know, how we said how being a solo dev is hard and there's pressure
(1:03:57) Kev: because people will play it.
(1:03:59) Codey: Yep.
(1:03:59) Kev: Did you know concern tape also feels pressure because we got one more item of
(1:04:05) Kev: news here, uh, we got concerned, Dave talking about haunted chocolatier.
(1:04:11) Kev: Um, looks like it's a, uh, let's see, they were, he's on a podcast, looks
(1:04:17) Kev: like talking about it, um, and, you know, uh, various things, um, but haunted
(1:04:24) Kev: chocolatier, like the, the kind of keynotes here out prepped, uh, he
(1:04:28) Kev: hopes to release it within the next five years, not going to lie.
(1:04:32) Kev: I thought it would be sooner than that.
(1:04:34) Kev: Again, game dev is very hard.
(1:04:36) Kev: I don't want to, you know, downplay that, especially if it's just
(1:04:41) Kev: doing solo again, because he's a monster like that because he does that.
(1:04:45) Kev: Um, but, uh, the next one is, I think this is the kicker here.
(1:04:52) Kev: He feels like it has to be better than stardew and there's a lot of pressure.
(1:04:56) Kev: Yeah, there's probably a lot of pressure, um, better than stardew.
(1:05:00) Kev: That's a terrifying thought, especially considering you haven't stopped on
(1:05:04) Kev: stardew, literally moving your own goalposts.
(1:05:06) Codey: - Yeah, he said that since he mentioned the game,
(1:05:10) Codey: he has been, it's been a good amount of time
(1:05:14) Codey: since he mentioned it to now
(1:05:15) Codey: and that he hasn't been able to make as much progress
(1:05:18) Codey: because he was focused on 1.6.
(1:05:20) Codey: But I do know like from a previous news episode that we did
(1:05:24) Codey: that he said that he's pretty set on like focusing on this.
(1:05:28) Kev: Yeah, he is on supposedly
(1:05:31) Codey: So that's great, but I think putting it on himself
(1:05:36) Codey: to be better than Stardew is pretty wild.
(1:05:40) Kev: Like, oh my god.
(1:05:41) Codey: Especially because it seems like it's fairly,
(1:05:44) Codey: like I remember him saying that it's gonna have different,
(1:05:47) Codey: it's like a different vibe,
(1:05:48) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. And you know what, that's saying it's different, I think, eases a lot, right? Because it's not stardew, too. It's a different thing. And you know, so it's it's not, you know, we're apples to oranges here, right? Like, I don't know if anyone else is going to be making this comparison. I really, I feel
(1:05:49) Codey: different mechanics kind of like.
(1:06:10) Codey: I think yeah, I think that's what you hit on it apples to oranges. So I'm not going to say that this orange is a better apple than that previous apple was, you know, like, so I don't but but it's, I know he wants to do well. He doesn't want to disappoint folks, it's, it's a lot of pressure.
(1:06:21) Kev: Yeah
(1:06:26) Kev: Yeah
(1:06:29) Kev: Look I
(1:06:33) Kev: Look armchair like I hate I don't like being armchair psychologist
(1:06:38) Kev: But man every time he drops another interview he just says stuff that worries about that worries me
(1:06:43) Kev: like for this like oh maybe and
(1:06:46) Kev: It's it's a spot cuz imagine. He's the stardew guy right like
(1:06:52) Kev: Yes, a lot of visibility expectations. I get it. That's all absolutely real, but like oh
(1:06:59) Kev: My give yourself a break concern Dave you I you made stardew you think you could make a good thing
(1:07:06) Kev: You'll be okay
(1:07:08) Kev: And it's a different thing give yourself a little a little slack my dude
(1:07:14) Codey: Yeah, so I mean he said that he he's hoping he's used the word hope that it comes out in the next five years
(1:07:23) Codey: I feel like he's probably gonna do he's probably gonna shadow drop it
(1:07:26) Codey: It might be in the middle of there might be like three years or something
(1:07:29) Codey: But this is the first time I believe that he's even given hint of any typos timeline
(1:07:37) Kev: Yeah, I believe that is correct.
(1:07:38) Codey: And it was prompted. It was prompted by the by the podcast person Bobby Lee
(1:07:40) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(1:07:43) Kev: Yeah.
(1:07:44) Kev: Yeah.
(1:07:45) Kev: Specifically, the question was asked.
(1:07:47) Kev: Do you think it'll come out in the next five years?
(1:07:49) Kev: And his answer is just, "I hope so," right?
(1:07:51) Kev: So I didn't listen.
(1:07:52) Kev: That might be in a joking-ish tone.
(1:07:54) Kev: Who knows?
(1:07:55) Kev: But it is the first hint of timeline.
(1:07:58) Codey: It was in a kind of like, well, I hope so.
(1:08:00) Codey: Like, so I don't think it was,
(1:08:03) Codey: I don't think it was joking.
(1:08:04) Codey: And he, you know, Bobby Lee mentioned
(1:08:07) Codey: that it looks pretty complete like in the trailers.
(1:08:09) Codey: And his third date was like, well, yeah.
(1:08:12) Codey: And that's the point.
(1:08:13) Codey: That's the, that's what you do when you make a trailer,
(1:08:15) Codey: right, is you need to like Hollywood-ify it
(1:08:16) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(1:08:18) Codey: and make it look real good.
(1:08:19) Codey: And so, yeah, I think he was trying to set expectations
(1:08:22) Kev: Yep, yep, yep
(1:08:24) Codey: a little lower, but, but yeah, I mean, it's,
(1:08:26) Codey: Take your time, my guy.
(1:08:28) Codey: I feel like I would rather it take time than hear that you burn yourself out.
(1:08:32) Kev: Yep, it's it's fine or we're fine, right? You don't need a team cherry this
(1:08:43) Kev: You know we're talking about apples and this is
(1:08:46) Kev: Complete site and I know we're just about finished. We're just one small site tangent
(1:08:49) Kev: So it's about fruit. So I love watermelon watermelon may be my favorite fruit
(1:08:55) Kev: Oranges I love watermelon. Anyways, so I
(1:08:58) Kev: Bought or you know about a couple watermelons from the store the other day, whatever and I don't know crack one open slicing it open
(1:09:04) Kev: and shock surprise
(1:09:07) Kev: It was a yellow watermelon
(1:09:09) Kev: I mean I knew they existed like but I just had never seen one or experienced it or expected it
(1:09:16) Codey: and what did it look like instead of green on the outside or on the inside?
(1:09:16) Kev: It was yellow it was a yellow watermelon
(1:09:20) Kev: No on the inside the flesh is yellow instead of red
(1:09:24) Kev: Yeah, I knew it because I do know those yellow watermelons exist
(1:09:29) Kev: Thank you Animal Crossing, but um, I uh, I just never seen one in person
(1:09:34) Kev: I don't know how it ended up in that batch of red watermelons cuz I just the Kroger where I always go to where
(1:09:39) Kev: I get my red watermelon, but anyways, it was delicious. Yeah, yeah sidebar over
(1:09:44) Kev: I just, I found a yellow watermelon.
(1:09:46) Kev: That was exciting. That's, that's my thrilling life. That's why I like to my week.
