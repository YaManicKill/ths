## Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers and welcome to the first episode of the harvest season of 2025. My name is Al.
(0:00:38) Kev: Wow, I'm Kevin and hmm. Did you smell that new 2025 smell that New Year's? No
(0:00:46) Al: It smells very much like 2024. We are recording this episode quite early. Four weeks early,
(0:00:56) Kev: Yeah, something like that yeah, we broke a favor no
(0:00:56) Al: three weeks early three weeks early three weeks early so uh
(0:01:01) Al: so yeah who knows what the world will be like in three and a half weeks
(0:01:06) Kev: Oh, and boy!
(0:01:08) Kev: Oh, gosh, that, you know, that was a time that could have been a "haha" joke, you know, that's a serious threat these days.
(0:01:14) Al: So obviously, we will not have any news, any news that we've missed over the last two weeks
(0:01:15) Kev: Oh, no!
(0:01:24) Al: will be in the next episode. We'll probably do a news catch-up episode. But yeah, we're
(0:01:30) Kev: Yep. So, you know, very.
(0:01:31) Al: going to talk about our exciting, what we're looking forward to for this year, our most
(0:01:37) Al: anticipated games of 2025.
(0:01:40) Kev: I mean, surely, you know, chocolate, or haunted chocolatier, which undoubtedly will have the release date by this point, because we're not recording it early.
(0:01:51) Kev: But yes, no. 2025, look at-looking.
(0:01:53) Al: I mean, considering he just said that he hasn't worked on it at all in the last year,
(0:02:02) Kev: Yeah
(0:02:03) Kev: Yeah
(0:02:03) Al: basically, I don't think that's the case.
(0:02:04) Kev: Yeah
(0:02:06) Kev: Those screenshots were doctored
(0:02:09) Kev: Yeah, no probably not but uh, but hey things to look forward to 2025 because boy do we need to find those especially out here in the
(0:02:19) Al: So we're going to talk about that, but first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:02:28) Kev: Okay, so all right since we already broke
(0:02:32) Kev: All in um, I mean I've been playing a lot of the usual Marvel snap is it's very busy right now
(0:02:38) Kev: There's a lot going on Marvel snap. I'm playing on its new season
(0:02:43) Kev: I'm having fun with it
(0:02:44) Al: Of course, when this comes out, it will be nearly time for another new season.
(0:02:48) Kev: Probably actually the new season will be out but it's funny though because
(0:02:50) Al: No, because this is releasing on the 1st of January, so it will be another couple of days.
(0:02:55) Kev: You're right, you're right. Okay. Well almost yeah
(0:02:57) Kev: well the end of uh almost the end of that season well either way i'm having fun
(0:03:02) Kev: at the start of the season I can't say about future kevin who he's out of my mind probably
(0:03:07) Kev: um but um honestly that goes hand in hand with uh uh what i've really been up to uh because the
(0:03:17) Kev: marvel snap season for december is a crossover season with marvel rivals which at the time of
(0:03:24) Kev: recording just brought the kids to be here the day before yesterday it's been a little more than 24
(0:03:29) Kev: hours.
(0:03:32) Kev: It's just Overwatch, but with Marvel, it is just Overwatch, and original Overwatch,
(0:03:44) Kev: so I played Overwatch when it first came out in 2016, almost 10 years ago, which is wild,
(0:03:50) Kev: 8 years at this point I guess, and I loved Overwatch, I adored it, I played so much Overwatch,
(0:03:58) Kev: And then they basically ruined it.
(0:04:02) Kev: It was two things. I mean, even before Overwatch 2,
(0:04:06) Kev: they, the way they updated and patch things and balance things or whatever,
(0:04:14) Kev: they started gearing it very much towards like high level competitive tournament stuff or whatever.
(0:04:21) Kev: So they reworked a lot of characters and just basically they ruined a lot of it for me.
(0:04:25) Kev: It was just nowhere near as fun when I dropped out.
(0:04:30) Kev: which I can't remember.
(0:04:32) Kev: Pre-COVID I think when I finally kind of dropped it, but yeah.
(0:04:35) Kev: And then Overwatch 2 came out, which was great because they just--
(0:04:40) Kev: here's the secret, Al, it really was just more Overwatch.
(0:04:44) Kev: It was not Overwatch 2.
(0:04:46) Kev: It was just the same thing, except they made it even worse
(0:04:49) Kev: because I don't think all the characters were free.
(0:04:54) Kev: They changed it from 6v6 to 5v5 and just all sorts of nonsense.
(0:05:02) Kev: It's so-- embarrassingly so, I would say.
(0:05:06) Kev: Actually, just like the week before Rivals dropped,
(0:05:08) Kev: Overwatch 2 did a mode called Overwatch Origins or something.
(0:05:11) Kev: I don't remember.
(0:05:12) Kev: Basically, they had a mode where everything
(0:05:15) Kev: was set back to the original Overwatch cast and abilities
(0:05:19) Kev: and balances and stuff like that, which is really funny.
(0:05:22) Kev: They were trying to capture that magic again
(0:05:24) Kev: because Rivals was right around the corner.
(0:05:28) Kev: But it doesn't matter because Rivals is here
(0:05:32) Kev: and die now.
(0:05:34) Kev: So yeah, Mar--
(0:05:35) Kev: OK.
(0:05:37) Kev: First of all, Marvel Rivals, very stylistic.
(0:05:41) Kev: It's made by NetEase, a Chinese company.
(0:05:43) Kev: They have that, what I call Chinese anime aesthetic,
(0:05:47) Kev: like ancient impact and stuff.
(0:05:49) Kev: Here's this very edgy, pointy, and stylistic.
(0:05:52) Kev: I like it myself.
(0:05:55) Kev: But they also have--
(0:05:56) Kev: I counted them where, I believe, 29 characters
(0:05:59) Kev: at launch, which is insane.
(0:06:02) Kev: Then when Overwatch 1 shut down, just at launch, which is wild.
(0:06:07) Kev: So we have a good, healthy pick.
(0:06:10) Kev: I've been trying to play different characters,
(0:06:12) Kev: but there's so many of them.
(0:06:15) Kev: There's-- I mean, I like Squirrel Girl a lot.
(0:06:19) Kev: She's like the first one I picked.
(0:06:20) Kev: And I think she still might be my favorite.
(0:06:22) Kev: Penny Parker with her robot is pretty fun.
(0:06:25) Kev: Captain America is really fun.
(0:06:27) Kev: His shield just reflects everything.
(0:06:29) Kev: I just stand there and let things hit the shield.
(0:06:32) Kev: I'm contributing, yeah.
(0:06:35) Kev: Hulk is fun.
(0:06:37) Kev: Some characters are really hard.
(0:06:39) Kev: OK, so Spider-Man played just like Spider-Man
(0:06:42) Kev: from the PS4 or 5 games.
(0:06:44) Kev: He has a swing.
(0:06:45) Kev: He punches.
(0:06:46) Kev: He does the web shoot.
(0:06:47) Kev: His movement feels just like the PS5 version.
(0:06:52) Kev: But that also makes him insanely difficult
(0:06:54) Kev: because it's such a chaotic game.
(0:06:56) Kev: So you have to be very precise with Spider-Man.
(0:07:00) Kev: and you're trying to hit other, you know, actual...
(0:07:02) Kev: players and such um it's uh yeah it's it's uh it's great great fun so you've never played overwatch
(0:07:12) Al: I have not. I'm not a big first person game of any sort kind of person. Like, I'm struggling
(0:07:18) Kev: - Mm-hmm.
(0:07:19) Kev: - Okay.
(0:07:20) Al: to think of any first person game that I actively enjoyed, whether it's a shooter or anything
(0:07:22) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:07:24) Kev: - Short.
(0:07:26) Al: else. I'm not a huge fan of the perspective, because I think the thing is that you'd think,
(0:07:27) Kev: - Short.
(0:07:33) Al: oh, well, first person should be the most realistic thing, right? But the problem is
(0:07:38) Al: that your screen is not as wide as your
(0:07:42) Al: peripheral vision is so I just feel like and this happens in a lot of games
(0:07:43) Kev: Yeah, oh, that's a good point
(0:07:46) Al: with movable cameras in that I just feel almost claustrophobic is obviously
(0:07:47) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:07:51) Al: not a phobia but it's that sort of idea of like I feel hemmed in and I can't see
(0:07:52) Kev: Yeah
(0:07:54) Kev: I get it right yet
(0:07:57) Kev: It feels busy. Yeah, I totally can get that. I'm generally not a first-person shooter person either
(0:08:03) Kev: I did pick it up for overwatch and whatnot, but you know, here's here's the secret out. Here's a surprise
(0:08:09) Kev: Marvel Rivals is not first-person
(0:08:11) Al: Oh, it's not!
(0:08:13) Kev: It's it's you you hold the back third-person camera. You see your full character when playing
(0:08:19) Kev: So as you say you do have a much wider
(0:08:23) Kev: Like scope you like how much you can see at once it is my yeah
(0:08:26) Al: Oh, yeah.
(0:08:29) Kev: So the camera is is focused on you like you're always centered on it and whatnot
(0:08:35) Al: Is Overwatch like this as well?
(0:08:37) Kev: No, it is not
(0:08:38) Al: Is Overwatch first person?
(0:08:39) Kev: Overwatch is first-person. Yes, so you're not you're not
(0:08:40) Al: Okay, so I'm not so I'm not just making I'm not just making because because people are
(0:08:43) Kev: No [LAUGH] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I know, yes, because you're not crazy, no, right?
(0:08:44) Al: just saying this is just and you did this exactly.
(0:08:46) Al: It's Overwatch, but Marvel.
(0:08:48) Al: So so I'm not going crazy.
(0:08:50) Al: I was thinking if it's Overwatch like Marvel, that would mean it was first person, but it's
(0:08:54) Al: not.
(0:08:55) Al: Okay, fine.
(0:08:56) Al: I was like, have I just miss on miss remembered this game for like, what, 10 years?
(0:09:02) Al: Is that how long since the first one came out?
(0:09:04) Kev: No, yes, no, no, no, you are correct and but yeah, here's like, that's a big thing, right?
(0:09:10) Al: Not 10 years, eight years.
(0:09:11) Kev: And yeah, eight years almost ten years, but.
(0:09:13) Al: 2016 that year.
(0:09:13) Kev: Well, okay. And that's a big thing because I mean, first of all, like you said, the whole camera thing, like, yeah, I can understand. And so obviously that improves that, especially like I couldn't imagine playing that as Spider-Man, like being first person while swinging around and fly.
(0:09:31) Al: No, no, I'd feel sick.
(0:09:32) Kev: Oh my gosh. That would be insane. That would be unplayable. So it works well. They can do stuff like that, right?
(0:09:41) Kev: And furthermore, I think
(0:09:43) Kev: Because much like overwatch one of the
(0:09:50) Kev: Foundations let's say of the game the pillars is cosmetics right like different skins and emotes and so on and so forth, right?
(0:09:56) Kev: so
(0:09:57) Kev: When overwatch you get a cool skin well, you can't see it most of them
(0:10:01) Kev: You don't see it when you're actually playing the game, right? You see like the characters hand maybe but and the death camera
(0:10:06) Kev: I guess but here you can actually see your costumes the whole time when you're playing the game, which is you know, very nice
(0:10:14) Kev: And so and actually on that note
(0:10:17) Kev: monetization like they were very clear and
(0:10:21) Kev: Transparent about it. They dropped the link a blog like actually two days before the game came out
(0:10:25) Kev: we didn't actually know what it was gonna look so right then but
(0:10:29) Kev: Two things they were very adamant and clear about one the game is free to play which overwatch
(0:10:34) Kev: original was not I don't know about overwatch - but Marvel rivals is completely free to play and download and play and
(0:10:40) Kev: and furthermore, every character is free to play.
(0:10:43) Kev: Like I said, Overwatch, I believe that is not the case anymore.
(0:10:46) Kev: In Overwatch 2, you have to buy characters or whatever.
(0:10:49) Kev: But here, nope, you can pick whatever character you like.
(0:10:52) Kev: They have a Season Pass, Battle Pass thing.
(0:10:55) Kev: They have bundles that they call them,
(0:10:58) Kev: where you can buy a skin and an emote and an animation.
(0:11:01) Kev: All sorts of different things, it's all grouped up together, right?
(0:11:05) Kev: And that's how they're going to focus on the monetization.
(0:11:08) Kev: It's all going to be cosmetics, which is fantastic.
(0:11:12) Al: And so this game is free to play, and you can play all the characters, and it's in third
(0:11:13) Kev: It is free to play, yep.
(0:11:17) Kev: That's correct.
(0:11:18) Al: person, and it's characters I like.
(0:11:20) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.
(0:11:22) Al: Damn it.
(0:11:23) Kev: Yes, I did it, score.
(0:11:26) Al: And it's on Steam, presumably, so I can play it on Steam Deck.
(0:11:26) Kev: It is on Steam, PS5, and Xbox, whatever the current one is, I've lost track.
(0:11:32) Al: Is it cross-play?
(0:11:34) Kev: Okay, actually, I think they did a very fair way of approaching that.
(0:11:38) Kev: It is cross-play, if you're playing casual matches.
(0:11:41) Kev: if you're just doing quick play.
(0:11:43) Kev: It is cross play and I see that all the time if you're playing ranked.
(0:11:48) Al: what about cross save
(0:11:50) Kev: I think it is cross save.
(0:11:52) Kev: I haven't looked too hard into that but that probably should be I think so.
(0:11:53) Al: so if I want to if I want to start it on my steam deck and then go on to my ps5
(0:11:59) Al: presumably I can keep any settings I have
(0:12:01) Kev: I I yeah, I don't I don't have that hard information in front of me, but I would wager that's the case.
(0:12:10) Kev: But yeah, so if you play ranked, it's uh, yeah, I know right.
(0:12:13) Kev: They're answering all the questions correctly.
(0:12:16) Kev: If you, uh, play, um, if you play ranked, you, you just play with
(0:12:20) Kev: people on the same systems or whatever you're on, which seems fair.
(0:12:23) Kev: Yeah, that's, that's fine.
(0:12:24) Kev: Um, but you can totally play cross play with other folks on slack or whatever.
(0:12:28) Kev: Um, so yeah, all right.
(0:12:30) Kev: There you go.
(0:12:31) Kev: Al's on board.
(0:12:32) Kev: You people should try it too.
(0:12:33) Al: Oh, my word, forty seven gigabytes.
(0:12:37) Kev: It's, it's a beefy boy.
(0:12:38) Al: Oh, I literally don't have enough space on my steam deck.
(0:12:39) Kev: Um, wait, 40.
(0:12:43) Al: Forty seven, I'm seeing forty seven is what it's saying on Steam.
(0:12:43) Kev: seven? Really? Oh. Good times. Good times. Um, but yeah, it's, I can't recommend it enough.
(0:12:47) Al: Forty seven gigabytes.
(0:12:48) Al: I need to uninstall something or get a bigger SD card.
(0:12:52) Al: Because I have forty three gigabytes free.
(0:12:59) Kev: It's, it's fun. It's got lots of different styles of play. Groot builds walls. He's fun.
(0:13:06) Kev: Um, Iron Man is always flying. He's just shoots from the air. He is always lying. Like a little,
(0:13:11) Kev: I don't think he can actually run.
(0:13:14) Kev: Loki creates duplicates, so on and so forth. It's good fun.
(0:13:18) Al: this feels like a game that I'm going to stick on my PS5 and use, because I am one of those suckers
(0:13:25) Al: that has a PS Portal. So it feels like I'm going to stick it on my PS5, use my PS Portal,
(0:13:26) Kev: There you go.
(0:13:32) Al: rather than trying to fit it on my Steam tech, which is full to the brim of different games.
(0:13:38) Al: Whereas my PS5 currently, I have been playing Astro Bot on it just the last few games. They've
(0:13:45) Al: they've added some the like speed as.
(0:13:48) Al: Speed run levels, so I've been doing them and I've just about to once I've finished
(0:13:54) Al: playing Zelda, which I will have done by the time this episode comes out,
(0:13:57) Al: but I'm not going to talk about that because I'm talking about that.
(0:13:59) Al: In the second episode that I'm recording today, just a little behind the scenes.
(0:14:00) Kev: that is releasing that is releasing before this episode so you've already
(0:14:07) Al: March before, three weeks before, I will, I'm going to once I finish Zelda, I'm going to start.
(0:14:09) Kev: so you've already talked about it actually
(0:14:18) Al: Hopefully finish before the end of the year, Sonic Shadows. Sonic Shadow generations.
(0:14:24) Kev: Oh I gotta get into that too. Generations, yeah. Oh man I gotta get to that too.
(0:14:27) Al: Yeah, because you finished it, haven't you?
(0:14:29) Kev: Uh, no, I finished Sonic, uh, uh, Frontiers, the, the, the open world one.
(0:14:33) Al: Oh, I thought you said you finish it, January. I thought you said something about that.
(0:14:36) Kev: Oh, I put, uh, original, Sonic Generations, the original Sonic, mm-mm, no, no, I've not
(0:14:38) Al: No, no, no, no, no. I'm sure I saw you saying something about Shadow.
(0:14:42) Al: Did I just misread what you said?
(0:14:43) Kev: gotten, maybe, because I finished Sonic Frontiers, but not, uh, I've not touched Shadow Generations
(0:14:48) Kev: yet, um, I, I actually do have it, it is ready to open, and as soon as I...
(0:14:54) Kev: probably finish up the, well, we'll see, I don't know, because Marvel Rivals is eating
(0:14:57) Kev: my life right now, so at some point I will get to it. Um, uh, going back to, dude, I just posted,
(0:15:05) Kev: uh, in the chat here, uh, a Penny Arcade comic, you gotta see it, it's about playing Marvel
(0:15:09) Kev: Rivals on the Steam Deck, just like you were talking about, good times. Um, but yeah, that's,
(0:15:14) Kev: uh, Marvel Rivals, I'm glad I sold Al on it, sick, um, big thumbs up, I'm sure it's even better by
(0:15:21) Kev: by the time this actually comes out.
(0:15:21) Al: Oh, well, what I'm going to talk about. Obviously, I've also been playing,
(0:15:24) Kev: what do you have been up to, Al?
(0:15:26) Kev: other than
(0:15:30) Kev: yes, other than the Zelda
(0:15:32) Kev: which you've already talked about
(0:15:33) Al: yeah, I've also been playing Snap, but I think I'm kind of wrapping up on that for just now,
(0:15:39) Al: because I'm just getting a bit tired. I've been playing it every single day
(0:15:43) Al: a lot, because, I mean, you know, you've seen the leaderboard on there. I don't stop.
(0:15:47) Kev: I you you do you I play daily but yeah you curve saw me on the leaderboard
(0:15:52) Al: I would love to see, what do I play? I play it on my Mac. I don't think it has, like,
(0:15:54) Kev: every every week you do play good
(0:16:00) Al: time, amount of time you've played on that. But, like, yeah, the amount of time I put in is just
(0:16:07) Al: stupid. Like, I would be playing it for, like, what, two to three hours every single day,
(0:16:16) Kev: That's not, ha ha ha ha ha ha.
(0:16:16) Al: two to three hours minimum every single day for about six months.
(0:16:21) Kev: Ahhhhhh.
(0:16:21) Al: I think I'm rolling back on that a little bit, just because I want to play some other things,
(0:16:25) Kev: I don't, weren't you so high?
(0:16:29) Kev: Yeah, until they bring you back in.
(0:16:30) Al: and I'm just getting a little bit tired. They will, of course, because this happened last
(0:16:32) Kev: It's the ebb and flow.
(0:16:35) Al: time as well. I played it from launch for a good nine months or something like that,
(0:16:41) Al: and then I got tired again, and stopped for a while, and then got back into it six months ago.
(0:16:48) Al: I'm sure it will get me back in again, and I'm sure I'll be annoyed that I...
(0:16:51) Al: I took the break because obviously I will be so far behind with the cards, but...
(0:16:55) Kev: Well, hopefully they'll have fixed it by then.
(0:16:59) Al: We'll see. We'll see.
(0:17:00) Kev: We'll see.
(0:17:01) Kev: Probably not.
(0:17:01) Kev: It'll probably take them a minute to fix it.
(0:17:04) Al: And I've been playing Pocket as well, just my regular daily Pocket.
(0:17:09) Al: I'm managing to actually do that as an actual how people do daily games, right?
(0:17:13) Al: Of putting like 15 minutes into it a day.
(0:17:18) Al: Crazy, I know. I don't do that.
(0:17:18) Kev: I don't blame you but um well hey pocket no I would just say like I still haven't got
(0:17:19) Al: I put my entire game.
(0:17:21) Al: gaming time into a game normally when I'm playing it.
(0:17:23) Al: But the other thing I've been up to recent. Oh, sorry, are you gonna say something?
(0:17:34) Kev: into it and like I don't know something about it it just feels almost uh the more I hear
(0:17:41) Kev: about it while not playing it the weirder it sounds to me which like is very much a
(0:17:46) Kev: a me thing like I don't have all the pieces
(0:17:48) Kev: in the puzzle but it's just I don't get it I still but regardless good for you
(0:17:54) Kev: enjoy your wonder pics which I just learned what is today what's that it's
(0:17:57) Al: I enjoy it, I like collecting things, and this allows me to collect things without battling.
(0:18:09) Al: The other thing I've been up to, because I will have talked about all the other games
(0:18:13) Al: in different episodes, I'm going to talk about I have been watching the TV show Legion.
(0:18:19) Kev: Okay, I have not, but I am familiar with it. First of all, who thought of that premise?
(0:18:26) Kev: Let's make a show about Legion, the Professor X's son.
(0:18:28) Al: it's it's yeah and it's funny it's funny because um that it that's the entire link
(0:18:36) Al: to marvel stuff is legion and minor spoilers for legion but if you know anything about the
(0:18:44) Al: character this will not be a spoiler for you shadow king right that is that that's it
(0:18:48) Kev: yeah yeah I actually found out about shadow king just yesterday I don't remember how I ended up
(0:18:55) Kev: it was a wiki hole and somehow I ended up well I don't know too much about legion to be honest
(0:19:00) Kev: but shadow king showing up threw me for a loop i'll say that um I guess it makes sense because
(0:19:05) Kev: he's a telepath that's probably the entirety of it um uh I will say um shadow king actually looks
(0:19:05) Al: Yeah.
(0:19:13) Kev: decent like they did a good job with how it looks. And Aubrey Plaza is sha-
(0:19:18) Kev: I'm not okay when I read that. I was like, "Well, she's possessed." I know. Yeah.
(0:19:20) Al: she's yeah I don't want to say too much because there's some spoilers but yeah she is acting
(0:19:26) Al: shadow king for some of it yeah it is she's fantastic I mean she's fantastic and everything
(0:19:32) Al: I think I have never been disappointed by her and she does but it's like such a different character
(0:19:32) Kev: I was about to say that "yes" in everything.
(0:19:39) Al: to other characters that she's done like I know she does weird characters like that's her thing
(0:19:44) Kev: Yeah, I was about to she's not her weird because she has the you know that very blasé face and a lot of the characters
(0:19:44) Al: she does weird characters yeah no this is
(0:19:50) Kev: They run into that, right?
(0:19:50) Al: this is very much she turns up the evil rather than the weird right which is what you want from
(0:19:54) Kev: That is yeah, yeah, that's that's interesting. I can't remember the last time I saw replaza play, you know evil
(0:20:02) Al: properly evil rather than just like accidentally evil.
(0:20:03) Kev: but
(0:20:06) Kev: Yeah, oh, yeah, yes, okay. Yes, that's correct
(0:20:10) Kev: Or let's it may be malicious maybe not outright evil, but
(0:20:13) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, for sure.
(0:20:14) Kev: But yeah, but yeah like a straight evil that's that is fascinating but hey, but look
(0:20:19) Al: Straight evil and nobody said straight.
(0:20:22) Kev: Yeah
(0:20:24) Kev: She's um, I mean hey good good. She's good. She's a great actress though. Like everyone. I've seen her so I'm sure she kills it
(0:20:31) Al: Yeah, no, she absolutely does.
(0:20:32) Al: She kills, the role is fantastic, but other than, yeah, other than Legion and Shadow
(0:20:40) Al: King, every other character is like an original character for the show, which is a little
(0:20:44) Kev: Okay, what about not even Charles like cuz that's
(0:20:46) Al: bit weird.
(0:20:48) Al: He is, he's hinted at, but he's never explicitly said.
(0:20:52) Kev: Okay as about this like I I don't
(0:20:54) Kev: Okay, cuz I don't expect them on screen, but you know that's kind of a fundamental part of Legion's characters
(0:21:01) Al: So I think they can.
(0:21:02) Al: They kind of hint at the fact at some point they hint about his dad being a telepath and they have like a cartoon drawing of who is clearly Charles Xavier, obviously, but it's just like it's hinted at, he has never explicitly said.
(0:21:17) Kev: Okay
(0:21:20) Al: said.
(0:21:21) Kev: Okay, so okay
(0:21:24) Kev: Two questions one do they ever I'm assuming they don't have the really stupid Legion here that you see in the comics
(0:21:31) Kev: But do they ever make a joke about it?
(0:21:32) Al: No, I haven't, I haven't noticed anything I like that he has.
(0:21:33) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:36) Kev: Okay, darn it
(0:21:36) Al: I mean, his hair is kind of, yeah, I mean, it kind of sticks up in some way,
(0:21:41) Kev: It's vertical
(0:21:42) Al: but it's not, yeah, it's not as tall.
(0:21:44) Al: It's nowhere near, it's like, it looks like a normal, like a possible
(0:21:47) Kev: Okay, it's a plausible hairstyle, okay
(0:21:48) Al: realistic hairstyle that is an homage to it, I think they do.
(0:21:51) Kev: Okay, so they translated it. Okay. I see. All right. Okay, because yeah, his comics hair is ridiculous. It's like taller than his head
(0:21:57) Al: Yeah.
(0:21:59) Al: Yeah.
(0:22:02) Kev: Okay, the other question
(0:22:04) Kev: how is the
(0:22:06) Kev: Multiple personality stuff done right because the bar is now set at moonlight, right? How is how do
(0:22:11) Al: So, the interesting thing, so I'm finished season two, and I've got one season left to
(0:22:17) Al: go, the up until the end of season two, they don't touch on the multiple personalities
(0:22:26) Al: very much.
(0:22:26) Kev: What?
(0:22:26) Al: Obviously, they'd know, let me finish, let me finish, because up until that point, he's
(0:22:33) Al: almost, he's not quite sure of what his deal is, right?
(0:22:41) Al: He starts off the series being diagnosed with schizophrenia in a mental hospital, and then
(0:22:48) Al: gets out of the hospital and is like, "Oh, I wasn't mentally ill, I was just a powerful
(0:22:53) Al: mutant and people didn't understand that."
(0:22:57) Al: And by the end of season two, they're like, "No, no, you're not, it's not that you're
(0:23:02) Al: not mentally ill, it's that you're both."
(0:23:06) Al: So that's how they finish the second season.
(0:23:09) Kev: OK.
(0:23:11) Al: Up until the last episode of season two, they've done a thing where he's got voices
(0:23:19) Al: talking to him, but until the last episode of season two, they don't do explicitly his
(0:23:25) Al: different personalities talking to each other.
(0:23:28) Kev: Okay. Well, yeah, towards. Yeah. Okay.
(0:23:28) Al: So they've not done that very much.
(0:23:32) Al: With Moon Knight, his personalities don't talk to each other, right?
(0:23:36) Al: that is dissociative. And I know that I know that legions meant to be dissociative.
(0:23:41) Al: But they do seem to be talking to each other, which is interesting.
(0:23:46) Al: So it's very different from how "Moonlight" works.
(0:23:51) Al: And this is probably one of these things where this is not at all what it's like in real life,
(0:23:54) Al: and I understand that, I'm not trying to say.
(0:23:55) Kev: oh yeah oh yeah for sure like I have even less expectations of legion in that end because legion
(0:24:03) Kev: is so over the top with everything he's got going on so yeah okay so uh-huh okay
(0:24:06) Al: It's, yeah, it's very much more towards schizophrenia rather than DID, because it's like, it's framed
(0:24:16) Al: as voices talking to him in his head, and he talks back to them. And then, yeah, so
(0:24:21) Al: are we interested to see what they do in season three with it? Because he's now kind of like
(0:24:26) Al: realized this and like, everybody else realizes it. And he's kind of like moving towards a
(0:24:30) Al: kind of almost villain arc, but it will be interesting to see where they take that because
(0:24:34) Kev: Ah.
(0:24:35) Al: 'cause obviously he's a complicated--
(0:24:37) Al: --character who, you know, yeah.
(0:24:37) Kev: Whoops.
(0:24:38) Kev: Oh, just a little.
(0:24:41) Al: So it'll be interesting to see where they end up, but I've enjoyed it so far.
(0:24:41) Kev: Just a little.
(0:24:43) Kev: OK.
(0:24:45) Kev: Well, that's great.
(0:24:45) Al: But yeah, it's been very weird.
(0:24:46) Al: It's like there's a character that's clearly meant to be kind of like rogue,
(0:24:52) Al: but not really, in that if she touches someone, she swaps bodies with them.
(0:24:54) Kev: Mmm
(0:24:58) Kev: Her name is bros not rogue
(0:25:01) Al: No, it's not.
(0:25:02) Al: It's Sydney.
(0:25:02) Al: But no, instead of like stealing someone's power, she literally swaps bodies.
(0:25:03) Kev: Okay
(0:25:05) Kev: Yeah, that's that's pretty cool
(0:25:06) Al: With them is interesting, and they've very much gone in a dark way with this, rather like, you know, there's a like, we go into her, her childhood and there's some like really not great moments where she realizes she can do this and.
(0:25:21) Kev: No, I'm sure. Oh, oh gosh. There's a lot of bad places you can go with that. Oh, that's not great. Oh
(0:25:28) Al: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not going to talk about them on the podcast, but I mean, I might, if you're if you're not going to watch it, I might tell you one of them after the podcast because it.
(0:25:32) Kev: Sure, but
(0:25:36) Kev: Dude I can already take a guess but do tell like mmm
(0:25:37) Al: I don't think that particularly got me.
(0:25:40) Al: After the podcast.
(0:25:40) Kev: Y'all you could you can yeah there is room to work with there. Absolutely
(0:25:46) Al: But yeah, so everyone else, including her are like, as far as I can tell, unique characters, because I was like, I don't recognize these characters and I went on to Wikipedia and they're not like.
(0:25:58) Al: Legion is linked as the Marvel Legion, and then obviously Shadow King is linked as Shadow King, the Marvel Shadow King and all the other ones, they're just.
(0:26:02) Kev: Yeah, no.
(0:26:06) Al: So and so, as this character name, and there's no like link to a Marvel equivalent for them, so I'm assuming they're all original characters.
(0:26:12) Kev: Uh-huh
(0:26:15) Kev: Sure, sure. Okay. Okay. Well
(0:26:17) Al: They also have Jermaine Clement. I don't know if you know who I who I'm talking about.
(0:26:21) Kev: That name sounds familiar, let me see. Ah, okay, okay
(0:26:22) Al: He was a flight, one of the flight of the concords. No flight of the concords? Yeah, he's excellent in it as well. So yeah, no, it's very good. I'm enjoying it and I'm looking forward to season three.
(0:26:36) Al: But I'm still finished by the time you hear this episode because I'm going to watch it this week. I've only got eight episodes left to go.
(0:26:42) Kev: it is it's such a fascinating thing right because he's I mean Legion is he is a
(0:26:50) Kev: character of some note but not like you know he's not an A-lister to name in the
(0:26:57) Kev: Marvel verse let's say that right but here they are making a spin a show
(0:27:04) Kev: entirely centered or out to him without any of the other Marvel connections so
(0:27:09) Kev: So when you hear that, it's such an interesting practice.
(0:27:12) Kev: It's very cool that they managed to do good with it.
(0:27:14) Kev: I have heard good things about it.
(0:27:18) Al: Maybe. Yeah, so that's mostly what I've been up to that I haven't talked about on other episodes.
(0:27:26) Kev: All right, cool
(0:27:27) Al: Shall we talk about what games we are most looking forward to in 2025?
(0:27:34) Kev: "Wildflowers 2" which might be announced by the time this comes out.
(0:27:38) Kev: I don't know.
(0:27:39) Al: Oh yeah, they've hinted at something coming, haven't they?
(0:27:42) Kev: Yeah, I think it's coming out.
(0:27:44) Kev: So I don't remember any dates or anything, but that may actually be announced by the
(0:27:49) Kev: time this comes out.
(0:27:50) Al: Yeah, so I know.
(0:27:51) Kev: That may not be a joke.
(0:27:53) Al: I know that so I I sent you a link, didn't I?
(0:27:56) Al: Yes, here it was.
(0:27:57) Al: So they're announcing something in the wholesome snack,
(0:28:00) Al: which as we're recording, it's happening in three days.
(0:28:04) Kev: Oh, great. Wildflowers 2 is going to be announced in three days, and I'm not for--
(0:28:05) Al: So.
(0:28:09) Kev: I can't confirm it, because I don't actually know at the time of the recording.
(0:28:14) Al: Like, have they hinted towards there being a Wildflowers, too, and it's not just
(0:28:17) Kev: No, okay. That's me just being hyperbolic. I don't know, but it's Drydock Studios.
(0:28:22) Kev: It's from their account, isn't it? The Wildflowers account, so...
(0:28:26) Kev: I don't know. Who knows? It could be. That would be my hope, of course. Maybe with a different art
(0:28:31) Kev: style but you never know um who knows what it'll be
(0:28:35) Kev: um i've got my eye on it though for sure though so we'll see
(0:28:37) Al: You'll play whatever they make, basically, is what you're saying.
(0:28:41) Kev: yeah basically
(0:28:44) Al: OK, cool. So we're going to go through. We've each got a list, presumably.
(0:28:48) Al: I can't see Kevin's list, but presumably we both have a list.
(0:28:52) Al: I think what we've previously done is talk through one each.
(0:28:59) Al: I just kind of go alternately and we'll talk through our opinions on why we're looking
(0:29:05) Al: looking forward to it, et cetera.
(0:29:10) Kev: I am where I cannot find my list I do right if you have a big you had a big list on you
(0:29:15) Kev: Where is it? Uh, hold on. Let me see. I'm trying to remember here. You need to go on in slack
(0:29:22) Al: I don't think I've posted a big long list of what's coming out, but it should be on if you look on the notion, there's a big long list.
(0:29:23) Kev: You did yeah
(0:29:34) Kev: Um, oh, here it is. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Sorry. Okay. Yeah, I could not find it. Um, but alright, let's uh, let's um, yeah. Alright, you start it.
(0:29:46) Al: All right, so my first one, and I feel like this has been on my list so many times, but
(0:29:52) Al: that's because I still haven't properly played it. And that is Snacko because obviously Snacko
(0:29:58) Al: is in early access. I haven't played it yet because it's been so busy. I think when it
(0:30:04) Al: came out last year was a really bad time because it's December and I'm not going to play a
(0:30:08) Al: brand new farming game in December because I'm already like out of it. But.
(0:30:16) Al: At some point this year, Snacko will release 1.0 unless something goes seriously wrong.
(0:30:23) Al: Like they've posted their updated roadmap and it has four updates on it. And it sounds
(0:30:29) Al: like they're expecting that to be done kind of reasonably early next year. So I would
(0:30:33) Al: be very surprised if Snacko 1.0 doesn't come out. So I think that's probably the thing
(0:30:37) Al: I'm most looking forward to.
(0:30:38) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:30:42) Kev: All right, yeah, no, that's fair like I
(0:30:45) Kev: snako isn't on my radar, but like I
(0:30:49) Kev: this is one of those I've talked, you know ad nauseam like
(0:30:53) Kev: Games that are in early access forever and then they get the 1.0 release like it's uh
(0:30:59) Kev: It's I don't know something almost perplexing unless they have a send some games do do it. We're like a massive
(0:31:06) Kev: Addition or patch change, right?
(0:31:09) Kev: To list the features to 1.0
(0:31:12) Kev: But you know, we'll see if it can't drop. Hopefully it will drop
(0:31:15) Kev: Um, I will say the art style still looks great. I will say that right like the pixel cap, but everything else is 3d
(0:31:22) Al: Yeah
(0:31:22) Kev: um
(0:31:23) Al: They've they've done a lot of work as well
(0:31:26) Al: So I've seen some recent screenshots and some screenshots from like when they first announced it and they've they've improved the graphics
(0:31:34) Al: A huge amount while still feeling like it's the same style, which is really impressive
(0:31:40) Al: And it's just I think the thing about snako is I have been talking about this game since we started the podcast. I'm pretty sure
(0:31:46) Kev: Oh, that sounds about right.
(0:31:48) Al: So, you know to to go that long
(0:31:52) Al: I can't even remember how long is it is this is this the end of year six or is this the end of you?
(0:31:57) Al: I think it's the end of year six in January. It will be six years of the podcast. So
(0:32:02) Al: Yeah, just the idea of you know, I've been talking about this game for that long
(0:32:07) Al: And I'm super excited to to finally properly played it. Obviously I played a
(0:32:12) Al: demo
(0:32:13) Al: Years ago now, but it's obviously changed a huge amount since then
(0:32:16) Kev: Yeah, that will be cool. Once it hits 1.0. I will say heck maybe even I'll get on board at that point. I don't know
(0:32:26) Kev: But yeah, it's uh
(0:32:28) Kev: That's good. Can you imagine that the finally that since it's you finally get into it
(0:32:35) Kev: I mean everything talking about it for this many years and finally we get 1.0 and you play the game proper
(0:32:42) Kev: But yeah, all right, I'll
(0:32:45) Kev: I'll, I'll take the baton.
(0:32:46) Kev: Um, my first pick, um, kind of like, I just talked about Snacko, but this is a similar boat where the game is already out, but I haven't gotten to it.
(0:32:58) Kev: And more importantly, it's going to be the console release of Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
(0:33:02) Kev: Um, ah, well, there you go.
(0:33:02) Al: Ah that's on my list as well. This I'm so excited for because yeah I really liked the game in
(0:33:12) Al: general but I hated playing it on my iPad so I was like I played it as much as I needed to
(0:33:18) Al: for the episode and went I will play this when it's on something else because it is such a good
(0:33:25) Al: game it is such it looks great it feels great everything about it is great I just did not want
(0:33:31) Al: to do it on a touch screen!
(0:33:32) Kev: It looks like it looks I know I say this knowing Hello Kitty is like one of the biggest franchises in the world just
(0:33:43) Kev: monetary wise right but it looks so much better than what I expect it to be right because I'm not saying Hello Kitty is isn't like it
(0:33:52) Kev: doesn't do quality stuff but it just does so much stuff right like it's so everywhere that I'm just I don't know and I don't
(0:34:00) Kev: expect, you know, super high
(0:34:02) Kev: highs, let's say that, right? But this looks incredible. Just everything going on. Like the
(0:34:08) Kev: writing, you write minecarts in this game, it's wild! And finding the Gudetama's hidden around,
(0:34:15) Kev: oh my, it just sounds incredible. And like, just the massive list of Sanrio characters.
(0:34:24) Kev: Yeah, no, this, this, like ever since the, you guys talked about it on that one episode, I've been so
(0:34:28) Kev: hype for it. You and Maddy talk about it.
(0:34:32) Kev: This is probably number one, just because I mean, of course, like we know what it is more or less, right? It's come out.
(0:34:39) Kev: We know I know what to expect. So that's probably why out of all the names here, it is the one I'm most looking forward to, I would say.
(0:34:46) Al: Yeah, I wonder, here's a question for you.
(0:34:47) Kev: Yeah, good stuff. Yeah.
(0:34:49) Al: Do you think this will be a Switch 2 launch title?
(0:34:57) Al: So as of just now, we just know 2025 for Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
(0:35:02) Al: We don't know when in 2025 and also we're expecting the Switch 2 to be released in
(0:35:10) Al: 2025 and it was announced that it was coming to Switch.
(0:35:17) Al: Or it was announced that it was coming to anything else
(0:35:20) Kev: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:35:21) Al: in a Nintendo Direct, you know, in 2024 this year, June 2024.
(0:35:29) Al: You know for a fact that if the Switch 2 is coming out next year,
(0:35:33) Al: there are developers that have a version to build against an SDK, right?
(0:35:40) Al: You know for a fact that there are games
(0:35:41) Al: companies that have that because there's no way they would release the game
(0:35:46) Al: Switch exclusives and this feels like it could be something, right?
(0:35:51) Al: Like, do you know?
(0:35:52) Kev: fact that it's already have you know it's already out right it's it's just a port as opposed to ground-up game doesn't make it a
(0:35:58) Al: Exactly, yeah.
(0:35:59) Kev: Lot more likely um I I don't know how strong lead field I'll say it's greater than 50% chance. It'll be a launch title
(0:36:06) Al: It's the fact that we still don't--it's been six months, and we still don't know when it's
(0:36:08) Kev: You know I don't know
(0:36:12) Al: coming out next year, you know? And there were many--like, the general assumption is
(0:36:13) Kev: Yeah, you know what that's that's fair um
(0:36:16) Kev: Umm...
(0:36:22) Al: that the Switch 2 release announcement was delayed from September. So June to September
(0:36:30) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
(0:36:31) Al: could be a sort of expected timeline between announcement and date. Don't know.
(0:36:54) Al: Yeah, it will be backwards compatible, but I will say, and this is the thing that people
(0:36:58) Al: keep getting wrong, backwards compatible does not mean it will run better on the Switch
(0:37:02) Al: 2, necessarily. That's not how these things work, right?
(0:37:04) Kev: No, you're right, I'm not saying, you know what, that's a good point.
(0:37:10) Kev: Yeah, no, you're right.
(0:37:10) Al: So if they make, because it's the same thing with PS4 versions on a PS5, do not run better
(0:37:16) Al: than on a PS4. Well, not better than a PS4 Pro. They do run better than a PS4, but they
(0:37:21) Al: don't run better than a PS4 Pro
(0:37:24) Al: They're not compiled for the PS5, they're compiled for the PS4 and PS4 Pro
(0:37:29) Al: and then they also work on the PS5 and so like when we got, I remember when I first got a PS5
(0:37:36) Al: Fall Guys was just the PS4 version and then like a year later they released the PS5 version and it
(0:37:39) Kev: yeah
(0:37:43) Kev: um really oh wow I didn't try on the ps5 i'll have to try that
(0:37:48) Kev: um
(0:37:48) Al: With your ps5 that's just sitting in the corner
(0:37:51) Kev: that's cool look ps5 was my zen the zone zero machine
(0:37:56) Al: Would you have a ps5? Oh, I didn't know that fair enough
(0:37:57) Kev: it was stupid oh yeah I do
(0:38:01) Kev: yeah yeah yeah I like I use it it's not just even the ps5 like in general my playstation or
(0:38:08) Kev: or non-Nintendo consoles are--
(0:38:09) Kev: get used just from a handful of games, right?
(0:38:11) Al: >> Yeah.
(0:38:11) Kev: Like, they're games, I want them, right?
(0:38:12) Al: Same.
(0:38:14) Kev: Like, it's my Street Fighter machine,
(0:38:16) Kev: it's my Send the Zone Zero machine.
(0:38:18) Kev: Now my Mar-- well, actually, no,
(0:38:19) Kev: I'm not even playing Marvel,
(0:38:20) Kev: I'm playing Marvel, I was on Steam,
(0:38:21) Kev: Calvin got the--
(0:38:23) Kev: 'cause Calvin was a big Overwatch fan, too,
(0:38:25) Kev: so we're both hyped about it,
(0:38:26) Kev: so I was like, okay, you know what?
(0:38:27) Kev: I have a computer that can run it,
(0:38:29) Kev: I'll run Marvel, I was on Steam,
(0:38:31) Kev: you play on the PlayStation,
(0:38:32) Kev: and that's how we split it up.
(0:38:33) Kev: But anyways, but there's another--
(0:38:36) Kev: yeah, Fall Guys, right?
(0:38:40) Kev: I probably won't try it, actually,
(0:38:41) Kev: 'cause I don't have too much other stuff.
(0:38:44) Al: I still love fall guys. It's great. I don't play as much as I used to, but I still, it's
(0:38:46) Kev: Oh, yeah, Fall Guys is excellent,
(0:38:48) Al: a good fun, good. They they've been adding, they've been adding loads of great, uh, what's
(0:38:49) Kev: like, there is no denying that,
(0:38:51) Kev: they knocked that out of the park.
(0:38:52) Kev: I wonder how far it's come.
(0:38:53) Kev: Oh, now I'm curious, maybe I will.
(0:38:58) Al: the word I'm looking for? Um, skins. And I really like how they've been doing the skins
(0:39:04) Al: in that you can quite often get a lot of skins for free. Um, so there's, there's a, they
(0:39:09) Al: They have a, okay, okay, here's what I really love about what they've been doing.
(0:39:14) Al: They have a premium pass, or what do you call it, a ladder, or whatever it is you
(0:39:20) Al: call it.
(0:39:21) Al: I can't never remember the terminology these games use.
(0:39:24) Al: The battle pass, yeah, sure.
(0:39:24) Kev: Battle pass, season pass, I don't know.
(0:39:26) Kev: Yeah.
(0:39:26) Al: Season pass.
(0:39:27) Al: There we go.
(0:39:28) Al: Season pass.
(0:39:29) Al: They've got a season pass.
(0:39:30) Al: But the season pass gives you back the currency that you use to buy the season pass.
(0:39:38) Kev: Okay
(0:39:38) Al: So if you reach level 40 in the season pass, you have a sentry.
(0:39:42) Kev: Yeah
(0:39:44) Al: Eventually, refunded your season pass.
(0:39:47) Kev: You have the next one free which is always great, yeah
(0:39:48) Al: Exactly, so if you're playing it regularly, you can get so much stuff without actually
(0:39:55) Al: having to pay except that first payment, which is really good.
(0:39:58) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:40:00) Al: And they have like a whole bunch of bundles where it's like, here's a bunch of skins and
(0:40:03) Al: the currency that you use to buy the battle pass.
(0:40:04) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:40:06) Al: So I think, obviously, it still is shoving these things in your face a lot and there's
(0:40:11) Al: a lot of stuff you can't get without paying.
(0:40:14) Kev: Yeah.
(0:40:14) Al: You're exclusive to pay money, pay 20 quid, and you'll get these skins, but that's fine.
(0:40:20) Al: It's skins.
(0:40:21) Al: Who cares?
(0:40:22) Al: You know.
(0:40:24) Kev: yeah yeah yeah exactly right at the end of the day even if you don't care like the game's
(0:40:27) Kev: free and you can still play and it's entertaining on its own right absolutely um yeah no um so so
(0:40:29) Al: Exactly, but my other point about Hello Kitty is they are releasing on PS4 and PS5, they've
(0:40:35) Kev: there you go fall guys one of my most anticipated 2020
(0:40:44) Al: exclusively said that, so it's not like they aren't known to release on two generations
(0:40:48) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's great. Oh, so there you go. Maybe we'll get
(0:40:49) Al: of the same console at the same time.
(0:40:56) Kev: That's switch to version after all then the ounces
(0:41:00) Al: we're getting close to the point where we're going to know when the switch is coming out and we're
(0:41:04) Al: going to get the first indications of what the launch titles are. Obviously there will be some
(0:41:10) Al: Nintendo stuff but there's going to be some third-party stuff as well and I would not be surprised if
(0:41:15) Al: this is one of them. All right my second one, I guess, I mean my third one was Hello Kitty
(0:41:16) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, you know, yeah, I could see it. Um, okay. Okay, go ahead. Yeah.
(0:41:27) Al: island adventure as well. So how many more do you have?
(0:41:28) Kev: All right. Oh, god. I, wait, how many do you have? I'll just try to match you, because I'm, I'm...
(0:41:30) Al: For organizing this. I have four in total, but that included Hello Kitty. But if you have four.
(0:41:38) Kev: Oh, oh, well, I could probably go, I could probably do...
(0:41:42) Kev: We'll see. I'll see. I'm going down the list. Just double check again.
(0:41:44) Al: You do another one, do another one now, then because I've just
(0:41:47) Kev: Okay. All right. Well, first of all, stop the presses. Sorry, as I've been double checking all these things, I've been in double checking trailers.
(0:41:47) Al: done alligator as well. So what's your, what's your next one?
(0:41:56) Kev: There's Professor Layton got an out. This is neither here nor there. This might be for the greenhouse. This is Professor Layton. Oh, my gosh. Anyways, okay.
(0:42:05) Kev: Okay, here's one. I'm going to say this not because I
(0:42:13) Kev: I might not play it, but I'm just so...
(0:42:16) Kev: ...curious about it?
(0:42:19) Kev: Uh, WANDERSTOP?
(0:42:21) Kev: Because that's the one by the Stanley Parable guy, right?
(0:42:25) Kev: And it's, like, such a wild departure from that.
(0:42:30) Kev: I'm... I just wonder what it's gonna look like, right?
(0:42:33) Kev: And, like, we have a trailer, and the game looks fine and whatnot.
(0:42:36) Kev: Um, it just looks like a straight, you know, straight-shooting, cozy-type game.
(0:42:41) Kev: But, um, so, you know, I don't know if it's gonna bring anything super new, but...
(0:42:46) Kev: Just the history of that developer really has me wondering what that's gonna look like.
(0:42:50) Kev: Because I'm not expecting there to be some weird Stanley Parable-esque twist,
(0:42:57) Kev: but at the same time, I don't know, maybe?
(0:43:00) Al: I don't expect it to be like a meta-commentary on games the way that Stanley Parable was,
(0:43:01) Kev: Like...
(0:43:05) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:43:06) Al: but I will say that it's describing itself as a narrative-centric cosy game about change and T.
(0:43:12) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:43:13) Al: I feel like it's going to do something interesting, and that's not going to be a really boring story.
(0:43:16) Kev: >> Yeah, it might.
(0:43:21) Al: It's going to be hard-hitting in some kind of way, like I don't think they would make it
(0:43:26) Al: just to make a cosy game. I wouldn't be surprised if it was...
(0:43:30) Al: Maybe a meta-commentary on coziness or something like that, you know, like I could see them
(0:43:36) Al: like completely appending what you would expect from a cosy game.
(0:43:40) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I I could see that absolutely
(0:43:45) Kev: Yeah, so you know like I don't know if I will get to it
(0:43:49) Kev: Maybe it drops out and it's amazing, but it certainly has grabbed my attention. I'll say that
(0:43:53) Kev: that.
(0:43:54) Al: it will, even if you don't play it, you'll find out a lot about it because this is going
(0:43:58) Al: to be talked about. You know, like the same way that the Stanley Parable was talked about
(0:44:00) Kev: Oh, oh, absolutely, right? Like, oh, I'm sure, right. I mean, just having that pedigree alone, like, it's gonna get talked about, absolutely.
(0:44:14) Al: I just noticed the music is done by C418, the guy who did Minecraft music.
(0:44:18) Kev: Oh, what?
(0:44:20) Kev: Minecraft guy, yeah. Oh, I'm like, ooh. Ooh, that's, that's strong. That's good music. Oh.
(0:44:20) Al: >> Yeah.
(0:44:26) Kev: Um, alright, well, that was an honorable mention, but here, let me, uh, let me-
(0:44:30) Kev: I can actually throw one. I probably will play, um, "Tales of Sekyu"? I think that's how you pronounce it.
(0:44:36) Al: say yeah I can I who knows yeah
(0:44:38) Kev: I think so. Um, okay.
(0:44:44) Kev: Uh, so there is, um, so it is a, you know, it's-
(0:44:50) Kev: What's the premise? It's- it's farming, but it's yokai.
(0:44:51) Al: Jokai. Farming, but Jokai, yep. That's a perfect explanation of it, really.
(0:44:54) Kev: Farming but yokai, right? So, that is what it is, right?
(0:44:59) Al: Do you need to say any more? That's it.
(0:45:01) Kev: Yeah, yeah. Okay, first of all, the art style is- we're looking full 3D, and it's not, like, super cutesy. It's a little more, uh,
(0:45:12) Kev: realistically proportioned, let's say that, right? Like, we got full proportioned humans and s- characters.
(0:45:18) Kev: Um, you transform into yokai to do farming tasks. You turn into a slime thing to water your crops.
(0:45:24) Kev: You can fly around as a bird, and yeah, I don't know. There's a lot going on here. Um,
(0:45:30) Al: Can I can I say that I feel like it looks like Sakuna, is that
(0:45:30) Kev: it- I was about to- if you look at the trailer, there's a blacksmith, and there's an otter guy, and he looks
(0:45:40) Kev: just like, um, I forget his name, whatever, the guy from, uh, Sakuna. Yes, I- I can totally get it.
(0:45:44) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you got a type of game by any chance?
(0:45:49) Kev: Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, you're not wrong. Um, yeah, I mean, it is- because I- it's-
(0:45:59) Kev: It's not a coincidence, right?
(0:46:00) Kev: They're both leaning into the very traditional Japanese folklore-esque roots and whatnot, right?
(0:46:08) Kev: So that's what they're going for.
(0:46:10) Kev: But, honestly, it's the fact that you can transform into the yokai that's really selling me on it, right?
(0:46:16) Kev: Like, you don't water a king, you transform into a little slime ball to water the crops.
(0:46:22) Kev: I'm curious to see what else they can do with that.
(0:46:24) Kev: That, I think, has really piqued my curiosity.
(0:46:27) Al: Yeah, it looks really smooth as well like the the transforming into the you're the flying one to
(0:46:30) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:46:32) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:46:34) Al: To fly to move like Luke's really fun
(0:46:37) Al: I suspect that's the sort of thing that you're gonna have to build up to you're not gonna immediately be able to transfer
(0:46:38) Kev: Yeah.
(0:46:42) Kev: Oh, for sure.
(0:46:43) Al: Tran transform into all these you okay, but I just I feel like building up to that will be fine
(0:46:44) Kev: Oh, yeah, you gotta collect 'em.
(0:46:49) Al: And and it will be I think I hope the movement feels fun like that
(0:46:55) Kev: Yeah. No, I agree. Um, yeah, so that that's and like, I think it does look nice like it's not heavy stylistic like other ones and maybe that's why it sticks out. It almost reminds you of like an Atlas game how it looks kinda.
(0:47:09) Kev: Um, so yeah, I don't know. Yeah, there you go. Tales will take you. We got it slated for next year, but that's all.
(0:47:16) Al: Yep. My next one, which I don't know if it's on your list, but you'll probably be looking
(0:47:23) Al: forward to is Super Zoo Story.
(0:47:25) Kev: I was actually on my list, of course, I mean, you know after let's build a zoo
(0:47:30) Al: I may have reordered my list so I could say this one so you couldn't steal it from me.
(0:47:34) Kev: Yeah, I
(0:47:36) Kev: Don't blame you. I mean like it's farming but zoo right instead of Yoka
(0:47:45) Kev: Like it's not just
(0:47:48) Kev: So zoo let's build a zoo was just zoo tycoon type game, right?
(0:47:52) Kev: This is more Stardew-esque, where you're running--
(0:47:55) Kev: We're running around actually taking care of the animals and such, and there's villagers, and I think they said there's romance, because you have to apparently, and you're farming.
(0:48:04) Kev: Um, but it's still centered on zoo animals and stuff, so like, I like animals, so you know, that's a big one for me. What can I say?
(0:48:12) Al: That's my that's my thing like I really wanted to like let's build a zoo, but I don't I've mentioned it before I just not a huge
(0:48:19) Al: fan of
(0:48:21) Al: management Sims and so this feels like the perfect balance of you know running a zoo, but it's also
(0:48:28) Al: You know you're playing as a character, so
(0:48:31) Al: Presumably it'll feel much less
(0:48:34) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah, hopefully, right? Like, I agree, right? Because the problem with management type
(0:48:42) Kev: games, it's once the scale gets big, it's really hard. Like, there's so much you have to do and
(0:48:46) Kev: whatnot, right? And here, if they're, you know, you have to run around and actually fill the trough
(0:48:52) Kev: and stuff, like, hopefully, they're going to dial that back down or give you automation or systems
(0:48:57) Kev: to make that manageable because there's a lot going on in these trailers, right? There's, you used to, yeah.
(0:48:59) Al: That's the key. Yeah, that's the key to me. If there's good automation, it will be a fantastic
(0:49:04) Kev: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you'd hope so, right? Because there's a lot that, like I said, there's full-on
(0:49:05) Al: game. If there's not, I will be so frustrated. So that's my one thing that I'm hesitant about,
(0:49:10) Al: is like, are they going to do the automation?
(0:49:18) Kev: farming systems here, right? Like, there's bug catching, it looks like, and all sorts of other
(0:49:23) Kev: stuff. Hey, there's a Caffee Bear. But, I'd miss that in PlayStation.
(0:49:27) Al: Of course, there was a capybara in Tales of Sakeu as well.
(0:49:31) Al: I don't know if you noticed that.
(0:49:34) Kev: Um, there you go. There you go. I mean, yeah, it's a pretty easy way to win us. So, um, yeah, so there we
(0:49:35) Al: If in doubt, capybara.
(0:49:44) Kev: go. Um, that's, uh, that's a good one. Yeah. Yep, I agree fully. Um, all right, so, so I'm just looking
(0:49:48) Al: Yep, I'm really, I'm really looking forward to it. I hope
(0:49:50) Al: it's gonna be, hope it's gonna be good.
(0:49:57) Kev: down the list and, like, so many are TBA, right, that I'm interested in, but, um, but.
(0:50:02) Al: I know, I know, I know. I'm trying to limit it to ones that have at least hinted that
(0:50:04) Kev: Yeah. Yep, absolutely. Um.
(0:50:07) Al: they're going to be next year. Because there's still so many of those on that list, right?
(0:50:15) Al: We still have like 25, 30 games that say they're coming out next year.
(0:50:20) Kev: I mean like I'll say Southfield is going to be the number one most
(0:50:24) Kev: I look forward to give every year until it comes out.
(0:50:28) Al: Yeah. I feel like, did they just announce something?
(0:50:29) Kev: That's that's the one for me.
(0:50:34) Al: No, they've not announced when their early access is coming out again yet.
(0:50:38) Al: It's been six months and we've not got...
(0:50:42) Kev: Yeah, no
(0:50:44) Kev: Here's
(0:50:49) Kev: But yeah, no, that's good. Um, let's see here. I'm trying to
(0:50:55) Kev: Out of the other ones. I've seen go ahead if you've got another one. Yes
(0:50:56) Al: Well, I've I've got another one that I just remembered about Starbirds.
(0:51:02) Al: So this is it's a game that is being made in conjunction with Kurskizat.
(0:51:08) Al: I don't know if you know them.
(0:51:09) Al: They're a YouTube channel that focus on science education.
(0:51:12) Kev: - I don't think so, no.
(0:51:16) Kev: - Oh, okay, oh, that's cool.
(0:51:17) Al: They're really cool and they've got a very
(0:51:19) Al: distinctive art style in their videos, and so this game uses that art style.
(0:51:24) Al: And it's a B.
(0:51:26) Al: An asteroid based building resource management game.
(0:51:30) Al: So it's a little bit management game
(0:51:32) Al: style, but I feel like it's less big and stressful and it's more like focusing
(0:51:38) Al: on a small asteroid at a time, which I feel like will pull that back and and
(0:51:42) Al: make me enjoy it more.
(0:51:44) Al: But yeah, I really like the look of it.
(0:51:46) Al: I think it's
(0:51:48) Al: I suspect it's going to be doing some science education.
(0:51:52) Al: You sort of stuff inside of it, right?
(0:51:53) Al: Like I don't think Kurzgesagt will just go, "Let's make--"
(0:51:56) Al: No, we're like, "Let's make a game that does what we care about," which is science education.
(0:51:58) Kev: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, look, I've already seen, like, on the trailer, you can see you're
(0:52:06) Kev: just loading up a planet with circuits and solar panels and stuff, so absolutely they're
(0:52:14) Kev: leaning into the science-y aspect of it. Yeah, I love this art style, it is very cute, and
(0:52:20) Kev: the 3D look of it, it's great. Yeah, that's a good one. I, you know, yeah, I'm looking
(0:52:26) Kev: for early so it's going to
(0:52:28) Kev: get early access in 2025 they're saying so you know definitely keep my out for that one
(0:52:34) Kev: all right I think you you still have one more you said right now I think okay really because I i mean
(0:52:38) Al: I have one more to mention. It's not a big one, but yeah.
(0:52:43) Kev: is it not the one i'm thinking of because I feel I thought that would be the the the finisher for us
(0:52:48) Al: I don't know. Go for it. Tell me.
(0:52:49) Kev: uh I mean are we not going to talk about tales of the shire
(0:52:52) Al: No. I'm not like... OK. I don't know. I feel like I've gotten less and less excited about this game
(0:52:58) Al: over time. Let me talk about my last one, and then we'll talk about the other side.
(0:52:59) Kev: Yeah.
(0:53:02) Kev: Yes. OK.
(0:53:03) Al: So my last one is Fields of Mystery. I've really been enjoying it,
(0:53:06) Al: and I want more of it so I'm looking forward to it.
(0:53:07) Kev: Hmm.
(0:53:08) Al: Hopefully we'll be next year. That's a good question. I don't know for certain. We'll see.
(0:53:09) Kev: Yeah.
(0:53:11) Kev: Sure.
(0:53:12) Kev: Fair enough.
(0:53:14) Kev: Yeah. OK.
(0:53:16) Al: Right, come on, let's talk about Tales of the Shire then. Tell me why you're excited.
(0:53:20) Al: Or should I tell you why I'm not excited first and then you can talk about why you're excited.
(0:53:20) Kev: Well, actually.
(0:53:23) Kev: I was about.
(0:53:23) Al: We can finish off as a positive.
(0:53:25) Kev: Much like Wander Stop.
(0:53:28) Kev: like I'm not sure if I'm
(0:53:29) Kev: excited or play it myself right because like it's it's it's very much the same
(0:53:34) Kev: thing right like it looks like your standard cozy fishing and then crafting
(0:53:40) Kev: and all that good stuff right but it's friggin little rings right like how is
(0:53:46) Kev: that going to be integrated let's that's what I need to know I I don't know like
(0:53:52) Kev: I was just watching Lord of the Rings the other day and like you know that that's
(0:53:55) Kev: good stuff. It's like a shocker though.
(0:53:59) Kev: The Lord of the Rings movies are good and high fantasy and all that. Are they going
(0:54:04) Kev: to capitalize on what makes Lord of the Rings popular and successful? I don't know. That's
(0:54:10) Kev: what I'm wondering here. Gandalf has to wander into town, right? Absolutely.
(0:54:18) Al: Yeah, he's not gonna be someone you can see every day, but he's gonna turn up for I don't know there's a
(0:54:24) Al: Traveling there's a traveling market and he's coming
(0:54:29) Kev: Yeah, he's gonna be crazy red. Watch out for the Ford Breezy stuff.
(0:54:35) Al: Yeah, I think my thing about it is I like the concept of it, but I'm just and this
(0:54:42) Al: is not saying it's bad, I'm just not a fan of the art style.
(0:54:46) Kev: mmm you know that's very fair um I i think you know I can echo that sentiment i'm not a
(0:54:52) Kev: fan of the uh art style myself um yeah no I don't blame you at all
(0:55:00) Al: So, yeah, I don't know. I'm also a little bit worried about how it will play.
(0:55:04) Al: And I feel like it might just end up being just stardew but Lord of the Rings,
(0:55:09) Al: which is fine, but I don't know.
(0:55:11) Kev: Yeah.
(0:55:12) Al: Is that what I'm looking for?
(0:55:13) Kev: Yeah.
(0:55:14) Al: Maybe.
(0:55:15) Al: I probably did say when this was announced that that was what I was looking for.
(0:55:19) Al: But I don't know.
(0:55:21) Al: I'm going to play it like I'm not let's not lie.
(0:55:21) Kev: I
(0:55:23) Al: I'm going to buy it and I'm going to play it and I'm going to talk about it.
(0:55:27) Al: but the question is, am I going to enjoy it?
(0:55:27) Kev: Know
(0:55:30) Al: We'll see. I'm keeping an open mind, but that doesn't mean I'm super excited about it.
