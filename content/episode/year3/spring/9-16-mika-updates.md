# Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season.
(0:00:35) Al: My name is Al, and we are here today to talk about Cottagecore games, and maybe the switch
(0:00:36) Kev: and my name is Kevin.
(0:00:42) Al: to...
(0:00:44) Kev: Whoo!
(0:00:47) Kev: All Cottagecore games will be switched to exclusives
(0:00:50) Al: Uh, we are going to talk this episode about Mika and the Witch's Mountain, the updates,
(0:00:50) Kev: now forever.
(0:00:51) Kev: That's what the direct told me.
(0:01:04) Kev: Again!
(0:01:04) Al: because there have been three updates since we talked about it last, although two of those
(0:01:10) Al: updates we're probably not going to talk about because there's not much in them.
(0:01:13) Al: There's like one mini game, too many games, and some quality of life improvements.
(0:01:14) Kev: Well, I did the churro races. I will talk about it.
(0:01:20) Al: You can talk about the churro races.
(0:01:22) Al: I did not do the churro races.
(0:01:24) Al: I did the dungeons in the third update.
(0:01:26) Kev: There you go.
(0:01:28) Al: So that's what we've got.
(0:01:29) Al: So we're going to talk about that.
(0:01:30) Kev: Okay.
(0:01:31) Al: Before that, we have a lot of news because a lot has happened recently.
(0:01:34) Kev: Did you hear that?
(0:01:35) Al: And that's even after all the news that you covered in the last episode, Kevin,
(0:01:38) Kev: Yeah.
(0:01:39) Al: about the Switch 2 games.
(0:01:42) Al: Just all the news.
(0:01:43) Al: It's busy, busy time, and we're not even in June yet.
(0:01:44) Kev: It is a beefy one. Yeah.
(0:01:48) Kev: All right. Let's, well, let's not get into it. Yeah, let's get into that.
(0:01:48) Al: So, yeah.
(0:01:50) Al: But first of all, Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:01:54) Kev: Okay. Obviously Mika, we'll get to that. Marvel Snap, I play. It's the what if season.
(0:02:00) Kev: What if, what if there weren't a lot of players and there's a lot of bots because there's a lot of bots right now.
(0:02:06) Kev: Marvel Snaps is still a good place. I like it. Or I like it. Maybe not a good place.
(0:02:14) Kev: I like it.
(0:02:16) Kev: They're, they're trying to make some changes because it is no, it is still a treadmill that you can't get off, but they're trying to make some changes to make it a little easier.
(0:02:26) Kev: They're going to start.
(0:02:26) Al: Or you can get off. The problem is if you get off, you're unlikely to get back on again.
(0:02:30) Kev: Yeah, then, then there's that.
(0:02:32) Kev: But, you know, we get the, I say the what if season, like the actual show, what if they're trying to focus on that. We get the strange Supreme, the bad one, they get the infinity Ultron.
(0:02:44) Kev: Captain Carter is the season pass card because of course she is. So yeah, fun stuff. But, but yeah, that's, it's, it's Marvel Snap. It is what it is.
(0:02:54) Kev: Other than that, the other Marvel game I play, Marvel Rivals, we welcome to the Hellfire Gala.
(0:03:02) Kev: The new season just started just yesterday as a recording. We got Emma Frost as the never ending arms race to make Hodges.
(0:03:14) Kev: She's fun to play, though. She is a tank, actually, and she comes with two modes. There is her standard psychic attacking mode where she attacks people with her brain and then she can create a little shield and whatnot, or as Emma Frost does, she can switch into her diamond mode where she goes completely melee and will actually pick up people slam them on the ground.
(0:03:40) Kev: slam them on the ground she will kick them into the wall
(0:03:44) Kev: that she gets reduced damage and so on um it's a lot of fun marble rivals very fun we got we got
(0:03:50) Kev: venom twerk and we're in a good place I saw that I thought it was a mod and then the game was like
(0:03:51) Al: Yeah, I I don't know what to say
(0:03:58) Kev: oh that's not a mod oh good times what about you al what's been up with you
(0:04:05) Al: mostly Mika. I was obviously playing the dungeons, and we'll talk about whether I enjoyed that or not. Spoiler alert, I did.
(0:04:13) Al: But I also have tried cassette beasts again.
(0:04:18) Kev: Ah, ah, that's a good one.
(0:04:21) Kev: I need to get, I'm intending to fire it up again this week
(0:04:26) Kev: 'cause we just got an update.
(0:04:27) Kev: So there's more things for me to do and that's exciting.
(0:04:27) Al: Yeah. I am struggling, Kevin.
(0:04:33) Kev: Ah, no, but where's the struggle?
(0:04:35) Kev: Where's the pain points?
(0:04:36) Al: I, OK, so I've just finished the tutorial, so I'm hoping that I now get there, right?
(0:04:43) Al: Because the tutorial is reasonable, it took me like an hour and a half to get through the tutorial.
(0:04:46) Kev: Trying to remember what is the tutorial, like, or what do you consider the tutorial?
(0:04:48) Al: So you like go off, you go off to like look at a path that's been destroyed. And when you get there,
(0:04:53) Kev: Uh-huh.
(0:04:54) Al: there's like a building and then when you get into the building there's an archangel.
(0:04:57) Al: And you have to fight the archangel.
(0:04:58) Kev: Ah, okay.
(0:04:59) Al: So you like, you go along a path and you have some battles and you get blah blah blah blah.
(0:04:59) Kev: Okay.
(0:05:02) Kev: Sure.
(0:05:03) Kev: Sure, sure.
(0:05:04) Al: And then you get back to the town and you discuss what just happened and then it's like,
(0:05:07) Al: oh, tutorial's done.
(0:05:09) Al: You're like, okay, wow, goodness, that was a long tutorial.
(0:05:12) Al: But like many tutorials, I feel like it kind of interrupts gameplay a lot to tell you things
(0:05:18) Al: and to do certain things and I don't find that particularly fun.
(0:05:24) Al: So I'm hoping that things go a bit smoother from here.
(0:05:27) Kev: Okay, um, it's been a while since I've played the tutorial so I can't speak to that but I
(0:05:34) Kev: Hope I hope you you sink into it because after the tutorial it's it's kind they just really let you loose
(0:05:43) Kev: Right, like it's a I mean, obviously you've heard us talk about it. It's it's one big it's it's all one map really
(0:05:50) Kev: so you can get out there and kind of explore there'll be hindrances and and you know stuff you have to
(0:05:57) Kev: progress but
(0:05:59) Kev: But it will ramp up quickly the amount of stuff you can do
(0:06:02) Al: Yeah, there's I mean, there's there's a few things I think I don't know whether it's just
(0:06:08) Al: because of how like different they are to Pokemon battles, but I'm also feeling a little
(0:06:13) Al: bit weird about the battles.
(0:06:15) Al: Like I feel weirdly restricted in them.
(0:06:19) Al: Like I feel my level is too low and it's like after I've done one wild battle, like not
(0:06:26) Al: even another trainer battle, I feel like at that point I need to be able to rest.
(0:06:28) Kev: >> Yeah.
(0:06:33) Al: It costs materials to rest when you're not like in the town and that feels a little bit
(0:06:39) Al: weird.
(0:06:40) Al: Like it feels like it's trying to be a survival game, but I don't think I want it to be a
(0:06:43) Al: survival game, right?
(0:06:46) Al: Like I don't, I don't know, there's just lots of little things that are a bit frustrating
(0:06:52) Al: to me.
(0:06:53) Al: And I don't know whether that's because they're just different and I'm not used to how this
(0:06:56) Al: is thinking about this type of game or whether it's just that I don't enjoy that.
(0:07:02) Al: We'll see.
(0:07:04) Al: I'm not giving up on it yet, but we'll see.
(0:07:05) Kev: okay I I will offer this piece of advice the game is it it's enough say
(0:07:13) Kev: honestly more defensive or you have to play a lot more defensively than you do
(0:07:15) Al: Mm-hmm, mhmm, it's huge.
(0:07:18) Kev: in in Pokemon the the damage is a lot bigger yeah though though the walls that
(0:07:25) Kev: you know a lot of the monsters can generate walls or whatever you're gonna
(0:07:30) Kev: want to use those because they can take two to three hits for like a
(0:07:35) Kev: quarter of your health and in this game that is a good bargain yeah yeah
(0:07:36) Al: And I think part of the problem is that we all know that I'm not the biggest battling
(0:07:44) Al: fan in Pokémon, like I like collecting, and I worry that maybe this is just too battle
(0:07:49) Al: focused for me.
(0:07:50) Kev: it might be because it is it's not as brain did I would say as Pokemon like
(0:07:57) Kev: you know after 20 years in a week we know the deal in Pokemon it requires a
(0:08:03) Kev: a little more attention.
(0:08:06) Kev: So, I can understand what you're saying there.
(0:08:14) Al: I also, I'm going to, I'm going to, Johnny's going to be so sad when he hears this, I also
(0:08:19) Al: think that there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of kind of puzzles and stuff to progress
(0:08:26) Al: on the map, right? Like you have to find like a switch that will do a thing that lets you
(0:08:28) Kev: Right.
(0:08:30) Al: progress to another bit. And I don't know, I'm not, I think, I think the thing is that
(0:08:35) Al: what I'm looking for in a Creature Collector is collecting creatures, and this game feels
(0:08:42) Al: like an X-ray.
(0:08:44) Al: An exploration game with survival and battles that also you happen to collect creatures in, you know.
(0:08:54) Kev: Think the emphasis is a little stronger than that on creature collecting
(0:09:00) Kev: But I do agree that there is a lot of emphasis on the exploration and the puzzle solving and all that
(0:09:08) Kev: Right, so if you know, that's not your bag then yeah that that's gonna be difficult
(0:09:09) Al: Yeah, we'll see. I mean, well, it's not that I don't like puzzles, right?
(0:09:13) Al: Like, I love puzzles in some games.
(0:09:15) Al: I just don't know if I want it in this game.
(0:09:17) Kev: Uh-huh, yeah
(0:09:17) Al: That's the thing.
(0:09:18) Al: Like, I don't know if that's what I'm looking for here, but we'll see.
(0:09:22) Al: I'm going to I'm going to push forward for a little bit longer.
(0:09:24) Al: I think now that I'm out of the tutorial, I need to give it more time after that.
(0:09:28) Kev: All right, well.
(0:09:28) Al: But I will just we'll see the last thing that I don't like about it.
(0:09:34) Al: And this is definitely something I don't like.
(0:09:35) Al: I don't like the menus. The menus are terrible.
(0:09:38) Al: them
(0:09:38) Kev: I have to look at the menus, it's been a while.
(0:09:39) Al: I just I feel like I feel like it's really hard to explain why I don't like these menus
(0:09:46) Al: but there's just something about them that feels they feel incomplete they feel it's not that
(0:09:52) Al: they're buggy but I just feel like i'm confused at what i'm looking at if that makes sense like
(0:09:58) Al: everything kind of blends together and there's a bunch of words and a bunch of stuff and i'm never
(0:10:04) Al: quite sure what's a button and i'm never quite sure where i'm meant to be doing things and i
(0:10:10) Al: have no connection to any of the creatures yet and so that doesn't help me so I look and i've got
(0:10:15) Al: like here's a list of creatures I don't care about them you know like it's
(0:10:19) Kev: Yeah, you know that one's
(0:10:24) Kev: That's gonna be tough because I I do think they do not
(0:10:31) Kev: They don't emphasize that connection with the creatures like like they do it they feel very much more
(0:10:38) Kev: either I mean there's some designs I like or whatever right, but
(0:10:42) Kev: There's no feeling of the partner Pokemon right of the the other starter. Yeah
(0:10:45) Al: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's in a design of how it is, right? Because you're not actually
(0:10:50) Al: collecting creatures. You're collecting designs of creatures, essentially, right? Like, because
(0:10:56) Al: of the way that you're catching, you're like recording them, you're essentially creating
(0:11:00) Al: an echo of what this creature is, and then you transform into that. Like, you physically
(0:11:02) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's very true.
(0:11:06) Al: can't create a connection with this creature because it doesn't exist. And it's definitely
(0:11:15) Al: the designs of the creatures are fun. I like a lot of them, you know, they're cute, they're
(0:11:18) Kev: - Sure, sure.
(0:11:20) Al: fun ideas and they have, you know, like they're, I think what I like about it is that they tie
(0:11:26) Al: their moves into the theme a lot as well. Like the dude who is a traffic cone has a
(0:11:35) Al: move that uses traffic cones, right? Like that sort of idea. I think that's fun. And
(0:11:36) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:11:40) Al: I think it's really good. And a lot of effort has gone into those designs, into the thought
(0:11:44) Al: of what these should be.
(0:11:45) Al: Be feel like as well as look like, I just really don't like the UI.
(0:11:48) Kev: Yeah. I honestly cannot speak to that because it's been so long. I don't remember, but you know,
(0:11:50) Al: I really don't like the UI.
(0:11:59) Kev: you know, that might be fair.
(0:12:02) Al: and I just yeah and that and combined with like why when I sit down why when I sit down at a fire
(0:12:08) Al: to rest the fire exists is there I don't get to rest and heal my part heal heal up until I also
(0:12:18) Al: use some more wood like the fire's already there why do I need to use up more wood and it's so much
(0:12:19) Kev: Ha ha ha ha!
(0:12:24) Al: wood you have to use up and I suspect it's one of these things where you get more and more and
(0:12:28) Al: you know 10 hours into the game you probably have far too
(0:12:32) Al: much and it doesn't matter. But like I'm really early in the game and I'm weak and I'm not super
(0:12:36) Kev: Yeah, yeah no
(0:12:37) Al: strong and I'm not experienced at how this game works and I have to pay 10 wood to rest to heal
(0:12:42) Kev: Yeah, yeah, no I I don't um
(0:12:43) Al: up. That's just bizarre. Why do I have to pay to heal? What is this America?
(0:12:51) Kev: I do recall that that early on the game is pretty brutal
(0:12:55) Kev: Um, there is a lot of going back and healing there's uh, there's a building or two not just in town
(0:13:01) Kev: There's a separate building. I'll have to look it up
(0:13:04) Kev: where you can go to rest.
(0:13:06) Kev: That's close to the early area, but that is a valid complaint.
(0:13:12) Kev: It is pretty challenging early on compared to, say, Pokémon.
(0:13:16) Kev: You're not dealing with level 2 Pidgeys and Rattatas or whatever.
(0:13:18) Al: Yeah, yeah, so we'll see we'll see how it continues.
(0:13:20) Kev: They're throwing you into full-on fights.
(0:13:23) Kev: Yeah.
(0:13:25) Kev: Alright.
(0:13:26) Al: I'm definitely going to give it some more time, but I'm not enamored by it yet.
(0:13:27) Kev: Well, I'll be.
(0:13:33) Al: Sorry, Kevin.
(0:13:34) Al: Sorry, Johnny.
(0:13:36) Kev: You just have to hear the good tracks, just you wait.
(0:13:37) Al: Oh, do I have to turn on the sound goodness, of course.
(0:13:43) Kev: You don't...
(0:13:44) Kev: Yes!
(0:13:45) Kev: You have to turn on the sound.
(0:13:46) Al: Kevin, I don't play games with the sound on.
(0:13:48) Al: I know, I know I get that, but like, that's not going to make it or break it for me.
(0:13:49) Kev: This one you do.
(0:13:50) Kev: It's literally called cassette beat.
(0:13:57) Al: I'm not going to go, oh, I don't like how the game plays.
(0:14:00) Al: I don't like how the menus look.
(0:14:01) Al: I don't like the battles, but the music is great, so I'm going to put in 50 hours into
(0:14:06) Al: this game.
(0:14:07) Al: That's not going to happen.
(0:14:07) Kev: Oh, maybe, maybe. (laughs)
(0:14:09) Al: Come on.
(0:14:10) Al: The gameplay has to stand by itself.
(0:14:13) Al: Anyway, that's what I've been up to.
(0:14:16) Al: Shall we talk about some news?
(0:14:19) Kev: I guess.
(0:14:19) Al: So we'll start off with the sad news.
(0:14:24) Al: Loose Leaf.
(0:14:25) Kev: This is wild.
(0:14:26) Al: This is interesting. I have many thoughts about this, but let's just talk about this initially. So Loose Leaf, a T-Witch simulator. This is a Kitfox game. They have said that it's now indefinitely on hold.
(0:14:39) Al: They have said, "After years of trying, we haven't solved the important problems with its design. We don't see a great way to continue right now that would make a good game anytime soon."
(0:14:48) Al: So we will not be moving forward.
(0:14:51) Al: And I have thoughts because that is good that they've decided, "Oh, this isn't a good game. Therefore, we're not going to finish this game and release it and sell a bad game." That's good.
(0:15:04) Al: But what I will say is, why are you deciding this after you've announced that this game exists?
(0:15:12) Al: That feels like a... Like, if you weren't sure, when you announced this game, if you weren't sure that you...
(0:15:18) Al: ...had a game that might be good, why did you announce it in the first place and go, "Hey, here's a game that we're making. Oh, never mind. It's not a good game."
(0:15:32) Al: That's a weird... Like, it feels like the initial development of, like, "Can we make a good game or not?" Like, you start with that. You start with, "Is this going to be a fun, core game?"
(0:15:43) Al: And you go, "Yes, it is. Okay, great. Let's announce it." Not, "Let's announce this game and then..."
(0:15:48) Al: ...decide if it is a game or not. Like, that's such a weird way to make that decision.
(0:15:54) Kev: Yeah, like, yeah, and, and, uh, like, I don't, uh, what are the, uh, what are the problems
(0:16:09) Kev: that they couldn't solve, right?
(0:16:11) Kev: Like, I want to know.
(0:16:12) Al: Yeah, I'm very interested in that. I don't know because it's hard, like, it's probably
(0:16:18) Al: very like specific stuff. So it's hard to know without being detailed in the game. But
(0:16:26) Kev: Yeah
(0:16:28) Al: yeah, weird, weird decision. Like the gate when they announced the game in the first
(0:16:31) Kev: When do they announce this do we know
(0:16:37) Kev: Yeah, let's see I'm kind of scrolling down
(0:16:43) Kev: Introducing December 7th of 23
(0:16:46) Al: Yeah, so a bit over a year ago.
(0:16:50) Kev: Yeah, um, huh, I just I don't know
(0:16:56) Kev: It's and you don't see this happen very often. That's what makes this interesting right like
(0:17:02) Kev: This was it was this wasn't crowdfunded was I hope not
(0:17:07) Kev: But and they're saying indefinitely on hold which is again a weird way
(0:17:14) Kev: It just feels odd, you know what okay because big triple-a companies do they do this all the time right projects get put on hold
(0:17:21) Al: Absolutely, yeah, they just do it privately.
(0:17:21) Kev: canceled, right
(0:17:23) Kev: Yeah, they just do it privately right but
(0:17:26) Kev: It's a small team. I mean, that's what seven people
(0:17:30) Kev: Like that, you know that that's a bit. That's kind of everything if you're not doing a game
(0:17:34) Al: Yeah, but no, I think Indies do this as well, we just like, because you don't know whether
(0:17:41) Al: a game is going to work until you have a base of it. And the thing is that you build out
(0:17:47) Al: your proof of concept game, and you go, is this fun enough? And then you go, yes, it
(0:17:53) Al: is. OK, we're going to continue and we're going to build the game. We're going to make
(0:17:56) Al: it look good. We're going to make it run well. We're going to add in all this story and all
(0:18:00) Al: the characters and blah blah blah blah but
(0:18:04) Al: in this case they did that after that I just yeah I don't understand what happened here
(0:18:11) Kev: - Yeah, and I mean, we won't, yeah.
(0:18:11) Al: this because you don't see this with indies either like you don't see people announcing
(0:18:15) Al: games that they then decide aren't fun right like and the thing is that there are so many
(0:18:22) Al: games I think that people make that aren't fun why is this the one that doesn't get made
(0:18:26) Kev: Yeah. Yeah, that's the challenge, right? Like we're not going to know the whole story. It would be nice to know if they broke it down, right? Like if they went into a video and said, here's this thing that we can't get to work, or we just didn't like it, couldn't agree. But it's kind of a question mark. But I mean, overall, though, as weird as it feels, I commend them instead of dragging this along for whatever, you know, not 15 years in development.
(0:18:50) Al: Yeah, yeah, that's fair.
(0:18:57) Al: Yeah, that's totally fair.
(0:18:58) Kev: So, but there you go.
(0:19:01) Al: On a more positive note, we have Tiny Garden, which came out
(0:19:05) Al: last week, have announced their roadmap. First of all, they
(0:19:10) Al: already have supporters DLC pack, which gives you some skins
(0:19:18) Al: and stick.
(0:19:20) Al: It's just a little bit extra if you want to give them a little bit extra and get some
(0:19:30) Kev: That's, that's just affordable.
(0:19:40) Kev: Yeah, very, uh, it's a cute game, I'll say that, like, you know, little Polly Pocket
(0:19:46) Al: more skins.
(0:19:47) Al: you go. That's what you can do.
(0:19:54) Kev: garden house decorating, oh, that's very cute.
(0:19:59) Al: Yes, I'm excited to play it, but they've also announced there's another update coming
(0:20:03) Al: soon in the summer, I think they're saying, because it's called the summer breeze content
(0:20:07) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:20:10) Kev: Yeah, which I'm good for that.
(0:20:13) Kev: I'm already working on the next thing.
(0:20:15) Al: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Outbound, as expected, Kevin,
(0:20:21) Al: their announcement for Outbound was the date for their alpha release.
(0:20:24) Kev: Docker. (laughs)
(0:20:26) Al: The most the least exciting thing in the world,
(0:20:29) Al: because I'm not playing an alpha of your game. Sorry.
(0:20:33) Kev: Yeah, we all know how I feel. I mean early access alpha's all it's all like I'm not I'm not I'm no offense
(0:20:39) Kev: Like it's important good for you. I hope people do play but I can't bring myself. I got I got stuff to do
(0:20:48) Al: Anyway, that's out on the 14th, which is in the past as you're listening to this
(0:20:51) Al: episode, so.
(0:20:52) Kev: But, that is a concrete step towards a game, and that's always good, and outbounds a fun little concept, so I appreciate that.
(0:20:54) Al: It is, absolutely.
(0:21:01) Kev: Have your whole camp on your vehicle.
(0:21:03) Al: I just love, yeah, they've got one of the images of a ridiculous build, and I just love
(0:21:11) Al: the idea of just making this stupid house on top of this camper van. This is so stupid,
(0:21:14) Kev: Yeah, yeah, it's great I love it
(0:21:18) Al: I love it so much. Without that, I would not be interested in this game, but when they
(0:21:23) Kev: Yeah
(0:21:23) Al: add that in, I'm like, yes, I am so in for this.
(0:21:26) Kev: Oh man, so, you know, we're cheering you on outbound just not playing your alpha. Sorry
(0:21:34) Al: I'm not playing your alpha, name of the episode.
(0:21:42) Al: Speaking of early access, Dinkum have announced that their 1.0 is coming out,
(0:21:48) Al: so they were in early access for two years, I think.
(0:21:51) Kev: Yeah.
(0:21:52) Al: Oh, nearly two years and eight months.
(0:21:55) Kev: Oh, that's, that's a beefy one, but they're here! They're making it, that's great.
(0:21:57) Al: It is, yeah, 23rd of April, their 1.0 will release, and this is the
(0:22:05) Al: Australian Outback farming game.
(0:22:08) Kev: Yeah, it's mine minecraft, but you're australia basically I say minecraft
(0:22:13) Al: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:22:14) Kev: You know it's it's a lot of different survival
(0:22:17) Kev: Type gates a lot of things um I
(0:22:20) Kev: Like the australia concept because we see kangaroos we see
(0:22:25) Kev: Emus we see a shark
(0:22:28) Kev: That you're fighting with
(0:22:31) Kev: axes and pickaxes and a glowing mushroom gator
(0:22:35) Kev: So the australia idea is cool. I don't know how
(0:22:38) Kev: I feel the character designs they're little I don't know if it's not my cup of tea but overall like I think it's a cool idea I am tempted.
(0:22:48) Al: Yeah, it's on my maybe list, like if I didn't have anything else that I was wanting to play,
(0:22:53) Al: I would be totally up for playing this, but I'm not sure what I'm going to not play in
(0:22:57) Al: order to play this instead, that's my problem.
(0:22:59) Kev: Yeah, that's fair.
(0:23:02) Al: Next we have Monster Patch, they've hit their switch, stretch goal, so it's coming to switch.
(0:23:08) Kev: Yeah, on the opposite end of the spectrum, this guy's succeeding too hard.
(0:23:08) Al: Oh my, yes.
(0:23:18) Al: He's also hit the next one as well, which is for fossils.
(0:23:22) Al: So there's going to be a fossil system.
(0:23:24) Kev: Yeah. Oh my gosh, where are we out 20 fossils?
(0:23:27) Al: We're nearly at 250,000, and what's the next one then, because there's a 250,000 one is
(0:23:33) Al: the treasure system.
(0:23:34) Kev: Okay, I
(0:23:36) Al: And then the one after that is the game corner.
(0:23:38) Kev: The gay. Oh, yeah now we're talking
(0:23:43) Kev: But I will say I hope this you know the one other
(0:23:48) Kev: Asterisk is I hope and all this doesn't bloat development where it takes like five years
(0:23:53) Al: There is that there is that that is always a worry there was something else I was looking at
(0:23:59) Al: What was it? Oh, it was the new chibi game where they were talking about
(0:24:03) Al: The extra stuff that they've unlocked and like this means that this that they will take extra time and I'm like just I don't
(0:24:10) Al: Add your extra stuff like either just do it or
(0:24:15) Al: Add it in as future updates right like let me play the game like cuz I don't care about fossils in your game in
(0:24:19) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:24:23) Kev: I don't either.
(0:24:23) Al: Mustard patch. I would rather get the game earlier than not have fossils personally
(0:24:27) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:24:29) Kev: You know what, they should,
(0:24:32) Kev: Kickstarter games should do this, right?
(0:24:34) Kev: You know, all of them have their, you know,
(0:24:36) Kev: little ladder of stretch goals or whatever, right?
(0:24:41) Kev: Next to them, put the plus X number of months
(0:24:44) Al: But the thing is, right, they want people to buy because they get more money that way,
(0:24:44) Kev: years of development time.
(0:24:50) Al: right?
(0:24:50) Kev: Yeah.
(0:24:51) Al: Like that's more more guaranteed people buying the game because in the upfront, right?
(0:24:52) Kev: Yeah.
(0:24:53) Kev: Yeah.
(0:24:54) Kev: Yeah.
(0:24:55) Al: Like that is what they want.
(0:24:56) Al: So they're never going to do that.
(0:24:57) Kev: Yeah, no.
(0:24:58) Kev: Or, or, okay, more realistically.
(0:25:02) Kev: Make a, like...
(0:25:04) Kev: Right now, Sean Young should look this, let's say, okay.
(0:25:08) Kev: Battle Tower is gonna be the base game, Fossil System will be an update later, and label that.
(0:25:14) Kev: I think that would be nice, to say, okay, this is what I want for the base game.
(0:25:14) Al: >> Yeah, that would be, yeah.
(0:25:18) Kev: This will come
(0:25:19) Kev: after, because I want this game to come out.
(0:25:21) Kev: That would be nice.
(0:25:24) Al: So yeah, who knows when Monster Badge is actually going to come out, but I'm looking forward to it when it does.
(0:25:34) Al: Next we have ArtClans, which is an upcoming game. They've announced that they've released their character creator app.
(0:25:42) Al: So you can go and create a character for the game beforehand. I think this is a fun little thing.
(0:25:49) Kev: It is, um, one, uh, yeah, that, that, that is a fun little, not, not even demo, but just a way to
(0:25:55) Kev: interact and get the name out there. That's a fun little thing. Um, what, what is the game?
(0:26:02) Kev: That's what you remember. Let's see. Hold on. You're wizards. You're, you're a wizard. Um,
(0:26:07) Kev: but, uh, that is fun. You know, little, little website games you can play to hype up for the game.
(0:26:13) Al: Oh, they have bald as an option.
(0:26:15) Al: I love it when they have bald as an option.
(0:26:15) Kev: Oh, now we're talking.
(0:26:18) Al: Give me give me your bald.
(0:26:19) Kev: Let's see. Um, that's good stuff. Oh, man.
(0:26:24) Al: Sorry, I'm making my character now.
(0:26:28) Al: Let's get rid of the get rid of the facial hair.
(0:26:30) Al: I don't want earrings.
(0:26:31) Al: Thank you. I'll take some glasses.
(0:26:33) Al: There we go. I've got me my character.
(0:26:34) Kev: There you go, we have Allen Arkland, yay, Allen.
(0:26:36) Al: Love it.
(0:26:41) Al: Nice. Our owl lands.
(0:26:43) Al: Continue. Oh, there's more stuff to do. You can do backgrounds. Different backgrounds.
(0:26:48) Kev: Oh yeah, I make the- do the whole thing.
(0:26:50) Al: Export. There we go. I'll send this to you, Kevin, and then I'll put it in the show now.
(0:26:54) Kev: Oh, I can't- oh, well now I gotta make my own too.
(0:26:58) Kev: Oh, this will be- we can post these on the Slack.
(0:27:00) Kev: This is your bonus content for you Patreon people.
(0:27:02) Al: Excellent! We love it.
(0:27:05) Kev: There we go, okay, I've downloaded.
(0:27:09) Kev: There we go, we're now in Arkland.
(0:27:11) Kev: See? Look how good this marketing is.
(0:27:13) Kev: We're doing it live on the show. _laughs_
(0:27:15) Al: I like the designs of this as well. It's a fun little thing and I feel like I could get something
(0:27:18) Kev: Yeah, it's fun.
(0:27:21) Al: pretty close to what I actually-
(0:27:24) Kev: Yeah, oh, that's- yeah, yours is good, I like yours.
(0:27:27) Kev: Alright, here we go, I'm doing the thread spoilers for this week. _laughs_
(0:27:30) Kev: Live. Um...
(0:27:32) Al: all right do I need to post it in the thread as well okay yeah cool that makes makes sense
(0:27:34) Kev: That's what I'm doing.
(0:27:38) Kev: Look at you, I see that Arklords has me infinitely more interested in this little game because I created my character. _laughs_
(0:27:45) Al: absolutely and it's much better than telling you to go and play an alpha
(0:27:49) Kev: Yeah, it really is. _laughs_
(0:27:53) Al: there we go I posted mine in the spoilers thread as well
(0:27:54) Kev: Yeah, I'm doing it right now too.
(0:27:58) Al: this is what you get if you're in the slack oh nice I like
(0:28:00) Kev: Yeah, there we go, look at us. Yeah, I like- I like yours, I like the red eyebrows, that's good.
(0:28:05) Kev: Yeah, these are good, these are really good. I like that.
(0:28:08) Kev: You can't tell though the little full finger sprite apart, but the character portraits pretty good.
(0:28:14) Al: Yes, that is going to be a problem with this game, because I think, yeah, there wasn't
(0:28:18) Kev: Gotta get the hat to see how it's bald, it's the only way you can do it.
(0:28:23) Al: an option to not wear a hat.
(0:28:24) Kev: I'm sure in the full game there will be, 'cause...
(0:28:28) Kev: Otherwise, well, I don't know, maybe not, whatever, but that's fun. Look at that, live on the episode, making our characters for Arklands.
(0:28:36) Al: Fun times. Right, moving on. What we got next? Dave the Diver. Ichiban's holiday DLC is out now.
(0:28:38) Kev: Good for you, Arklands. What do we have in these? Oh, no.
(0:28:46) Al: The reason we're talking about this again is because, oh boy, so all the previous DLCs,
(0:28:48) Kev: The feel-bad story of the year.
(0:28:54) Al: I think, have been limited time. So this one is also limited time, but it is a paid DLC as well.
(0:29:01) Al: So you can't just go, oh fine, I'll just add it to my inventory and play it later,
(0:29:06) Al: with the previous DLCs. It costs money, which I'm not against. It's costing money, right? Like,
(0:29:10) Kev: - Okay.
(0:29:12) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:29:12) Al: it's a bit annoying that there have been so many DLCs that are free and now it's a paid one, but
(0:29:18) Al: you know what? Fine. It's stuff. I'm happy to pay for stuff. But why do I have to buy it in the next
(0:29:24) Kev: Am I still gonna get this it's very likely but I'm not happy
(0:29:29) Al: Yeah, not happy about it. Of course, I'm gonna buy it
(0:29:31) Kev: Yeah, it's
(0:29:34) Kev: I'm I'm I feel more upset about this price than the switch
(0:29:40) Kev: Because the limited time scarcity Mario
(0:29:44) Kev: Nintendo's gonna come destroy your copy of Mario 3d all-stars feeling. It's not great. It's not a great feeling
(0:29:50) Al: - Yeah, yeah.
(0:29:51) Kev: But here we are what can be done
(0:29:53) Al: Have you looked at trying to buy
(0:29:54) Al: a physical copy of that now on eBay?
(0:29:55) Kev: You
(0:29:57) Al: They're so expensive.
(0:29:57) Kev: I'm not I bet they are shocker. Good. That's what happens when you create this dumb artificial scarcity BS
(0:30:07) Kev: But and it kills me because the GLC looks fantastic
(0:30:14) Kev: like they you know, they're putting all the minigames and all the effort the
(0:30:21) Kev: Strolling the you know, like oh man
(0:30:25) Kev: It kills me kills me
(0:30:27) Kev: But here we are. I don't like I wonder if that's a
(0:30:32) Kev: No, because they said they've done limited time before which I don't get to begin with but here we are
(0:30:37) Kev: How much is the deals? I didn't even see the price
(0:30:40) Al: It is six pounds, so probably $10.
(0:30:45) Kev: still not happy. It's probably worth that price. It is a lot of content. It looks more
(0:30:50) Al: Yeah, I'm not saying it's not worth the price.
(0:30:51) Kev: substantial than the other ones. Yeah. Probably. Yeah. Yeah, that was not a lot.
(0:30:54) Al: I think it probably is worth the price for what you get, and I think they probably should
(0:30:59) Al: have charged for the other DLCs as well.
(0:31:03) Al: I would say the Godzilla one, make it two quid, right?
(0:31:07) Al: It's not worth 10 quid, but I think it's important, blah, blah, blah, blah, for people to say
(0:31:13) Al: that these things are worth something.
(0:31:15) Al: It's the same Nintendo argument, right?
(0:31:17) Al: The limited time is the problem.
(0:31:20) Al: If you can't play this game, then you've got to pay for it now.
(0:31:23) Kev: now
(0:31:26) Al: And that is not good.
(0:31:27) Kev: now now now
(0:31:28) Al: That's bad.
(0:31:29) Kev: now though
(0:31:31) Al: Bizarre.
(0:31:32) Kev: money
(0:31:32) Al: Bizarre decision.
(0:31:33) Kev: ceo wants money now
(0:31:35) Al: And I don't even think it's like, obviously, I think the Mario 3D All-Stars
(0:31:40) Al: was stupid as well, but it's not even the same as that because I can still go and
(0:31:41) Kev: yes
(0:31:44) Al: buy a physical copy of the game if I want.
(0:31:46) Al: And even if I can't...
(0:31:50) Al: Those are just ports. They're just games that you could play on something else if
(0:31:54) Al: you wanted to, right? Like, I'm not saying that's good. I still think it's bad, but it
(0:31:58) Al: doesn't even... This seems worse than that, because this is content that you couldn't
(0:32:04) Al: get in any other way. You can't buy it secondhand, and you couldn't be at it for another previous
(0:32:09) Al: thing. This is... If you don't buy it in the next six months, you can never get this. Ever.
(0:32:16) Kev: I'm gonna make a fortune when I sell all my switches loaded with Dave the Diver with the Ichiban DLC.
(0:32:21) Al: Oh dear. Anyway, so that's that. That's out now. I'm gonna play at some point, but yeah I'm gonna
(0:32:25) Kev: Just you watch. To the moon, baby!
(0:32:34) Al: grump about it. Right, we also have some new games. First up we have Peggy's Farm, which describes
(0:32:42) Al: itself as "combine the crowsy crafting of a farming sim with the satisfying physics of a pachinko
(0:32:49) Al: game.
(0:32:50) Kev: Pachinko game. Yeah. Oh
(0:32:51) Al: I don't know what a pachinko game is.
(0:32:54) Kev: Okay, so it's a pachinko game is
(0:32:58) Kev: How should I put this?
(0:33:00) Kev: Okay, it's like pinball but without the flippers
(0:33:02) Kev: So you just shoot your initial like one ball and it kind of bounces around and hits things
(0:33:04) Al: Oh, it's that thing with all the nails in, and the balls go down, and where they land
(0:33:09) Kev: Yes
(0:33:11) Kev: Yes that exactly
(0:33:12) Al: is where they land. I understand. What a weird combination of things. Why are you doing this?
(0:33:13) Kev: That's the correct. That's pachinko
(0:33:16) Kev: Right popular in Japan for gambling
(0:33:20) Kev: You
(0:33:21) Al: Why is this a thing?
(0:33:22) Al: This is a weird game.
(0:33:25) Kev: Are you not enthralled by the concept of combining a cozy stardew like with pachinko
(0:33:33) Al: No
(0:33:34) Kev: It's what we've needed
(0:33:38) Al: Look maybe someone's excited about this, but I
(0:33:40) Kev: I know Konami's thrilled. They said they love pachinko
(0:33:44) Al: Am I I don't understand why
(0:33:49) Al: Is a bizarre game it feels like it feels like those like marriage games
(0:33:50) Kev: It is very very weird
(0:33:54) Al: it's like
(0:33:56) Al: the the the cunt the
(0:33:58) Al: The it's just different images depending on which version of this marriage game you do right you
(0:34:03) Al: So many different ways and it's like it's not really it's not a
(0:34:08) Al: Farming game right? It's a pachinko game that happens to have images that are based on farming
(0:34:14) Kev: Yeah, well, I mean no thought is the thing because when you hit the the the pull the crops when you launch the ball
(0:34:22) Kev: It actually causes them to grow or whatever. It's very weird
(0:34:26) Al: Yeah, I don't... I'm all right, thanks. I'm gonna pass. It sounds like something that
(0:34:29) Kev: I don't know either. Yeah, not for us, but
(0:34:38) Al: would be an interesting idea, but I don't know why I would ever actually want to play it as a game.
(0:34:43) Al: You know, it's like you're sitting in a brainstorming session and you're like, "Oh,
(0:34:46) Al: right, what else can we do farming games with?" "Oh, how about pajinco?" And you go,
(0:34:51) Al: "That sounds fun!" And then you start making the game and you go, "Actually, that's not fun."
(0:34:57) Al: It was just a fun idea.
(0:35:03) Al: Like Loose Leaf, a T-Witch simulator.
(0:35:03) Kev: This... I was about to say, this is what loops leave. They couldn't nail down the pajinko macales. [Laughter]
(0:35:12) Kev: Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah. Oh, good time.
(0:35:20) Al: "Clear out space and collect materials with your pinball cannon.
(0:35:23) Al: Watering your plants.
(0:35:24) Al: Use your cannon for that. Taking care of animals.
(0:35:27) Al: Your cannon does that too.
(0:35:29) Al: Your fluffy friends love to bounce around that cannonball."
(0:35:32) Kev: Oh, they love it.
(0:35:34) Al: No, anyway, the Kickstarter is coming soon.
(0:35:40) Kev: Best of luck. I would be- I will be intrigued to see if this, you know, makes it. That- that'll be-
(0:35:41) Al: Good luck, yeah.
(0:35:47) Kev: It's- it's interesting. I will say that.
(0:35:50) Al: And, well, it's interesting for about two minutes and then it's no longer interesting.
(0:35:57) Al: On the other hand, we have Neverway.
(0:36:00) Kev: Oh yeah, oh now this this one. Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah
(0:36:03) Al: This one, yeah, here we go, here we go.
(0:36:06) Al: "After quitting her dead end job, Fiona starts over on a farm and becomes
(0:36:10) Al: the immortal herald of a dead God. Make friends fight through horrors and pay
(0:36:18) Al: your debt in this night bearish life soon.
(0:36:20) Al: I'm guessing you're like going to try and bring the God back to
(0:36:21) Kev: Okay, well, okay before anything well, I have one question just a fundamental conceptual question
(0:36:27) Kev: Why do if the God is dead? Why does he need a herald?
(0:36:32) Kev: Even the dead ones
(0:36:36) Kev: Okay, is that it sure okay. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Okay that that was okay now go ahead
(0:36:42) Al: So, pixel art is made by the pixel artist from Celeste.
(0:36:48) Kev: you okay oh oh oh shoot have we should oh okay I actually just need two messages to kelly then
(0:36:54) Al: I think this is super fun. I love the idea of it. It looks great. I've always liked the
(0:37:04) Al: idea of a kind of horror style farming game, but none of them have ever really, I guess
(0:37:08) Kev: Yep. Hit that balance.
(0:37:11) Al: other than Cult of the Lamb, I guess, none of them have really grabbed me in any way.
(0:37:15) Kev: Yeah, but yeah, sure.
(0:37:18) Al: But yeah, even Cult of the Lamb, it was still cutesy horror, right? Like it wasn't really
(0:37:21) Kev: Yeah. And it was.
(0:37:22) Al: horror. And this few.
(0:37:24) Al: More horror and I'm excited to see what happens because the other one that was that rogue light one, and I can't remember what it was pumpkin panic. That's what it was. And that was just terrifying and I never want to play that thing again.
(0:37:32) Kev: Yeah
(0:37:38) Al: This feels like something I could actually play properly and it's an RPG as well. That sounds fun addition to it. Like, I think this looks great. And I think people overall look really excited for it.
(0:37:45) Kev: yeah
(0:37:51) Kev: I don't blame them because this feels
(0:37:54) Kev: it I would call this a stardew like but
(0:37:56) Al: Mm-hmm.
(0:37:57) Kev: you know the the horror is it's a very thick layer of horror and and very
(0:38:03) Kev: well-implemented it's not just staple on like uh...
(0:38:06) Kev: this is top the bottom scary stardew uh... and it looks it looks great looks
(0:38:12) Kev: fantastic uh...
(0:38:15) Kev: you have your crops your farming your you're even decorating your place
(0:38:20) Kev: and you're talking to people in relationships and all that good stuff
(0:38:23) Kev: but there's there's a lot of or there's scary things in this trailer
(0:38:28) Kev: uh...
(0:38:29) Kev: yeah this looks fantastic we don't have any t
(0:38:32) Kev: each is on anything house
(0:38:34) Kev: uh...
(0:38:36) Kev: but uh...
(0:38:37) Kev: uh... you can lie to people yeah
(0:38:40) Kev: uh...
(0:38:42) Kev: uh...
(0:38:43) Kev: Yeah, or date, yep, so it is dating relationship.
(0:38:45) Kev: Um, yeah, I cannot, uh, I can't wait for this one. It just looks great.
(0:38:51) Kev: Um, yeah, oh gosh, yeah, oh, this is mature, mature. Wow.
(0:38:56) Kev: Okay, yeah, we did get, not good for work or violence and mature content.
(0:39:04) Kev: I can't wait, this is great. Um, this is one of the most exciting games in a while.
(0:39:10) Al: All right, next we have Cottonville, which feels like the complete opposite of Neverway.
(0:39:17) Al: Create farm and style in Cottonville, a cosy dress-it-up game with farming and sim mechanics.
(0:39:25) Al: This is so sweet, it's giving me cavities.
(0:39:30) Kev: It's, it's, it's very Facebook game, dress up, internet, cutesy.
(0:39:38) Kev: It's a lot of things.
(0:39:40) Kev: Um, like, I'm sure this is great for some people.
(0:39:45) Kev: There's a market I'm sure, but okay.
(0:39:48) Kev: I have one huge complaint.
(0:39:50) Kev: The characters are always standing facing you.
(0:39:53) Kev: It's unnerving.
(0:39:54) Kev: I don't like it.
(0:39:54) Al: their eyes move in the direction you're moving very slightly.
(0:39:55) Kev: I don't like it.
(0:39:58) Kev: Yeah.
(0:40:02) Al: Yeah, it's cute.
(0:40:05) Al: I don't know if it's for me, but I don't know for certain that it's not for me.
(0:40:10) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:40:10) Al: I could see myself trying it.
(0:40:12) Kev: It's I don't think it's for me like I know I don't the dress-up thing doesn't have my appeal
(0:40:19) Kev: But I'm sure it's for someone
(0:40:23) Kev: But but yeah, that's cotton milk, it's okay. It's going on the Kickstarter. I think
(0:40:28) Al: Yes. The Kickstarter, I think, is live already, if that's what I said.
(0:40:32) Kev: All right, there you go
(0:40:34) Al: Yeah, Kickstarter is live now.
(0:40:35) Kev: Best of luck
(0:40:36) Al: It is not doing well, but we'll see how things go.
(0:40:42) Kev: Well, that's because the harvest season had yet to report on it. We're gonna change the game for them
(0:40:42) Al: It's.
(0:40:48) Al: It's a thousand euros of its ten thousand euro goal, so.
(0:40:53) Kev: Influencers
(0:40:54) Al: It's gonna, it might get there, it's going to take a while.
(0:40:58) Al: got a bunch of stretch goals, that's optimistic.
(0:41:01) Kev: Oh yeah it is, oh yeah that's off, ooh, best, oh.
(0:41:07) Al: Never put up your stretch goals until you've hit your target, because it's embarrassing.
(0:41:12) Al: It's really embarrassing if you have stretch goals and you never hit your target, right?
(0:41:14) Kev: Oh, yeah.
(0:41:15) Al: Come on, come on.
(0:41:16) Kev: Yeah, unless you're Sean Young, I guess.
(0:41:19) Al: I don't think you put up the stretch goals until they hit the target,
(0:41:22) Kev: Did he? Oh.
(0:41:22) Al: but it's just that it only took five minutes, you know?
(0:41:29) Al: I do think, however, I feel like it will probably get made even with the Kickstarter
(0:41:35) Al: doesn't, because the Kickstarter is so low that it feels like something,
(0:41:38) Kev: Mm-hmm a test thing. Yeah, maybe
(0:41:39) Al: like they don't actually need the money, and it's more like a marketing thing.
(0:41:45) Al: Who knows? We'll see, we'll see.
(0:41:49) Al: And that's all the news.
(0:41:52) Kev: Whoo, we did it! We defeated the news, finally. No new games ever again.
(0:41:58) Al: All right, we're going to talk about Mika and the Witches Mountain and the updates.
(0:41:59) Kev: Free. Free at last.
(0:42:05) Al: So just a quick summary of what this game is, if you haven't listened to our previous
(0:42:08) Al: episode, it will be linked in the show notes. Go listen to that, because we're going to,
(0:42:13) Al: we're not going to, I mean, okay, we're still going to talk about how much we love this
(0:42:15) Al: game, right? Because I don't know about you, Kevin, but like I've, I've still, I still
(0:42:16) Kev: Yeah, I love the game. I finished the game, finally!
(0:42:20) Al: love it. I still love this game. But a quick summary of it, just in case you refuse to
(0:42:27) Al: listen to that episode.
(0:42:28) Al: It is a witch broom riding package delivery game with Wind Waker graphics.
(0:42:34) Kev: very niche, but very good, we promise you.
(0:42:40) Al: It is very fun.
(0:42:41) Al: We talk loads about how much we love the core game in the first episode on it, but
(0:42:47) Al: we don't want to do that here because it will just, we'll just, we'll just spend
(0:42:51) Al: hours talking about how good it is.
(0:42:53) Al: We're not going to do that.
(0:42:54) Kev: Yeah, assume it is good. It's it's good. It's still Wind Waker and Kiki delivery service and good things
(0:43:02) Al: So I'm going to talk quickly about the three updates and what they include in them.
(0:43:08) Al: And then we can talk about what we've actually done and what we think about that.
(0:43:12) Al: And if it's changed our view on the game at all.
(0:43:14) Al: So the first update is the churros and cats update.
(0:43:18) Al: So this adds the churro express minigame,
(0:43:20) Al: which Kevin, I believe you've played. Do you want to talk about that just now?
(0:43:20) Kev: Yeah, I did
(0:43:23) Kev: Yeah, okay. So it's it's so right. The game is heavy about the the broom riding, right? Well now
(0:43:31) Kev: Logical step. Okay now do it fast. Here's your racetracks go they give you like seven courses, I believe
(0:43:37) Kev: And you can complete them all but they give you a time goal, you know
(0:43:40) Kev: I try if you hit the time goals, then you can get different rewards. You could get a special outfit a
(0:43:46) Kev: separate charm I
(0:43:50) Kev: Took me maybe an hour to clear them all
(0:43:54) Kev: the first
(0:43:55) Kev: Four or five are not terribly hard. They're easy. I won pretty much one shot them
(0:44:01) Kev: Some of the later ones get a little more challenging took me a few do overs to get them
(0:44:06) Kev: overall, I enjoyed it
(0:44:09) Kev: the
(0:44:10) Kev: Because so it's like an air a lot of them are air based tracks, right because you're on a broom, of course
(0:44:15) Kev: They have these like churro rings giant churro rings that you fly through to
(0:44:20) Kev: Get speed boosts and and and reset the timer or whatever the the churro aesthetic is cute. I like it's funny
(0:44:27) Kev: I like churros a lot
(0:44:28) Al: Yeah, it's cute.
(0:44:29) Kev: but
(0:44:30) Kev: But yeah overall like no complaints. I enjoyed it. It was a very natural like yeah, of course
(0:44:37) Kev: They're gonna do that and it worked
(0:44:40) Kev: Yeah, the outfit you get for it is completing. It's cute too. So there you go that there's my thoughts
(0:44:44) Al: So I have one complaint and it's not specifically about the turo race, but it's about the updates
(0:44:47) Kev: Okay
(0:44:50) Kev: You
(0:44:51) Al: in general. This just feels like the time to talk about it. There's no indication as to how to do
(0:44:58) Al: this in game. If you open the game and you had completed the game before any of the updates,
(0:44:59) Kev: Oh, okay
(0:45:07) Al: as I had I done, you open it up and it's like, "Oh, hey!" and you're like, "Hey, what am I?"
(0:45:14) Al: "What am I doing here?" "What have I got to do?" "You tell me this stuff?" "What is it?"
(0:45:20) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:45:22) Al: And it goes, "What do you mean?" "What do you mean? What do I mean? Where's the stuff?"
(0:45:28) Al: I find that most games when you have an update or a DLC that adds new stuff,
(0:45:33) Al: you open up the game and it pops up and says, "Here are things you can do now!"
(0:45:36) Kev: yep here's oh here's it yep
(0:45:36) Al: And you're like, "Great! I'll go do those!" And there was one thing it told you about,
(0:45:41) Al: which was about the the pet's companions, I think.
(0:45:44) Al: I think it mentioned that, and that was it.
(0:45:47) Al: There was no information about anything else in any of these three updates.
(0:45:50) Al: And so I had to Google to figure out how to do any of this.
(0:45:54) Kev: Yeah, so okay. I had I don't think I touched Mika since the last episode maybe like once or twice, but certainly not since the updates
(0:46:03) Kev: When I I am my game and updated I loaded in no messages or anything you're right no indication
(0:46:12) Kev: So I played around I completed the story a great ending by the way, I love the very cute
(0:46:17) Kev: And I was I wasn't sure I don't remember
(0:46:20) Kev: I didn't look up what the updates were I was just playing around because it's one to experience it
(0:46:24) Kev: I don't know what I experienced. There were updates. I saw the churros things like okay
(0:46:28) Kev: This feels like an update and sure enough it was
(0:46:30) Kev: But let's let's get really into it because I'll just I'll just cut to the chase here
(0:46:36) Kev: I was excited for the dungeons because when you complete the dungeons you get the the fake
(0:46:41) Kev: The green Mika you're actually supposed to be linked Wind Waker outfit, right?
(0:46:45) Kev: Um, and it lets you I think control the broom better or something like that
(0:46:48) Al: Yeah, you can infinitely go up instead of just the one boost.
(0:46:50) Kev: Yeah
(0:46:52) Kev: Which is great fantastic, right?
(0:46:54) Kev: So I was very excited for that
(0:46:56) Kev: I could not find the dungeons. I played several days this week. I'm looking for the engines
(0:47:02) Kev: I'd be in the game is like, where are you dungeons?
(0:47:06) Kev: and then so I look online finally and
(0:47:10) Kev: Well, it looks like I'm playing on the switch
(0:47:13) Kev: I mean there are my specific save file or I'm guessing it's just my specific save file is glitched
(0:47:19) Kev: I could not access the dungeons the doors just did not open for me
(0:47:25) Kev: And it was extra frustrating because again, there's no indication that there are new dungeons or where to go or whatever
(0:47:30) Kev: I happen to do the things
(0:47:33) Kev: and
(0:47:35) Kev: And they didn't open for me
(0:47:37) Kev: But just no no notifications or anything
(0:47:40) Kev: So it's just very frustrating because I didn't know where what I was doing if I was doing it wrong and and I didn't get
(0:47:45) Kev: To play the dungeons at all. So that's a very
(0:47:48) Al: Yeah, yeah, and I think so I got into the dungeons and they worked well for me.
(0:47:54) Al: But interestingly, mine seems to be bugged in a different way in that I can't get the
(0:47:58) Al: the Green Witch outfit despite having done the three dungeons and I've got the
(0:48:02) Al: achievement, what you're meant to do next is a specific thing.
(0:48:06) Al: And when I do and it just doesn't it doesn't happen.
(0:48:10) Kev: Oh, yeah
(0:48:10) Al: And the problem is, because this game isn't popular enough,
(0:48:13) Al: there aren't enough people talking about it and therefore you can't tell if this is
(0:48:15) Kev: Yup
(0:48:19) Al: that you're just doing something wrong or if it's a bug because there's not enough
(0:48:19) Kev: You just yeah
(0:48:22) Al: people saying this is exactly what you do because we've figured it out, you know.
(0:48:25) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:48:27) Al: So it's a little bit of a problem.
(0:48:29) Kev: It's and that's
(0:48:31) Al: I suspect both of these issues would not be an issue if you started a new save now.
(0:48:35) Kev: That would be my guess as well
(0:48:36) Al: But I'm not sure I really want to go through the whole game again just to do that.
(0:48:40) Kev: Likewise likewise
(0:48:43) Al: I'd like if they did a new game plus, that would be fun, right?
(0:48:46) Kev: Yeah
(0:48:47) Al: Like I've done the dungeons, give me a new game plus.
(0:48:48) Al: Would I get the green witch outfit from the start?
(0:48:51) Kev: Yeah
(0:48:51) Al: I'd do that. I'd do the story again if I could have the green witch outfit.
(0:48:55) Kev: Yeah
(0:48:56) Al: But yeah, I don't.
(0:48:57) Kev: Oh
(0:48:58) Kev: Yeah, this is oh, it's frustrating like yeah cuz
(0:48:59) Al: Awkward.
(0:49:04) Kev: Should be games often have a level of jank to them, right?
(0:49:08) Kev: I think let's be cool
(0:49:08) Al: Mm-hmm. Yep
(0:49:10) Kev: And it's a shame because this one is so enjoyable
(0:49:15) Kev: But this this jank is really frustrating at this point where I can't access the dungeons. You're not getting the green witch outfit like oh
(0:49:23) Kev: That's frustrating
(0:49:26) Kev: And sexual frustrating because again the game is good the parts I can play are fantastic. I love this little game
(0:49:32) Kev: Yeah
(0:49:32) Al: Yeah, I think this is the thing. I think the thing is that chibi games are, they're not your standard
(0:49:38) Al: 2D indie games, right? A lot of indie games are 2D because they're easier to do. They are 3D games
(0:49:43) Kev: Yeah.
(0:49:44) Al: and so with 3D games becomes a lot more complexity and they don't obviously have the size of teams
(0:49:52) Al: and the amount of money that big game development companies have to have like huge QA teams that
(0:49:58) Al: that can figure out all these bugs and fix them all, and, like, oh, here's, like...
(0:50:02) Al: 20 different save states that you could be in when you do the update, and on these three
(0:50:06) Kev: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:50:07) Al: ones it didn't work, right? It's hard to do that, and so you're right, there is a little
(0:50:12) Al: bit of jank to them because their games are typically slightly more complicated than most
(0:50:16) Al: indie games, but they don't have the additional team sizes that bigger development teams can
(0:50:16) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. And that's, uh, yup. And, and it's, and for the more or less the same reason,
(0:50:22) Al: have.
(0:50:30) Kev: like, are we ever going to get a hot fix that, you know, an update that's going to fix these
(0:50:34) Kev: save state issues? Probably not. Because they, you know, again, they don't have, they just
(0:50:38) Kev: don't have the resource. I don't, I don't fault them for it, but just, uh, um, so it's unfortunate.
(0:50:44) Kev: and that's all.
(0:50:46) Kev: It hurts because I love the game.
(0:50:49) Al: Okay, cool. So that update also has some pets based stuff. I didn't particularly do it. I think
(0:50:55) Al: there's there's a save the cats minigame. It just seems to be another collecting thing, which
(0:51:00) Al: is fun. I would, I would, I would probably have done it if I if this had been there when I'd
(0:51:00) Kev: Yeah, I did not do it either. You hear the cats meowing, if you're in the right area.
(0:51:07) Al: start the game. But like, I'm not as much as I enjoy the game. I think maybe I would do it if
(0:51:15) Al: if I got the Green Witch outfit, if that hadn't bugged out, because I feel like that.
(0:51:18) Kev: Ah, yeah
(0:51:19) Al: Massively changes how you play the game, and I would really want to do that.
(0:51:21) Kev: Yeah, absolutely
(0:51:23) Al: But I've done everything else in the game at this point, other than the DLC stuff.
(0:51:26) Al: And so I'm like, do I really want to go on another fetch quest? Not particularly.
(0:51:30) Kev: Yeah, just collectibles. Yeah, I don't blame you right so the other big one is there's like a hundred little statues
(0:51:37) Kev: I don't was that an update. I don't know little statues
(0:51:40) Al: The statues was not an update, there's just, there's like a hundred of them or something.
(0:51:42) Kev: Okay, okay, well, you know if I got the green witch outfit that would probably make hunting down the statues because you get other
(0:51:48) Kev: outfits and stuff
(0:51:50) Al: - Yeah, yes.
(0:51:50) Kev: But because of you know the control in the broom going up infinitely huge game changer
(0:51:56) Al: Agreed.
(0:51:57) Kev: but
(0:51:58) Kev: But here we
(0:52:00) Kev: Are we don't have it so it can be done
(0:52:02) Al: The next update was the... I didn't have a name this one, it's just second free content update,
(0:52:07) Al: but I thought it had... Oh, mini friends update. So this one added the mini map,
(0:52:12) Al: which you probably were like, "Oh, I didn't realize it didn't have a mini map the first time."
(0:52:16) Kev: Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, it's a great mini map, yeah.
(0:52:17) Al: Because it's just, it's a good mini map. I like it, it's great. It's good.
(0:52:22) Al: I'd forgotten it, I wasn't there in the first place, because it feels so natural.
(0:52:26) Al: And then there was a fishing mini game, which you can fish. In the way and the fishing in this
(0:52:32) Al: is actually quite fun in that you don't have a fishing rod. Part of the game as you go through
(0:52:37) Al: the story is you have these glass fish bowls that you use for certain things throughout the story.
(0:52:42) Kev: Bolts, yep
(0:52:47) Al: And the fishing is you use one of these bowls to fish, to grab the fish out of the water.
(0:52:50) Kev: Yep. Yeah, I. Yeah, I agree. Yep. Yeah, I agree. Right. Like the I think the fishing how they implemented it was pretty nice. So you know, it's nice that they expanded on it, but I didn't feel the itch to do it where I was in the game, right? I think that's kind of a common theme, except for me, like the dungeons, I think is the big one that feels like a
(0:52:53) Al: it's fun I did a little bit of it I don't feel the need
(0:52:57) Al: to complete this like the other stuff but it's it's fun
(0:53:20) Kev: postgame sort of you can't even an accident until the latter part of the game. These other updates, like they're small, nice, fun things that, you know, on their own or whatever. But I think starting fresh right now, it's awesome, right? Like, I think that was one of our biggest complaints from the first episode that there just was not enough to meet. It was missing a little bit, right? It was a little light. And I think altogether, like all these content updates, I think it's filled it out quite nicely.
(0:53:22) Al: Yes. Yes.
(0:53:48) Al: I agree, and I think that the dungeons make sense as an update, but I really wish they'd
(0:53:58) Al: waited for the other two stuff to be ready. Because I would have much rather played this
(0:54:04) Al: game with that stuff there. The dungeons, because it's an additional skill-based thing
(0:54:06) Kev: Ha ha ha ha!
(0:54:11) Al: that gets you a little extra thing at the end, I get why that's an update. But yeah,
(0:54:14) Kev: Yeah
(0:54:16) Al: The other ones just felt like they just rushed.
(0:54:18) Kev: Mm-hmm or
(0:54:19) Al: We want to get this game out earlier rather than later.
(0:54:22) Kev: Yeah, or it was stuff they had already in the oven just didn't finish so they just quickly banked it out to finish it
(0:54:27) Al: Yeah, who knows?
(0:54:29) Kev: Yeah
(0:54:30) Al: OK, let's talk about the dungeons then, or I should say, let me talk about the
(0:54:34) Kev: Yeah, tell me about the dunce
(0:54:34) Al: dungeons. I love the dungeons.
(0:54:38) Al: The dungeons are really fun.
(0:54:40) Al: So first of all, obviously, they're skill based dungeons.
(0:54:43) Al: So you have to be good in the broom to get them done.
(0:54:46) Al: But thankfully, you don't need to do them.
(0:54:48) Al: Right. So it's one of those classic things I always like when there's like here's
(0:54:51) Al: a really hard thing at the end that you don't need to do.
(0:54:53) Al: It's not part of the main story,
(0:54:55) Al: but it's something you can do if you really want to taste your...
(0:54:57) Al: skill and I find that really fun what I thought was really cool is obviously
(0:55:02) Al: there's one that's... they're based on three elements right you've
(0:55:06) Al: got wind water and fire and what I loved is they all had a different way of
(0:55:11) Al: getting through the dungeon so obviously it's all about it's all about riding on
(0:55:17) Al: your broom and if you boil it down to that it's they're all basically the same
(0:55:21) Al: but they managed to do it in such a way that they all felt very different so the
(0:55:27) Al: one is is purely about going super fast and dodging things and just trying to get
(0:55:33) Al: to specific places and it's literally about how can you go can you fly
(0:55:39) Al: properly and can you do what you meant to do and that's really good and that
(0:55:42) Al: was fun and it's just your standard dungeon for for broom riding the water
(0:55:49) Al: one was much more puzzle based where you had the these like little frog like
(0:55:56) Al: fans are called.
(0:55:57) Al: They are kappa, but in the game they're called little frog-like friends.
(0:55:59) Kev: they're kappa yeah well here's the thing you you meet a few of them outside the dungeons
(0:56:04) Al: I don't know why.
(0:56:08) Al: You do, you do.
(0:56:09) Kev: um and and they they do use the word kappa but they still call them from
(0:56:14) Al: I think the heart of the mountain calls them kappa, I think at one point, but that's the
(0:56:20) Al: only time they actually use the term.
(0:56:22) Al: Everywhere else it's little frog-like friends.
(0:56:27) Al: You have to transport them around the dungeon.
(0:56:30) Al: When you put them in a specific place, the water level rises and that allows you to access
(0:56:34) Al: different places.
(0:56:35) Al: But then you need to get the kappa from there to another place, but now you don't have...
(0:56:41) Al: When you take it off the bowl, the water level goes down again, so it changes the puzzle
(0:56:47) Al: of how you're getting around as you do it.
(0:56:48) Kev: That's really fun
(0:56:50) Al: It is.
(0:56:51) Al: It's really fun.
(0:56:52) Al: I really enjoyed it and it's not really short either.
(0:56:55) Al: It's quite long.
(0:56:56) Al: Like I was, it maybe took me an hour.
(0:56:57) Al: to get through the water dungeon so it feels it's a proper good length dungeon and it feels very much like a kind of a proper Zelda dungeon type thing.
(0:57:08) Kev: Yeah, I was about to say that, right, because, you know, from the very minute one Mika has said we're, we're, we're inspired, meaning we're trying to copy as much as we can from Wind Waker.
(0:57:17) Al: Yeah. The wind one, I think maybe took me 10 or 15 minutes.
(0:57:20) Kev: And they did a good job, right? And so, you know, that's one element they didn't have dungeons, and so here they did it and did it well. That's great.
(0:57:30) Al: So it's much shorter, but it's very much about like, I think if you weren't,
(0:57:36) Al: if you weren't as good as me at flying the broom, it might take you longer.
(0:57:38) Kev: hahaha gillish
(0:57:40) Al: But it's very simple in terms of like, you're going from A to B four different
(0:57:44) Al: times, and if you don't feel it.
(0:57:47) Al: It's not going to take you a long time,
(0:57:48) Al: whereas the water one is about figuring out how do I do this?
(0:57:52) Al: How do I get from A to B while also not having?
(0:57:52) Kev: uh-huh which is a lot very much zelba
(0:57:56) Al: Exactly. It's exactly that.
(0:57:57) Al: It's exactly that. So that was fun.
(0:57:59) Al: And then there's the fire one, which is you have.
(0:58:02) Kev: The combat one finally
(0:58:06) Al: So the fire is it gets you higher, right?
(0:58:10) Al: So if you if you if something is on fire
(0:58:13) Al: and you go on it, it raises you up, right, because hot air, it makes you go up.
(0:58:17) Al: The whole point of this one is going up from the bottom to the top.
(0:58:20) Al: And each level within that, I think there's four levels within that.
(0:58:24) Al: You have to go and get into a part of the
(0:58:29) Al: dungeon that has a puzzle in it there and come out with this flaming orb that will
(0:58:34) Al: then set fire to this this level's cauldron, which will then raise you up to
(0:58:40) Al: the next level and they get quite complicated as it goes through.
(0:58:44) Al: and the last one is like in almost pitch darkness.
(0:58:47) Al: And you're having to find your way through a maze using just the light from the fire that
(0:58:53) Al: you're holding. So yeah, I think what I love most about it is how different they are.
(0:59:01) Al: And yeah, fundamentally, it's just about flying, but they're puzzles, and it is. But they all feel
(0:59:02) Kev: - Yeah, I mean, that's the game, so, you know.
(0:59:09) Al: so different because of that, the different ways of doing it. It's not just like, "Oh,
(0:59:15) Al: Here's a dungeon but this time it's themed around.
(0:59:17) Al: I would say
(0:59:20) Kev: Mechanics, yeah.
(0:59:39) Al: I don't think for anything else it's worth starting a new save but if you can't get into
(0:59:43) Al: dungeons and you need to start a new save I would say do it because you enjoyed this
(0:59:47) Al: game and I think I think you would love the dungeons I think the dungeons are the best
(0:59:48) Kev: do. Wow that's that's high praise and you know what I mean Mika is not a
(0:59:52) Al: bit of this game they are so fun.
(0:59:58) Kev: terribly long or difficult game so that might be worth a replay just to see if
(1:00:03) Kev: we can hit those dungeons and experience you know maybe not a hundred percent but
(1:00:08) Kev: be able to fly around find some of those statues using the green witch outfit
(1:00:14) Al: Yeah, for sure. For sure. So there we go. If you've not played
(1:00:19) Al: week makeup before, and you were thinking it looks fun, but you
(1:00:22) Al: want to wait till it's finished, it's finished, there you go, go
(1:00:25) Al: play it. It does, it does now feel finished. It didn't feel
(1:00:25) Kev: Yeah, and it feels finished right that's the important thing
(1:00:30) Al: finished before. That was one thing that we kept talking
(1:00:31) Kev: Yeah
(1:00:33) Al: about. And we could tell there were stuff that was missing. And
(1:00:36) Al: it felt like they'd released it early rather than, you know, we
(1:00:39) Al: always talk about like, there's a difference between releasing a
(1:00:42) Al: game that's finished and then adding more stuff to
(1:00:44) Kev: Yeah, absolutely, that's great. I'm so happy, you know, they finished it because Mika, yeah, from the beginning, it was all the good things about it were strong from the start, right? The design, the charm, the personality, the art style, all that.
(1:00:45) Al: and releasing a game that's unfinished and finishing it.
(1:01:04) Kev: But I was just missing a little, just a little more meat on the bones and that's what we got through all these updates and yeah, no complaints anyway.
(1:01:14) Kev: Sure, it's a short, sweet, charming little game that I cannot recommend enough, especially now.
(1:01:22) Al: Agreed awesome. Wow. I don't think there's much else to say those are the updates. We still love the game
(1:01:24) Kev: Alright, yeah, nope.
(1:01:29) Al: We love it more now
(1:01:30) Al: Go buy this game
(1:01:30) Kev: Yep, go buy it, go do a capitalism, buy the game.
(1:01:34) Al: Well, we'll see you in two years for elusive
(1:01:38) Kev: Wait, what's the loser? Is that the next G big? I don't, I don't know. Okay.
(1:01:40) Al: That's their next game yeah
(1:01:44) Al: That's the the borrowers game
(1:01:46) Kev: Okay, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. I'm sick, I can't wait.
(1:01:52) Al: All right, well Kevin, thank you for joining me. Where can people find you on the internet?
(1:01:54) Kev: Thank you.
(1:01:56) Kev: Yeah, thanks for having me on, Al. Find me over at Koopa Prez on Blue Sky if you want, you know, the social medias or whatever, or the artist square if you want to see some of my art.
(1:02:12) Kev: Find me, or, more interestingly...
(1:02:16) Kev: Find me over at Rainbow Road Radio, a Mario-themed podcast I do with our mutual friend Alex.
(1:02:22) Kev: We did, you know, our schedule's a little up in the air right now, but we did do an episode for the Switch 2 because there was so much Mario stuff to talk about.
(1:02:32) Al: Yeah, let's not pretend like it was talking about the Switch 2, it was just
(1:02:35) Al: about Mario Kart.
(1:02:36) Kev: It was, look, Nadia came on, she demanded it, and it became the Mario Kart episode.
(1:02:42) Al: Yeah, no, I enjoyed it.
(1:02:42) Kev: - I said my (laughing)
(1:02:44) Al: I'm not saying it was bad, just let's not pretend it was a Switch 2.
(1:02:45) Kev: - Yeah, no, no, no, I'm, I'm,
(1:02:47) Al: It was not a Switch 2 episode, it was a Mario Kart World episode.
(1:02:48) Kev: that is, is a Mario Kart.
(1:02:50) Kev: It's the Mario, yeah, you're not wrong.
(1:02:53) Al: I enjoyed it because Nadia has spent a lot of time hyper analysing specific
(1:02:59) Al: things that I never would have even thought about.
(1:03:00) Kev: They
(1:03:02) Kev: Yeah, my Nadia likes the Mario Kart and and that's why she was on
(1:03:02) Al: And I enjoyed hearing all of that.
(1:03:06) Al: Absolutely.
(1:03:10) Al: Yep, absolutely.
