## Transcript

(0:00:31) Al: Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season.
(0:00:34) Al: My name is Al.
(0:00:36) Kelly: And my name is Kelly.
(0:00:38) Al: And we are here today to talk about Cottage Core Games.
(0:00:42) Al: Woo!
(0:00:42) Kelly: Woo!
(0:00:45) Al: Uh, welcome back, Kelly.
(0:00:47) Al: Always good to have you.
(0:00:48) Kelly: It's always fun to be back.
(0:00:50) Kelly: I feel like we talked so recently and yet so long ago.
(0:00:55) Kelly: It really wasn't that long ago.
(0:00:56) Al: Let's have a look.
(0:00:57) Al: Your last episode was "Grimoire Groves", and that was in March.
(0:01:01) Kelly: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:01:02) Al: For two months.
(0:01:04) Al: Hmm, I have not played that game since that episode.
(0:01:07) Kelly: I completed everything.
(0:01:09) Al: Hmm.
(0:01:10) Kelly: Everything, everything.
(0:01:12) Al: Impressive.
(0:01:12) Kelly: And then I put the game down and never picked it back up again.
(0:01:14) Al: Hmm, fair.
(0:01:16) Al: That's how I play most games, to be fair.
(0:01:16) Kelly: It was fun.
(0:01:19) Kelly: Me too.
(0:01:19) Kelly: But usually I don't go full completionist mode.
(0:01:23) Al: Yeah, yeah.
(0:01:24) Kelly: I pick things that I want to complete
(0:01:26) Kelly: or give myself goals.
(0:01:27) Kelly: Otherwise, I kind of lose motivation sometimes.
(0:01:30) Al: Fair enough
(0:01:32) Al: And then you were on the fields of then you were on the fields of mystery out before that. Have you played the update?
(0:01:32) Kelly: But I was determined.
(0:01:37) Kelly: No.
(0:01:38) Kelly: I really enjoyed the portion that I played,
(0:01:42) Kelly: but I decided that was enough and I'm just
(0:01:44) Kelly: going to wait for the full game.
(0:01:46) Al: I have done the same also. I was really tempted to jump in in the last update, but I'm like,
(0:01:52) Kelly: Mm-hmm yep, that's why I am I ended up picking up Sunhaven instead
(0:01:52) Al: "No, let's not do it. Let's not do it. Don't ruin it for yourself. Wait for the full game."
(0:02:00) Al: Yes. Well, let's get into that then. So, just before we get into that,
(0:02:02) Kelly: So I was like, you know what that's a completed game
(0:02:08) Al: we're going to talk about Ratopia, this episode. Ratopia, this episode, because it has just come
(0:02:14) Al: out in 1.0.
(0:02:16) Al: Kelly has previously played it, so I thought we would talk about that.
(0:02:21) Al: Before that, obviously, we'll have our regular news.
(0:02:25) Al: But first of all, Kelly, what have you been up to?
(0:02:28) Kelly: "Playing Sunhaven."
(0:02:29) Al: I have questions.
(0:02:30) Kelly: Woo!
(0:02:31) Kelly: I also got 15 yards of dirt delivered to my driveway
(0:02:34) Kelly: so I could fix my backyard.
(0:02:36) Kelly: So that's--
(0:02:39) Al: Why is it measured in distance?
(0:02:44) Kelly: I don't have that answer.
(0:02:46) Al: So, presumably, it's like a set thickness, right?
(0:02:47) Kelly: Do you know how I had to figure out what 15 yards of dirt was,
(0:02:50) Kelly: Al?
(0:02:50) Kelly: I had to go on YouTube and watch a video of a dump truck
(0:02:53) Kelly: delivering 15 yards of dirt to someone's driveway.
(0:02:59) Kelly: I guess?
(0:03:01) Kelly: Because they also do like--
(0:03:01) Al: You're the one that's had it delivered!
(0:03:03) Kelly: yeah, Al, this was through Facebook Market.
(0:03:06) Kelly: This is just, I don't know, the standard measurement
(0:03:08) Kelly: that they use, though, because it's cubic yards and cubic feet
(0:03:11) Kelly: are used for soil.
(0:03:12) Al: Oh, so it's cubic yards, not yards.
(0:03:17) Kelly: I don't know, because they only said yards.
(0:03:19) Al: Because that's a bit-- because cubic yards is a vol--
(0:03:23) Al: Yeah, so it sounds like they're just automatically
(0:03:24) Kelly: It's probably cubic yards, and I just never considered it.
(0:03:25) Al: shortening it then, because cubic yards is a volume.
(0:03:28) Al: That's how you measure something like soil.
(0:03:28) Kelly: Yes.
(0:03:29) Kelly: Yes, that's how I do my soil.
(0:03:31) Kelly: I do soil calculations in cubic yards.
(0:03:34) Kelly: I just didn't put two and two together because it just
(0:03:37) Kelly: straight up said yards.
(0:03:38) Al: Yeah, that's just laziness, I think, on behalf of people selling.
(0:03:42) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:03:43) Kelly: But no, I literally watched YouTube videos on dirt delivery
(0:03:46) Kelly: to figure out how much dirt this would be.
(0:03:48) Al: Although, I also have a question about that, because this is a thing that Americans do
(0:03:55) Al: a lot, is you measure things by volume, when that can be very inaccurate for certain things.
(0:03:58) Kelly: Yes. Yeah. Yes.
(0:04:02) Al: It's all very well and good measuring liquids by volume, because they stay the same. You're
(0:04:08) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:04:08) Al: not going to add extra air in between grains of water. Yeah. Yeah.
(0:04:10) Kelly: No, listen, I do a lot of baking.
(0:04:14) Kelly: All of my baking is done by weight.
(0:04:18) Kelly: I convert recipes all the time.
(0:04:18) Al: Yeah.
(0:04:22) Kelly: I'm pretty sure that they do it this way so that they can, like...
(0:04:24) Kelly: Okay, this is free dirt, so it's like...
(0:04:26) Al: Okay, yeah.
(0:04:28) Kelly: trash as it is.
(0:04:30) Kelly: But it's like, clearly they want to do it by volume and not weight
(0:04:32) Kelly: so that they can give me things like a two foot long concrete rock
(0:04:36) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure.
(0:04:36) Kelly: inside of my dirt pile.
(0:04:40) Kelly: You know, like, that's...
(0:04:42) Kelly: I don't know about the other things,
(0:04:44) Kelly: because I'm assuming when people buy nice soil,
(0:04:46) Kelly: they're not getting giant rocks in their nice soil.
(0:04:49) Al: Yeah, I.
(0:04:50) Kelly: But I think... I think it's... it's a...
(0:04:54) Kelly: I think that's part of it. I don't know.
(0:04:56) Al: You weren't buying high quality topside, well, that's for sure.
(0:04:58) Kelly: You know, it's free dirt.
(0:05:00) Al: But yeah, the baking one is funny, right?
(0:05:02) Al: Because I understand the want to do it in volume, right?
(0:05:05) Al: Like there's a lot of cooking that I do
(0:05:07) Al: where I do it by volume because it's quicker, right?
(0:05:08) Kelly: Yes, yeah.
(0:05:09) Al: Like I quite often I quite often will make like
(0:05:13) Al: I do like oat breakfast cookies quite often and I'll just I'll just use one
(0:05:19) Al: of my measuring spoons and I'll just like throw half a cup into a bowl, right?
(0:05:24) Kelly: - Yeah.
(0:05:24) Al: Because it's quick and it's dirty and it
(0:05:26) Al: doesn't really matter because if it's slightly off, it's fine.
(0:05:27) Kelly: You're getting cookies no matter what.
(0:05:29) Al: Exactly, right?
(0:05:30) Kelly: - Yeah, exactly.
(0:05:31) Al: It does the job.
(0:05:31) Al: But like when you're if I'm if I'm baking a cake, like, you know, I'm I'm weighing
(0:05:36) Al: out that flour, right, I cannot but you'll see recipes online all the time.
(0:05:36) Kelly: - Yep, yeah, oh yeah.
(0:05:40) Al: And it's like a cup of flour.
(0:05:42) Al: And I'm like, first of all, first of all, there is no single standard cup.
(0:05:46) Al: Did you know our cups are different than your cups?
(0:05:48) Kelly: Yes. That's what pisses me off. That's what pisses me off when like a lot of good baking
(0:05:49) Al: Fun, isn't that super fun to learn about after I've spent following American
(0:05:54) Al: recipes for years?
(0:05:59) Kelly: recipes will include both the the grams or whatever ounces and then also yeah the ones
(0:06:02) Al: Yes. You click the little button and it will change them. Yes, it's nice. I like that.
(0:06:09) Kelly: that don't are so questionable because it's like well did you pack the flour when you put in the
(0:06:14) Al: Yeah, exactly.
(0:06:15) Kelly: the cup but do you
(0:06:18) Kelly: do our cups match yeah it's very frustrating it's very I do a lot of
(0:06:20) Al: How irritated is your flower?
(0:06:26) Kelly: math when I do baking so it's very interesting I guess
(0:06:28) Al: And this is why I don't do much baking, because I like cooking where I can just throw things in
(0:06:35) Al: and it'll taste good. And if it doesn't taste good, I add in something else and it tastes good now.
(0:06:41) Al: But baking, if you muck up the measurements, you're getting a pile of mush.
(0:06:42) Kelly: That's, yeah, I will say, I am definitely doing like a dirty sourdough at the moment for the starter because I used to be very anal and I would measure everything out.
(0:06:55) Kelly: And after like, I guess four or five years of doing sourdough starters, I just like, I understand what the consistency needs to be.
(0:07:04) Al: Yeah, yeah, that's very different.
(0:07:06) Al: If you're doing the same thing all the time, you know what it needs to be,
(0:07:08) Kelly: Yeah, but there's definitely some.
(0:07:10) Al: and you just get used to that.
(0:07:12) Kelly: There are some things that I kind of like mess around with in baking where I think other people might not.
(0:07:16) Kelly: And it's like in the end, it still tastes great.
(0:07:20) Kelly: And it's my little science experiment, you know?
(0:07:22) Al: Yeah, I know. For sure.
(0:07:24) Kelly: But no, I love cooking and baking for the two different reasons.
(0:07:28) Kelly: Like one is my little science chemistry set.
(0:07:32) Kelly: And the other one is like throw whatever the hell you want into a pan and see what happens.
(0:07:34) Al: Yeah, I like the idea of baking and I sit with a pack of flour in my cupboard and I
(0:07:42) Al: watch as it goes out of date, because it's just like, it's a whole other mindset you
(0:07:49) Al: have to be in before you can actually realistically do that. And that, yeah. I've had a recipe
(0:07:50) Kelly: - Yes.
(0:07:55) Kelly: - Yeah, it's a different commitment.
(0:07:57) Al: for like a specific kind of flatbread for months and I've not done it yet. And that's
(0:08:04) Al: all for baking. That's just bread.
(0:08:06) Kelly: Yeah, yeah.
(0:08:07) Kelly: No, I've been meaning to make a brioche bread for months,
(0:08:12) Kelly: and I just keep putting it off because I'm like,
(0:08:14) Kelly: I don't want to deal with it.
(0:08:14) Al: There's so much brain space.
(0:08:16) Al: Anyway, Sunhaven.
(0:08:17) Kelly: Yes, Sun Even has been a lot of fun.
(0:08:20) Al: Pardon me, that's what we were talking about.
(0:08:23) Kelly: I like the different mechanics that they've added into it.
(0:08:26) Kelly: I enjoy having magic.
(0:08:27) Al: Yep. Interesting.
(0:08:28) Kelly: I wouldn't say it's like the most thrilling farming game.
(0:08:32) Kelly: I've ever played, but I think it's overwhelming in a way that keeps my attention.
(0:08:38) Kelly: Like having the different farms in different areas.
(0:08:42) Al: It's quite story based as well, isn't it?
(0:08:43) Kelly: Yes, yes, there's a lot.
(0:08:45) Al: How are you finding that?
(0:08:47) Kelly: Um, it's good.
(0:08:49) Kelly: I don't always pay attention to stories and games, so I'm not the best person.
(0:08:54) Al: Yeah, same.
(0:08:57) Kelly: I will say sometimes I look over to the characters, though, and have my eyes coped at one, I think.
(0:09:03) Kelly: You guys don't have that much clothes on.
(0:09:04) Al: I've had, I backed this game on Kickstarter and I've had it in my Steam library now for
(0:09:14) Al: a couple of years. I've not done anything with it. I have not, no. I think part of my
(0:09:16) Kelly: Have you played it?
(0:09:21) Al: problem is there's like a time frame after a game comes out where if I don't play a game
(0:09:26) Al: in that time period I'm probably never playing it.
(0:09:28) Kelly: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and that's hard because you have games that like you want to play and also
(0:09:35) Al: Let me tell you how many games have come out this year, purely farming games. We are currently
(0:09:41) Al: at 20. 20 games have come out this year so far. No, actually I'm wrong. 22. No, 24. 25.
(0:09:51) Al: 25 games that I am tracking on this game, on this podcast, by the 10th of May. There's
(0:09:54) Kelly: By May.
(0:09:59) Al: more coming out in May. There's another three on the list that are releasing this month.
(0:10:03) Kelly: Are they flooding the market?
(0:10:06) Al: It's the Stardew Effect. We're just at that time period. We are, what is this, eight years
(0:10:08) Kelly: It is.
(0:10:10) Al: after Stardew got popular? So just everybody's finishing up their Stardew clones.
(0:10:12) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:10:18) Kelly: That is very true.
(0:10:19) Kelly: And unfortunately, Sunhaven does fall into that.
(0:10:24) Kelly: But again, I think it's not the most unique farming game I've
(0:10:28) Kelly: ever played, but I do like some of the things that they've added.
(0:10:31) Kelly: I also just find it comforting.
(0:10:33) Kelly: I like a good micromanagy game.
(0:10:36) Al: Yeah, yeah, I'll talk about mine in a minute.
(0:10:38) Al: But, yeah, I totally agree with that.
(0:10:40) Al: I wonder.
(0:10:40) Kelly: And I do like that you don't spend energy.
(0:10:44) Al: Oh, yeah, so we're going to have to we're
(0:10:46) Al: definitely going to have to talk about this game then
(0:10:48) Al: because I am also playing a game which doesn't have energy.
(0:10:54) Kelly: It's a fun mechanic to like, not worry about.
(0:10:54) Al: And that is.
(0:10:57) Al: Yeah.
(0:10:59) Al: I am very much enjoying it.
(0:11:02) Kelly: It's really nice.
(0:11:04) Kelly: Like, oh, there's still always the time, you know, crunch or whatever.
(0:11:06) Al: Yeah, yeah.
(0:11:07) Kelly: But like, oh, I don't have to eat 10,000 apples just because I
(0:11:11) Kelly: want to hit a few more rocks.
(0:11:13) Al: This is the thing that's always annoyed me about farming games is you've got two
(0:11:17) Al: limitations, you've got the time and the energy and removing one or the other of
(0:11:24) Al: them, because Ever After Falls, which is what I'm playing and Sunhaven,
(0:11:29) Al: which is what you're playing, both remove the stamina.
(0:11:32) Al: but Sugaju Valley, which we'll talk about in the news section,
(0:11:36) Al: it removed the time aspect where it's essentially turn based.
(0:11:41) Al: So you do your stuff and then you there's two phases to the day.
(0:11:45) Al: There's the day phase and the night phase.
(0:11:48) Al: And the night phase is when you open the shop.
(0:11:51) Al: So it's like you do whatever you want to do and then you go and open the shop.
(0:11:54) Al: And then when you close the shop, it's bedtime.
(0:11:58) Kelly: that's sick yeah yeah yeah sometimes bad games yeah it's um which I think you
(0:11:59) Al: So I like the...
(0:12:01) Al: I mean, it's not a good game, it's a bad game.
(0:12:03) Al: But it was interest that was that was an interest.
(0:12:06) Al: Interesting thing and I like the games are now trying to play around with these things a little bit more.
(0:12:13) Kelly: know that's one of the things that we benefit from at like at the time point
(0:12:17) Kelly: we're in post stardew is like obviously that a lot of copies came out but I
(0:12:24) Kelly: I think we're really starting to see people like try to change
(0:12:28) Al: Mm hmm. Yeah. So we'll see. We'll see how those things go. But OK, so you're enjoying Sun Haven.
(0:12:36) Kelly: Yes, I have put over 100 hours into it so far.
(0:12:39) Al: Let me schedule that episode then. Sun Haven. Kelly. We'll see when we do that.
(0:12:48) Kelly: You know, you're the reason I actually picked it up, I think, is because we were talking
(0:12:50) Al: I've been meaning to play it for so long. Maybe I can event. Maybe I can finally play it if I've got
(0:12:55) Al: a date to record on it. Aha!
(0:12:58) Al: Right, OK. Was it in the news then?
(0:12:59) Kelly: about it during the grimoire podcast.
(0:13:06) Kelly: Probably I don't know.
(0:13:07) Kelly: I know it got mentioned.
(0:13:08) Kelly: It was probably like a brief mentioning, but I think it was the news.
(0:13:10) Al: many things, come on. Well I have obviously been playing Ratopia, I've only been playing the demo,
(0:13:13) Kelly: So you influenced me, congrats.
(0:13:22) Al: we'll get to that later, but yeah I've been playing the demo of Ratopia. I've also been
(0:13:29) Al: playing Ever After Falls and I have put in about 60 hours in that game so far, so it hooked me.
(0:13:34) Kelly: What, what's, what's that one?
(0:13:37) Al: So that's just another stardew clone, but it um
(0:13:40) Al: Obviously, as I said, it doesn't have the stamina aspect, but it's, let's see, how would I describe, so it's premise is slightly different, where you die at the beginning of the game, and then wake up and turns out that your real life was a simulation, and now you're in another world with a farm.
(0:14:06) Kelly: Oh, interesting. So really planning on people's simpsychosis fears.
(0:14:11) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. And it's very solid, I would say, probably much like what you're talking about with Sunhaven. It's like a solid farming game, and it has definitely caught that bug that I have for I must do this thing, and I'm building up this farm, and that is what I'm doing.
(0:14:37) Al: And I've been enjoying that.
(0:14:40) Al: And I have some things to talk about it that I'm going to talk about in a future
(0:14:43) Al: episode that I found interesting, but I think if you'd like Stardew and you've
(0:14:49) Al: been like, I must have another one and I'm done with Stardew,
(0:14:52) Al: I want a different list.
(0:14:54) Al: It's a pretty solid one.
(0:14:55) Kelly: The graphics look really cute.
(0:14:57) Al: Yeah, that's what initially grabbed me in.
(0:14:59) Al: And the animation of it is fun as well, like your character's arms are not
(0:15:03) Al: attached to the body and they can swing really funny as you walk around.
(0:15:08) Al: And there's a few other things like you've
(0:15:10) Al: seen these that you can catch and put them on things and you'll get like wood or
(0:15:14) Al: or without actually cutting the thing down.
(0:15:17) Al: And that's kind of like around it's trying to encourage sustainability.
(0:15:18) Kelly: Oh, that's cool.
(0:15:21) Kelly: Mm-hmm.
(0:15:22) Al: So, yeah, there's a few bits and pieces.
(0:15:22) Kelly: Yeah, but it's that solid game.
(0:15:27) Kelly: Sometimes you don't need anything innovative or crazy
(0:15:29) Al: Yeah. Yeah.
(0:15:30) Kelly: different.
(0:15:30) Kelly: It's just a nice, comforting game.
(0:15:34) Al: So that's what I've mostly been playing.
(0:15:37) Al: I have also, so two picks earlier came out and I had backed that game.
(0:15:42) Al: So this is like a life sim in a kind of stardew style,
(0:15:48) Al: but it's much more, it's almost, I guess, GTA-esque.
(0:15:54) Kelly: I was gonna say it looks like kind of reminds me of like I don't want to say sim city but like
(0:16:00) Al: I guess it would be some city if you were actually controlling an individual.
(0:16:00) Kelly: something like that
(0:16:04) Kelly: yeah that's that's which I guess is kind of like the ratopia of also
(0:16:10) Al: Yeah, I think it's different from that in so much as like you don't have any control
(0:16:15) Al: over anyone else. You're just living your own life, but you can you can do crime and
(0:16:16) Kelly: Mmm.
(0:16:20) Al: stuff like that. What I will say is I've not properly played it because it doesn't have
(0:16:21) Kelly: Okay, that's cool. That's fun.
(0:16:27) Al: controller support. So later, I play on my Steam Deck.
(0:16:30) Kelly: Oh, you don't do mouse and keyboard.
(0:16:35) Kelly: Ah, that's crazy.
(0:16:36) Kelly: I didn't consider that, that...
(0:16:38) Kelly: Why would they put anything on the Steam Deck
(0:16:40) Kelly: that doesn't have...
(0:16:40) Al: Well, anything on Steam goes on the Steam Deck by default, and most games coming out
(0:16:43) Kelly: Yeah, no, I understand that, but like...
(0:16:47) Al: now will have controller support. It's a good question as to why it doesn't have controller
(0:16:52) Al: support yet, and I do not know the answer. They have said that they're adding controller
(0:16:56) Al: support soon, but yeah, I'm just like, why, why, why?
(0:16:57) Kelly: okay hopefully like I get what you're saying like obviously they push everything from steam to it
(0:17:03) Kelly: but like you would think that there would be like some kind of filter like
(0:17:08) Al: They have a compatibility thing and it's and it currently has an unknown compatibility
(0:17:12) Al: for Steam Deck.
(0:17:13) Kelly: okay
(0:17:14) Al: So.
(0:17:15) Al: But whatever.
(0:17:16) Al: Yeah.
(0:17:17) Al: I opened it up.
(0:17:18) Al: Went.
(0:17:19) Kelly: yeah that's that's fair that's very fair
(0:17:19) Al: Yeah.
(0:17:20) Al: Nope.
(0:17:21) Al: We closed it.
(0:17:24) Al: I'll try again once you've added controller support, please and thank you.
(0:17:28) Al: So, yeah, that's.
(0:17:30) Kelly: Interesting concept though.
(0:17:31) Al: Yeah.
(0:17:32) Al: Yeah.
(0:17:33) Al: Well, I want to try it.
(0:17:34) Al: That's the thing.
(0:17:35) Al: Like what it is saying it's doing
(0:17:38) Al: It has mixed reviews on Steam just now.
(0:17:40) Al: So who knows how that will go, but
(0:17:42) Kelly: Well, you know. You gotta try stuff.
(0:17:43) Al: we'll see.
(0:17:46) Al: All right, let's talk about some news.
(0:17:48) Kelly: Yay! News!
(0:17:50) Al: Tales, Tales of Saikyu.
(0:17:56) Kelly: I think sake you, but like, also, I'm not a-
(0:18:00) Al: This is the game where you turn into Yoko, Yoko, Yoko.
(0:18:06) Kelly: Yokai?
(0:18:08) Al: This game is where you turn into Yoko for getting around and dealing with your crops and stuff like that.
(0:18:09) Kelly: Taseku, mess you up.
(0:18:21) Al: You have a whole bunch of different abilities for turning into different Yokai that have different abilities to do these things.
(0:18:30) Al: Yeah, yeah, I haven't decided whether I want to play this or not, but it is a thing.
(0:18:36) Al: and they've announced that their early access is coming.
(0:18:38) Al: I don't think this was a Kickstarter, so I won't have backed it, so don't buy it.
(0:18:40) Kelly: Oh, very soon.
(0:18:53) Al: I'm telling myself that, not other people.
(0:18:56) Al: I can't be trusted.
(0:18:57) Al: Yeah, not much else to say about that, they've just announced their early access is coming.
(0:19:03) Al: One thing I didn't check is what they're expecting in terms of how long.
(0:19:08) Al: Because that's always an interesting thing is how long they say they're going to be in
(0:19:11) Al: early access for.
(0:19:13) Al: They're expecting it to be about a year, so I suspect two and a half years.
(0:19:18) Kelly: That sounds like good math.
(0:19:24) Al: Next we have another update for Sugaju Island.
(0:19:27) Al: So this game is bad game, don't buy this game, don't play this game, but they are making
(0:19:32) Al: it less bad.
(0:19:34) Al: Maybe someday it will be less bad enough that it will be worth buying, it probably won't
(0:19:38) Al: be.
(0:19:39) Al: So in this update they've added sprinklers, so you can have sprinklers on the farm.
(0:19:45) Al: Yay.
(0:19:46) Kelly: And you can discover seashells.
(0:19:46) Al: It's such a, yeah, wow, I just, what, well, lackluster updates for lackluster game, that's
(0:19:47) Kelly: How exciting.
(0:19:53) Kelly: This is like really lackluster updates.
(0:19:55) Kelly: I'm sorry.
(0:19:59) Al: what I would say.
(0:20:02) Al: I don't, they've also added key bindings support, so you can change your key bindings, which
(0:20:06) Al: Good, I'm glad.
(0:20:08) Al: You should have had that at lunch. I find this game so fascinating,
(0:20:14) Al: because it feels so much like we need to do a farming game, so let's do a farming game.
(0:20:21) Al: And the only interesting thing about it was the turn-based time in the day. It is,
(0:20:28) Kelly: Which is like a really cool concept, which is that sounds so interesting.
(0:20:32) Al: but... but he's just not good.
(0:20:34) Kelly: They put all their effort into that one concept and nothing else.
(0:20:38) Al: They've marked this as a major update on Steam. That is something. Uh, yeah.
(0:20:46) Kelly: I mean, I'm going to just say this like then I think the name alone implies to me that there's not a lot of effort going on here.
(0:20:54) Al: Oh Kelly, you probably haven't listened to last week's episode have you?
(0:20:57) Al: There were two new games in last week's episode that were called Sunseed Island and Starsand Island.
(0:21:08) Kelly: We got to start like putting a ban on certain words for farm game
(0:21:14) Al: Known, known, island or valley. Yeah, this is...
(0:21:18) Kelly: If you have "do" in your name.
(0:21:24) Al: Good changes to the game, but that does not make a good game.
(0:21:31) Al: I cannot see how either of these three tiny things in this major update would
(0:21:39) Al: change this game from being bad to being good. I have no interest in opening that game again.
(0:21:48) Kelly: Definitely good to know. I was very intrigued when you mentioned the turn-based, and very
(0:21:52) Kelly: disappointed when you immediately followed up with that it's a bad game.
(0:21:54) Al: here lies the problem. They do have a demo. Feel free to try the demo. I mean, some people
(0:22:01) Al: like it, apparently, there are some positive reviews. Apparently, it's mostly positive.
(0:22:07) Al: I don't know how. I really don't know. So, like, every recommended person is like, oh,
(0:22:08) Kelly: Are they paying these people?
(0:22:17) Al: it's so nice. And they're like, but it's not. And all the not recommended is like, it is
(0:22:23) Al: the most boring farming game.
(0:22:24) Al: With so few features, it feels like a proof of concept and then they didn't add the rest of the game.
(0:22:36) Kelly: I don't know how Steam reviews work.
(0:22:38) Al: You just have to own it, I think.
(0:22:42) Kelly: Yeah, but like, I think it tells you, right, if like, they got it for free.
(0:22:44) Al: Oh, good question. Purchase type. Steam purchases and other. So other would be free ones.
(0:22:53) Kelly: That's what I would think, but like I meant more so too on like the, oh, no, nevermind.
(0:22:58) Kelly: 230 people found this review helpful.
(0:23:02) Al: Oh, is that the not recommended one at the top?
(0:23:04) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:23:06) Al: I can't believe I put 12 hours into this game, absolutely mad.
(0:23:09) Kelly: That's a lot of hours.
(0:23:10) Al: It's a lot of hours for a bad game.
(0:23:13) Al: All right, yeah, I'm going to start bashing this game.
(0:23:14) Kelly: Next.
(0:23:16) Al: Moving on, Outlanders have announced a new DLC, The Culinary Diaries.
(0:23:23) Al: It looks like it's a food based story addition to the game.
(0:23:29) Al: This is a town building strategy game.
(0:23:31) Kelly: OK, it looks like a short hike or the goose game.
(0:23:36) Al: Yeah, I mean, graphics wise, yeah, it's very much management style game, though, rather
(0:23:38) Kelly: Yes, yeah, that's what I'm basing that off of entirely.
(0:23:44) Kelly: OK.
(0:23:45) Al: than I have not. There's too many games to play them all. But yeah, it looks like it's
(0:23:47) Kelly: Have you played this one?
(0:23:55) Al: added a whole bunch of cooking stuff. So if you enjoy this game, there you go. You got
(0:24:01) Al: a new update? A new DLC? Or is it paid? That's a good question, I should check that.
(0:24:06) Al: It is... No, it's not free. It is $5. It is not bad. They've got quite a few DLCs,
(0:24:06) Kelly: It's free, maybe.
(0:24:13) Kelly: Oh, that's not bad.
(0:24:17) Al: which is interesting. They're all $5. Yeah, they also have very positive rating on Steam.
(0:24:18) Kelly: I noticed that it seems like they're, they have quite the DLC
(0:24:29) Al: None of that tells as much, because it's Sugaju Island, Suga Valley, whatever, I don't care.
(0:24:30) Kelly: - I think no.
(0:24:37) Al: Had a positive, quite positive, was it? Or something like that? I don't know. It was positive for some reason.
(0:24:46) Kelly: But I mean, like, I feel like generally, obviously,
(0:24:49) Kelly: that's not true for everything.
(0:24:51) Kelly: Games that tend to put out consistent DLC content,
(0:24:55) Kelly: like, there's something good going on.
(0:24:57) Al: Yeah, it has twenty nine thumbs up on the Steam post and zero comments.
(0:25:03) Al: So you've not got a whole bunch of people
(0:25:05) Al: complaining about it being paid, which implies to me that some people are
(0:25:10) Al: excited to buy it.
(0:25:10) Kelly: Yeah. And again, for $5, it's not a bad addition.
(0:25:14) Al: Five dollars.
(0:25:17) Al: All right, next, we have some new games to talk about.
(0:25:21) Al: First up, we have turnip bill.
(0:25:25) Al: Words, words.
(0:25:25) Kelly: You're not having a good day with the, I'm immediately adding this one to my wish list
(0:25:27) Al: Fail me, Callie.
(0:25:33) Al: Turnip Boy steals them all.
(0:25:36) Al: Uh, have you played any Turnip Boy game?
(0:25:39) Kelly: I have not, um, not out of like not wanting to, but like just life.
(0:25:45) Al: So turn it by commits tax evasion is great fun. It's it's a really good
(0:25:51) Al: small
(0:25:53) Al: RPG and I really liked that game turn it by Rob's a bank is
(0:26:00) Al: similar in terms of its action
(0:26:02) Al: But it is a roguelite
(0:26:06) Kelly: Oh, interesting. So not for Al.
(0:26:08) Al: I
(0:26:09) Al: Mean I I played it. I want to see how many hours I put into it. I put in
(0:26:11) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:26:15) Al: I played it on the switch not steam apparently
(0:26:18) Al: So I would need to I would need to look on my switch, which I'm not doing right now
(0:26:23) Al: I
(0:26:26) Al: Finished the game. I completed it which I haven't done for many many roguelites
(0:26:35) Kelly: says a lot. I didn't realize how new these games were though. That's crazy that they've put out
(0:26:40) Kelly: three games in like four years.
(0:26:43) Al: Yeah, 10 hours is apparently what I put into it to complete the game.
(0:26:48) Kelly: Oh, that's, that's a, that's like a solid cute little short game.
(0:26:52) Al: Yeah, well, that's the thing about them. They're not super long,
(0:26:55) Al: you know, you're not looking at 50 hours, you're looking at up to 10.
(0:27:00) Al: With Turnip Boy commits to excavation, I 100% did it. I didn't 100%
(0:27:05) Al: rob the bank, but I did complete the story. I completed that run, completed that run.
(0:27:12) Al: Which is enough.
(0:27:13) Al: For a roguelite, for me, considering I only got a third of the way through a run in Hades.
(0:27:27) Al: Defeated the first boss, then died in the next level and went "I'm not playing that boss again".
(0:27:36) Kelly: Where's your dedication to pain?
(0:27:40) Al: Nowhere. So yes, right. Okay, so this is a new Turnip Boy game. Don't get excited. It is not an
(0:27:46) Al: RPG. It is not like the previous Turnip Boy games. It is an endless runner for some reason.
(0:27:55) Kelly: Very, you know, they found like their niche little like theme with the turnip boy, but like it's very interesting that each game is different.
(0:28:04) Al: Yeah, so what I've said in my notes here is, I'll buy and play a new Turn It By game, right?
(0:28:13) Al: Because I like Turn It By, but I'm a little bit disappointed that it's a third game and
(0:28:19) Al: it's not like the first, because yeah, the second one was different, but it was the same
(0:28:24) Al: as well.
(0:28:25) Al: Like it was a roguelite, but it was still like a combat game in the same way that the
(0:28:31) Al: other one was, right?
(0:28:32) Al: The controls were the same, you controlled the player.
(0:28:34) Al: The same, you still had a weapon in the same way, and there weren't as many puzzles, right?
(0:28:40) Al: The first one had more puzzles, but it was still there was the same combat and stuff like that.
(0:28:46) Al: And this is very much not that. So I'm a little bit sad about that.
(0:28:53) Al: I guess that's fine, you know, they can do what they want. But yeah, I'm gonna buy it, I'm gonna
(0:29:00) Al: to play it and I'm sure I'll enjoy it but I want another turnip by turnip
(0:29:04) Al: I was so good, it was funny
(0:29:06) Kelly: I've literally only heard good things about it. Like, you know, it's I feel like they
(0:29:11) Kelly: really like turn a boy made himself into a thing.
(0:29:14) Al: Turnaby commits tax evasion was a lovely RPG that you could 100% in 10 hours, and it was funny.
(0:29:20) Al: It had a fun little story. It had some good combat that was actually challenging,
(0:29:24) Al: especially near the end. And it was good fun. Turnaby robs a bank, had the challenging combat,
(0:29:30) Al: and it had some of the funny story. And other than that, it missed the rest of it.
(0:29:34) Al: And this presumably will have the same humor. But that's it. And
(0:29:38) Kelly: But that's it.
(0:29:39) Kelly: So they're just slowly degrading.
(0:29:44) Al: I feel bad saying that, because I suspect it's not like they're making this instead of another
(0:29:50) Al: RPG, right? Like, I think they had a good idea for doing this. And they've done it as Turnaby.
(0:29:57) Al: I'm just like, when I saw there's a new Turnaby game, I went, "Oh, yes, great!"
(0:30:01) Al: And I looked at it and went, "This is nothing like them at all."
(0:30:04) Kelly: Yeah. No, I was just being a little cynical, but I agree.
(0:30:09) Kelly: I think that's they're just trying different avenues.
(0:30:14) Kelly: It's not like, oh, this is like a quick grab or something.
(0:30:16) Al: Yeah, yeah, no, I get that. But yeah, I'm not saying it's going to be a bad game. It's
(0:30:20) Al: just one of these things where it's like, if you would hear, oh, you know, say you didn't
(0:30:25) Al: know about Silksong, right? And you heard Silksong's coming out. It's a new, a new Hollow Knight
(0:30:33) Al: game. You're like, oh, fantastic, exciting. And then it turns out it's Solitaire. Right?
(0:30:40) Kelly: Yeah, that would Yeah, yeah, that's very true
(0:30:41) Al: That's essentially what we've had here.
(0:30:44) Al: OK.
(0:30:46) Al: Like I'm not saying it's a bad game, I just saw new turnip game, excited.
(0:30:50) Kelly: You want her to play, yeah
(0:30:51) Al: It's not that, that's the problem.
(0:30:54) Kelly: Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's the hard part
(0:30:55) Al: And I guess this is the problem with spin-offs and stuff like that, right?
(0:30:59) Al: Because this is what this is, it's a spin-off, it's not a sequel, it's a spin-off.
(0:31:02) Kelly: Mm-hmm.
(0:31:03) Al: And I'm not saying they can't do that, I'm just like, my expectations going in was different
(0:31:09) Al: and I don't know how they solve that problem, but that's where we are.
(0:31:14) Kelly: Well, maybe they're working on that perfect Turnip Boy sequel in the back end.
(0:31:20) Al: Well, they're working on a different game just now as well, Hobknobbers,
(0:31:26) Al: which I don't think is out yet.
(0:31:27) Al: Let me check.
(0:31:27) Al: Yeah, it's not.
(0:31:28) Al: It's still coming soon.
(0:31:29) Al: So I suspect that the Hobknobbers is their upcoming big game and
(0:31:37) Al: Turnip Boy steals them all as a let's do a quick and easy, fun, endless
(0:31:37) Kelly: - This is the, mm-hmm.
(0:31:42) Al: runner that some people can buy and it will help our cash reserves.
(0:31:49) Al: Well, speaking of their cash.
(0:31:50) Al: It deserves, they're also releasing a cubified turnip boy plushie.
(0:31:53) Kelly: It's so cute though and they have to reach their funded goal.
(0:31:56) Al: I don't need it.
(0:32:00) Al: It's $40!
(0:32:01) Al: Oh my word, $40?
(0:32:05) Al: This thing better be huge, how big is this?
(0:32:07) Al: It's 35 centimetres tall, so it is reasonably big, but that's a lot of money.
(0:32:14) Kelly: But it looks so soft.
(0:32:16) Al: What is the shipping going to be to me?
(0:32:20) Al: Probably too much.
(0:32:20) Kelly: I don't need this. What is the shipping?
(0:32:26) Kelly: How much tariff would I have to pay to receive this?
(0:32:30) Al: Oh 15 dollars shipping to me!
(0:32:33) Kelly: Ugh.
(0:32:34) Al: 55 dollars.
(0:32:36) Kelly: Okay, that's... that's...
(0:32:36) Al: And it is only 40 pounds, but I'm enjoying the dollar has sunk.
(0:32:38) Kelly: But he's so cute.
(0:32:50) Kelly: Well, I'm so glad that someone's benefited.
(0:32:58) Kelly: Oh, I see, there is a tariff statement at the top.
(0:33:06) Al: I don't need it anyway so cube turnip cube or cube boy whatever you'd like to call him he exists
(0:33:14) Kelly: He's very cute.
(0:33:15) Al: yeah uh
(0:33:16) Kelly: He looks like he's like that good soft material, too.
(0:33:18) Al: yeah yeah
(0:33:20) Kelly: Like squishmallows.
(0:33:22) Al: but not
(0:33:22) Kelly: I'm just going to keep talking until you feel bad,
(0:33:24) Kelly: and then you add yourself to life.
(0:33:29) Al: everdream valley have announced and released I think I think this is out now
(0:33:34) Al: Ever Dream Valley.
(0:33:36) Al: VR. A virtual reality version of Ever Dream Valley.
(0:33:38) Kelly: Oh, oh, I don't like that at all. I can't look at that.
(0:33:42) Kelly: I think I would puke if I ever did VR.
(0:33:46) Al: I played, there was a game that I played which was like in VR, but you, but it was
(0:33:54) Al: augmented reality rather than virtual reality. So you're seeing the world around you as well
(0:33:58) Al: and you like create these little islands where you put animals on them. I love that game. It's such a
(0:33:59) Kelly: OK.
(0:34:05) Kelly: That seems cuter, and probably wouldn't
(0:34:07) Kelly: give me motion sickness, maybe.
(0:34:10) Al: it was yeah it was a it definitely is much better um this I oh
(0:34:16) Kelly: I literally can't look at that cow clip.
(0:34:18) Al: yeah I don't I don't know what to say about this game uh
(0:34:25) Al: this kind of looks like a proof of concept this looks thrown together um
(0:34:30) Kelly: It doesn't look good.
(0:34:32) Al: oh it's not out yet it's coming soon but you can pre-order it
(0:34:34) Kelly: No yeah yeah but like that cow clip does not look good.
(0:34:38) Al: No, no.
(0:34:40) Al: No.
(0:34:42) Kelly: Feels like I don't, maybe I'm biased because I don't like VR but like
(0:34:47) Kelly: I thought we were kind of coming down from like the VR
(0:34:51) Kelly: um spike I guess.
(0:34:54) Al: do it. Yeah, I don't know why they've done this. Like I have a VR headset and I love
(0:34:59) Al: it for some things. I love Beat Saber. I love whatever the name of the game is. I kind
(0:35:01) Kelly: Mm-hmm
(0:35:07) Kelly: Beat Saber looks so sick. I think that would that's like the the soul game that would sell me a
(0:35:12) Al: It is the single thing that convinces anybody to buy VR.
(0:35:17) Al: It is so good, I love it so much.
(0:35:21) Al: But that, watching films in IMAX and whatever the name of the other game I play, the one
(0:35:29) Al: with the Islands of Animals, those are the three things I've done more than once on my
(0:35:33) Kelly: okay yeah no and it's a separate game right like yeah you have to pay
(0:35:35) Al: VR headset, right?
(0:35:36) Al: Like there's other things that you've tried once or whatever and gone "not for me".
(0:35:42) Al: It's game, but the content.
(0:35:47) Al: Yeah.
(0:35:48) Al: It's twenty dollars I think?
(0:35:50) Kelly: you could pre-order it for 15
(0:35:58) Kelly: Yeah, no, I feel like a lot of the VR game just feel like novelty.
(0:36:02) Al: Tune in next time to see if I've bought this game or not.
(0:36:07) Al: All right.
(0:36:08) Al: That's the news.
(0:36:09) Al: Let's talk about Ratopia.
(0:36:11) Kelly: Yay, I'm just so glad it came out.
(0:36:12) Al: All right, I'm going to.
(0:36:15) Kelly: Can I say that as someone who is waiting on so many different stupid games?
(0:36:16) Al: Yeah.
(0:36:20) Kelly: It is so nice to get a full release.
(0:36:25) Al: OK, I want to try and describe this game and you can tell me what you think
(0:36:30) Kelly: Okay.
(0:36:30) Al: about my description.
(0:36:32) Al: You are the the queen of a new rat city
(0:36:39) Al: and you are building your city out.
(0:36:43) Al: You it's it's almost it almost is like a it is a city builder,
(0:36:49) Al: but it is a an RPG city builder.
(0:36:52) Al: So you're controlling a character.
(0:36:55) Al: And you are building up the city.
(0:36:58) Al: You're you know, you're saying this is where buildings go and you're saying this
(0:37:02) Al: different things go and this is these are the laws of the city and stuff like that.
(0:37:08) Al: And you also accept in new members or new citizens.
(0:37:14) Kelly: Mm-hmm.
(0:37:15) Al: They are. They call them
(0:37:18) Al: they call them migrants or refugees.
(0:37:19) Kelly: I think it's migrants.
(0:37:19) Al: I can't remember. It's one of the two.
(0:37:21) Kelly: It's something with an M. I know that.
(0:37:22) Al: I think it's my yeah, it'll be migrants then.
(0:37:25) Al: And when you accept migrants in, you can then put them to work.
(0:37:29) Al: Or you, so I guess the two, two.
(0:37:32) Al: Your main ways of playing the game are you are controlling your individual character who goes around and can do things, and then you're also directing your citizens to do things as well, so you don't have to do them instead.
(0:37:47) Al: And that can be basically anything, right? You can get them to man a specific building, to like lumber, or you can get them to dig.
(0:37:55) Al: I think automatically they will like gather up everything that's on the ground and put it in the chest.
(0:38:02) Al: That's it. It's a city builder, but you are controlling an individual character as well as telling other characters what to do.
(0:38:10) Al: Is that a fair description of the game?
(0:38:12) Kelly: I think it is also it's vertical builder uh like yeah yeah yeah
(0:38:14) Al: What does that mean? What do you mean? Oh, like a 2D, yeah, okay, I see what you mean. It's side scrolling up and downy.
(0:38:22) Kelly: yes but like you're building vertically which I think is like more terraria than like other
(0:38:25) Al: Yes. I was going to, I was just going to say that Terraria is the, is the.
(0:38:32) Al: Would be the example.
(0:38:34) Kelly: I would say this is like a micromanagers final boss game
(0:38:38) Al: Oh, my word, so micromanaging.
(0:38:40) Kelly: It's, it makes.
(0:38:42) Kelly: It makes my heart sing. It's incredible and so stressful.
(0:38:45) Al: So let me tell you how I, let me tell you my thought process when starting this game. I've not put in, like, I've maybe put in less than an hour into this game, but the demo is really good at showing you the core concept of the game really quickly, and I don't know if the main game does it in the same way, but.
(0:39:02) Al: And you're like, oh, you're great. That's fine. I'm going to go do some digging and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, man, I can only carry three things at once and there's only three of the same thing.
(0:39:10) Al: Oh, that's really frustrating. Oh, goodness. Right. This is going to take forever to do anything. It's like you dig, dig, dig, and then you throw in the chest and then you dig, dig, dig, and you throw in the chest. Right. Fine. Whatever. This is really annoying.
(0:39:22) Al: Oh, OK. Right. I'm adding in new people to my city. OK, fine. Oh, they're all picking up the things I can do so I can just go now and dig and dig and dig and dig and they will take the thing. Great. That's a much improvement.
(0:39:32) Al: And then it's like, oh, and then it goes, oh, you need to build this thing. And you're like, how do I do this? And it's like you go into this menu and this menu then expands and expands and expands.
(0:39:43) Al: And it's like this web, absolute mass, massive web of different parts of different menus. And you're just like, I have no idea what's happening here.
(0:39:54) Al: And it's just it is, if you enjoy not creating spreadsheets, but if you enjoy looking at.
(0:40:02) Al: Somebody else's spreadsheets and figuring out what they do, you will like this game.
(0:40:08) Kelly: I think that is a fair--
(0:40:12) Kelly: not metaphor, what is the word I'm looking for--
(0:40:15) Kelly: summation of essentially all of the aspects of this game.
(0:40:18) Al: Where I enjoy making spreadsheets, I do not enjoy figuring out what other people have done, and that's what the menu felt like. I'm like, I want this thing, but I need to figure out what category they put it in, what category of what category, and what menu of what setting, and then where in this category is it, because it's just like this mess of things.
(0:40:42) Al: And I don't like figuring out what people think in the best of times.
(0:40:48) Al: And it just feels like somebody made this game, and this is how they decided was the most logical thing for their brain, and I cannot be bothered spending my time figuring out why they decided.
(0:41:02) Kelly: I think that is a very fair way to see it because I think that's exactly how it is.
(0:41:10) Kelly: But also, I feel like once it starts clicking, it starts making more sense because for me,
(0:41:16) Kelly: I really enjoy trying to figure out how people are thinking because I think that's the only
(0:41:20) Kelly: way I can understand vaguely people.
(0:41:26) Kelly: So it's like a puzzle.
(0:41:27) Kelly: So I think the puzzle of trying to understand the thought process is kind of fun.
(0:41:32) Kelly: Also frustrating, though.
(0:41:35) Kelly: Like, there's definitely been moments where I'm like,
(0:41:38) Kelly: "This stupid rat has to pee! How do I fix this?"
(0:41:42) Al: Yes, I
(0:41:42) Kelly: You know, like, "What do you mean they can't do this task?"
(0:41:46) Al: Think that part of it is is is I I didn't hate right because it's like you're just your standard city builder thing
(0:41:50) Kelly: No, no, it's not bad
(0:41:52) Al: It's like you need to balance you need to balance all these things and you need to figure out how they balance fine
(0:41:57) Al: Sure, whatever my problem. I just felt like I was navigating menus for 90% of the time
(0:41:57) Kelly: Yes, it's just I think
(0:42:03) Kelly: It's a lot of menus
(0:42:04) Kelly: I did see someone say that they didn't like that the game paused when you opened the menu to like build something and in
(0:42:11) Kelly: My head I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
(0:42:13) Al: All right souls player, goodness me, just masochistic person.
(0:42:15) Kelly: Yeah, I was like what kind of game do you think this is that's crazy
(0:42:21) Kelly: Then like I literally I watched that and I was like what the hell kind of person
(0:42:27) Al: Oh, my word. Horrifying.
(0:42:28) Kelly: That's sick that's sicko behavior
(0:42:32) Kelly: It's like please keep those thoughts to yourself and I think better never implement that in this game
(0:42:38) Al: Yeah, that that that how to make this game more stressful.
(0:42:42) Kelly: Yeah, literally, like you said, the souls-like version.
(0:42:47) Kelly: That's disgusting.
(0:42:48) Kelly: Don't ever tell people that.
(0:42:50) Al: It was like the kid just said, "Is it time for a test in school?"
(0:42:51) Kelly: Like, I need those, I need that pause
(0:42:54) Kelly: to figure out what I'm doing.
(0:42:58) Al: And you're like, "No!
(0:42:59) Al: What are you doing?
(0:43:00) Al: What?"
(0:43:00) Kelly: You didn't collect our homework.
(0:43:01) Al: Yeah.
(0:43:02) Al: Oh.
(0:43:06) Kelly: But yeah, no, that blew my mind.
(0:43:07) Kelly: 'Cause I was like, people think like this?
(0:43:10) Kelly: Why would you want that?
(0:43:12) Al: So yeah, I think I, I mean, we're just, we're apparently getting straight into
(0:43:15) Al: my opinions, um, I, I can, I, this is not the game for me, but I 100% can see why
(0:43:16) Kelly: I think that's very fair, and I do overall, I think this game, there is so much going
(0:43:21) Al: someone would like this 100%.
(0:43:29) Kelly: on and like, I like Rimworld a lot, I don't know half of the shit I'm supposed to be doing
(0:43:36) Kelly: in Rimworld because there's just so much in that game.
(0:43:41) Kelly: I don't even buy the DLCs for that game, I just like playing the game, I figure things
(0:43:45) Kelly: Peace out as the game goes on.
(0:43:46) Kelly: You know, I've been playing it for a few years, things will happen, bad things happen, sometimes you die.
(0:43:48) Al: Yeah
(0:43:51) Al: Do you know I think
(0:43:53) Al: What I think interesting was I think that when I while I was playing this game
(0:43:57) Al: I think I was thinking you know what I would have more fun doing probably what is terraria
(0:44:03) Al: Right, like I feel like that's what I'm looking for if I'm one if I would be wanting to play this game
(0:44:08) Al: It's it's I I I want it simpler
(0:44:13) Al: I'm not it's not necessarily even the action adventure bit right like it's it's more I
(0:44:14) Kelly: That's, yeah.
(0:44:18) Al: Was thinking like this but
(0:44:22) Al: Minecraft and then I was like wait, but that's terraria, right?
(0:44:24) Kelly: Mmm
(0:44:26) Kelly: That's so funny because I've I've actually never played I missed the boat on Terraria
(0:44:30) Kelly: And I've also never played Minecraft because I 100% missed the boat on that one. I feel like at a certain point
(0:44:37) Kelly: Like I think I would still enjoy Minecraft, but at this point in my life. I'm just like I cannot pick up Minecraft
(0:44:43) Al: That's totally fair. Minecraft was my, like I got in literally the last day of alpha
(0:44:50) Kelly: Oh, wow.
(0:44:51) Al: in Minecraft. So that was back on in 2010, I want to say. And that was like, I was,
(0:44:56) Kelly: Mm-hmm. And I know people are still playing it. I know, you know, it's still a relevant game.
(0:45:00) Al: oh yeah, yeah. Oh, absolutely. But I was like part of the way through uni at that point,
(0:45:07) Al: university. So like I, I was very much in a world where I.
(0:45:12) Al: Could sit up till three in the morning, obsessing over stuff. And I loved the building aspect of
(0:45:18) Al: that. So I, I, if I, obviously I do not have any numbers for how much time I spent on Minecraft,
(0:45:25) Al: because it wasn't through Steam and nothing exists for that. But if I did have numbers,
(0:45:30) Al: I would probably be incredibly scared to share that number with anyone, right? Like.
(0:45:34) Kelly: That's how I feel about my Sims numbers, you know? I'm so glad I don't have those.
(0:45:39) Al: Yeah. Yeah, same, same sort of thing.
(0:45:42) Al: Absolutely.
(0:45:45) Kelly: But no, I think what I like about this game is that there's so much going on. Like in
(0:45:50) Kelly: a sense it's like, I enjoy being stressed out, which is so sick. Yeah, listen, there's
(0:45:54) Al: And you I'm sorry and yeah, and you were you were judging the souls like player come on
(0:46:00) Kelly: There's different levels.
(0:46:04) Kelly: Okay I cannot do time crunches. I do not like any game that gives me a timer.
(0:46:09) Kelly: I immediately panic so like that would add on to the timer. That's like a timer.
(0:46:13) Kelly: I can't do that one. That's a different kind of stress. This game I feel like it
(0:46:17) Kelly: has so much going on. Like obviously I'm you know I haven't played a ton of this
(0:46:23) Kelly: either but like even just like figuring out taxes. You know it's like
(0:46:28) Al: That's, yeah, that's the, I do think that is very interesting what they've done there, right, they've taken our, this is our, a town builder but like take it to the extreme.
(0:46:38) Kelly: Mm-hmm, which I think is very cool because it's like
(0:46:38) Al: And I do think that's interesting. Yeah, oh no, absolutely. I'm not saying this is a bad game and I'm not saying that anything they've done is wrong.
(0:46:44) Kelly: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(0:46:46) Al: It just, it does not work.
(0:46:48) Kelly: Yeah, no, that's and it's like you know, listen
(0:46:51) Kelly: I'm someone who also like you give me one thing that like sets me off the wrong way and I'm like
(0:46:55) Kelly: I don't want to play this anymore
(0:46:57) Kelly: So I totally I'm not I'm not judging you on that one at all
(0:47:02) Kelly: But I do think like I love that you get to not only control
(0:47:08) Kelly: character and your people
(0:47:11) Kelly: Like I think that is such a fun concept
(0:47:12) Al: I agree, I agree because what I don't like about management games is that like it's just
(0:47:21) Al: and they've not solved that in this game but it's menu management, right? Like that's the game,
(0:47:24) Kelly: Yes, yes, which is
(0:47:26) Al: the game is menu management. They haven't solved that here but I feel like they're
(0:47:30) Al: moving in that direction and I like that it could possibly go somewhere, you know?
(0:47:34) Kelly: Yeah, I feel like it makes it feel you feel more connected to the game, even though it's still a menu game.
(0:47:42) Kelly: Like you are more involved in the actual world of the game.
(0:47:46) Kelly: Instead of being some overlord, you know, telling everybody what to do, which this game still also is very much so.
(0:47:54) Al: Yeah, yeah, you are the overlord, but like it makes sense, and there's not this, you are,
(0:47:58) Kelly: But you're in the mud with everybody. You're in the thick of it with everybody.
(0:48:01) Al: you are, it's, you are the monarch in the traditional sense of monarch, in so much as like,
(0:48:07) Al: you are the one that is creating this society, and therefore you rule it. And I'm not saying
(0:48:14) Al: that that is a good way to run society, but it's not like modern monarchies, where it's like,
(0:48:19) Al: this person was born through this person, therefore, they have control.
(0:48:25) Al: Um, it's not the same sort of thing at all. And I don't, I, you know, I'm not saying I want to
(0:48:31) Al: go back to that way of ruling, but it made a lot more sense, I think, monarchy in that sort of
(0:48:38) Al: world. And this, I think, creates that sort of world. And whereas, you know, like, if you take
(0:48:47) Al: SimCity, mayor doing the thing that mayor does, and that would get assassinated, right? Like,
(0:48:53) Kelly: Yes, which is so funny cuz I don't think I ever viewed myself as the mayor of SimCity
(0:48:55) Al: none of that makes sense.
(0:49:01) Kelly: I viewed myself as an all-powerful God
(0:49:03) Al: Yeah, that's essentially what you are, but like they don't they pretend you are a mayor.
(0:49:05) Kelly: Yeah, but like realist yeah, no your your metaphor totally makes sense because it's like yes
(0:49:11) Kelly: if a mayor came in just started like
(0:49:14) Kelly: demolishing buildings and building highways and you know doing all this stuff without any sort of
(0:49:16) Al: Yeah.
(0:49:18) Al: And, you know, creating earthquakes.
(0:49:19) Kelly: third-party input
(0:49:22) Kelly: There would be
(0:49:23) Kelly: massive consequences.
(0:49:25) Kelly: But it makes sense here because you are the queen.
(0:49:28) Al: Exactly.
(0:49:28) Kelly: Listen to my words or fall in the pit, you know?
(0:49:33) Kelly: But I really do enjoy getting to control the character.
(0:49:39) Kelly: And I think also, as a side note, they are very cute little rats.
(0:49:43) Kelly: I think the graphics are so cute. I love them.
(0:49:46) Al: Yeah, yeah, fair.
(0:49:46) Kelly: I love my little rats.
(0:49:49) Kelly: I think resource management in this game is very good.
(0:49:53) Kelly: It's very interesting, and I think that's one of the biggest challenges.
(0:49:56) Kelly: Once you get past figuring out the overall mechanics of the game.
(0:50:01) Kelly: I know you said you haven't played that much, but when I played the demo,
(0:50:06) Kelly: one of my first biggest issues was just food.
(0:50:08) Al: Yeah, I've not even got to the point where you need food, right?
(0:50:09) Kelly: Because it's like...
(0:50:11) Al: Like I've built a toilet because they were all complaining about needing to go to
(0:50:11) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:50:14) Kelly: Oh my god, the toilet.
(0:50:15) Al: the toilet. Um, and, but yeah, they've not, none of them have complained about food
(0:50:20) Al: yet, so it's not, I'm not
(0:50:21) Kelly: Okay. Yeah, that was definitely my
(0:50:23) Kelly: issue in the first run because I was like, "Oh my god, I need more rats. Let me
(0:50:28) Kelly: just get some more rats. You know, I need to get these tasks done." And then all of
(0:50:30) Al: I think I think that's an interesting part of it, right?
(0:50:33) Kelly: a sudden it's like, "Oh, I have to feed these rats."
(0:50:38) Al: Because, yeah, you get you start off going,
(0:50:41) Al: there's so much to do and you get a rat and they do stuff for you.
(0:50:45) Al: And you're like, oh, I need more rats.
(0:50:47) Kelly: Mm-hmm.
(0:50:47) Al: And so you start getting more and more rats as quickly as you can.
(0:50:51) Al: And then suddenly you're like, oh, no,
(0:50:54) Al: I can't just have these rats.
(0:50:54) Kelly: Oh no!
(0:50:55) Al: I need to actually provide them with everything they need.
(0:50:58) Kelly: They need beds, they need entertainment. I need to rotate the clowns so that the clowns don't get sad.
(0:50:58) Al: And, yeah.
(0:51:01) Al: Yeah.
(0:51:07) Al: What a sentence. What a sentence.
(0:51:12) Kelly: That one in the that was like one of the first ones where I was like, what am I doing, Rock?
(0:51:17) Al: so many things, playing the game, probably.
(0:51:18) Kelly: Uh
(0:51:20) Kelly: But yeah, no the and then if they get if you don't
(0:51:23) Kelly: So I don't want to jump mechanics here
(0:51:25) Kelly: But like also the fact that on top of everything else you also have to monitor your rat
(0:51:32) Kelly: populations
(0:51:34) Kelly: Needs and wants is very interesting because that's like that's you know, that's really just throwing a wrench in your juggling
(0:51:43) Kelly: But you know, I don't know if you I doubt you got to this point too
(0:51:48) Kelly: You have to set up
(0:51:50) Kelly: So obviously there's taxes
(0:51:52) Kelly: Which is an interesting mechanic?
(0:51:54) Al: Yep.
(0:51:55) Kelly: Because that really sets up like a class warfare if you're not careful about it
(0:51:55) Al: Basically.
(0:52:01) Kelly: But also there is jail and
(0:52:04) Kelly: Laws because they will try to kill each other and then they have to put them in jail and then they get mad that they're
(0:52:09) Al: Mm-hmm.
(0:52:11) Kelly: in jail as
(0:52:12) Kelly: If they didn't try to stab another rat
(0:52:15) Kelly: And then they have to go see the clown.
(0:52:17) Kelly: Because they're sad because they were in jail.
(0:52:19) Kelly: So, I like this game. I think it's very silly.
(0:52:22) Al: It is. It is very silly. You're not right.
(0:52:26) Kelly: But like, I think all of that, it's overwhelming at first trying to figure out all of those little pieces to get the game running smoothly in that aspect.
(0:52:36) Kelly: And obviously with any sort of colony sim builder game, you're not going to have smooth runnings for very long, like that's kind of the whole point.
(0:52:46) Al: Yeah, I think the tutorial does that in a very hand-holdy way, which is probably good
(0:52:55) Kelly: - Mm-hmm, yes.
(0:52:56) Al: for the start of the game, right?
(0:52:57) Al: Because you don't immediately have to do everything that you would presumably need to be doing
(0:53:03) Al: five hours into the game.
(0:53:04) Kelly: Yes, which, and I'm not a big hand-holding tutorial person,
(0:53:06) Al: Yeah, well, it's hand-holdy, but it's not, so I think part of the reason I don't like
(0:53:08) Kelly: but I think they did this tutorial very well.
(0:53:15) Al: can't hold each tutorials is they're like
(0:53:17) Al: now press this button now press this you don't need to do that
(0:53:18) Kelly: Mm-hmm. It doesn't baby.
(0:53:21) Al: what it does is it says hey people need the toilet you might want to build a
(0:53:25) Al: toilet and then there's a little icon on the button
(0:53:25) Kelly: Yes.
(0:53:27) Al: to get into the menu to build and then it shows you where you
(0:53:31) Al: so it's like I really hate when tutorials are like the only thing you
(0:53:34) Al: can do right now is press that button because we need you to press that button
(0:53:36) Kelly: Yeah, yep.
(0:53:38) Al: and it doesn't do that but if you don't do what it says you're going to have
(0:53:41) Al: problems and I think that's really good i
(0:53:42) Kelly: Yes.
(0:53:44) Al: I think it is absolutely the best way to do a tutorial.
(0:53:48) Kelly: No, absolutely.
(0:53:49) Kelly: I think it's less that they're not babying you.
(0:53:51) Kelly: They're like a parent teaching you
(0:53:53) Kelly: how to cross the street properly.
(0:53:54) Al: Yeah, yeah, exactly
(0:53:57) Kelly: So I fully recommend everybody does a tutorial
(0:54:01) Kelly: if you play this game.
(0:54:02) Kelly: It is very helpful.
(0:54:02) Al: it's even possible to skip it. I feel like it's just part of the game. Can you? Interesting.
(0:54:07) Kelly: No, yeah, you could skip.
(0:54:09) Kelly: Yeah.
(0:54:11) Al: I didn't see anything about that. Yeah, maybe you're the only give that option after you've
(0:54:12) Kelly: Maybe because it was your first run.
(0:54:19) Al: done it once. Yeah, that would that would make sense.
(0:54:22) Kelly: Yeah, because I could see, you know, imagine if they don't, they don't make you do the tutorial,
(0:54:26) Kelly: and then people start writing bad reviews because they don't understand the game.
(0:54:28) Al: Yeah.
(0:54:32) Kelly: I'm also assuming that you did not get to any real combat.
(0:54:38) Al: No, I did not get to the combat. So tell me about the combat, because I was assuming this existed
(0:54:42) Al: somewhere, right? You're not going to get a thing like this, which is clearly trying to be
(0:54:47) Al: mostly realistic without there being some sort of presumably enemy.
(0:54:52) Kelly: Mm-hmm. So obviously like I said you have like the internal conflicts which are just dealing with people dealing with your population, but you also have
(0:55:01) Kelly: You have creatures that potentially you will encounter when you're digging underground
(0:55:09) Kelly: So like like there's rabbits you kill the rabbits to eat them, but then there's also bumblebees
(0:55:16) Kelly: Yeah, isn't that kind of messed up
(0:55:20) Kelly: So like it's
(0:55:22) Kelly: It's figuring out how to handle different creatures like that
(0:55:26) Kelly: But then you also have enemies and they are like zombie underworld
(0:55:32) Kelly: creatures and
(0:55:34) Kelly: so usually what happens is
(0:55:36) Kelly: There will be one gateway for them to come out of or at least as far as I've seen one gateway for them to come
(0:55:42) Kelly: out of above ground and
(0:55:44) Kelly: That's typically close to where your bases
(0:55:47) Kelly: And so like what you can do is you can set up different security measures
(0:55:52) Kelly: So like I set up a whole bunch of different like barricades and like traps and stuff so that once a raid starts, you know
(0:56:00) Kelly: Before my little warrior rats can get there because you assign warrior rats
(0:56:05) Kelly: It stops like the stampede of zombies from getting to your base
(0:56:12) Kelly: So that is as far as I've played pretty manageable so far the issue comes in
(0:56:19) Kelly: You also get a random
(0:56:23) Kelly: enemy inside your base.
(0:56:26) Kelly: And they can basically spawn anywhere.
(0:56:31) Kelly: So they can spawn, you know, in your barracks
(0:56:34) Kelly: and like your beds, they can spawn next
(0:56:36) Kelly: to your toilets or in your food supply area.
(0:56:42) Kelly: And so like so far, again,
(0:56:45) Kelly: the raids that I've encountered haven't been hard to manage.
(0:56:48) Kelly: It's more of like.
(0:56:50) Kelly: Getting to them with a speed.
(0:56:52) Kelly: That prevents any real damage from occurring at first
(0:56:56) Kelly: because also obviously like when you first start you don't have a ton of rats
(0:57:00) Kelly: so you're having people work multiple jobs and assigning like a few rats to like
(0:57:08) Kelly: be warriors but then they have to like you have to make sure they're dropping their jobs when
(0:57:11) Kelly: zombies come or like they're in the vicinity is tough especially as your like little colony
(0:57:18) Kelly: starts to build because they can really just pop up anywhere and you just really have to
(0:57:22) Kelly: hope that your rat can get there fast enough before you know some poor civilian dies.
(0:57:27) Al: Interesting is one way of putting it, I guess, yeah.
(0:57:27) Kelly: So that's interesting. That one stresses me out. I don't like that.
(0:57:34) Kelly: I don't like that they just spawn inside which is another there's like a mechanic like that in
(0:57:39) Kelly: Rimworld where like uh the bugs can just spawn inside and I just basically turn that off
(0:57:45) Kelly: because I don't want to deal with it. But I don't think you can turn it off in this one so
(0:57:52) Kelly: it is. But it's very interesting and it definitely you know keeps you on your toes.
(0:57:57) Kelly: You gotta pay attention. There's no you cannot fall into a lull of safety in this game.
(0:58:03) Kelly: I do think though that they warn you if I remember correctly because I didn't have a raid recently
(0:58:08) Kelly: um they will warn you when an upcoming raid is happening. So I think you'll get like a maybe
(0:58:14) Kelly: I'm wrong on this but I think I'm right. You'll get like a you know possible raid in like three days
(0:58:22) Kelly: kind of warning. Which is good for planning out stuff like so if it's like oh I want to take a trip
(0:58:29) Kelly: on the top soil to go kill some more rabbits I've got to make sure I'm not going too far so that
(0:58:33) Kelly: I'm close to the base. Which is also interesting. I like that aspect that you can like kind of
(0:58:38) Kelly: explore up top. But yeah um I feel like I've been just babbling.
(0:58:40) Al: Yep, I agree.
(0:58:47) Al: No, that's fine.
(0:58:48) Al: No, that's absolutely fine.
(0:58:49) Al: I think, so here's the question.
(0:58:52) Al: What, I feel like we've probably covered most of the stuff enough to give people
(0:58:56) Al: an idea of what this game is, right?
(0:58:58) Al: And the key point is, is this something you would like?
(0:59:02) Al: And if there's one more thing, is there one more thing that you think is
(0:59:07) Al: interesting about this compared to other games?
(0:59:10) Al: That might hook people if they haven't.
(0:59:13) Kelly: I don't know, I think my biggest selling point really is that you get to be a character.
(0:59:19) Kelly: Because again, I think that's such a unique setup for these kind of games.
(0:59:27) Kelly: I don't know, I think they just do a really good job overall of putting a lot of stuff
(0:59:31) Kelly: into this game.
(0:59:33) Al: Oh yeah, for sure, for sure.
(0:59:34) Kelly: I think I could play this game and not touch on a good amount of the content.
(0:59:41) Al: It's like, you can tell that just by looking.
(0:59:44) Kelly: Mm-hmm. And I do think it's very like, you get to choose how you want to play. You know, like,
(0:59:51) Kelly: like I'm taxing people so that there's nobody super rich. But you can make like crazy classes
(0:59:57) Kelly: and like disparity, and to the point where people can't afford to use the toilet. So I think that's,
(0:59:58) Al: Yeah, not ideal.
(1:00:04) Kelly: that's like, you can be very cruel. No, I would not do that. I am incapable of playing games on
(1:00:06) Al: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
(1:00:14) Kelly: well. I learned that very young. I think the only one I could play like that is The Sims,
(1:00:19) Kelly: and even then I'm like, I gotta take care of you guys. I did. I did. But like in Fable,
(1:00:21) Al: you never put them in the pot in the pool without the oh you did fair enough
(1:00:29) Kelly: I've never played Fable as an evil character. I could not do it. I'm very bad at like,
(1:00:36) Al: I understand that.
(1:00:36) Kelly: doing the evil side of things. I don't know. Even in games.
(1:00:39) Al: Yeah, I understand that.
(1:00:41) Al: There's something about it that feels a little bit weird when you do that.
(1:00:44) Kelly: It does.
(1:00:44) Al: I understand why some people would enjoy it, right?
(1:00:47) Al: Because it's the escapism part of it.
(1:00:48) Kelly: Yes, absolutely. It's just like I.
(1:00:51) Al: This is absolutely not, oh, I can't believe that you're, you know.
(1:00:54) Kelly: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, listen, I've, I've drowned a lot of Sims in.
(1:00:56) Al: I'm no Elon Musk hating on GTA because you have to kill cops.
(1:01:00) Kelly: Okay, okay. Also GTA. Because in The Sims and GTA, I've killed a lot of people.
(1:01:06) Al: Yeah.
(1:01:07) Kelly: But those are my, my two games. Every other game I'm like, I have morals.
(1:01:14) Kelly: Um, I think the other selling point for this game is that there is a demo that you can try for free.
(1:01:20) Al: Mm hmm. Yes, I it's, it's very beefy. I haven't I haven't I
(1:01:22) Kelly: And I highly recommend that. Yes, it is a good demo.
(1:01:26) Al: don't know how long it is, but it's long enough. It's absolute.
(1:01:29) Kelly: I think it's 12. It's 12 days of gameplay.
(1:01:30) Al: If you aren't right, okay. If you yeah, if you aren't sure
(1:01:38) Al: based on this conversation, if you play that game, you'll you'll
(1:01:40) Al: be sure within half a
(1:01:42) Kelly: Absolutely, yes. Because I think I put in like five hours into the demo, and I hit the end of
(1:01:50) Kelly: the 12 days. And that's when I put it down pre full release. And I was completely sold. I was like,
(1:01:56) Al: Yeah
(1:01:58) Kelly: I don't know what they're going to be adding to this game that's not here already.
(1:02:04) Kelly: So it's it's a good demo. It's probably like one of the best demos I've ever played.
(1:02:09) Kelly: But if you found anything we've discussed.
(1:02:10) Al: It's pretty good. Agreed. No, I think I've explained why I don't like it. But again,
(1:02:12) Kelly: You're interesting. I would highly recommend trying that, but yeah, is there anything on your end that you?
(1:02:21) Al: it's not you, it's me. It's a really nice looking game. I've not noticed any issues.
(1:02:31) Al: It doesn't feel thrown together. It feels like there was a lot of thought and care into it.
(1:02:36) Kelly: - Mm-hmm.
(1:02:38) Al: It's just...
(1:02:40) Al: The menus feel like spaghetti falling out of someone's brain, but if you like that, you'll like that. I just, I do not like that.
(1:02:50) Kelly: That's completely fair. Spaghetti falling out of someone's brains.
(1:02:57) Al: Well, Kelly, thank you for joining me to talk about ratopia.
(1:03:00) Kelly: Thank you for having me out. I was very excited to talk about this and,
