(0:00:30) Kev: Hello farmers and welcome to another
(0:00:33) Kev: Contractually obligated episode of the harvest season that's not true at all. There's no contracts whatsoever
(0:00:36) Codey: Not true.
(0:00:40) Kev: By no one, have you ever seen Paul board and the mall cop movie?
(0:00:45) Codey: Uh, for not for a hot minute.
(0:00:49) Kev: Well, I'm just reminded like he he there's this plaque
(0:00:53) Kev: You know mall security whatever and he just made it himself for himself and that's all that I'm thinking
(0:00:57) Codey: Okay.
(0:01:00) Kev: Contract I drafted for myself. Oh
(0:01:03) Kev: Anyways, hello. My name is Kevin
(0:01:05) Codey: And I am Cody.
(0:01:07) Kev: And we are here today to talk about cottagecore games per the first section for the party of the first part. Oh, yeah
(0:01:12) Codey: A-wooo!
(0:01:15) Codey: Ow-ow-ow!
(0:01:17) Kev: You go
(0:01:19) Kev: I don't know Rick flair, but I feel like I should try to mimic kids. I might be mimicking these woo already
(0:01:25) Kev: I don't know, but I just know he does the woo
(0:01:28) Codey: No, I, I do not, I do not wrestle.
(0:01:28) Kev: You don't talk about wrestler guy
(0:01:30) Kev: He does booze
(0:01:32) Kev: Yeah, there's a wrestler. He's kind of an older guy. I think he's actually like running WWE now, but anyways
(0:01:38) Codey: That's a choice.
(0:01:39) Kev: Hello everyone
(0:01:42) Kev: It is
(0:01:44) Kev: Okay today, it's all it's just another news episode
(0:01:48) Kev: Life is chaotic. Cody actually managed to get on thankfully after actually surviving the wilderness for this past weekend
(0:01:52) Codey: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. I will. We'll talk we'll talk about that. I can. Yeah. So it's big, big old news episodes. We got lots of stuff to talk about. We this is the first of this month. So this will be our I know what you released last month. Boo. Episode as well. But what we have been up to. So this farmers has been a
(0:01:57) Kev: but it
(0:01:58) Kev: Hey, Oleg.
(0:02:00) Kev: Well, do you want do you want to open because obviously okay. All right, let's just let's get into it
(0:02:16) Kev: Yeah.
(0:02:22) Codey: wild ride. So this last week, on Tuesday, I was working at the
(0:02:28) Codey: Wildlife Center, it was going great, no issues. And we we
(0:02:32) Codey: heard that there was going to be this huge storm coming through.
(0:02:35) Codey: And that there's probably going to be a lot of animals like
(0:02:38) Codey: thrown out of trees. And so we were probably going to get a lot
(0:02:41) Codey: of animals from people. And just kind of be ready for that. And
(0:02:45) Codey: we were like, Okay, and then, like seven o'clock, power goes
(0:02:52) Codey: on. And I had gone outside at one point, because we knew this
(0:02:55) Codey: storm was happening. But we the our wildlife center is in the
(0:02:57) Codey: basement of the owner's house. Answer. p.m. p.m. crucial
(0:02:58) Kev: Okay, wait question you say it's 7 o'clock a.m. Or p.m.. Okay. All right. This is all right
(0:03:05) Kev: There's still light at that time, but okay. Yeah, all right
(0:03:06) Codey: information. Yeah. So I had gone outside, just like poked my
(0:03:10) Codey: head outside. And it sounded like a frickin jet engine. It
(0:03:13) Codey: was so loud. And I was like, Yep, it sure is storming. And I
(0:03:17) Codey: told the other people to go check it out. They poked their
(0:03:20) Codey: heads out. They were like, "Yep, sure, it's working."
(0:03:22) Codey: And so we were like, "Okay." And then, yeah, not long after that, power goes out.
(0:03:28) Codey: And so we're feeding, we're like laughing about it, whatever, we have like little lights and everything.
(0:03:33) Codey: We're feeding baby squirrels with lamps with like headlamps on and stuff and doing just us, I think.
(0:03:36) Kev: Very cute.
(0:03:37) Kev: The pictures, I've seen the pictures.
(0:03:42) Kev: Wait, did you have the lamps
(0:03:43) Kev: or did the squirrels have the lamps?
(0:03:44) Kev: Both.
(0:03:46) Codey: Yeah, it was just us. But there were like little, the owner has like lanterns everywhere.
(0:03:51) Codey: We found out that the.
(0:03:52) Codey: Um, sinks are run.
(0:03:56) Codey: There's a pump that takes the stuff from the sinks.
(0:03:59) Codey: So then we weren't even able to do dishes.
(0:04:02) Codey: So then we were just kind of like sitting there waiting for her to put the backup
(0:04:06) Codey: generator on took like 20, 30 minutes.
(0:04:08) Codey: And then when we had backup generator, it was great.
(0:04:10) Codey: Like no issues.
(0:04:12) Codey: Um, Jeff, my partner texts me and is like, Hey, we don't have power.
(0:04:15) Codey: I'm like dope.
(0:04:17) Codey: When I leave, I see all of the messages and basically it was a derecho storm
(0:04:23) Codey: I don't know how you say it.
(0:04:24) Codey: We had like 90 mile an hour winds and there were trees, um, that were
(0:04:30) Codey: straight up uprooted and like power lines that went across the road.
(0:04:32) Kev: Oh, that's sick.
(0:04:38) Codey: Uh, animals were indeed.
(0:04:38) Kev: Animals were indeed thrown out of the trees
(0:04:41) Kev: with said trees.
(0:04:42) Codey: Yes, they were.
(0:04:43) Kev: With said trees.
(0:04:45) Codey: We, I have not worked since that day and I, the messages have been going crazy,
(0:04:50) Codey: but I have had other stuff to do.
(0:04:52) Codey: So yeah, we're out of power and we're like, okay, this is probably just like,
(0:04:57) Codey: they just got to put it back up every now and then we'll go out of power
(0:04:59) Codey: for like 10 or 15 minutes.
(0:05:00) Codey: It's not a big deal.
(0:05:01) Codey: Um, nope.
(0:05:03) Codey: Next morning we wake up and on our like weather outage app, it's like, uh,
(0:05:09) Codey: time estimated time to restoration, to restoration of, of power unknown.
(0:05:16) Kev: Big old shrug
(0:05:18) Codey: Yeah.
(0:05:18) Codey: Big old shrug.
(0:05:19) Codey: And they, it was like right down the street, like there was a power line
(0:05:22) Codey: that was just straight up across the road.
(0:05:24) Codey: And it was like that for a day and a half.
(0:05:28) Codey: So like over 200,000 people in Western Pennsylvania, we're just like out of power.
(0:05:34) Codey: Um, I was out of power for two full days.
(0:05:37) Codey: We had to throw away all of our food.
(0:05:39) Codey: Um, and I was like really grumpy because I had planned on doing all of my chores
(0:05:45) Codey: that Wednesday, I was so excited.
(0:05:46) Kev: Mmm, mmm.
(0:05:48) Codey: that includes like vacuuming and dishes and laundry.
(0:05:53) Codey: I couldn't do any of that stuff.
(0:05:54) Codey: And yeah, it was like the whole town, except for they kicked power
(0:05:57) Codey: on for like some of the businesses, some of the grocery stores.
(0:06:00) Codey: Cause they knew everyone was going to need grocery store stuff.
(0:06:02) Codey: So they made sure that those lines were up and that the like hospital was up and
(0:06:07) Codey: stuff, but most of the residences didn't have power for at least two days.
(0:06:12) Codey: So that was crazy.
(0:06:13) Codey: That was, so that was a reason, um, when they were like, Oh, you
(0:06:17) Codey: want to do news this week?
(0:06:18) Codey: I was like, I still have a lot of stuff to get caught up.
(0:06:22) Kev: Yeah, well, appreciate it, you know, that you managed to strap the baby squirrels to
(0:06:23) Codey: I don't know, but it's fun.
(0:06:25) Codey: Um,
(0:06:30) Kev: a hamster wheel to power your computer to record this.
(0:06:31) Codey: yeah, yeah, they, some of them, the red squirrels would love that actually.
(0:06:34) Kev: I'm sure they would.
(0:06:38) Codey: Um, yeah.
(0:06:39) Codey: So I'm, I did that.
(0:06:40) Codey: That was me for two days.
(0:06:41) Codey: I was straight up roughing it.
(0:06:43) Codey: Um, also I went to a nursery today at plant nursery and I got four different
(0:06:50) Codey: species, not species, four different varieties.
(0:06:52) Codey: of peppers. I got some herbs and I got some tomatoes so it about to be in real
(0:06:56) Kev: ooh peppers okay
(0:07:03) Codey: life farming for me. Yeah.
(0:07:05) Kev: all right that's good stuff so you know back back in many many moons ago when I actually
(0:07:12) Kev: lived in a house with the backyard um we we had a garden and we had and all basically all those
(0:07:18) Kev: things um tomatoes and peppers I forget the other one but um but those are good ones to grow they're
(0:07:20) Codey: Yeah, and I also got kale as well. Yeah, so those are all going to grow in my back. I have like a little area that's kind of closed off. So I'm going to give it a try because we got a shot, a glimpse of what it looks like to be in a post-apocalyptic scenario with no power and having to live on our own, you know.
(0:07:23) Kev: hardy and you can get a lot of them, you know.
(0:07:26) Kev: There you go.
(0:07:43) Kev: Mm-hmm. Off the land. Yep. Yeah. Well, um, that's pretty, well, the power outage thing's
(0:07:50) Codey: Like off the land. So I also, I wanted to garden anyway, but it's a joke.
(0:08:00) Kev: not cool. Like, that's wild. I've never had an, I've extended power outage, I guess, like
(0:08:04) Codey: Yeah, it was it was cool for a while, I just realized like I listeners I entreat you to take a moment, you can pause this for like a minute or something after I post this, think about what you do that requires electricity, and then just don't touch that for a day.
(0:08:05) Kev: couple hours. So that's, that's a lot to hear, but I'm glad you're out of it. Okay. Son's
(0:08:26) Kev: I mean, yeah, everything.
(0:08:29) Kev: We're the brain rot termly online.
(0:08:34) Kev: But even aside from that, yeah, I'm
(0:08:37) Kev: living in an apartment complex.
(0:08:39) Kev: Everything is electric for me.
(0:08:40) Codey: Yeah, I got all like yep alt might our stove is electric all of our lights clearly are electric
(0:08:42) Kev: Even my stove, I'd be out.
(0:08:44) Kev: Yep.
(0:08:49) Codey: Couldn't do any cleaning couldn't do like I was trying to use my phone as little as possible
(0:08:56) Codey: but I could take it like I could jump in my car and like
(0:08:56) Kev: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
(0:09:00) Codey: Drive around but I'm sure there were probably gas shortages because everyone was trying to power their generators
(0:09:07) Codey: But yeah, I was like wow a lot of my life is
(0:09:11) Codey: That so I did a lot of yard work
(0:09:13) Kev: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure the the challenge I think would for at least in my scenario would be the food because
(0:09:20) Kev: You know, we we're you can't go out because restaurants are gonna be down too, right? So
(0:09:26) Codey: A lot of the restaurants were down and then the second day when some of the stuff had jumped back up, all the restaurants were swamped because everyone was going out to the restaurants.
(0:09:34) Kev: Yeah, of course, of course, of course, yeah, but yeah
(0:09:38) Codey: Yeah, so you can't, you can't really do that.
(0:09:42) Kev: So you did non
(0:09:43) Kev: perishable stuff that's ready to eat and won't go bad. So like, I hope you have a lot of fruit,
(0:09:44) Codey: Yep.
(0:09:48) Codey: It was boring.
(0:09:50) Kev: I guess a cereal I don't know because you can't even have the cold milk. Nevermind.
(0:09:52) Codey: I can't yeah our milk went bad real fast, so.
(0:09:56) Kev: Yeah, no. Um, yeah, I don't even like break out the the spam. I don't even know.
(0:09:56) Codey: Yeah.
(0:10:06) Codey: I pretty much, I got chips.
(0:10:07) Kev: Can you eat spam out of the can? Yeah.
(0:10:09) Codey: I got like a thing of chips.
(0:10:10) Codey: So like of little individual packages of chips.
(0:10:13) Codey: So I have that.
(0:10:14) Codey: I bought Chewy bars, like granola bars.
(0:10:16) Kev: Oh, all of those are good. Yep. One of the bars. That's good. Yeah.
(0:10:19) Codey: And that's all I bought.
(0:10:22) Codey: Because then after that, we just got like some fast,
(0:10:26) Codey: but even the fast food lines were like so long.
(0:10:30) Kev: Yeah, of course. Of course.
(0:10:30) Codey: It was crazy.
(0:10:33) Codey: Yeah.
(0:10:33) Codey: The only other thing that I've been up to
(0:10:37) Codey: Breath of the Wild.
(0:10:39) Codey: And then now that we have power again,
(0:10:41) Codey: suddenly there's a new season of Fortnite
(0:10:43) Codey: and it is all Star Wars themed.
(0:10:46) Kev: Oh, is is glub shadow in it?
(0:10:47) Codey: So I don't know what that is.
(0:10:51) Codey: I'm not a Star Wars human.
(0:10:53) Codey: I don't like Star Wars.
(0:10:54) Codey: So you're gonna send me a picture.
(0:10:56) Kev: OK, hold on, let me just pronounce it correctly.
(0:10:59) Kev: No, no, it's it's so it's a it's a meme
(0:11:05) Kev: just because.
(0:11:07) Kev: Yeah, because obviously Star Wars have all these goofy dumb names or whatever.
(0:11:12) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:11:12) Kev: There's the running gag of Guelp's shadow of just being a made-up name-slash-
(0:11:16) Kev: character and always saying, "Oh, I love Guelp's shadow. He's my favorite Star Wars
(0:11:20) Kev: character just because he sounds like a real one." But yeah, Star Wars. I mean, that makes sense that
(0:11:22) Codey: Got it, okay, cool
(0:11:28) Kev: the third one movie came out. I'm not that big of a Star Wars person, but yeah, sure. Why not?
(0:11:34) Codey: Yeah. So that is the short version of what I expected to do. Oh, what have you got, Toucan?
(0:11:35) Kev: I mean, it's cool. I respect it. I just, I've never really watched much, many of the movies.
(0:11:42) Kev: Yeah.
(0:11:49) Kev: She didn't get into how she had to kill the bear for survival.
(0:11:54) Codey: Yeah, didn't get into any of that. Or my knitting. I've been knitting a lot, but it's fine. You
(0:11:58) Kev: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, good stuff. All right. Well, over here, I have had power. So,
(0:11:58) Codey: You have to go to the Slack for that information, kids.
(0:12:08) Kev: you know, a different experience. Going to roll that in. Just going to show off all the power I
(0:12:10) Codey: - Wow.
(0:12:12) Kev: have here. Okay. Okay.
(0:12:16) Kev: So it's been busy week. So it's endless zone zero. I mean, I've played daily. I don't talk about it much because most of the time it's like it's a new character I like about, but nobody cares about. So whatever. But this past update this past week or the week before was a big one. Because it was the final, final update for season one stuff. Season one had this whole storyline plot lines connected. And so the next update, we're going to get a whole new
(0:12:46) Kev: batch of stories and characters and all new no, no, no dangling threads, really. So it's good. That's, that's kind of cool. And the character that dropped with this update, her name is Vivian. She is a kind of like Victorian gothic, you know, big, not super big. She's got a dress with a big, like, almost hoop skirt looking thing and an umbrella, you know what I'm talking about. And she's got pointy ears. So
(0:13:16) Kev: it's kind of vampire ish gothic, like I said, style that they're going for her. And so she's fun. But what I really like about her is that under the dress, there's actually a bunch of rockets strapped under there. So she'll launch yourself into the sky, and then launch yourself down at people, which is really funny. So yeah, she's she's great. I love Vivian. She's also hilarious, because she's something of a fanboy of the main character that you're playing as. And it's really, really funny.
(0:13:26) Codey: Okay.
(0:13:44) Kev: But anyways, yeah.
(0:13:46) Kev: I'm just they did show a trailer for season two and there's all sorts of new characters and stuff including a playable panda, which I'm looking forward to but but yeah, that's that's that's my gotcha corner for myself.
(0:14:01) Kev: Let's see the other okay I picked up a new game this week actually.
(0:14:05) Kev: rat topia do you do you remember this one? Oh, we've talked about it on the show. I don't know if I'm in the episode you were on, but are you familiar.
(0:14:06) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:14:11) Codey: Yeah, yeah
(0:14:14) Kev: So, yeah, so for people who may not.
(0:14:16) Kev: I don't remember, it's very Terraria like, right, like the 2D slice of earth, you see everything, but you control a rat princess queen, and you are establishing a new rat city village kingdom thing.
(0:14:34) Kev: So it's great because it's, again, very Terraria like, but as the leader, you get to command the people who move into your town, you actually get to command them to go.
(0:14:46) Kev: Do this job, do, you know, mine here, do this, you're now the logger, whatever.
(0:14:48) Codey: Hmm.
(0:14:52) Kev: So that part is really cool. That really excited me because I love when you actually get to command people and they do stuff in these games, right?
(0:14:58) Codey: Yeah.
(0:15:00) Kev: And I like rats. The art style is cute. But, you know, I like little critters in general. So that was fun.
(0:15:08) Kev: And the game's good, but it also can be really hard. It turns out running a kingdom is really hard because sometimes.
(0:15:12) Codey: Mmm
(0:15:16) Kev: You have to defend from zombie rats invading your town. You have to manage an economy. Do you know how fun that is to figure out how much you should be taxing or subsidizing?
(0:15:26) Codey: Nope.
(0:15:28) Codey: That does not sound fun.
(0:15:30) Kev: It's wild. I've had to start over a few times because I just backed myself into a corner of unsavable. I destroyed the kingdom.
(0:15:42) Kev: So, yeah, that, you know, kind of like the real life car, I mean, it's just...
(0:15:46) Kev: I can just restart the politics, yeah.
(0:15:53) Kev: But yeah, that's Rhetopia.
(0:15:54) Kev: Overall, it's a great game, two thumbs up from me.
(0:15:58) Kev: I hear other people are interested in this game
(0:16:00) Kev: and may talk about it and play it
(0:16:02) Kev: and discuss it at length somewhere.
(0:16:05) Kev: So yeah, keep an eye out for that.
(0:16:08) Kev: And the other one, so lastly, not game specific,
(0:16:14) Kev: But, uh, oh.
(0:16:16) Kev: Uh, this past, a couple of days ago, I went, I went out to the club.
(0:16:20) Kev: I don't go very often, but I liked the club.
(0:16:22) Kev: Um, I liked to dance.
(0:16:24) Kev: Um, I, yeah.
(0:16:24) Codey: Okay, awesome!
(0:16:26) Kev: Um, so it was a solo trip.
(0:16:29) Kev: It was just me.
(0:16:31) Kev: Um, I was like, you know what?
(0:16:32) Kev: I've been, I've had a very stressful couple of weeks.
(0:16:34) Kev: I was like, you know, I'm going to get away for a day and go for a night out.
(0:16:38) Kev: And then I had fun or whatever.
(0:16:40) Kev: Um, I went to the, uh, club by the.
(0:16:46) Kev: Area I went to is very college heavy.
(0:16:48) Kev: Um, so, um, I, at first when I got there, I think I got there, no, not I think
(0:16:48) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:16:53) Kev: I did get there a little too early.
(0:16:54) Kev: So I thought, you know what?
(0:16:55) Kev: Maybe this was a bad call.
(0:16:56) Kev: Cause you know, the semester's are ending for colleges.
(0:16:59) Kev: I don't know.
(0:16:59) Kev: People aren't going to be there.
(0:17:00) Kev: Um, but it did populate eventually.
(0:17:03) Kev: Um, and now I'm only 30, what am I two?
(0:17:04) Codey: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter anymore.
(0:17:08) Kev: No, yeah, 30.
(0:17:09) Kev: Yeah, 30.
(0:17:09) Kev: Yeah.
(0:17:09) Kev: No, I forget after 26, I lose track.
(0:17:12) Kev: Um, yeah, yeah, right.
(0:17:14) Kev: So I'm.
(0:17:16) Kev: Not, yeah, yeah.
(0:17:17) Kev: So I'm not old, but especially in this college heavy area, I feel old
(0:17:20) Kev: man at the club, just, just a wee bit.
(0:17:24) Kev: I'm laying out there in my slacks and a little vest.
(0:17:26) Kev: I'm looking, you know, I'm feeling snappy, but everyone else are the
(0:17:30) Kev: majest majority of people are college aged kids with t-shirts and the shorts
(0:17:34) Kev: and whatever, so I'm sticking out.
(0:17:36) Kev: Um, but, uh, but overall I still had fun.
(0:17:39) Kev: Um, I just, okay, here's my biggest old man thing.
(0:17:44) Kev: All right, embrace yourself.
(0:17:44) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:17:46) Kev: Um, I, um, so I'm a single guy, right?
(0:17:46) Codey: Okay.
(0:17:49) Kev: And, you know, obviously with heading out to the club, one of the things is like,
(0:17:53) Kev: you know, maybe I'll find someone to dance with, right?
(0:17:56) Kev: Cause that's, that's just the thing.
(0:17:57) Kev: Or so I thought because, uh, I struck out all night and that's, that's fine.
(0:17:58) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(0:18:02) Kev: That happens.
(0:18:03) Kev: And you know, whatever, but after talking to other people, apparently the scene
(0:18:07) Kev: has kind of changed, like everyone's just going up in groups or, or people very
(0:18:14) Kev: We rarely actually
(0:18:16) Kev: like reach out to strangers or accept the strangers to dance with and apparently you
(0:18:23) Kev: gotta like you know meet up beforehand or you know you're meet up online and decide
(0:18:28) Kev: to do so or whatever but that's just that's that again that's just me old manning here
(0:18:32) Kev: like I'm I'm just shocked to see that the the the scene has changed as it will or as
(0:18:39) Kev: it were
(0:18:39) Codey: - Dating, dating is awful.
(0:18:43) Codey: Yeah, I, when I was dating,
(0:18:46) Codey: even like five years ago, I hated it.
(0:18:48) Codey: - Yeah, no, it was awful.
(0:18:50) Kev: Yeah, yeah, but um, but yeah, that's just like I'm I'm too on hip to
(0:19:00) Kev: Yeah, I'm I'm out of it. I'm it's it's all the zoomers. I can't keep up with them
(0:19:07) Kev: That their fortnight dances in the floss
(0:19:11) Kev: All right, that's all I got
(0:19:15) Kev: Alright, let's get to let's get to I know what you're at least
(0:19:20) Kev: last month or monthly segment where we talk about stuff that just came out, but before we do,
(0:19:23) Codey: No, I didn't know there was a new one.
(0:19:24) Kev: did you see the trailer for I know what you did last summer the new one?
(0:19:30) Kev: Yeah, our you know, obviously what we're riffing off here for the title segment that movie got a
(0:19:37) Kev: I don't sequel reboot thing it's it's it's it's that trend where it's reusing the original title
(0:19:44) Kev: just called I know what you did last summer and it's you know the same premise but oh look there's
(0:19:50) Kev: original character who is it Sarah Michelle Keller I think it is I don't remember the original actress
(0:19:56) Kev: from the original oh and she's there older and she's gonna be helping out and and you know it's
(0:20:01) Kev: it's just the rehash that Hollywood has been doing with all especially a lot of horror movies it feels
(0:20:05) Kev: like but yeah I just just want to point out that I got a trailer I haven't watched any of the other
(0:20:12) Kev: ones so whatever but it's just interesting
(0:20:14) Codey: Yeah, I don't mind like when they do that stuff. So I really love the scream franchise.
(0:20:20) Kev: yeah the scream one seemed to do I hadn't seen the newer ones but that seemed pretty well done how
(0:20:26) Kev: they did it yeah all right there you go that first scream is really good like I get it when
(0:20:28) Codey: So yeah, 10 out of 10.
(0:20:36) Codey: Yeah, we.
(0:20:36) Kev: I watched it the first time I was like oh okay I get it um okay uh all right not for games that
(0:20:45) Kev: Come on, non-horror games, Cottage Court games, if you don't like those, do you?
(0:20:45) Codey: Mm-hmm, yeah.
(0:20:50) Kev: If you like those movies, you might like this.
(0:20:52) Kev: Alright, first of all, Bugaboo Pocket, what I call the Bugagotchi game, because it's 2D pixel style, very detailed, very gorgeous looking sprite work of bugs, and you pet them and do games with them.
(0:21:02) Codey: Mm hmm. It was so good. I'm like still so tempted to get that but I will I will I will hold off.
(0:21:18) Kev: There's, there is a lot I will say. There's Tarot, there's also it looks like a Fruit Ninja game, and a lot of petting of bugs, they're very cute but yeah this, yeah, it looks, well maybe you should get the full release so, so it is as long as you want it to be.
(0:21:26) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:21:31) Codey: Yeah, I played the demo the demo was super good it's just wasn't as long as I wanted it to be
(0:21:43) Kev: Oh, if you look on their Steam page, they have a big, like, Nintendo seal of a period.
(0:21:48) Kev: So now on the flip side, something that is more pocket, as in Polly Pocket, because Tiny
(0:22:09) Kev: Garden came out. The Polly Pocket game, or inspired game, it is a game, not a physical.
(0:22:18) Kev: Thing that you can open, and you garden inside your little Polly Pocket world, and you kind of
(0:22:23) Kev: rearrange and decorate and all that good stuff. I have not played this game. It looks a lot like a
(0:22:32) Kev: game called Garden Galaxy that I did play, which was fine. I think it looks very cute, this Tiny
(0:22:38) Kev: Garden. It looks well done, but yeah, go check that out if you're interested. The gardens are
(0:22:46) Kev: So very cute, I will say that.
(0:22:49) Kev: Um, let's see here.
(0:22:51) Kev: Next up, we have Opidum, I think. I think I say it different every time.
(0:22:54) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:22:57) Kev: It is the, what I call, multiplayer pow world-esque equivalent of Breath of the Wild, because it's open world sandbox key.
(0:23:09) Kev: And you know, it has all your usual survival, whatever.
(0:23:13) Kev: Um, but the combat, the combat is just so very clearly Breath of the Wild-ish.
(0:23:18) Kev: Feeling, um, which is fine because, you know, that's a good game to take inspiration from.
(0:23:24) Kev: But, uh, but yeah, um, I, you know, a full 3d game like this being multiplayer co-op,
(0:23:31) Kev: that is pretty cool. I will give them that. Um, so I don't know if I'm going to try it just because
(0:23:36) Kev: I don't have room for it right now, but, uh, good on, uh, good on, uh, E.P. games is the
(0:23:42) Kev: dev. He came out with it and it's finished. Um, well, I say it's finished. It's really
(0:23:48) Kev: released. Um, yeah, and multi multiplayer Breath of the Wild, they're, they're just
(0:23:54) Kev: sound like a neat niche for that. So, um, yeah, good on them. Uh, and then let's see,
(0:24:00) Kev: lastly on our list, we have Dean Come 1.0. This is our survive, again, survival-less life sim game,
(0:24:09) Kev: whatever. Uh, but this time you're, uh, you're in Australia. Um, so you farm, hunt, mine, fish,
(0:24:14) Kev: all that good stuff do do all the Australian things is our
(0:24:18) Kev: friend mark and it may be because as we all know,
(0:24:21) Kev: Australia is a small little island nation and almost really
(0:24:25) Kev: the people they all know each other and just they basically
(0:24:26) Codey: They should, they all know each other.
(0:24:31) Kev: walk by each other every day on their way home. But anyways,
(0:24:36) Kev: but yeah, look, Australia is very cool. I always I adore like
(0:24:39) Kev: reading about as a kid who loved wildlife and animals and Steve
(0:24:43) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:24:44) Kev: Irwin, right? Like Australia was very big in the 90s. And I've
(0:24:46) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:24:47) Kev: read and bought a lot of
(0:24:48) Kev: Australia.
(0:24:49) Codey: Have you seen some of the new photos that Robert Irwin posted?
(0:24:54) Kev: No, what does he do?
(0:24:54) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:24:56) Kev: What is he doing?
(0:24:58) Codey: Don't look at it.
(0:25:00) Kev: Wait, don't why not?
(0:25:02) Codey: Unless you are a housewife that is bored.
(0:25:07) Codey: He posted a risque.
(0:25:08) Kev: Oh, dear.
(0:25:10) Codey: No, it wasn't.
(0:25:11) Kev: Oh, my gosh, I see.
(0:25:11) Codey: It wasn't risque.
(0:25:13) Codey: It was just Robert Irwin in underwear.
(0:25:14) Kev: No, I get it.
(0:25:17) Kev: I i didn't yeah
(0:25:18) Kev: oh that's uh yeah that is underwear those are boxers yep I see it
(0:25:18) Codey: But Instagram was going insane.
(0:25:23) Kev: with him holding it looks like a gila monster or something
(0:25:26) Codey: Yeah, he was also holding a snake at some point.
(0:25:27) Kev: yeah oh wait oh I see oh that snake that's a different one yeah
(0:25:29) Codey: Yeah.
(0:25:31) Codey: He could have a whole calendar.
(0:25:34) Codey: And I'm sure he'd make millions.
(0:25:36) Codey: Yeah, no, I think that the idea of a survival game in Australia--
(0:25:37) Kev: oh that's good
(0:25:43) Codey: why hasn't that happened yet?
(0:25:46) Codey: Why has it taken this long?
(0:25:46) Kev: Yeah, you're right. And it's an Australian pleasant places. This is just my daily lives.
(0:25:58) Kev: This is just the Sims. This isn't anything special. No, but but yeah, I mean, all you know,
(0:26:05) Kev: all joking, the Australia danger death zone aside, you know, it has the wide variety of unique floor
(0:26:13) Kev: and faunus that makes for I think doesn't make great for
(0:26:16) Kev: great setting for this kind of game although you know fighting the boss shark is kind of ridiculous
(0:26:22) Kev: but in a fun way um so yeah that's dinkum 1.0 um it is again much like op-ed you can play co-op
(0:26:30) Kev: with people um that is out right now um 1.0 um there's lots of stuff go check out the link you
(0:26:39) Kev: know where to find all that stuff um okay yep there you go let's talk
(0:26:43) Codey: And that's what released last month.
(0:26:47) Kev: stuff that didn't release next month but supposedly releasing in the future supposedly
(0:26:54) Kev: all right harvest moon double pack of ports um we have sky tree uh lost valley and sky tree village
(0:27:04) Kev: being released uh as a double pack um for uh let's see I don't know switch is that what it is okay
(0:27:13) Kev: Yeah that makes sense. It is getting a...
(0:27:17) Kev: A physical release through the Natsume store, that's where it is, yeah through the Natsume store.
(0:27:24) Kev: You can get a physical copy including an acrylic standee which I don't think looks particularly noteworthy or nice, but there you go if you're interested.
(0:27:30) Codey: Yeah, but I mean maybe if this was a game that someone really liked then that's that's cool for them
(0:27:35) Kev: Yeah, yeah, but do those people exist though?
(0:27:37) Codey: But I
(0:27:39) Codey: Don't know not to me just trying to milk the cash cow as long as they can
(0:27:45) Kev: the literal cash cow.
(0:27:46) Codey: Yeah
(0:27:48) Kev: I will give them this. They've done a dang good job because it's been a hot minute since they just did the localization,
(0:27:56) Kev: but they're still running. It is so good. I respect that hustle.
(0:28:04) Codey: So yeah, 3rd of July if folks are interested in that.
(0:28:06) Kev: Oh, thank you. Yeah, the date. I guess that matters.
(0:28:12) Kev: Um, next up, all right, here is a game I do care about though.
(0:28:15) Kev: Actually, let's talk about.
(0:28:16) Kev: Cattle Country, um, your 2d pixel art Western frontier, um, Stardew ish like where you're, you're doing all the things, um, and you can little bit Oregon Trail, a little bit Stardew Valley, I guess, I don't know, but, uh, yeah, um, it comes, it is releasing on May 27th, um, which that is very close.
(0:28:35) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:28:41) Codey: Ooh, that's close.
(0:28:44) Kev: Um, that's a bad time. That's always a busy time.
(0:28:46) Kev: Um, yeah, that's, that's a couple of weeks. Um, I'm looking forward to it and I'll be
(0:28:47) Codey: Okay.
(0:28:48) Codey: Did you, like, back it or anything, or you haven't bought it yet?
(0:28:53) Codey: Okay.
(0:29:14) Kev: playing it. Keep your eyes.
(0:29:16) Kev: Ears peeled, I guess. I don't know how to peel ears. But here we are. Let's see. Now we have
(0:29:29) Kev: the next game, 2Pixellia, that is out now. This is, yeah, May 1st, it just released. This one is a
(0:29:32) Codey: Mm hmm. Yep.
(0:29:43) Kev: again pixel art to the kind of city
(0:29:47) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah, this is the one that doesn't know what it wants to be,
(0:29:47) Kev: simulator I guess um yeah
(0:29:53) Codey: and there's so many different things in it. I believe Al backed this one, so he has it.
(0:29:59) Kev: that's a safe bet
(0:29:59) Codey: We'll probably hear about it, but watching the trailer and stuff, I was just so like...
(0:30:06) Kev: it's it's a lot if it feels like honestly it feels like taking control of
(0:30:12) Kev: one of the sims instead of watching them do
(0:30:14) Codey: Yeah.
(0:30:15) Kev: everything like just playing them you know
(0:30:17) Kev: um so i'll check it out if you want if you want to do
(0:30:22) Kev: crimes you can do crimes so i'll give them that
(0:30:24) Codey: You can do crimes in this game can't break up marriages though.
(0:30:25) Kev: or you can do crimes i'll give them that
(0:30:29) Kev: all right not not yet again that is two pixely and that is
(0:30:35) Kev: out now on steam at least I don't know where else but uh
(0:30:38) Kev: there you go all right let's get into games that already
(0:30:43) Kev: did come out but now have more stuff coming out
(0:30:47) Kev: okay okay this first one blew my mind because I thought this game was
(0:30:52) Kev: dead based like not dead but you know done I can
(0:30:54) Codey: Dude, no, this game is not dead.
(0:30:57) Codey: This game slaps.
(0:30:59) Codey: I wanna play it so bad.
(0:30:59) Kev: well I mean yeah I mean i'm not saying that
(0:31:02) Kev: dead like people aren't playing it just I didn't think they were we're gonna get
(0:31:06) Kev: an update but I guess if there is one franchise in
(0:31:09) Kev: the world that can do whatever they want it would be
(0:31:13) Kev: san rio and hello kitty because hello kitty island adventure has
(0:31:17) Kev: not one but two updates well one of them I think
(0:31:21) Kev: came out already um the other one was announced
(0:31:25) Kev: Um, so there is the first one is
(0:31:29) Kev: the, um, friends furniture and frozen peaks expansion. Um,
(0:31:34) Kev: I think that's out already. Um, there is, uh,
(0:31:39) Kev: expansions to believe new areas, Blizzard peak and snow village.
(0:31:44) Kev: There are new types of weather flowers, all sorts of new story and cosmetics,
(0:31:49) Kev: um, and more improvements and refinements to the friendship system,
(0:31:53) Kev: which were needed. Um, just, yeah, just a lot of stuff.
(0:31:57) Kev: There's a lot of stuff again.
(0:31:59) Kev: The ice area that's the big one and improvements to the, you know, UIs and experiences. Nice little
(0:32:07) Kev: quality of life touches here and there. All sorts of new furniture and cosmetics.
(0:32:15) Kev: There's some new quests and storylines, all that stuff. Yeah, yeah.
(0:32:20) Codey: Sorry, I I was trying to see what it was available on and it is on Apple Arcade
(0:32:27) Kev: I mean, it's on the Steam page.
(0:32:29) Kev: So I assume it's, yeah.
(0:32:31) Codey: Yeah, so it's on Steam but it's also on Apple Arcade well because on Steam it's only or sorry it's on Steam it's only
(0:32:40) Codey: Windows but then it so to play it on Mac you have to play it in Apple Arcade
(0:32:43) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:32:47) Codey: I'm wondering, so it's also on switch.
(0:32:53) Kev: on everything, I think, right? I'm just gonna... Look, I'm assuming their deep pockets have
(0:32:59) Kev: enabled it to just be out on everything.
(0:33:02) Codey: No, they don't have a Xbox. I was looking for that because I have game pass. Yeah, looking
(0:33:08) Kev: - Oh, well, everything they're on.
(0:33:09) Codey: at this, looking at this like update, the biggest thing that I lost my mind about was
(0:33:14) Codey: Aggretsuko. So they added, it was, I think it was just in the friends furniture and frozen
(0:33:16) Kev: Yeah
(0:33:23) Codey: peaks. One, they added Retsuko. So from the TV show, Aggretsuko, they added.
(0:33:24) Kev: Yeah
(0:33:30) Kev: Well retzeko was in already
(0:33:32) Codey: But her friends and coworkers are now.
(0:33:35) Kev: That's correct
(0:33:36) Kev: But she was the weird one because nobody knew her because she was from a different part of the scenario verse
(0:33:41) Kev: But now yes the supporting ritz a gretzeko cast is here
(0:33:46) Kev: I haven't watched the anime so I can't get hyped, but I'm kind of hyped because it's cool
(0:33:50) Kev: I like the anime without watching it. It's a good concept
(0:33:54) Codey: I friggin love that anime. Well, because I love metal, so it like tickles that fancy.
(0:34:01) Codey: Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, the other update is called the month of meh.
(0:34:02) Kev: Yep, I'll do it
(0:34:07) Kev: But
(0:34:10) Kev: Okay, I just got to say when I saw this I thought that was I'll know it I was like wow I'll jam
(0:34:15) Codey: See, I thought I was saying like, eh, this game sucks. And then I looked, I was like, oh no, it's literally.
(0:34:17) Kev: Don't like this update, huh?
(0:34:24) Codey: Called the month of meh. And there's Gudetama as. Oh, okay.
(0:34:25) Kev: The next up is called month of man
(0:34:32) Kev: As good atomic it's a good atomic festival of sorts right cuz
(0:34:38) Kev: yeah, because the Hello Kitty Island adventure does like kind of like Animal Crossing where you know special events or
(0:34:45) Kev: Theirs are usually like maybe a week or two. Whatever like oh, here's the
(0:34:50) Kev: Chinese New Year's the Christmas is the Halloween whatever right they do their monthly your seasonal events and this appears to be one of those
(0:34:54) Codey: This, this character that's dressed as an egg yolk though, a nisetami-san.
(0:34:57) Kev: from a night what I saw
(0:35:02) Kev: I
(0:35:04) Kev: Don't know who that is. Is that a Sandra Hill character because okay, cuz everyone knows Goude Thomas the lazy egg with the butt
(0:35:05) Codey: I don't like it.
(0:35:07) Codey: I don't like it.
(0:35:11) Kev: All right, he's it's a little the little guy, right? It's like, you know standard chicken egg and the little guy is that
(0:35:18) Kev: But this guy
(0:35:20) Kev: He said Thomas son. No, that is a full grown
(0:35:24) Codey: That's a person, and it's in a weird costume, and I don't like that.
(0:35:24) Kev: sized human man in a
(0:35:28) Kev: You know like yellow
(0:35:32) Kev: Jump not jumps, you know, it's those weird Halloween costumes
(0:35:34) Codey: body suits. Yeah. That's a choice.
(0:35:36) Kev: Yeah, the bodysuits that are the single colors and he's dressed up like Gudetama, but he's got a very
(0:35:43) Kev: Bland face. I don't I don't know how to
(0:35:46) Codey: the face is honestly the worst part like if if it was like a normal face I would be like
(0:35:51) Codey: oh it's a person but the face I'm just like what is happening um
(0:35:55) Kev: Yeah, no, I'm looking this up, this is not new, this is a Sanrio.
(0:35:59) Codey: I'm sure it's a character I just it's character I didn't know and I would love to go back to
(0:36:01) Kev: Yup.
(0:36:03) Kev: It's a man dressed as Gudetama, so there you go.
(0:36:06) Codey: I'd love to go back to five minutes ago when I did not know what six things existed
(0:36:12) Kev: He's got very thick eyebrows.
(0:36:14) Kev: That might be part of the problem.
(0:36:16) Codey: I don't know I don't know
(0:36:19) Kev: Well, there you go.
(0:36:19) Kev: There's the month of May.
(0:36:21) Kev: It's through the month of May.
(0:36:24) Kev: You get it?
(0:36:25) Kev: You get it?
(0:36:25) Kev: I don't know if that was their intention,
(0:36:27) Codey: it's gonna be meth
(0:36:27) Kev: but whatever worked out.
(0:36:29) Kev: You know what's not-- well, actually, I'm
(0:36:31) Kev: sure the update itself is not meh.
(0:36:33) Kev: But you know what else is not meh?
(0:36:35) Kev: These new games actually-- no, they're all right.
(0:36:36) Codey: Oh, no, we got another update.
(0:36:39) Kev: Oh, I did skip one.
(0:36:41) Kev: Whoopsie.
(0:36:41) Codey: There was another update, but it's only the 0.5 update,
(0:36:42) Kev: Oh yeah.
(0:36:45) Codey: y'all, so don't worry.
(0:36:46) Codey: It's not really--
(0:36:50) Codey: it's not a real update.
(0:36:51) Codey: No, it's fine.
(0:36:53) Codey: The game Far Lands has a 0.5 update
(0:36:56) Codey: that adds a bunch of stuff, including
(0:36:58) Codey: hostile mobs in the mines, a new mine
(0:37:01) Codey: that you can go to, 10 new social events, Steam Deck
(0:37:05) Codey: support, uh, furniture.
(0:37:06) Codey: I didn't, I haven't really looked at this game before, you kind of just look like a zombie.
(0:37:14) Kev: yeah you look like a weird uh yeah a lot of the other characters because you crash line on like
(0:37:20) Kev: an alien planet and they're all alien zombie-ish in appearance I i I agree um but uh yeah okay it
(0:37:29) Kev: feels a little space tardewy but it has a little more flavor it has a little more sauce as the kids
(0:37:34) Kev: call it um like uh it I that's what I hear look I still tutor kids okay you know okay
(0:37:36) Codey: Is that what the kids are calling it?
(0:37:44) Kev: tangent hey shocker me cody you're going to tangent but okay look I know every generation
(0:37:46) Codey: Tangent, boom, boom, boom, boom.
(0:37:52) Kev: our generation and everyone has their slang and lingo and and bads and whatever right
(0:37:58) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:37:59) Kev: but that I think i've been thinking about this because as I tutor right like I see the the next
(0:38:05) Kev: generation of kids or it's also i'm like a couple cycles in at this point really um because i've
(0:38:10) Kev: tutored for so dang long it's it's gotten horrendous the the skipper
(0:38:15) Kev: generation as i'm gonna call it because I think that's the emblematic uh term and and
(0:38:16) Codey: Yeah, it's it's the brain rot generation. So they, they say like the they they're that
(0:38:22) Kev: yes the brain rot generation there too
(0:38:26) Codey: what they're going to watch is just brain rot and just cringe. And like, yeah, they
(0:38:28) Kev: yep yep all that like I i don't either it's not and like
(0:38:31) Codey: I don't get it. It's not entertaining to me.
(0:38:39) Kev: the issue isn't even the stuff itself per se I mean a little bit but you know like that's i
(0:38:43) Kev: I think also just kind of.
(0:38:44) Kev: The nature of the generations, like our parents didn't get our stuff either or whatever, right?
(0:38:49) Kev: Um, but it just feels like so much more prevalent and ingrained and, and virulent than, uh, than other generations.
(0:39:01) Codey: Verilent. It's a virus, the brain rot virus.
(0:39:01) Kev: And I've been thinking about it really.
(0:39:03) Kev: Yeah, it really is.
(0:39:06) Kev: And, and it's, I've been thinking like, how should I put this right?
(0:39:11) Kev: So when you and I grew up, let's say, right in our middle school.
(0:39:14) Kev: I'm a school, whatever, right?
(0:39:15) Kev: Like there are the fads and there's the playground speak and it would spread or whatever, right?
(0:39:19) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:39:20) Kev: But it was still kind of contained to our local area, right?
(0:39:22) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:39:24) Kev: Because we didn't have the internet, but I think about it.
(0:39:27) Kev: Like, I think that's the issue, right?
(0:39:29) Kev: All these kids have their phones and the same app.
(0:39:32) Kev: So like, it's all so homogenized.
(0:39:35) Kev: Like, I think that's just why like every single kid knows it and watches the same thing.
(0:39:42) Kev: Like, it's, it's insane.
(0:39:44) Kev: Oh, my gosh. Oh.
(0:39:46) Codey: Yeah, that's a whole other story about like whether or not that stuff is helping or harming
(0:39:54) Codey: the socialization of the next generation.
(0:39:58) Kev: Mm-hmm. That's a, that is a good one.
(0:39:59) Codey: That's something I've been thinking about a lot lately as like, more discussions about
(0:40:01) Kev: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
(0:40:04) Codey: autism come out and stuff and like having been, you know, diagnosed as a autistic adult
(0:40:10) Codey: at this point.
(0:40:12) Codey: Um, yeah, but.
(0:40:14) Kev: Yeah, it's
(0:40:16) Kev: And it's tough because we you know, we're not gonna have all the data until later right like it's gonna be tougher kind of
(0:40:23) Kev: Speculating but um, it's it's it's what to see
(0:40:27) Kev: and but I you know
(0:40:28) Codey: Well, that's Far Lands.
(0:40:30) Kev: As about yeah, there you go, there's your point five update for for this it's out now
(0:40:32) Codey: Pull us back.
(0:40:33) Codey: Pull us back.
(0:40:37) Codey: It's out now.
(0:40:38) Codey: If you want a hostile mob, if you've
(0:40:40) Codey: been waiting for steam support, they're there.
(0:40:44) Kev: Achievements, they're in there, too.
(0:40:47) Codey: They are there.
(0:40:49) Kev: All right, let's talk--
(0:40:51) Kev: those are the updates.
(0:40:53) Kev: Let's talk about some new game announcements.
(0:40:54) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:40:55) Kev: Let's talk about "Scibbity Island."
(0:40:57) Codey: No!
(0:40:59) Codey: We were leaving it.
(0:41:00) Codey: We were leaving it.
(0:41:02) Kev: No, it's here to stay.
(0:41:03) Codey: No, Sunseed, Sunseed Island.
(0:41:05) Kev: OK.
(0:41:07) Kev: OK, yeah, "Sunseed Island."
(0:41:10) Kev: OK, first of all, this is insanely cute art style.
(0:41:14) Kev: Whoever their art team is, they're
(0:41:18) Kev: knocking out of the park.
(0:41:20) Kev: The actual game itself, you're playing
(0:41:22) Kev: as a little cat with a little Pikmin-style flower
(0:41:25) Kev: star on your head.
(0:41:27) Kev: And you're rebuilding your town.
(0:41:29) Kev: You're farming.
(0:41:30) Kev: You're fishing.
(0:41:31) Kev: You're exploring islands.
(0:41:35) Kev: A lot of the hallmarks of the cottage core verse,
(0:41:37) Kev: what can I say?
(0:41:38) Kev: There's different-- it looks like--
(0:41:40) Kev: I think it's kind of like Animal Crossing,
(0:41:42) Kev: where you can sail to different islands,
(0:41:43) Kev: and there might be different environments.
(0:41:44) Kev: It's coming on April 24th on the eShop, actually.
(0:41:51) Kev: Wait, what?
(0:41:53) Kev: Wait, April 24th?
(0:41:54) Codey: Oh, so it's already out.
(0:41:55) Kev: Is that already out?
(0:41:56) Codey: It's already out.
(0:41:57) Kev: Oh, yeah, it is sale ends.
(0:42:00) Codey: Yeah, so it's already out.
(0:42:02) Codey: Yeah, the little things on top-- they all have little Pikmin.
(0:42:06) Codey: It's not just your character.
(0:42:07) Codey: All the characters look like they
(0:42:08) Kev: Yeah.
(0:42:09) Codey: have little Pikmin-y things.
(0:42:10) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:42:11) Codey: Very cute.
(0:42:12) Kev: Yeah.
(0:42:14) Codey: And so their blurb for it is, welcome to Sunseed Island,
(0:42:18) Codey: the perfect escape for cozy gamers who love
(0:42:20) Codey: to farm, explore, and collect.
(0:42:24) Codey: Rebuild a lost village, befriend magical creatures, grow crops,
(0:42:27) Codey: fish and tranquil waters, and upgrade your tools,
(0:42:29) Codey: discover the secrets of a mystical tree,
(0:42:31) Codey: and reconnect the scattered islands.
(0:42:35) Codey: I could read that for so many different of these games.
(0:42:38) Kev: Okay.
(0:42:41) Codey: Yeah, it looks cute.
(0:42:43) Codey: Looks like all the other ones, unless you'd
(0:42:46) Codey: want to play as a cat, then here you go.
(0:42:47) Kev: Yep. Yeah.
(0:42:49) Codey: So the price, though, was confusing.
(0:42:54) Codey: So on May--
(0:42:55) Kev: I mean it's um well right it's on sale on the us e-shop for three dollars that's 72% off i'm
(0:42:58) Codey: yeah, go for it.
(0:43:04) Kev: too lazy to do the math that's maybe what like 10 bucks maybe um yeah it's something like that
(0:43:10) Kev: usd uh I can't see this because I don't have the uke shop but
(0:43:14) Kev: per one of al's notes apparently it is 100 off on the uke shop so
(0:43:18) Codey: I feel like they probably fixed that because the note out so Al said that he got it for free
(0:43:24) Codey: because it was it was literally free on the eShop so he got that um and then the note that he left
(0:43:25) Kev: yep
(0:43:28) Kev: I i don't blame him
(0:43:33) Codey: for the US eShop was that it was 90% off but then I looked and it's definitely 72% off so
(0:43:36) Kev: So, sounds like some numbers were crossed and buttons were pushed incorrectly.
(0:43:47) Codey: Y'all should--
(0:43:49) Codey: Y'all should check this.
(0:43:50) Kev: It's on sale somewhere.
(0:43:52) Kev: You can go get it for cheap right now, we'll tell you that much.
(0:43:54) Codey: Yeah, check this regularly.
(0:43:57) Codey: Maybe they just are flipping a dice or something,
(0:44:00) Codey: like throwing a dart at a board.
(0:44:01) Kev: Maybe they put the wrong sign on.
(0:44:07) Kev: It happened to me at the store, not just once multiple times, but they had something on sale and it wasn't on sale, it made me sad because it was like boxes of cereal, it was like buy two, get three free, it was like wow that's a great deal, and then I went to the register like no that's wrong, and I was like oh, I guess I won't get my cereal.
(0:44:24) Codey: So check it out if you like the idea of a stardew where you're a Pikmin cat.
(0:44:31) Kev: Yeah, but you know it kills me that
(0:44:33) Codey: The next s s island.
(0:44:37) Kev: Okay, okay, you know you want to get into all right. Let's get into that because what I was gonna say for both of these games
(0:44:43) Kev: We went from was it sunseed Island to star sand Island, right? And
(0:44:46) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(0:44:50) Kev: Look, you know
(0:44:51) Kev: It's a tough market. I get it right like you got to stand out
(0:44:56) Kev: It's tough and you know what there's redeeming qualities here both of these
(0:44:59) Kev: I'm not- I'm not gonna say these are off.
(0:45:01) Kev: That's awful, but I'm- I'm already loading the gun and ready to drag you out behind the barn for using those names because no, no.
(0:45:06) Codey: S-- yeah, for a lack of originality, for sure.
(0:45:13) Kev: You went with the Noun Noun island slash valley, which is- is-
(0:45:17) Codey: S-- like, nouns that start with S.
(0:45:20) Kev: And then you start with S, both of you, like, oh my gosh, what is- you know what, maybe- maybe the Skibitty kids aren't so bad.
(0:45:23) Codey: Yeah.
(0:45:31) Codey: This one does look different, though.
(0:45:33) Codey: So the blurb of it, again, is basic.
(0:45:36) Codey: So it's leave the hustle of the city behind
(0:45:38) Codey: and embrace life on Starsand Island.
(0:45:40) Codey: Fish, farm, raise animals, and befriend or fall in love
(0:45:43) Codey: with locals to learn their secrets,
(0:45:44) Codey: customize your world with our DIY system,
(0:45:46) Codey: and invite friends to help build your dream paradise.
(0:45:49) Codey: So the invite friends to help build
(0:45:51) Codey: is kind of hinting at a co-playing thing,
(0:45:58) Codey: playing with other people.
(0:45:59) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right, because that's a big one. This one is not your 2D Stardew,
(0:46:00) Codey: But I don't quite see it yet.
(0:46:02) Codey: The thing-- the art style, though.
(0:46:08) Kev: like it is full 3D. It is a Japanese developer. Seed Lab, I think they're new. But it feels
(0:46:18) Kev: Story of Seasons-esque, I would say. That's probably a much closer comparison. And there's
(0:46:24) Kev: a lot of production and polish into this. It looks great. There's a giant watermelon,
(0:46:26) Codey: Yeah. Yeah, the watermelon is pretty large.
(0:46:29) Kev: size of your average human. There's copy bearers and squirrels. Visually, this great game has
(0:46:36) Kev: a lot going for it. I will say that. Yeah, again, Room Factory, maybe more than Story
(0:46:37) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:46:40) Codey: Yeah, I think it looks like 3D anime farming.
(0:46:45) Codey: Looks-- probably.
(0:46:47) Kev: of Seasons, probably closer to Room Factory-ish. They got your fishing in there. You got a
(0:46:55) Kev: potential, it looks like hinting at a romance already.
(0:47:00) Kev: So yeah, it's, it's, it's well trodden ground, but it does
(0:47:05) Kev: look competently made. I will say that. So, you know, check.
(0:47:07) Codey: - Yeah, I really liked that the squirrel,
(0:47:11) Codey: you can like befriend the squirrel
(0:47:13) Codey: and it can run all over you and like jump on your shoulder.
(0:47:18) Codey: And that is such a squirrel thing.
(0:47:20) Codey: I, they will run all over you 100%.
(0:47:20) Kev: That's hilarious. That's great. I have not had, sadly, I've not had close contact with
(0:47:26) Codey: If you let them, they will walk all over you.
(0:47:35) Kev: a squirrel like that. I'm, yes, I'm, I look, I, I'm well aware.
(0:47:36) Codey: I am not, okay, I need PSA, PSA, do not get in contact with wildlife unless they are injured
(0:47:48) Codey: or too young.
(0:47:50) Codey: Oh, I just, I have to say it for other people.
(0:47:50) Kev: I'm not intending to, but I, yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. For sure. I'm just saying, cause
(0:47:58) Kev: I know there's places where you could possibly, in theory, experience, right? Like if I visited
(0:48:04) Kev: Cody at the Wallace and it could, there's a higher chance of, no.
(0:48:06) Codey: Nope, nope, people can't, if you visit the wildlife center, actually you can't even visit
(0:48:14) Codey: the wildlife center, first of all, but if you did, you don't get to touch anything.
(0:48:17) Codey: You have to like go through the training and everything and it's just for the volunteer
(0:48:18) Kev: No, well, I can't okay. Okay, you know what part maybe nuts
(0:48:24) Codey: at your local wildlife center, the squirrels are like the one thing we'd probably throw
(0:48:25) Kev: There you go do that that's how you
(0:48:28) Codey: at people, be like feed this.
(0:48:32) Kev: There you go, I can't I I did feed a giraffe once at a zoo
(0:48:36) Kev: That was nice and in touch it but but it just you know, you know drafts. They have a ridiculous tongue
(0:48:37) Codey: That's pretty, I've never done that.
(0:48:42) Kev: So it just takes the lettuce right out of your hand. Yep. Just slurped it right out
(0:48:43) Codey: Mm-hmm, just schlorp'd.
(0:48:48) Kev: Oh, okay. You know what? You know, it's a great one for animal encounters shout out to the Atlanta Aquarium
(0:48:54) Codey: Mmm, yep.
(0:48:57) Kev: They have some
(0:48:58) Kev: banger animal encounters I
(0:49:00) Kev: Hung out with the sea lion like they'll bring them up to you and they'll make you know
(0:49:06) Kev: They'll do some tricks for you and you can take a photo with the ceiling like, you know
(0:49:10) Kev: Like my arm around the sea lion and it's cool
(0:49:13) Kev: You can dive into the pool. They'll have a pool you can go and I didn't do beluga
(0:49:18) Kev: you can you can hop into the pool with the beluga you can feed penguins at the
(0:49:24) Kev: Atlanta Aquarium Georgia Aquarium banger animal counters
(0:49:27) Codey: Ten well just aquariums in general ten out of ten they got whale sharks. I went there
(0:49:33) Codey: I was there for a soccer game a while back and in like 2019 and
(0:49:34) Kev: Yeah
(0:49:39) Codey: We went we went there because it was just a touristy thing to do while we were there, and it was absolutely amazing
(0:49:44) Kev: Yeah
(0:49:46) Kev: It's probably our best touristy thing I would say I mean, you know that not that other stuff's bad just
(0:49:53) Kev: Georgia aquariums. It's pretty strong. It's good
(0:49:56) Codey: Yeah, it's a strong contender.
(0:49:58) Kev: Yeah, so there you go that's Star Sant Island
(0:50:02) Codey: No, there's more.
(0:50:02) Codey: There's more to Star Sand Island.
(0:50:04) Codey: So it isn't currently live on Kickstarter.
(0:50:06) Codey: There are 26 days left to go at 37% of gold.
(0:50:10) Codey: But the shocking thing, shocking, Al has not backed it.
(0:50:20) Codey: I am-- I'm floored.
(0:50:20) Kev: Well, something will come out to convince him.
(0:50:24) Codey: I'm floored, thank you.
(0:50:26) Codey: No, he's doing so well because that was a thing he wanted to back fewer things.
(0:50:29) Kev: Yeah.
(0:50:34) Codey: Very proud of him.
(0:50:35) Codey: Don't back it out.
(0:50:36) Codey: I'm very proud.
(0:50:37) Kev: Wait, there's a whale shark at the end of this trailer.
(0:50:38) Codey: They're so cool.
(0:50:39) Kev: Take it back.
(0:50:43) Kev: Take it back.
(0:50:43) Codey: Yeah, so that is Star of Saint Island.
(0:50:45) Kev: Go go back the whale shark.
(0:50:46) Kev: OK, I like whale sharks.
(0:50:52) Codey: Those are the new games.
(0:50:54) Kev: I know it's the nature of Kickstarter that some games will just die,
(0:50:58) Kev: some games don't cut it, but it really feels like Sean Young
(0:51:02) Kev: could share just a little, you know?
(0:51:04) Kev: Just a little this way, Sean.
(0:51:06) Codey: Yeah.
(0:51:08) Kev: All right, let's talk about some other stuff.
(0:51:12) Codey: Yeah, just a couple more things here.
(0:51:14) Kev: A few other news items.
(0:51:16) Kev: That's a good name.
(0:51:18) Kev: That's how you name things, games, the frog game.
(0:51:22) Codey: This this sure is a thing that I need to play I
(0:51:26) Codey: Have it I have it
(0:51:28) Kev: It has a soundtrack that came out.
(0:51:32) Kev: It's very cheap. It's like $2 USD.
(0:51:34) Kev: I haven't listened to the soundtrack, so I can't say it, but...
(0:51:36) Codey: I'm gonna look, if it is who I think it is, 100% back.
(0:51:41) Codey: I mean, just in general, back this.
(0:51:43) Kev: Mm hmm. Wow. Wow. Wow. Good for you. Well.
(0:51:44) Codey: Oh, it's just, it's just Elle.
(0:51:46) Codey: Elle made the music.
(0:51:49) Codey: There you go.
(0:51:51) Codey: The developer made the music.
(0:51:55) Codey: Yeah, back it.
(0:51:55) Codey: It's just also straight up available on Spotify.
(0:51:58) Codey: I'm probably gonna be listening to that.
(0:52:00) Codey: But if you wanted to buy it on Steam,
(0:52:03) Codey: it's available for Windows, Mac,
(0:52:06) Codey: but also just for Steam for two whole dollars.
(0:52:10) Kev: That's pretty good, that you're underselling yourself, El.
(0:52:14) Kev: You could have done five.
(0:52:15) Codey: Yeah, Elle.
(0:52:16) Kev: You could have done five, really.
(0:52:19) Kev: No one would have minded, believe me.
(0:52:22) Codey: Well, I, I think, I don't, my coffee might've stopped, but I had, I, I had a coffee Kofi,
(0:52:28) Codey: I don't know what it's called, subscription for L for a really long time. I need to check that out.
(0:52:30) Kev: Oh, yeah. I, I love, oh. Hmm. I, you know what, out of all the give me money platforms,
(0:52:35) Codey: Oh, they stopped it. I think they stopped it because he, they were like not doing as much
(0:52:41) Codey: to things and they didn't feel like they could do that.
(0:52:50) Kev: I think Ko-fi might be one of the best ones, like the way it's presented and like, oh,
(0:52:53) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah.
(0:52:55) Kev: you're cool. I'll buy you a coffee or more or whatever. You know, like, I'd love that.
(0:53:00) Kev: Oh, you go. Now we're gonna, I'm gonna have to go buy the soundtrack multiple times to me.
(0:53:06) Codey: Yeah, I need to I need to get it up on my I have I
(0:53:07) Kev: And Mudborne. I should play Mudborne. You play as a frog. I'd like, I'd need anything else.
(0:53:17) Kev: For, for people who didn't realize the connection, this is the apico dev. So there's a certain,
(0:53:20) Codey: Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to download it now.
(0:53:26) Kev: there's a certain pedigree here that we're already very
(0:53:30) Kev: fond of. All right. Next up, something else we're very fond
(0:53:36) Kev: of, the JRR token and fantasy and the Lord of the Rings. It's
(0:53:40) Kev: Tezla Shire. It's the drop in merch, folks. Oh, they're going
(0:53:43) Codey: Tales of the Shire and this is in real life merch so when I first read it when I first
(0:53:44) Kev: for it. Yeah, in real life merch. These oven mitts? Yeah.
(0:53:50) Codey: read it I was like what oven mitt in game oven mitts why am I going to care no no these
(0:53:57) Codey: are real oven mitts
(0:54:00) Kev: That's 15 euro, which is I don't know how much that is in USD,
(0:54:03) Kev: maybe 20, under 30, I would hope, I could be wrong. It's a
(0:54:07) Kev: pretty design, nice little butterfly, very simple, tasteful.
(0:54:11) Codey: I think, so one, my only complaint about the butterfly, the butterfly oven mitts is
(0:54:16) Codey: there's nothing on it that says specifically tales of the Shire or anything like that.
(0:54:22) Kev: or Middle Earth at all, you're right.
(0:54:23) Kev: No, you know what?
(0:54:24) Codey: It's just a butterfly.
(0:54:24) Kev: That's a good point.
(0:54:26) Kev: Like maybe the butterfly is a logo in game or something,
(0:54:29) Kev: but I mean, we haven't seen that thus far,
(0:54:30) Codey: Yeah.
(0:54:30) Kev: but it doesn't feel emblematic.
(0:54:35) Kev: Yeah, it is cute.
(0:54:37) Kev: Let's see, we got stickers.
(0:54:39) Kev: We've got a, what is that green dragon?
(0:54:42) Kev: Oh, it's a computer mouse pad mat thing.
(0:54:43) Codey: A dragon mat. Yeah, a desk mat. This says green dragon. That's 20 bucks.
(0:54:45) Kev: Yeah.
(0:54:49) Kev: more stick.
(0:54:49) Codey: Ovid mitts are 20 bucks. Stickers are 10. Desk mat is 20.
(0:54:52) Kev: And then like a, it's not an apron, I don't know what it is, they have some in the picture, they, "Oh, thank you, that's what it is." Yeah, that's a not very, I don't experience that much, but there you go, all sorts of tales of the Shire stuff.
(0:54:56) Codey: A tea towel.
(0:55:06) Codey: Oh, put the stickers on your mittens.
(0:55:06) Kev: See, what you do is you buy the stickers and then you put it on your mitt, in your mittens.
(0:55:14) Codey: Nah, I would put the stickers on my laptop.
(0:55:14) Kev: Nah, don't do that.
(0:55:17) Codey: I really, okay, let me click it again.
(0:55:20) Codey: I need to see how big this sticker sheet is because I really like, there's really not
(0:55:26) Codey: anything that shows how big this is.
(0:55:28) Kev: There is a hot one of the characters, I mean there's the hobbit hole though. I don't know what they're called
(0:55:30) Codey: They, okay, they have a picture of it on a Mac.
(0:55:37) Codey: Oh, it might not be a Mac on a laptop, so you can kind of see how big it is.
(0:55:41) Codey: I need small stickers, y'all.
(0:55:43) Kev: Yeah, these are these are massive stickers, holy mackerel
(0:55:43) Codey: I'm, these are pretty, pretty big.
(0:55:47) Kev: The the Hobbit whole home thing. That's like almost
(0:55:53) Codey: That'll cover your Apple logo and more.
(0:55:53) Kev: It's almost a quarter
(0:55:56) Kev: Yeah, yeah, that's these are doing big stickers. Yeah, I don't know we're gonna put those on there's the butterfly again
(0:56:02) Codey: Yeah
(0:56:04) Kev: But yeah, there you go. I'm a big fan of yeah, I am too. I'm a big fan of the desk man
(0:56:05) Codey: Very pretty art style
(0:56:09) Kev: I'll say that like in general this math. I think or a solid one
(0:56:13) Kev: But there you go
(0:56:14) Codey: - I think I need one.
(0:56:15) Kev: Tales of the shard well you could get if you'd like to
(0:56:19) Kev: alright next up our next news item is the announcement of news items and a whole bunch of
(0:56:25) Kev: Tarvis season episodes as so we're getting all some direct on June 7th, which is what like two months away
(0:56:32) Kev: Two days after the switch truly, so will half of those announcements be existing cozy cotch core games
(0:56:39) Kev: Just announcing switch to ports very likely yes
(0:56:43) Kev: I look forward to that
(0:56:43) Codey: Are we gonna take bets on whether or not Silksong's gonna be in that?
(0:56:47) Kev: Oh, I forgot I was gonna make that joke earlier what if that's
(0:56:51) Codey: Oh, were you really?
(0:56:52) Kev: yes, I was thinking I was looking forward to their world announcement on the
(0:56:59) Kev: the wholesome direct
(0:57:00) Codey: I got so excited when I saw it in the game awards or whatever it was,
(0:57:05) Codey: but then I saw someone like shared a video or a picture that
(0:57:11) Codey: shows the same screenshot.
(0:57:13) Codey: And it's like, has like a picture of all of the places
(0:57:14) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:57:18) Codey: that it's been announced or released or whatever like that
(0:57:21) Kev: Mm-hmm that specific shot
(0:57:21) Codey: little five second thing has been shown. And there were at
(0:57:26) Codey: least 20 or 30 that were crossed out like, Oh, no.
(0:57:29) Kev: Over I
(0:57:32) Kev: Mean for me, it's always gonna be the Xbox tweet. You don't talking about
(0:57:38) Codey: box tweet. No.
(0:57:39) Kev: Yeah, so at in one of their Xbox showcases or whatever
(0:57:44) Kev: They said all of the titles in this video or whatever will be released within the year or whatever
(0:57:52) Kev: And so somebody on Twitter responds
(0:57:52) Codey: Okay.
(0:57:54) Kev: So are you saying that silk song because it was in there, right?
(0:57:58) Kev: Are you saying silk song will be releasing in the next year and then the official Xbox Twitter account replies?
(0:58:04) Kev: Yes, we are saying that silk song will release in the next year
(0:58:11) Codey: I have doubts.
(0:58:13) Codey: I have so many doubts.
(0:58:15) Kev: It's beautiful
(0:58:17) Kev: Okay, but you know what here's here's the crazy thing. Okay, I'm not
(0:58:21) Kev: Like I'm not the one of the actual people who've been waiting and dying
(0:58:25) Kev: I'm not one of the Kickstarter people who are owed silk song. I'll say that right
(0:58:29) Kev: But I think this time I don't know. I just get the feeling I think this time
(0:58:33) Kev: we're actually gonna see it on switch to like
(0:58:34) Codey: this time.
(0:58:36) Kev: Like I
(0:58:38) Kev: I love laughing at the silk song at the scong people as some would call them
(0:58:43) Codey: Scong.
(0:58:44) Kev: at the scong people but
(0:58:46) Codey: I've never heard that, but I am a scong.
(0:58:50) Codey: No, I'm just waiting for it.
(0:58:52) Codey: I almost got a tattoo of the character, but then I didn't.
(0:58:56) Codey: So I am one of the scongs.
(0:58:59) Kev: Oh my gosh, okay
(0:59:02) Kev: Let's see here. So yeah, it's a wholesome directs with the guaranteed scong news to date on June 7th. Oh
(0:59:11) Kev: But yeah, yeah, all right. All right. Let's see. Let's see next up
(0:59:14) Kev: This was a fun one. So video gamer.com is the website. They did a little interview with or PC gamer, I think was actually the website.
(0:59:24) Codey: No, it's video gamer you were right
(0:59:24) Kev: Well, video gamer did the article, but PC gamer did the interview. Some people sat down with one Eric Brown. I don't know why he keeps that name.
(0:59:36) Kev: I should just be legally just concerned, Dave, at this point, and I should wear a mask of the what is it, the bear with the glasses or whatever, because I'm not.
(0:59:44) Kev: I'm comfortable seeing his human face. They sat down with concern, Dave, talk about all sorts of stuff. It's like there's a 25 minute full interview, but some of the highlights.
(0:59:56) Kev: The big one really haunted chocolatier. He's in this interview. He says that it will come out within the year and the Xbox and he said, no, what he's actually saying is that
(1:00:12) Kev: he is putting a halt on any stardew.
(1:00:14) Kev: He's saying he's not necessarily done with stardew because I am genuinely concerned that man has an issue.
(1:00:26) Kev: No, like seriously, like I think I'm a little concerned for his, you know, workaholic mental health stuff.
(1:00:34) Kev: He's reaching Sakurai levels a little bit. Like I genuinely think someone might have to come a little worried.
(1:00:35) Codey: Pull him away from the star, do you guys?
(1:00:39) Codey: I mean, he enjoys it, it's fine.
(1:00:42) Kev: You know, but yeah
(1:00:44) Kev: Like right I say that like but if he enjoys it and he obviously is working well for him good for you, but that's
(1:00:50) Codey: Yeah, I mean, that's his life, it's his job, so.
(1:00:53) Kev: It's his thing. Yeah, I mean it's his magnum opus. It's his baby right like I get it
(1:00:58) Kev: But but yeah, regardless he says that he's he's he's drawn this glass sand in the line like sand in the line
(1:01:06) Codey: line in the sand.
(1:01:06) Kev: That's correct. That's correct
(1:01:10) Kev: No, no stardew updates until he finishes haunted chocolatier
(1:01:14) Codey: I will believe it when I see it, Eric.
(1:01:15) Kev: And then then there's that right so I listened to most of the interview
(1:01:23) Kev: It's uh, it's pretty fun interview. He talks about
(1:01:28) Kev: he goes a little into like some of the stuff about
(1:01:32) Kev: like stardew his thoughts on it now like
(1:01:36) Kev: He thought he thinks about some stuff he might be considering like he says there's a lot of open
(1:01:42) Kev: Threads or storylines that didn't get a full proper
(1:01:44) Kev: closure and he see he goes back and forth on that like says you'd like to
(1:01:49) Kev: finish it but maybe it's better that he doesn't so that way you know players can
(1:01:52) Kev: kind of fill in their own gaps with their mind or whatever making more
(1:01:55) Kev: personal experience right he talks about yeah just that he's probably never going
(1:02:01) Kev: to be finished with it just because he loves it that much or whatever he talks
(1:02:06) Kev: about haunted chocolatier he taught he makes the joke about actually locking
(1:02:10) Kev: himself in the cabin so he can finish it and all I have to say is
(1:02:14) Kev: that's fine just make sure you bring George RR Martin with you in there. No
(1:02:21) Kev: I'd say Team Cherry but the problem with Team Cherry is I think they are actually
(1:02:25) Kev: locked in the cabin and just aren't refused to come out I think that's a
(1:02:30) Kev: problem for Scott but anyways yeah it's a fun interview he talks about some of
(1:02:37) Kev: the other stuff he's been playing he picked up Sun some of the other stardew
(1:02:41) Kev: like Sun Haven was one and Graveyard Keeper.
(1:02:44) Kev: He's been playing some chess, apparently he's been into that, and just all sorts of other stuff.
(1:02:53) Kev: It's a great interview so I suggest you guys check it out.
(1:03:00) Kev: Next up, the next news item, they announced...
(1:03:03) Codey: This is the last news item.
(1:03:06) Kev: Oh there we go, well, fiddly enough they announced a huge deduction to Al's wallet.
(1:03:13) Kev: they've announced new
(1:03:14) Kev: animal crossing LEGO assets. So the big one is the museum and
(1:03:20) Kev: Blathers, which yeah, okay, I can get why it didn't come out
(1:03:26) Kev: already. But yeah, I mean, it was how to happen, right? I'm not
(1:03:31) Kev: a LEGO connoisseur. I think it's a good one. It's probably
(1:03:35) Kev: going to be way too expensive for me to buy it. But it's a
(1:03:39) Kev: good one. I'll say that. It came out with a few other house
(1:03:42) Kev: That's what they know neighbors.
(1:03:44) Kev: Including two of my absolute favorites in the series, Goldie and Stitches.
(1:03:50) Kev: Then Fuchsia and Whitney are also going to be in coming out here.
(1:03:54) Kev: I'm surprised they haven't done the, you know, like the blind pack, box pack or whatever.
(1:04:00) Kev: Just a random LEGO Animal Crossing minifig neighbor, but...
(1:04:04) Codey: That would, that would make a lot of money.
(1:04:06) Kev: That would make a lot of money!
(1:04:10) Kev: As everyone tries to pull for, um...
(1:04:12) Kev: Oh my gosh, what was it, Raymond?
(1:04:14) Kev: The heterochrome me, I can't.
(1:04:16) Codey: Yeah. David Bowie cat.
(1:04:16) Kev: Yeah.
(1:04:18) Kev: You know, I actually got...
(1:04:20) Kev: So I thought it was insane when that came out.
(1:04:24) Kev: And I was like, "The Raymond people are crazy."
(1:04:26) Kev: And then I got Raymond, just naturally.
(1:04:28) Kev: I was like, "Well, I'm just gonna hold this cat over all of you and just gloat."
(1:04:28) Codey: Yeah. Yeah. I liked him, but I, my favorite from that, that time was, uh, bisexual galaxy
(1:04:40) Codey: bear or Judy. So she has like blue. She's a mix of blue and pink and her eyes are like
(1:04:43) Kev: But hold on, let me see.
(1:04:51) Kev: Yeah, I see it, okay.
(1:04:52) Codey: stars. Um, so I just, I called her bisexual galaxy bear. That was
(1:04:53) Kev: Yeah.
(1:04:58) Codey: that was my, my fave, but my absolute fave is blue bear. So I also like fauna stitches
(1:05:03) Kev: Blue bear is pretty good.
(1:05:05) Kev: So I mean, out of, I mean, we could go,
(1:05:08) Kev: stitches is top tier for me.
(1:05:10) Codey: is a cute one. Yeah.
(1:05:12) Kev: Stitches is top tier
(1:05:13) Kev: Goldie has a very special place in my heart
(1:05:23) Kev: Goldie was one of the very first three neighbors in Animal Crossing original on the GameTube for me
(1:05:30) Codey: Oh, yeah, I can't beat that.
(1:05:39) Codey: That was my situation with Blue Bear.
(1:05:42) Codey: I had Blue Bear and Savannah.
(1:05:43) Kev: I had a grumpy one too, gosh what was it? I mean obviously I played some of Animal Crossing trying to think back to the originals but yeah Goldie has the sweet kind personality and just oh that's one of the reasons I'm here 30 years later still talking about this game because of you Goldie.
(1:05:45) Codey: Savannah.
(1:05:50) Codey: And then I might have had a grumpy one.
(1:05:53) Codey: I don't remember.
(1:06:08) Codey: It's you, Goldie, sweetie.
(1:06:14) Kev: Yeah, so yeah new Lego set so yeah that's why Lego should do the blind boxes and take all the money. I mean so okay one minor thing that I always kind of had an issue I have with Lego sets right in general like I find Lego sets to be very static.
(1:06:20) Codey: They really should, they should.
(1:06:37) Kev: Like the museum like it's a beautiful looking museum design or whatever but
(1:06:43) Kev: I wish you could open it or look inside right so the comparison point I'll use you know mega construct mega blocks the ones that do the non Lego blocks that did the Pokemon sets they came out with a Pokemon Center set.
(1:06:58) Kev: It was a big one and it was it was you know not just the front but the back of it you turn it around it was like fully modeled Pokemon Center functioning you could interact with it and it came with the chancy figure it was it was.
(1:07:13) Kev: Awesome. And I just wish they do something like that for this museum right where it's not just a pretty building but you could actually see an exhibit or something inside but.
(1:07:24) Codey: Yeah, I mean, you can see they do have like, there's a fountain that goes with it. And the fossil is really cute. The bug catching net like with a spider. But I agree though. Yeah.
(1:07:30) Kev: Yeah, and they have a fossil and stuff like that. Yeah
(1:07:35) Kev: The
(1:07:37) Kev: Yeah, I mean it has stuff it's not bad just I just would like a little you know
(1:07:44) Kev: I mean like I'd love to I want to see a museum that
(1:07:47) Kev: It's come to life, right?
(1:07:48) Codey: Well, and they have like those Lego house sets where it's like a
(1:07:54) Codey: City block or something and the buildings are like legit like you can they'll have like a cafe that has cafe Legos inside of it
(1:07:56) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(1:08:02) Codey: So it's it's a thing that they do
(1:08:06) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. I think it's really funny that they have blathers doing the bug catching on the box
(1:08:08) Codey: But they just haven't
(1:08:19) Kev: when he hates bucks so much. Like he's doing that, I've, you know, knowing the character,
(1:08:25) Kev: just imagine doing that to save his life basically at that point. But yeah, yeah, it has a little,
(1:08:33) Kev: the whole thing there's a little fish pond with uh I i don't know what that frog's name is that
(1:08:36) Kev: such a your mind I don't think it is um yeah um but yeah lego sets very cute um very expensive
(1:08:43) Kev: i'm sure man do you buy lego at all cody
(1:08:47) Codey: So I get Lego. My, let's see, Jeff worked one of my okay, I
(1:08:56) Codey: actually don't remember who got me what but I got the like,
(1:08:59) Codey: wildlife one that is a squirrel and an owl and a fox like with
(1:09:05) Codey: the same Lego pieces. And I made the two and then of course
(1:09:10) Codey: it's in fox form now. And then someone gave me the Minecraft
(1:09:12) Kev: >> Mm-hmm. Oh, that's a good one. I saw that. I think. Yeah.
(1:09:15) Codey: box set.
(1:09:18) Codey: Yeah.
(1:09:20) Codey: And then I got another one that I am blanking on right now.
(1:09:23) Codey: Oh, the insect set.
(1:09:26) Codey: But yeah, I haven't made those two those two.
(1:09:29) Codey: I'm like, I kind of want to just show the box.
(1:09:33) Kev: It's yeah, I get it like that. I think that's part of the challenge. I have with Legos right like they the sets are always just too
(1:09:41) Kev: Small or lacking for me right like it's uh
(1:09:45) Kev: So a big bill like the Fox or you know these wildlife ones those I think are cool
(1:09:50) Kev: Especially the non branded or whatever like you know like they they can put a little more oomph into those and still make their money
(1:09:58) Kev: So yeah, those are good
(1:10:01) Kev: but
(1:10:03) Kev: like the fox one, the minecraft one, i've seen it and it looks great on the box but I get it when
(1:10:08) Kev: you open up build it it's it's a few pieces nice but it's not the whole you know diorama looking
(1:10:13) Kev: feel on the box and and I get it like that's part of the the challenge or appeal for some people
(1:10:19) Kev: even right but um but really at the end all it comes down to is the price for me and like it's
(1:10:26) Kev: it's just brutal for me it's it's tough man there's some really nice um animal lego sets there's a
(1:10:34) Kev: these are great looking ones yeah
(1:10:34) Codey: Mm-hmm. They got some good ones for sure.
(1:10:38) Kev: yeah oh I don't like this i'm oh no this is dangerous I might get this
(1:10:43) Kev: this panda is pretty good my sister would love that she loves pandas
(1:10:47) Kev: parrots I like parrots I want a parrot in real life
(1:10:52) Codey: They're too smart. And for me, I think well, and then they get attached. And like,
(1:10:55) Kev: it is adopting a child like no I mean no no like I mean i'm saying no to you i'm saying
(1:10:59) Codey: what if you pass away in a car accident and then they're still alive and they miss you?
(1:11:04) Codey: I
(1:11:09) Codey: It is like,
(1:11:13) Kev: to the people who hear because everyone hears you know the dog cat child or whatever you know
(1:11:19) Kev: parrots are actual children they have intelligence on par with three-year-olds tests have shown
(1:11:25) Kev: that like they they are terrifying intelligent and cool and that's part of why I love it and
(1:11:31) Kev: they'll live forever too like what over 100 years have you you know things go well um yeah no I get
(1:11:38) Kev: it that is actually adopting a child you're 100 correct but that's yeah um I still want one they're
(1:11:41) Codey: It's crazy.
(1:11:47) Kev: so beautiful I in back in savannah there was this flea market and one of them was like a pet stall
(1:11:54) Kev: or whatever and they had to.
(1:11:55) Kev: Okay. All right. All right. I'm done. I think we're done. That's the news. That's
(1:12:04) Codey: That's yeah, that's the news. That's it. It was a big episode y'all.
(1:12:08) Kev: the news. The agony. We stretched it out. We did it. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. That was
(1:12:14) Codey: I mean, we didn't have to stretch it out that much. I just had to talk about what it's like to have a power outage.
(1:12:21) Kev: the least stretched out part like we got into the skibitty and the
(1:12:25) Kev: the Australia. Yeah, that was genuine life events. And, and
(1:12:26) Codey: You're right, you're right, you're right.
(1:12:34) Kev: you kept it short, actually. We spent way more time talking about
(1:12:36) Codey: Yeah, and his underwear, no, I did not, no, I didn't.
(1:12:39) Kev: Robert Erwin and his underwear. No, no, that one was actually
(1:12:46) Kev: short to find me at Cooper Prez on the busk, Twitter, whatever on
(1:12:47) Codey: Okay, well, Kev, where can people find you?
(1:12:55) Kev: the Amcoop. No one's gonna take that name. It's a dumb name. I
(1:12:58) Kev: made it 13 years old. If it's there, it's me. No one's gonna
(1:13:01) Kev: steal it. Find me over at Rainbow Road Radio, Mario podcast
(1:13:07) Kev: I do with a friend Alex for a little behind where we have an
(1:13:10) Kev: episode in the barrel, which recorded and publish it. But

(1:17:26) Codey: My dog, and then I gotta find that squirrel photo.
(1:17:30) Kev: I love millipedes. Well, I love roly polies which are just like small millipedes. I played with those a ton as a kid. I mean
(1:17:35) Codey: Mm-hmm, we have those in the same tank, yeah.
(1:17:39) Kev: Yeah, I mean, okay you play with bugs now as an adult but as a kid like I I
(1:17:46) Kev: Played a bunch with roly polies and ladybugs that pick them up and you know, walk them around my hand or whatever
(1:17:52) Codey: We have some of those two, we have, we have zebra isopods.
(1:17:52) Kev: My mom was wild
(1:17:54) Kev: she would oh
(1:17:55) Codey: So how the heck did you get a dragonfly?
(1:17:56) Kev: That's cool. My mom was wild. She'd grab dragonflies and butter bumblebee
(1:18:00) Kev: and tie strings around them and actually fly there. I don't know. I don't know how she did it but she says she did it.
(1:18:06) Codey: That is wild.
(1:18:08) Kev: Look at that middle appearing.
(1:18:10) Codey: Yeah.
(1:18:11) Codey: So, uh, the story of the undead millipede, um, someone was going to an outreach event
(1:18:18) Codey: and they said they were looking for the millipedes and they found one dead.
(1:18:22) Codey: And we have two. And so they were like, we couldn't find the other one. She probably escaped
(1:18:27) Codey: because she escapes all the time. Um, her name is Amtrak. And the other one is caboose.
(1:18:29) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(1:18:33) Codey: Um, so caboose passed and then Amtrak, um, I went and looked for her in her substrate and I found
(1:18:41) Codey: her, but she seemed very dead, like very limp, very nonresponsive. And so I was like, Oh, okay.
(1:18:47) Codey: And so I set her on a log, her log on top.
(1:18:51) Kev: >> Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Look, I've owned fish, and sometimes you get that too. Like,
(1:18:52) Codey: Cause I was like, I don't know what we're going to do with her.
(1:18:53) Codey: Whatever.
(1:18:54) Codey: And I just kind of left her there.
(1:18:55) Codey: And then today I went back to check on them again and she's fine.
(1:19:01) Codey: It's like, girl, you were limp.
(1:19:04) Codey: You were like, what the heck?
(1:19:08) Codey: So yeah, but she was not dead.
(1:19:11) Codey: So she's on dead.
(1:19:15) Kev: I haven't seen the fish in a few days. I think you died. And then, like, the next day, oh,
(1:19:17) Codey: Yeah.
(1:19:20) Kev: back okay you're on
(1:19:20) Codey: No, you're back.
(1:19:21) Kev: dead oh my goodness mm-hmm of course they are that's
(1:19:22) Codey: We have, I mean, we have death fainting beetles, so they literally play dead.
(1:19:26) Codey: And we have in their enclosure, we have a little sled that we had in there for
(1:19:30) Codey: Christmas and we just leave it in there now.
(1:19:32) Codey: So anytime we think that one is dead, you put them on the sled and then you
(1:19:36) Codey: check the next day and they're always gone.
(1:19:39) Codey: They've never, they don't die.
(1:19:41) Codey: So.
