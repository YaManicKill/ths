## Transcript

(0:00:30) Al: Hello farmers, and welcome to another episode of the harvest season.
(0:00:34) Al: My name is Al.
(0:00:36) Kev: I'm Kevin. We're back baby. This is the first episode back, right?
(0:00:38) Al: They said they said we couldn't do it, Kevin.
(0:00:41) Al: They said we couldn't do it.
(0:00:43) Al: We said we couldn't go on a break and come back because no one goes on a break
(0:00:46) Kev: The they being you, I think primarily.
(0:00:48) Al: and then comes back.
(0:00:52) Al: No, everyone.
(0:00:53) Al: Nobody believed in me.
(0:00:57) Al: But here we are.
(0:00:58) Al: back and here we are here today to talk
(0:01:00) Al: about so many Cottagecore games like so many that I think some might just be that's a game
(0:01:03) Kev: Oh, a lot like they double.
(0:01:06) Kev: It in the last five minutes.
(0:01:13) Al: moving on we'll see we'll see we are we are here today to talk about the Wholesome Direct
(0:01:14) Kev: Yeah, probably a lot of them we're talking about the wholesome direct everyone
(0:01:23) Al: specifically and a bunch of stuff in that not everything because it was an hour long and
(0:01:30) Al: talked about everything in an hour long presentation we would probably be here all day and it's already
(0:01:37) Al: half eight at night that's that's also that's also true so we're going to talk about that we
(0:01:37) Kev: and we don't have enough to talk about it
(0:01:40) Kev: 'cause we don't care about all of them.
(0:01:46) Al: do have one piece of news that I want to cover before that and before that we're going to talk
(0:01:53) Al: about what we've been up to but first of all Kevin we've got feedback this is being sent in by Katie
(0:01:56) Kev: Oh!
(0:02:00) Al: of the show I have been listening to the podcast for some time now and it's a highlight of my week
(0:02:02) Kev: Uh-oh.
(0:02:06) Al: not last two weeks so sorry I really enjoy hearing your honest and sometimes brutal opinions on games
(0:02:06) Kev: When did we ruin it for her?
(0:02:14) Al: and I especially enjoy how positive and how much energy Kev has on his solo episodes keep up the
(0:02:21) Al: amazing work. There we go Kevin. You got a shout out.
(0:02:23) Kev: Okay, I'm going, I'm trying to refrain from, you know, being sarcastic or whatever, putting myself down. But thank you very much. Sincerely, that means a lot. I have a lot of practice talking to myself. I think that's what it is in my head space. Now, I just put a mic in front of it.
(0:02:38) Al: I feel like the brutal opinions on games has to be talking about Shugadu Island, right?
(0:02:54) Kev: Oh, I feel like there's a number of episodes we could point to, including the ones we like.
(0:02:58) Al: That is the particularly bad one. Well anyway, thank you Katie for the feedback. If you too
(0:03:00) Kev: Yeah.
(0:03:05) Al: want to send feedback you can do it on the website harvestseason.club
(0:03:08) Al: There's a feedback from there. Come send us more and you'll get a mention on the podcast.
(0:03:12) Kev: Yeah, all right.
(0:03:15) Kev: You'd like right now, yay.
(0:03:16) Kev: Thank you, Katie.
(0:03:17) Kev: I very much appreciate it.
(0:03:19) Al: Next Kevin, what have you been up to?
(0:03:22) Kev: Boy, what do I--
(0:03:23) Kev: Well, my internet has been out for a week,
(0:03:27) Kev: so let's start with that.
(0:03:28) Al: That's unfortunate.
(0:03:29) Kev: Yep, it's been a headache.
(0:03:33) Kev: But here I am using not working internet.
(0:03:40) Kev: But that's kind of--
(0:03:42) Kev: affected a lot of my gameplay, because so I didn't realize just how many of my games are like online only.
(0:03:48) Kev: Or have to connect to servers or whatever, like Zendless on Zero has a 2.0 update. I haven't played that. Marvel Snap,
(0:03:55) Kev: I don't get that many games in this week. My phone's dying, so it can't-- for whatever reason Snap just crashes on it now.
(0:04:01) Kev: So I have to pretty much play on PC these days.
(0:04:05) Kev: But Unite is gone, so on and so forth.
(0:04:09) Kev: The one game I have been playing though
(0:04:12) Kev: Unicorn Overlord, are you familiar with that, Al?
(0:04:14) Al: I am. I'm a photo.
(0:04:16) Kev: Okay, oh man, it's...
(0:04:20) Kev: So I picked it up on sale, it was like 30 USD, which is pretty cheap for a game of this size.
(0:04:24) Kev: Um, it's for people unfamiliar, it's a strategy, real-time game.
(0:04:32) Kev: I like Fire Emblem, but real-time.
(0:04:34) Kev: And Good Heavens, this game does all the things I like in that game.
(0:04:40) Kev: Um, okay.
(0:04:42) Kev: So, have you ever played a Fire Emblem, Al?
(0:04:44) Al: No.
(0:04:44) Kev: Okay, but I assume you're familiar with the concept of super-trust, right?
(0:04:47) Al: Yeah.
(0:04:48) Al: Yeah.
(0:04:48) Kev: Yeah, okay. So, like I said, that's correct.
(0:04:51) Al: They've all got swords, that's what I'm aware of.
(0:04:54) Kev: And Unicorn Overlord also has swords.
(0:04:56) Kev: Actually, Unicorn Overlord has a lot of Fire Emblem stuff.
(0:05:00) Kev: It's very much like an homage/love letter to a lot of strategy games, Fire Emblem included.
(0:05:06) Kev: So, it has a lot of the elements borrowed from that.
(0:05:10) Kev: that are like likely it feels
(0:05:12) Kev: less like trying to knock them off and more become the wash / love letter anyway
(0:05:19) Kev: so unlike Fire Emblem which is grid based this is not grid based it's real
(0:05:24) Kev: time you just send your units point A to point B and they'll travel as close to
(0:05:29) Kev: straight line as they can also they in Fire Emblem each character is a single
(0:05:36) Kev: unit in this game you assemble teams of up to five characters in one unit with
(0:05:42) Kev: front row and a back row so all of a sudden the complexity is through the
(0:05:46) Kev: roof and it's really enjoyable in my opinion right you got tanks in front
(0:05:50) Kev: archers in the back so on and so forth and each character you can load them out
(0:05:58) Kev: with different equipment skills and stuff and Fire Emblem is like every
(0:06:02) Kev: character gets like two or three items that do almost just that's basically but
(0:06:07) Kev: in this one you can you can change their move sets so there's
(0:06:12) Kev: it like layers and layers and layers of complexity which is
(0:06:15) Kev: really, really good. Yeah, I really, really like this game.
(0:06:20) Kev: I'm at 60 hours so far. Yeah, good. No internet. So just
(0:06:26) Kev: crushing it. But it is. It's the arts really nice. Very, very
(0:06:31) Kev: pretty. But but oh, great, great stuff. Um, yeah, that's that's
(0:06:38) Kev: kind of the big thing I've been up to.
(0:06:42) Kev: All right, Al, what about you?
(0:06:44) Kev: Tell me-- tell the poor pleb about the switch, too.
(0:06:46) Al: The Switch 2, what? What are you talking about? Yes, yes, I've got the Switch 2 and I've been
(0:06:52) Al: playing Mario Kart World. I haven't had a huge amount of time on it yet. As we are talking,
(0:06:58) Al: I have been... I was away. I was not at home when the Switch 2 came out on Thursday, and
(0:07:06) Al: it was delivered to my home. I didn't get back till Saturday evening, and so that's
(0:07:11) Al: about 24 hours ago as of now. So, yeah, I've not had a huge amount of time.
(0:07:16) Al: Especially as obviously I had to set it up, and you know, I have kids and a life, and
(0:07:20) Al: I can't just always play the game. But I have put in a couple hours into it, both myself
(0:07:27) Al: and me and my son playing it together, and it's fun. I enjoy it. What I will say is that
(0:07:35) Al: I love a lot of the... It's a lot more reactive in terms of like, your character does a lot
(0:07:44) Al: more while playing, which makes it feel
(0:07:46) Al: a lot more real, right? Like there are more reactions to things. And, uh, so it's really
(0:07:54) Al: hard to explain, but there's just lots of little things that they do that make it feel real. Um,
(0:08:00) Al: the animations are all more detailed. Uh, when you, when you hit a car, you don't now just like
(0:08:07) Al: stop in the same way that you do when hit by, uh, uh, you know, a weapon you like get knocked to
(0:08:15) Al: the side and you can actually
(0:08:17) Al: there was one today where I was like hit it in such a way that I actually just ended up going up on two wheels
(0:08:24) Al: and continuing to move.
(0:08:26) Kev: What?
(0:08:28) Al: Yeah, exactly. So there's just lots of little things like that.
(0:08:30) Al: It's you don't, whereas in Mario Kart 8, if you hit a vehicle, no matter how you hit it,
(0:08:37) Al: you would just, you would just stop.
(0:08:37) Kev: You do the somersault, you know, or whatever, yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
(0:08:38) Al: Yeah, exactly. You'd just do the standard.
(0:08:40) Al: I've been hit by something I have now stopped, whereas that's not necessary.
(0:08:44) Al: If you hit it, like, straight on, you will slow down.
(0:08:46) Al: And, you know, spin off to the side.
(0:08:49) Al: But if you hit it in certain ways, you can actually just keep going.
(0:08:52) Al: It just depends on exactly how you hit it, which makes it a lot more fun, I think.
(0:08:59) Al: And, you know, different weapons do different things depending
(0:09:03) Al: on where they hit you and how they hit you and stuff like that.
(0:09:06) Al: Which it is, it is, it's really interesting.
(0:09:06) Kev: Really, that's fascinating.
(0:09:10) Al: And it just, yeah, just the animations, like, you feel like the character moves
(0:09:16) Al: the vehicle. It doesn't just feel like you are one car, one model, stuff like that.
(0:09:20) Kev: Wow, that's the power of the Switch 2.
(0:09:26) Al: Or is it the power of, like, 10 years of developing the next Mario Kart game?
(0:09:31) Kev: No, no, this wasn't possible on the Switch 1.
(0:09:34) Kev: Impossible, absolutely.
(0:09:38) Al: And I also like how, so one of the things about this game is obviously you're just choosing
(0:09:44) Al: a car rather than like choosing the body.
(0:09:46) Al: The wheels and what's it called, parachute.
(0:09:49) Kev: Right.
(0:09:53) Al: I quite like that because there's less for you to have to think about.
(0:09:57) Al: But what I do like is that each of the carts looks slightly different depending on the character.
(0:10:04) Kev: Wow, that's impressive.
(0:10:06) Al: It's not just like the base cart, the Mario cart, that if you're Mario it's red with the M on it.
(0:10:10) Al: If you're Luigi it's green with the L on it.
(0:10:14) Al: if you're the cow, it's grey with the cow.
(0:10:16) Al: They put a lot of attention to detail in this game, a lot of effort.
(0:10:18) Kev: - That's all.
(0:10:28) Kev: Wow, that's impressive genuinely, like wow, that's attention to detail.
(0:10:38) Al: It's really fun. Some things are going to take some getting used to like the controls are
(0:10:44) Al: are obviously slightly different.
(0:10:46) Al: The thing that's knocking me off a lot is in eight and before, if you wanted to hold
(0:10:54) Al: like a shell or banana behind you, you would have to hold down the fire button. Whereas now
(0:10:58) Kev: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
(0:11:02) Al: that happens by default. So as soon as you have it in the priority slot, it is behind you.
(0:11:06) Kev: Okay, huh, I think. Okay. Sure, sure. I feel like at least one
(0:11:09) Al: And then if you press it and hold it, it will just fire it. So I have spent a lot of time
(0:11:17) Al: things because I was trying to have them behind me. But that's just how you get used to it.
(0:11:21) Al: And eventually you'll stop doing that. But yeah.
(0:11:25) Kev: other Mario Kart did that. But it's not as common at the very
(0:11:30) Al: possibly. Well, that's the thing. Like, do I remember how things before 8 actually worked?
(0:11:30) Kev: least, or regardless, it's been what 10 years with our hard part
(0:11:34) Kev: eight.
(0:11:36) Kev: That's how - that's how video game historians - yeah, yeah. Now that's fair. That's how
(0:11:39) Al: No, I do not. I'm not an idea. I don't go back and play old Mario Kart all the time, right?
(0:11:46) Al: That's not my life.
(0:11:50) Kev: video game historians chronicle things in the BMK8 era or the AMK8 era. But that's
(0:12:00) Kev: good stuff. Okay, how does - how does the free driving world...
(0:12:04) Al: I haven't done any of that yet. I've just been playing Grand Prix. I will say...
(0:12:08) Kev: Mmm. Well, I mean, but you - you have between the phrases now, right? Like, that's - you feel a
(0:12:14) Al: So yeah, so I think no, is how I'll say it. It is not like what I think Free Run will be at all.
(0:12:15) Kev: taste of it.
(0:12:26) Al: You're not really driving between the courses. How it is, is yes you are driving, like you start
(0:12:32) Al: Start on the finish line of the previous course.
(0:12:35) Al: And then the first lap is to the starting line of the next course.
(0:12:42) Al: And then this, and then you've got the second and third laps are on the course.
(0:12:46) Al: It depends on what course it is.
(0:12:47) Al: Like some of them are shorter, like baby park, and you actually have like then
(0:12:51) Al: multiple laps around it, or a lot of them aren't just like a single loop that you
(0:12:56) Al: do a certain number of times.
(0:12:57) Al: A lot of them are like the ones where you, you just have one long course that
(0:13:01) Al: you do different sections of.
(0:13:03) Al: It just depends on what it is.
(0:13:05) Al: I am, I don't really like it.
(0:13:09) Al: I personally would just prefer the standard you've got your three courses
(0:13:13) Al: and you do your three laps or however many laps.
(0:13:16) Kev: >> Sure, sure.
(0:13:16) Al: Um, the driving between it just feels kind of tacked on and it almost feels
(0:13:22) Al: like they wanted the open world thing.
(0:13:24) Al: And sure, fine.
(0:13:25) Al: I don't, I I've not tried it yet, but I, I can imagine it'd be interesting.
(0:13:30) Al: Um, but the all you must drive between the courses, the bit that is
(0:13:35) Al: between the courses feels pretty either feels pretty generic and boring, or just
(0:13:40) Al: feels like the previous course that you just finished and you're like, I don't
(0:13:44) Al: understand why I'm still doing this course when I'm on the next course.
(0:13:49) Al: And it doesn't, the other, the other thing that I found a bit weird was it
(0:13:52) Al: doesn't start straight away.
(0:13:55) Al: Like once you hit the finish line, you go into like, Oh, here's the rankings.
(0:13:59) Al: And then you have to start it again.
(0:14:01) Al: And then because you're starting again, you're starting on the finish
(0:14:04) Al: and it just feels like that's a weird jarring thing.
(0:14:08) Al: It's like, Oh, you finished that race.
(0:14:10) Al: Now let's start the next race on this point.
(0:14:13) Al: Like where you just finished, like it just, it feels like an idea that someone
(0:14:17) Al: had, and then they went, yeah, let's do that.
(0:14:20) Al: But they never really did anything with it.
(0:14:22) Al: And it almost would have felt more realistic or more interesting.
(0:14:28) Al: If it just, the race hadn't stopped at any point, or maybe if it, if you have.
(0:14:35) Al: You have to wait for everyone else to get there, like, if you just like stayed in
(0:14:40) Al: position at that point, and waited for everyone to catch up, but the fact that
(0:14:41) Kev: Yeah, in that way, kind of--
(0:14:46) Al: it goes like, Oh, now we're going to like cut to this other screen, like they do in
(0:14:50) Al: previous Mario carts, where you show the rankings, it almost defeats the purpose
(0:14:54) Al: of then, then driving between the two courses.
(0:14:57) Kev: Yeah, that's so weird to me because, yeah, that doesn't from the way it was described, like, that would have been, you know, what I would have thought, right? Like, you there, you know, you hit the finish line and then you just keep driving and maybe ranking is on the side or something.
(0:14:57) Al: It's like, well, what happened, what happened in that time?
(0:15:00) Al: Because now I'm back on the finish line.
(0:15:16) Al: 100% why I expected. And I guess the reason they don't do that is they want everyone to catch up
(0:15:19) Kev: That's wild.
(0:15:21) Al: so that you're all starting at the same time for the next race. Sure, fine. But I feel like you
(0:15:25) Kev: But, okay.
(0:15:27) Kev: Yeah, but what's the point? Like, that's baffling to me.
(0:15:28) Al: could have done that transition better, right? I don't-- I understand why they want something
(0:15:34) Kev: Um...
(0:15:37) Al: like this. It feels like it's another mode, and I feel like they should have kept Grand Prix
(0:15:41) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:15:44) Al: as it was. And then this was like
(0:15:45) Kev: Yeah.
(0:15:47) Al: a new type of tour. A grand tour instead of a grand prix. I'm not saying this is bad,
(0:15:48) Kev: Yeah, that's what they should have done. Absolutely. Yeah, exactly. There you go.
(0:15:56) Al: I'm saying I don't like that this is instead of what we had before.
(0:16:00) Kev: Right, right. I get that. Yeah, from what you're describing, it doesn't...
(0:16:05) Kev: Yeah, it sounds like they fumbled that execution just a little bit.
(0:16:09) Kev: And if you're not here completely removing the standard Grand Prix for that, like, that's a problem. That's rough.
(0:16:14) Al: Exactly.
(0:16:16) Al: Exactly.
(0:16:17) Al: Exactly.
(0:16:17) Kev: Well, we'll see. Like, I mean, I... I mean, I personally think we're going to get DLCs that are just going to be standard Grand Prix-type modes.
(0:16:19) Al: We will see.
(0:16:30) Al: Interesting. I can't see them not doing DLC for this. For two reasons, one, they did two sets of DLC for the previous game, and two...
(0:16:31) Kev: Because...
(0:16:35) Kev: Right, exactly, right?
(0:16:40) Kev: Mm-hmm. And DLC for the remastered version of the game, that DLC. Yeah.
(0:16:46) Al: Well, yeah, that was the second one. But anyway, secondly, it doesn't feel like there's enough races, because you have, like, eight.
(0:16:56) Al: And it doesn't feel like
(0:17:00) Al: enough to me. I'm not regretting buying the game, especially because I got it in
(0:17:01) Kev: Not anymore
(0:17:05) Kev: Yeah
(0:17:06) Al: the bundle, right? But I totally get why people are like, Oh, that feels like a lot
(0:17:10) Al: of money for eight, eight grand prix. Especially when like, the preview, like, I don't, I'm
(0:17:18) Al: not expecting it necessarily will be free DLC. And obviously people complain about that,
(0:17:23) Al: right? They're like, Oh, you're charging us $80 and then you're also charging us more
(0:17:24) Kev: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah, yeah, that's what I suspect too.
(0:17:27) Al: courses. But I can
(0:17:30) Al: see the DLC being reasonably cheap, and it's just like $10 or whatever, right?
(0:17:36) Al: But it just, yeah, eight just feels, eight isn't even as many as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had. Eight
(0:17:42) Al: Deluxe had 10. And so eight had eight, of course. Mario Kart 8 had eight courses, and then they
(0:17:44) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:17:48) Kev: Yeah
(0:17:51) Al: added on eight grumpries, sorry, and then they added on two, I think, for DLC initially. And then that
(0:17:56) Kev: - DLC, that's correct.
(0:17:57) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:17:57) Al: That was all bundled together as Mario Kart 8 delivered.
(0:18:00) Al: So Mario Kart 8 Deluxe had 10 and then they doubled in the other DLC, yeah.
(0:18:00) Kev: - And then they doubled the number.
(0:18:05) Al: So it just feels a little bit meh that we're not even, we've not even got as many races as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
(0:18:12) Kev: Yeah. Yeah, that's fair, right? Like it's, I think the pain point is just this, the way you've described how they fumbled their new Grand Prix version, right? Because like I could, I could live with eight cups or whatever, if it was the standard Grand Prix that, you know, you could just do ad nauseam like, you know, other Mario karts and it'd be fine.
(0:18:12) Al: And then this is more expensive.
(0:18:15) Al: None of that, none of that feels good.
(0:18:43) Kev: But if you're replacing that and given something that feels a little worse or a little awkward, yeah, it's going to be rough.
(0:18:51) Al: And let me get and let me point out the courses are really good.
(0:18:55) Kev: Sure. Yeah. Are there any, any new ones you're fond of that you've seen so far?
(0:18:57) Al: And like.
(0:19:02) Al: The the one I particularly like, obviously, I've not done them all.
(0:19:06) Al: And I've not done them all yet, but the one that I'm particularly
(0:19:10) Al: enjoying is the Donkey Kong one, I can't remember what it's called.
(0:19:12) Kev: hmm is uh I don't know which one because there's obviously been a handful or if it's a new one but uh okay
(0:19:18) Al: Yeah, let me check.
(0:19:20) Al: I think it's a new one.
(0:19:21) Al: And that I think is really fun.
(0:19:25) Kev: oh yeah they saw they showed that one in the trailer first yeah that one looked cool
(0:19:32) Al: You're essentially it's one of the ones that's not like laps.
(0:19:35) Al: It's one specific course and you end at the end.
(0:19:39) Al: And what I really like it is you're essentially going through a Donkey Kong level, right?
(0:19:44) Al: Like you're going up this course and then at the end at the top is a robotic Donkey
(0:19:46) Kev: Really? That's cool.
(0:19:51) Al: Kong, throwing barrels down at you.
(0:19:53) Kev: Oh, that's so cool.
(0:19:55) Al: So I really like that and there's like lots of stuff to avoid and there's bouncy pads
(0:20:01) Al: and stuff like that.
(0:20:03) Kev: That's so cool
(0:20:06) Kev: And I can't wait to check that out
(0:20:08) Kev: But I mean, obviously we're nitpicking but still Mario Kart, right? Like it's still the overall good
(0:20:12) Al: Yeah, I don't regret it. I obviously want the bundle, but if I paid full price for this,
(0:20:18) Al: I still wouldn't be regretting it. It is still really good fun and it's still going to sell
(0:20:20) Kev: Yeah, yeah. Oh, absolutely. And cow is playable. Yep. Wait, really? That's hilarious. That's incredible.
(0:20:22) Al: like bonkers. But yeah, I mean, and Caro is one of the best characters to actually play
(0:20:30) Al: as. It's one of the meta characters. It is, yeah. So yeah, I'm enjoying it. I get why
(0:20:37) Kev: Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Mm-hmm. Well, that'll be-- that's awesome.
(0:20:42) Al: people might be frustrated with it and I haven't tried everything in it yet, so I guess
(0:20:47) Al: we'll see.
(0:20:50) Kev: Can't wait to hear more people. I haven't heard much about it,
(0:20:54) Kev: but I'm obviously interested in the free roam mode or whatever. But good stuff.
(0:21:04) Kev: How was vacation world not-- how was touching grass?
(0:21:07) Al: Yeah, I wasn't really on holiday. I was still working. In fact, I was working more than
(0:21:12) Kev: Oh, were you?
(0:21:13) Al: I normally do. I was just doing it in a different place. But I didn't have my kids, so it was
(0:21:15) Kev: Oh, that was me this week, too.
(0:21:21) Al: relaxing in some way. No, I had fun. It was a little bit frustrating on the Thursday at
(0:21:21) Kev: Mm-hmm.
(0:21:27) Al: the end to be like, "Everyone's getting their Switch too, and mine's at home. I just can't
(0:21:30) Al: get it." But it was only two days. It was only two days, yeah. But it wasn't even
(0:21:30) Kev: mmm your squid word and patrick and sponger outside
(0:21:37) Al: like it feels worse than the people who just weren't getting it, I feel, right? Because
(0:21:42) Kev: yeah yeah yeah yeah
(0:21:42) Al: you're like, "Oh yeah, that's annoying, and I don't have it, and I feel like I'm missing
(0:21:46) Al: out." But I was like, "I have paid money, and I have had one delivered to me. It's just
(0:21:51) Kev: I shouldn't be missing out
(0:21:52) Al: I am not where it is."
(0:21:55) Kev: oh there yeah I can see that that's funny yeah obviously I haven't gotten my
(0:22:00) Kev: i'll probably have or well not mine i'm getting one for calvin next week is a little late birthday
(0:22:05) Kev: present um so i'll be able to join the ranks of people driving his cow and talking about it
(0:22:16) Kev: 24 racers that's insane
(0:22:16) Al: um it is and it does it does mean that you like especially the there's a lot of kind of I think
(0:22:24) Al: they might need to do some rebalancing in terms of how things work especially like the rubber
(0:22:28) Al: banding and stuff like that because like if you don't if you if you don't get up to first place
(0:22:30) Kev: Oh, yeah
(0:22:33) Al: quickly you're probably not going to stay there uh um the the middle just feels absolutely insane
(0:22:36) Kev: Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good stuff. I
(0:22:41) Al: just now. So, yeah.
(0:22:43) Kev: Can't you know back in back in the old days there are eight racers
(0:22:55) Kev: It's crazy to think like there are some chunks with that many characters
(0:22:59) Al: You have to have two whole pages to view everyone.
(0:23:00) Kev: in a race
(0:23:03) Kev: The rankings, oh my goodness. Oh, that's incredible. Oh
(0:23:10) Kev: Good time
(0:23:12) Al: The other thing I've tried out on my Switch 2 is Pokemon Violet, and let me tell you,
(0:23:18) Al: obviously if you didn't like the game before, you're not going to like the game suddenly
(0:23:20) Kev: Right, it doesn't fix a lot of the core design issues, but yeah.
(0:23:21) Al: now that it's running at a decent speed.
(0:23:24) Al: Exactly, it's still the same game, but my word is incredible.
(0:23:29) Al: If you like the game, it is an incredible upgrade, just so good.
(0:23:36) Kev: - Mm-hmm, but yeah, yeah, I'll sit.
(0:23:41) Al: It drives me insane whenever I see anyone talking about this and people will reply and
(0:23:45) Al: be like, "Oh, it's $500 to get the game how it should have been."
(0:23:49) Al: I don't shut up.
(0:23:50) Al: I don't care.
(0:23:51) Al: It doesn't matter.
(0:23:52) Al: Yeah, you don't like it.
(0:23:53) Al: Don't play it.
(0:23:54) Al: Don't buy this.
(0:23:55) Al: Shut up, right?
(0:23:56) Al: Let me enjoy the fact that this game now runs incredibly.
(0:23:59) Al: And you know what I'm most excited for with this is how well I think the new game's going
(0:24:05) Al: to run.
(0:24:06) Al: Because there's no way it will run worse than this, right?
(0:24:10) Kev: Well, well.
(0:24:10) Al: Because well, no, no, no, let me, let me, let me.
(0:24:13) Al: So my point is, right, like it is a clearly a much more small and focused world, right?
(0:24:19) Al: And one of the big issues of this game was the fact that the world is like all loaded
(0:24:23) Al: at once.
(0:24:24) Kev: Oh, oh you're talking about ZA. I thought you meant yeah. Okay. Oh no. Yeah. Yes
(0:24:25) Al: Yeah, yeah. Oh, no, I'm not even thinking about that.
(0:24:29) Al: just now. Not even thinking about that just now.
(0:24:30) Kev: Yeah, ZA is gonna be great. Yeah. Sure sure sure. Yeah, that's fine
(0:24:34) Al: And so if this game runs this well, like surely that game will run just as well. And
(0:24:40) Al: it's going to be so good. And I think it looks, it looks better, right? Like a lot of the
(0:24:45) Al: thing about this game is that it just looks bland and meh. And yeah, the character models
(0:24:46) Kev: Mm-hmm. Yeah, absolutely.
(0:24:51) Al: don't look amazing in the new game, but I don't really care about that, right? Like everything
(0:24:55) Al: else in my opinion looks a lot nicer, kind of like the, you know, the
(0:24:59) Al: bright colours in the night. I think the night time in particular is going to look really good in that game, especially on
(0:25:04) Kev: I agree. Yeah, that is nice, right? Because, like, okay, obviously, we all know I'm unknown,
(0:25:12) Kev: Scarlet Violet, Disparage or Dissenter, whatever you want to call it, right? I'm critical.
(0:25:16) Al: For fair reasons, I've like, I've not, I've never, I've never said that your reasons are not the totally fair reasons.
(0:25:18) Kev: Just a little bit critical. Like you said, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, like, you know, there's a lot of design choices.
(0:25:30) Kev: Design Choices.
(0:25:32) Kev: I don't like other people who I like.
(0:25:34) Kev: It's not fixing those issues, but like I think just how poorly it ran.
(0:25:44) Kev: You know that like I'm an Nintendo fan.
(0:25:46) Kev: I'm a Pokemon fan.
(0:25:48) Kev: I don't care about technical stuff, generally speaking, right?
(0:25:52) Kev: But like it was just so bad that even even someone like me, it felt embarrassing.
(0:25:58) Kev: Like it was rough.
(0:26:00) Kev: So it's nice to have at least that improved.
(0:26:01) Al: No one, no one defends it. Right? Like with, with other, with other games, like Legends,
(0:26:08) Al: like some of us are like, actually, I like how it looks, right? Like I, you know, I don't,
(0:26:10) Kev: Yeah
(0:26:12) Al: I think that a lot of that is down to taste, but with, with the performance issues in this
(0:26:14) Kev: Sure
(0:26:17) Al: game, it was just embarrassing. Nobody justified it. And if anybody even tried to, you'd be
(0:26:19) Kev: It would nope, yeah, yeah
(0:26:22) Al: like, come on, like let's be real here. You can like the game and still admit how terrible
(0:26:28) Al: the performances. Whereas now, it's just...
(0:26:29) Kev: Yep
(0:26:33) Kev: Yeah, it's crazy I've seen clips online it's wild the difference
(0:26:38) Kev: I genuinely did.
(0:26:42) Kev: I did not think it would upgrade that much.
(0:26:44) Al: Yeah. And that's handheld as well, not even docked. In handheld, it feels incredible.
(0:26:47) Kev: That's crazy.
(0:26:52) Kev: Important question.
(0:26:55) Kev: Have you tried the raids?
(0:26:57) Kev: Because that was the...
(0:26:57) Al: I have not. Yeah, I'm not convinced it's going to make a massive difference to raids, because
(0:26:59) Kev: Okay, 'cause that's...
(0:27:00) Kev: I mean, it's great the world runs right now,
(0:27:02) Kev: but the raids, like...
(0:27:05) Kev: Oh.
(0:27:08) Al: I think a lot of the issue with raids was the internet communication. But I don't tend
(0:27:12) Kev: Yeah, probably, but I was curious it's like
(0:27:17) Al: to do raids a huge amount. I do them when there's a seven star out, if possible. If
(0:27:20) Kev: Yeah
(0:27:21) Al: possible I do them as a solo build, so I don't have to deal with other people.
(0:27:23) Kev: Mm-hmm, I yeah. No, that's fair
(0:27:28) Kev: But yeah, that's uh
(0:27:30) Kev: Because if raids were good like I genuinely might be tempted
(0:27:35) Kev: Consider another playthrough to give it a second chance on switch do but anyways, not that I'll have one for a while, but
(0:27:42) Al: Well, we'll see, we'll see.
(0:27:42) Kev: Anyways, that's good stuff
(0:27:46) Kev: that
(0:27:47) Kev: that's nice and
(0:27:49) Kev: Yeah, good on you Pokemon team for putting the effort to make that happen
(0:27:54) Al: Yeah, I clearly, like, I wonder whether they'd been working on this before the game came
(0:28:00) Al: out or whether this is in reaction to the game coming out and being terrible. Because
(0:28:04) Kev: Yeah.
(0:28:05) Al: they did tell us, like, oh, we hear you and we understand. And the question is, was that
(0:28:11) Al: the point where they go, oh, we can't just, like, let this go. Like, this is something
(0:28:16) Al: we actually need to deal with. And then, obviously, they've gone, like, decision made. Do we try
(0:28:21) Al: Try it our best to make it work as well on the switch, or do we just...
(0:28:24) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:28:24) Al: take all of the nonsense that we're going to get for the next two and a half years,
(0:28:28) Al: and then throw it all on the switch too, and hope that we gain back the positives for that.
(0:28:35) Al: I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case, right? That is a decent... That timeline works,
(0:28:38) Kev: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
(0:28:43) Al: that's more than two years. I could absolutely see that they hadn't even considered this
(0:28:45) Kev: Mm hmm.
(0:28:48) Al: until the reception was so bad, and then they've gone, "You know what? We do need to deal with
(0:28:52) Kev: Yeah, also
(0:28:52) Al: this and they had a small team dealing
(0:28:54) Al: with that for the last couple of years.
(0:28:56) Kev: Sure, I'll I'll you know, I'll say that they probably
(0:29:02) Kev: Whenever they found out switch to upgrades we're gonna have which I imagined was relatively early, you know, I
(0:29:08) Kev: Imagine they were planning one for scarlet violent
(0:29:10) Kev: I don't see a version where they weren't gonna do that
(0:29:12) Kev: What I don't think is I don't think they were gonna put in the effort they did for this because that I think was reactionary
(0:29:20) Kev: Because I think they wanted to
(0:29:22) Kev: You know try to clean up their act if you know if it had come out
(0:29:27) Kev: Not as good or you know if the original game might come out better
(0:29:32) Kev: I don't think it would have been this huge of a jump because they probably just
(0:29:32) Al: Well, yeah, yeah. I mean, because it wouldn't be better. I don't know. Yeah. I do feel like
(0:29:37) Kev: You know, then yeah. Well, yeah. Well, that's true, but they wouldn't put the effort, you know what I mean
(0:29:43) Al: I do think a lot of this is like, we need to make sure people actually buy our next
(0:29:47) Al: game. Let's show them that we can actually make a good game or a smooth enough. Okay.
(0:29:47) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:29:52) Kev: Yeah
(0:29:53) Al: A well performing game. And, and I think that's probably has done a lot to improve people's
(0:29:59) Kev: Yeah
(0:30:00) Al: view on things, right?
(0:30:02) Kev: Yeah
(0:30:02) Al: People who were, you were probably worried about the next game, right?
(0:30:05) Kev: Yeah, well hey, you know like I make all the jokes about you know, we could the you know, then Gen 10 could fail
(0:30:12) Kev: or you know or whatever, you know, but
(0:30:15) Kev: But maybe this is actually a sign that they're actually trying to
(0:30:19) Kev: They're gonna try to double down or you know
(0:30:23) Kev: put in the effort to make sure it really comes out.
(0:30:25) Kev: Um yeah but okay good stuff that's that's really nice to know the power of the switch too.
(0:30:33) Al: it's good fun. All right, we have one piece of news I want to talk about before we just
(0:30:40) Al: go through the wholesome direct stuff that we want to talk about. Snacko, Snacko decided
(0:30:42) Kev: All right, what is it?
(0:30:43) Kev: What is it?
(0:30:46) Kev: That's the cat game.
(0:30:46) Al: that just after we released our last episode two weeks ago, they decided they were going
(0:30:54) Al: going to release their 1.0, just shadow drop it.
(0:30:56) Kev: That's correct. That's how this works in this gig, podcast world. Things happen as soon as
(0:31:07) Kev: you take a break. That's good.
(0:31:08) Al: And I'm not even joking. This was a legitimate shadow drop. Like I saw the Steam news about
(0:31:16) Al: Snacko 1.0 and I'm like, hold up, wait a minute. Did I miss something? And then I looked through
(0:31:19) Kev: Tempting you.
(0:31:21) Al: everything and nope, I did not miss anything. This was just surprise. Here you go. Here's
(0:31:27) Al: the new, here's 1.0. So there we go. Snacko 1.0. It's probably finally time for me to
(0:31:35) Kev: Probably. I'm just looking at it, it looks nice. Yeah, that's a, they're little like pixely,
(0:31:45) Kev: 2D, 3D thing, it looks nice, and the cat's very cute. Yeah, good for you, Snaggo. You made it to
(0:31:52) Kev: 1.0, like, that's always a genuine cause for celebration, assuming it's a real 1.0,
(0:31:58) Kev: and not one of those 1.0s, yeah, it's kind of 1.0, but not really, because we still have a whole
(0:32:02) Kev: a whole bunch of other stuff that didn't make it in yet.
(0:32:04) Al: Yeah, I think they've got more updates coming, but it feels like it looks like it's extra stuff.
(0:32:09) Al: But having said that, I haven't played through it, so I don't know.
(0:32:11) Kev: Yeah.
(0:32:12) Kev: Sure, sure, yeah, yeah, I know.
(0:32:14) Kev: But I'm just saying, we all know those games out there
(0:32:17) Kev: that at 1.0 really should not have been at 1.0.
(0:32:18) Al: Yep. Yep, yep, yep, yep, we do, we do.
(0:32:23) Kev: But-- but-- yeah.
(0:32:24) Al: It doesn't feel, from what I know about the game and the developers,
(0:32:28) Al: it doesn't feel like something they would do.
(0:32:30) Al: I don't feel like they would just go, "Here we go."
(0:32:30) Kev: Yeah, from what-- yeah, like, I also agree.
(0:32:34) Kev: - Yeah, I agree.
(0:32:35) Kev: Very cute game, always has been cute, still cute.
(0:32:40) Kev: I might be interested in, oh, there's a demo.
(0:32:42) Kev: I might, I'll download that demo at the very least.
(0:32:44) Kev: Good for you, Snacko.
(0:32:46) Al: All right, let's talk about the Wholesome Direct then.
(0:32:49) Kev: Okay, okay.
(0:32:51) Kev: Before we get into, because obviously we got our list,
(0:32:54) Kev: I want to comment on the presentation,
(0:32:56) Kev: 'cause man, an hour straight of wholesome and cozy,
(0:33:03) Kev: Oh, it's a little it's.
(0:33:05) Kev: A little much and you know, obviously that's the nature of the beast, but you know, I'm just look, I don't know how big wholesome games their operation is right and and and they're they're trying right like they highlight so many streamers or you know, content creators or whatever and oh good for you, you know, little spotlight on these guys, but you know, maybe, maybe just just put a little more into that, right?
(0:33:06) Al: - Yeah.
(0:33:32) Kev: Every, I can't just, I'm not.
(0:33:35) Kev: I'm not blaming any one streamer because they, but they all just happened to have the same, you know, just palette color palette swap backgrounds of a shelf with plushies and some plants.
(0:33:46) Al: Yeah, yeah, I definitely found that as well. The other thing that I found was like everybody
(0:33:50) Al: talks in this calm voice. Yeah, exactly. It's like cosy games, right? First of all, it's
(0:33:54) Kev: - ASMR?
(0:33:55) Kev: - Yup.
(0:34:00) Al: not cosy games. It's wholesome direct, right? The whole point was it's like we want a place
(0:34:03) Kev: - Yeah, huh?
(0:34:05) Al: to show a bunch of games that are not just shooting zombies, right? And that is a totally
(0:34:10) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:34:11) Al: fair thing and that's why I like it and it doesn't that doesn't
(0:34:14) Kev: Yeah.
(0:34:16) Al: have to mean calm and quiet and trying to send you to sleep which is I definitely felt like it was I don't know whether it's always been like this and I'm just getting annoyed with it or whether it's getting more like this but yeah I was absolutely the same every streamer was the exact same voice and background and I also think that there was a little bit weird and like having a different streamer to introduce every single game felt a bit weird
(0:34:33) Kev: >> Yeah.
(0:34:46) Al: in the every time there was a streamer on they were like here's my name here's my channel here's what I do and it was all the same as well it's like oh we do everything cozy and you're like oh my word like yes you are just the exact same as all the other ones we've just seen like I don't it was yeah I agree I'm glad you felt the same because it was just too much for me
(0:34:52) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And again, and yeah, and again, I'm not blaming any individual
(0:35:09) Kev: streamer because I'm sure they got their prompt and they do their thing and that's why. But
(0:35:13) Kev: when, you know, the wholesome gang people, when they were putting, cutting, pasting all
(0:35:16) Kev: this together, somebody should have said, you know what, this might be a little much.
(0:35:20) Al: You get, it's the same, it's the same with everything, right? Like it's when, when you
(0:35:23) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
(0:35:24) Al: watch a Nintendo direct and you have the two hosts who make the same terrible jokes after
(0:35:30) Al: every single game, you get annoyed about that. And when you have the Xbox showcase and like
(0:35:35) Al: half of them are shooting zombies in the face, it's the same thing again. It's just like,
(0:35:38) Kev: - Mm-hmm.
(0:35:39) Al: why are all these games the same? And, and why is the presentation so long? And so like,
(0:35:46) Al: I think maybe we need to spread these things out a little bit more in the year, right? Like
(0:35:51) Al: June, for releasing game information, do we really need to?
(0:35:55) Kev: Yeah, yeah
(0:35:59) Kev: Yeah, I agree or or you know what I'm trying to look up a year
(0:36:06) Al: It's 2025.
(0:36:08) Kev: Yeah, not our year I'm I'm trying to look to the the highest
(0:36:13) Kev: The high bar of video game presentations at 2014. That's what it was the Nintendo
(0:36:20) Kev: 2014 e3 presentation. That's the one where we had a
(0:36:25) Kev: and Reggie fighting
(0:36:27) Kev: With their DBZ fight with the amiibo humor that that one
(0:36:27) Al: Mm hmm. Yeah.
(0:36:32) Kev: Obviously not every company is gonna be able to produce goofy bits like that or whatever
(0:36:36) Kev: But you know that the point is they tried right? They they put a little a little effort into the presentation
(0:36:44) Kev: And so, you know, it'd be nice right? What's crazy to me is some of these bits were like the streamers introducing game
(0:36:49) Kev: Didn't even mention the game
(0:36:51) Kev: They just said he was a world premiere
(0:36:52) Al: yeah yeah well there is that I i don't know I also think like the live ones are really
(0:36:55) Kev: But anyways, I digress
(0:36:59) Al: annoying as well right did you watch the friday's summer game fest it was just really it was really
(0:37:01) Kev: Mm-hmm
(0:37:03) Kev: No, I haven't watched any other I've just seen the the bids oh
(0:37:08) Al: awkward I didn't like it and like there's something about jeff keeley that like i'm not saying he
(0:37:10) Kev: Yeah
(0:37:14) Al: doesn't like games i'm sure he does i'm sure he does like games but the way he presents himself
(0:37:20) Al: is corporate students.
(0:37:21) Kev: Uh-huh, yep, that's correct.
(0:37:22) Al: And I can't take him seriously and it's like when there was a point where he was like oh
(0:37:29) Al: something some game was shown and he was like wow looks great and he moved on to the next thing
(0:37:34) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's kind of underlying the point, right? You want to get somebody
(0:37:35) Al: and I'm like you did not sound sincere there, what are you on about?
(0:37:43) Kev: who's sincere about the presentation or whatever is being presented, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
(0:37:46) Al: Which Reggie did well. That was his thing. Like, he was a corporate guy and we all knew that,
(0:37:52) Al: and we all knew that he would probably sell us if he could. But you also got that he cared,
(0:37:55) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right.
(0:37:58) Al: and I don't know whether that was real or not, but you definitely believed that he cared.
(0:38:04) Kev: I mean, I think he cared, but maybe that's just part of the whole thing he did. I don't
(0:38:09) Kev: know, but he, like the important thing is he made us believe he cared, right? He could
(0:38:13) Kev: talk about his games. Like it sounded like someone who played the game or knew of the
(0:38:17) Kev: game to whatever degree. And yeah, you're right. Like that's what we need. We just need
(0:38:23) Kev: people who know, who care, who are sincere. Like they'll, even if it's, you know, just
(0:38:29) Kev: some of a blurb, you can feel that, right? So the point to one.
(0:38:34) Kev: Well, long story short, wild. I forget what the new one is. Wildflowers people call me.
(0:38:40) Kev: I'll do the blurb for your next one. I'll do it. All right. Let's get into it.
(0:38:42) Al: Alright, let's talk about some games then. I don't know if you've got anything else that
(0:38:49) Al: you want to talk about other than the stuff that's in this list, because I think, but
(0:38:52) Kev: OK, there's-- here, let me see if I can find a--
(0:38:53) Al: I think this is all the Cottagecore related stuff in my list. Let's go, let's go with
(0:39:01) Kev: just go to-- I'll be looking up another list.
(0:39:04) Al: it. So we started off with Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar. No new real information, but
(0:39:10) Al: There was a new trailer with some.
(0:39:12) Al: Uh, bits and pieces and, uh, I'm going to be honest.
(0:39:15) Al: I'm really excited about this game.
(0:39:16) Al: I think I'm, I've, I never played the original obviously.
(0:39:19) Al: Um, and it does things a bit differently.
(0:39:20) Kev: Yeah, it looks it looks good. I'll say that. It looks like it has that, you know, Nintendo
(0:39:21) Al: Um, so I'm excited to play it.
(0:39:32) Kev: C.Lo quality story of seasons quality that they do. It looks good. I'll say that. Yeah.
(0:39:32) Al: Next one that I wanted to talk about was gourdlets together. So it's a new gourdlets game. It's
(0:39:44) Al: a multiplayer gourdlets game. Which I feel like is a fun thing to add into a gourdlets
(0:39:50) Al: game. I guess the question is, does this feel like it should have been a separate game or
(0:39:55) Al: should it have been an update to gourdlets? I don't know, but it is what it is. I guess
(0:39:57) Kev: another mode. I don't either. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true. Well, I could have seen that even
(0:40:02) Al: it's cheap. It feels a bit selfish to ask for anything more.
(0:40:16) Kev: more paid DLC by that point with the difference. But yeah, I guess so. I don't know. It's not
(0:40:22) Kev: appealing to me, like, I don't know, I'm just not feeling it, but it's cool.
(0:40:27) Kev: It's cool to see them, you know, wanting to do this.
(0:40:30) Al: Yeah, it also feels, I think it feels much, it looks like it's much more character-based
(0:40:36) Al: rather than obviously the girdlets was design-based, like management style, whereas this, I think,
(0:40:43) Al: looks like you're controlling a character because it's the multiplayer aspect. So I'm
(0:40:49) Al: thinking that might vibe with me more than the previous one.
(0:40:52) Kev: Yeah. No, I can see that. That's fair.
(0:40:56) Al: we got something that you'll be interested in, Luma Island, the
(0:41:00) Kev: Well, you know what I do like pirates you're right about that
(0:41:06) Al: Well you played. Did you not play Luma Island? Am I misremembering?
(0:41:06) Kev: It looks I didn't play them island. No, that wasn't me
(0:41:10) Al: Oh, I know Johnny did, but I thought you had done as well. Oh well.
(0:41:13) Kev: No, I don't think no that was me but I do like pirates
(0:41:15) Al: Well the Luma Island pirate update is coming out on the 20th of June. So we had,
(0:41:19) Al: we already knew about the pirate update, but now we know that it's coming out next week.
(0:41:26) Kev: you go. It's pretty looking, I guess. I like pirates, I don't know. Okay, like, you know,
(0:41:32) Al: We got a new trailer for tales of the shire as well.
(0:41:38) Kev: in the past week, I actually watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And like, dang, man,
(0:41:44) Kev: what a what a legacy you have to live up to. Okay, first off, did we have a date? Because
(0:41:54) Kev: We finally got a date.
(0:41:55) Al: We did. We did have a date when when they delayed it from March, they gave us a date of that point. So yeah, this is this is still what we were expecting.
(0:41:56) Kev: I'm kidding. Okay. Okay. Well, that's soon. It looks kind of like where it was at. I don't
(0:42:07) Kev: know what to say. I'm pretty sure the game is clear what it's going to be. And as I watched
(0:42:16) Kev: The Lord of the Rings and looking at this trailer, I'm thinking, "I don't know if this
(0:42:21) Kev: is the one for me. I'm not the one who wants to live in a hobbit. I want to hang out with
(0:42:26) Kev: you." That's what I want to do in Middle Earth.
(0:42:28) Al: Yeah. I'm a bit the same. I just, I don't know what it is about this game that's not
(0:42:36) Al: grabbing me because A Lord of the Rings, Shire based culture game should be something that
(0:42:42) Al: I would love, but I just, I don't know. There's just, it's not grabbed me in anything other
(0:42:48) Al: than the concept since it was announced.
(0:42:48) Kev: yeah yeah that's the hard part right is the concept gonna be better than the game maybe
(0:42:57) Kev: uh that's that's you know that's tough it like I said it's when you put the lord of the rings
(0:43:03) Kev: name on the box you have made things so much harder for yourself because that's a lot of
(0:43:08) Kev: expectations on now um but we'll see maybe when it comes on it's actually incredible I don't know
(0:43:16) Kev: Gandalf looked very kawaii, I'll give him that.
(0:43:18) Kev: They give us little ubu Gandalf.
(0:43:21) Al: "I think it's the character models that really confuse me. It's not that I hate how they look,
(0:43:27) Kev: Yeah, they do feel a little weird.
(0:43:28) Al: I just... I don't know. It's so hard to explain."
(0:43:33) Kev: Yeah, no, I know exactly what you mean.
(0:43:35) Kev: It's something-- it's just a little je ne sais quoi.
(0:43:40) Kev: I agree.
(0:43:42) Al: Not normally used in a positive frame, not a negative frame, but fair enough.
(0:43:42) Kev: But yeah.
(0:43:49) Kev: But we'll see.
(0:43:50) Kev: It's coming out soon.
(0:43:51) Kev: And maybe it'll surprise us still.
(0:43:56) Al: Next, we had a new game, Linked Banner of the Spark. Build a bright new world alongside
(0:44:01) Kev: oh my goodness this game
(0:44:05) Al: a band of rescued robot buddies in this colourful action RPG, battle waves of enemies in solo
(0:44:10) Al: or co-op, then return home and use your parts to craft a thriving town, assemble your crew,
(0:44:15) Al: and grow stronger with each new adventure. I mean, this is basically like robot cult
(0:44:19) Al: of the lamb, right? Go out and get stuff, and then save some creatures, and then come
(0:44:24) Al: back and build a town.
(0:44:27) Al: Kotlin did it really well, so if it implements it well, I think this could be really good.
(0:44:32) Kev: It looks so good to me.
(0:44:34) Kev: Like, oh man, 'cause I've never called credit
(0:44:40) Kev: within the trailer show.
(0:44:41) Kev: There's still like some gardening
(0:44:42) Kev: or something like that, I think.
(0:44:43) Al: There's definitely farming, I'm seeing a farming plot.
(0:44:43) Kev: But either, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
(0:44:47) Al: It doesn't look like it's a big thing, it looks like it's relatively small, but it is
(0:44:53) Kev: But like, it does it great.
(0:44:56) Kev: 'Cause you have that and you have, you know,
(0:44:57) Kev: you're throwing robots in there.
(0:44:58) Kev: Well, you know, that can be a different number of ways,
(0:45:01) Kev: but the robot portion of it.
(0:45:02) Kev: It looks sick, like you have a lot of knife hands like there's some that look kind of threatening or genuinely actiony.
(0:45:09) Kev: Um, there's robot fish. That's kind of fun. Um, I'm excited about this one. This one is high up on my list. It looks great. Um, the gameplay looks like what I want to the world's colorful. I can't wait. I'm so excited for this one.
(0:45:26) Al: Yeah, I agree. Looks really fun.
(0:45:28) Kev: All right, what's next that's not linked and thusly not as high on my list.
(0:45:32) Kev: Oh well that blew up in my face because I forgot no this one is high up on my list too.
(0:45:32) Al: Milano Milano's odd collection or job collection.
(0:45:43) Al: This one is, I think, PlayStation style is what they're going.
(0:45:48) Al: They're calling it PlayStation one style.
(0:45:48) Kev: Is
(0:45:53) Al: It's.
(0:45:55) Kev: You okay, you got I guess so you've got 90s anime vibe
(0:45:56) Al: A bunch of mini games, I guess.
(0:46:02) Kev: and yet a bunch of mini games like you the character named Milano and she's milking full-line cows and
(0:46:10) Kev: Serving food and doing stuff like I don't I don't know but oh, this is appealing to the weaves
(0:46:16) Kev: This is a certain of like 90 90s and
(0:46:18) Kev: I'm a aesthetic that gets right to my heart. I'm excited and you can take her to house
(0:46:26) Kev: Yeah, I'm very excited about this one shocker Kevin the weeb is excited for Jeff
(0:46:33) Al: Next we have Heidi's legacy mountains calling, which by the way, what a terrible name.
(0:46:44) Kev: Oh, is this the sheep one, the goat one? Yeah. Which it stinks because it's such a unique
(0:46:45) Al: That's so bad. So bad. Yes. Yeah, yeah.
(0:46:52) Kev: looking game, right? It has, in my opinion, a great looking art style, or at least very
(0:46:57) Kev: distinctive because it's kind of Paper Mario-y, or like the characters look a little flat
(0:47:04) Kev: in 3D world, but it's almost like storybook, maybe I would say, because it's like a more
(0:47:11) Kev: detailed realistic art style than the cartonnier.
(0:47:14) Kev: You're taking care of goats and doing stuff, it's very pretty game, but you're right, it's an awful name.
(0:47:22) Al: Yeah, it reminds me, the graphics and the gameplay style, it reminds me a lot of a Highland
(0:47:28) Al: song, which is the one about climbing mountains. It just in that kind of like, it's 2D, but
(0:47:29) Kev: >> Yeah.
(0:47:36) Al: you kind of like, there's multiple layers to it. So you can like, you can appear in
(0:47:40) Al: a back or a back bit of the place where you were previously in a front bit. And yeah,
(0:47:41) Kev: Yeah
(0:47:47) Al: it's interesting. I hate the name. I feel like you could have easily simplified it to
(0:47:52) Al: Heidi's Mountain. It gives you everything you want from there, right? Like I just, like
(0:47:55) Kev: Yeah
(0:47:56) Al: there's so many other, anyway, it just, it's such a long, nobody's ever going to remember
(0:47:59) Al: that whole name. Like, what are you doing?
(0:48:01) Kev: Yeah
(0:48:03) Kev: Yeah, and you usually say they know those the colon subtitle for like a sequel or something, right?
(0:48:08) Kev: Why you don't need open with that
(0:48:12) Al: Um, yeah, no, it looks interesting.
(0:48:14) Al: It's definitely farming based.
(0:48:16) Al: There's a lot of farming, a lot of different farming things there.
(0:48:19) Al: There's, uh, because you've got the animals.
(0:48:21) Al: Um, and then you have to like, uh, do other things.
(0:48:24) Al: There's some, there is some gardening type thing with mushrooms and stuff like that.
(0:48:30) Al: Uh, you have to take care of the goats.
(0:48:33) Al: You have to milk the goats.
(0:48:35) Al: Um, you have to play with the goats.
(0:48:37) Al: There's a shop there's, you know, it looks interesting.
(0:48:42) Kev: Yeah, it does
(0:48:44) Kev: It caught my eye. That's for sure. It's pretty good. I have nothing else
(0:48:50) Kev: All right, what's next
(0:48:52) Al: Hotel Galactic have announced that their early access is coming the 24th of July.
(0:48:54) Kev: You know what
(0:48:57) Kev: Golf clap for the wholesome direct it took them that long to reach a whole studio Ghibli inspired game
(0:49:05) Kev: Almost an hour in good for it's good for them. They held off
(0:49:09) Kev: but
(0:49:10) Kev: Yeah
(0:49:12) Kev: It's the it's spirited away that's the one you do you like spirited away here's a game for you
(0:49:20) Al: I do like the the visual of the like management of the hotel where you've got that almost
(0:49:26) Kev: - Yeah.
(0:49:26) Al: like Spiritfarer style view of your building. I really like that. I do think the rest of
(0:49:29) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:49:32) Kev: Yeah.
(0:49:33) Al: the game is not for me and would really annoy me. But I'm just I'm a real sucker for that
(0:49:40) Al: like vertical side on view of a tall building that you're shoving things onto. There's something
(0:49:44) Kev: Mm hmm. Yeah. Sure. Or maybe, or maybe you want to play what
(0:49:47) Al: really fun about that and maybe I'd maybe
(0:49:50) Al: just want to place bit of hair again maybe that's what the problem is
(0:49:55) Kev: was that other one the other spirit fair game I forget I'll
(0:49:57) Kev: find it. So it's like a flamingo or flamingo pulling your
(0:50:02) Kev: boat. Anyways, I'll find it. There was a game in here. Don't
(0:50:04) Al: I have no idea what you're talking about.
(0:50:08) Kev: you worry.
(0:50:10) Al: Next we have 'out and about', which may have previously or may still be called 'wholesome'
(0:50:16) Al: out and about. I'm still not sure what its actual name is.
(0:50:19) Kev: Oh, don't you love that when you name confusion?
(0:50:24) Al: They've released a new trailer and said that they've got a playtest coming.
(0:50:27) Al: So the name on Steam is 'out and about', but their title screen still said 'wholesome'.
(0:50:34) Al: 'Out and about' and then the playtest says 'join the wholesome out and about playtest'.
(0:50:39) Al: But in the direct they just called it 'out and about'.
(0:50:43) Al: What's the name of this game? What's it called?
(0:50:43) Kev: Okay. That's it. I don't know. Yeah. I forgot about this game. I'll be on it looking at
(0:50:49) Al: 'Out and about' is OK. It's not a great name, but it's OK. 'Wholesome out and about' is a bad name.
(0:51:00) Kev: the -- oh, yeah, it's the one with that girl's head looks like a mushroom. Like, I'm sorry,
(0:51:06) Kev: but it's a crowded market. It's a tough sell, but --
(0:51:12) Al: It's a photography-based game. Foraging photography.
(0:51:14) Kev: yeah.
(0:51:18) Kev: Yeah, I've been thinking about that because obviously there are a handful of photography games because that's cozy or wholesome or whatever, like
(0:51:25) Al: If you're gonna play a photography game, just play ALBA. It is the best. Do it.
(0:51:31) Kev: Oh, you know, I was going to say snap, but you know what?
(0:51:34) Kev: Apple's good, too.
(0:51:34) Al: Or snap. Yeah, if you like Pokemon, then fine. But if you want something that's not Pokemon,
(0:51:35) Kev: I'll give you a hug.
(0:51:39) Al: ALBA is the one to play. It's incredible. It's nice sized. It's good. Good game.
(0:51:39) Kev: Yeah.
(0:51:41) Kev: Yeah, that's fair.
(0:51:45) Kev: Yeah, I agree.
(0:51:47) Kev: I agree.
(0:51:48) Kev: Cozy Cove, that's the game I was trying to-- or Collector's Cove.
(0:51:51) Kev: Excuse me, Collector's Cove.
(0:51:52) Al: Oh, yeah, we've got that where we got that later on. We'll get to it.
(0:51:54) Kev: OK, I'm just saying that Spear of Terror.
(0:51:54) Al: We'll get to that. That's fine. That's fair.
(0:51:55) Kev: OK, all right, let's go to-- OK, next.
(0:51:57) Kev: Let's go to it.
(0:51:58) Al: Discounty.
(0:51:58) Kev: All right, what's next?
(0:51:59) Kev: Oh, all this one.
(0:52:01) Al: Discounty have announced that they launch on the 21st of August.
(0:52:05) Al: As far as I can see, that's not early access.
(0:52:08) Kev: Good good for you
(0:52:10) Kev: Discounty, so
(0:52:12) Kev: Look, I believe our
(0:52:14) Kev: Views on business management running a shop games are established. You're not fond of them. I am I
(0:52:22) Kev: Don't know what to say like I
(0:52:24) Kev: Was kind of eh, I like I mean look decent look good and all but what was it something towards the end?
(0:52:30) Kev: When um, hold on see the rewatching the trailers
(0:52:34) Kev: But I mean, I personally like running a shop, film managing inventory.
(0:52:38) Kev: Oh yeah, and then you see like a creepy shadow person at the end.
(0:52:41) Kev: All right, now, this might call my attention there at the end. I'm intrigued.
(0:52:42) Al: I will say, I'm not, it's not, okay, I do generally dislike shop games, but it's more
(0:52:53) Al: just because I've never found one that's fun. This intrigues me in so much as it's not,
(0:52:59) Al: so what I hate about most shop games is you've got like, you get the stuff and you go to
(0:53:04) Al: the shop and then people go and go, "Oh, I want to buy this," and you go, "Well, take
(0:53:08) Al: it then, go away. And it's like, if you have stuff, they buy it.
(0:53:12) Al: don't have stuff, they don't buy it. And like, there's nothing really, maybe there's
(0:53:16) Al: some haggling, but not really. And it just like, whatever. Whereas what this is, is like,
(0:53:18) Kev: - Mm-hmm.
(0:53:24) Al: you're more like taking things from storage and putting them in on the shop floor and
(0:53:28) Al: you're like balancing that levels of stock and stuff like that. That is more interesting
(0:53:33) Al: to me, because it's almost like puzzle like, right? And it's like, you need to make sure
(0:53:36) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. [laughs] Sure. Sure.
(0:53:38) Al: that you have everything. And like, if you run low on something, you need to go get some
(0:53:41) Al: more rather than just be.
(0:53:42) Al: Like I have stuff by my stuff, right?
(0:53:46) Al: Like it's like that almost, there's just like, it's just a shipping bin with more steps.
(0:53:52) Al: Whereas this is like a whole different game.
(0:53:55) Al: And I think that's why this could be interesting.
(0:53:58) Al: Whereas every other game that I've had with a shop is just like,
(0:54:01) Al: let's just make selling stuff more complicated.
(0:54:04) Kev: Yeah, okay.
(0:54:05) Al: Right?
(0:54:05) Al: Whereas this is logistics, rather than just like making it slower to sell things.
(0:54:10) Kev: Okay. Well, there you go.
(0:54:12) Kev: I'm certainly interested. All I might, it's very likely very possible, but we'll see. It's coming out soon. So, you know, one way or another, we'll find out.
(0:54:20) Kev: Good stuff. Discount.
(0:54:23) Al: Well, speaking of using a subtitle for a sequel, we have 'Islanders, New Shores', which is the sequel to 'Islanders'.
(0:54:36) Kev: excuse me that yawn was not related um I i know I did not play islanders it's
(0:54:37) Al: Did you play 'Islanders'?
(0:54:45) Kev: i'm looking at this one you're just building little islands that's cute I guess no
(0:54:48) Al: Yeah, yeah, this basically just looks like more of the same which is good because people liked what they had
(0:54:53) Kev: yeah yeah pretty much well there you go then you know good good on you no one what's good
(0:55:00) Kev: um am I interested in this I don't know um some of those islands do get uh
(0:55:07) Kev: pretty big and uh I have a lot of stuff I will see
(0:55:12) Al: It's almost like a, it's like a micro city building game based on islands.
(0:55:18) Al: And it is, but it's almost, I think, if I remember correctly, it's like each island
(0:55:24) Al: is almost a puzzle and you have to get to a, not to an end point, but like, you
(0:55:28) Al: have to satisfy criteria and once you get to that point, you've completed the level.
(0:55:31) Kev: Okay. Okay, that's more and much more interesting to me because, you know, this style of sandboxing, creating games, right? Like, you know, we had a handful of them in this direct, but like, I think of Garden Galaxy, right? I think that's, I like when there's criteria to meet when you can fail or succeed or whatever, that makes it a lot more, you know, a little more puzzle-like than just building a random garden or island or whatever.
(0:56:01) Kev: So, I'm gonna have to hear. I will say that. That does make me more interested. What else we got?
(0:56:04) Al: All right, next we have Collector's Cove.
(0:56:08) Kev: All right. That's, oh, that's, that's the one. Not a flamingo. I don't know what that is a flamingo. It's a, it's the easiest word. Story. It's the longest monster. Yeah.
(0:56:14) Al: Oh, I see what you mean.
(0:56:16) Al: Yeah, you're on a ship that is part which is being carried pulled by sea creatures.
(0:56:21) Kev: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. This is the very Spiritfarer looking boat.
(0:56:30) Al: Farming on a bull.
(0:56:31) Kev: Yeah. Very Spiritfarer looking with the, you know, the guests or being the, you know, fairy, fairy men of the dead. I guess it's not part of it either. As far as I know, that'd be very surprising if it were.
(0:56:39) Al: Yeah.
(0:56:46) Al: They've announced that they've got a demo out now, so.
(0:56:49) Kev: It's cute. Is it enough for me? I don't know. I do appreciate the demos, right? That's always strong.
(0:56:50) Al: Maybe, maybe I'll try it.
(0:56:56) Al: I'm trying to do that more rather than just go like, this is a vaguely interesting game.
(0:57:01) Al: Let me buy it and then not play it.
(0:57:02) Al: Instead, I'm trying more to go, let me play the demo and see what I think.
(0:57:07) Al: and then maybe I'll buy it after that.
(0:57:10) Kev: Yeah, there you go
(0:57:12) Kev: Yeah, I mean it it is it does like you for what it's worth like
(0:57:17) Kev: Is it enough for me? I don't know but the demo. Oh, well, I tried the demo
(0:57:20) Kev: Maybe probably if we do an episode I'd try the demo
(0:57:26) Kev: See monsters to it pulls your ship
(0:57:30) Al: All right. And the final thing that I had on my list,
(0:57:32) Al: I don't know if there's anything you got as well.
(0:57:33) Kev: There's a handful
(0:57:35) Al: Let's so this one is town to city,
(0:57:40) Al: which is build an idyllic, 19th century Mediterranean town and help it flourish
(0:57:47) Al: into a prosperous city, freely place and customize each element to create
(0:57:51) Al: the perfect home for your growing population in this cozy city builder
(0:57:55) Al: from the creators of station to station.
(0:58:02) Kev: I think, I saw, I don't remember, like it has a weird like cubicle Minecraft-y look to it.
(0:58:08) Al: So, yeah, this is this is what's really interesting about this.
(0:58:11) Al: It is very much blocky and it's not it's not pixelated.
(0:58:14) Kev: Yep.
(0:58:16) Al: It's it's very much high resolution, but the models are blocks.
(0:58:17) Kev: Yeah, no, it's blocky. Yeah, like those Minecraft mods.
(0:58:22) Al: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it is.
(0:58:25) Al: It's high fidelity Minecraft.
(0:58:25) Kev: With the advanced lighting and all that. Yeah.
(0:58:26) Al: That's exactly what it is.
(0:58:28) Al: It's I'm not going to play this because, you know, everyone knows I hate management
(0:58:33) Al: But there's something interesting about this.
(0:58:33) Kev: Yeah, yeah, visually it does stand out, right? Because, yeah, yeah, like I said, so much
(0:58:40) Kev: jokingly, but no, I think that's the best descriptor. One of those high-end, high visual
(0:58:44) Kev: fidelity Minecraft mods. But yeah, that's all right. I'm not probably not gonna play it like
(0:58:52) Kev: it's fine, but I don't know, just it's no, it's no linked or whatever the odd job game was.
(0:58:59) Kev: I suppose they call, I don't remember, whatever.
(0:59:01) Al: uh, linked banner of the spark or the odd job game, Milano's odd job.
(0:59:02) Kev: Milano.
(0:59:05) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:59:07) Kev: Yeah, yeah.
(0:59:09) Kev: Yeah, it's not one of those.
(0:59:10) Kev: Anyway, so, I mean, you're a fine town and city,
(0:59:12) Kev: you're a town to city.
(0:59:14) Kev: I don't know, I'm not fond of that name, but, sorry.
(0:59:16) Al: It's a name that makes me go, "Ha, that's interesting, but am I ever going to remember it?"
(0:59:23) Kev: You know, all right, let's um, okay, so that's that's the list you had I have a few more I want to just just a quick few blurbs
(0:59:31) Kev: Let's see here. What was the first? Oh, I'm surprised you didn't list this one at all
(0:59:36) Kev: Ambrose niffet niff yet and the cleaned Bell
(0:59:41) Kev: it's like a
(0:59:41) Al: you're gonna have to write that down somewhere. What was that?
(0:59:44) Kev: That's a it
(0:59:46) Kev: The way they pitched it it's like a mystery detective game
(0:59:50) Kev: But the the visual style is like a craft
(0:59:53) Kev: It's like the it's entirely the visual style because it looks like tiny miniature dolls and high-end Yoshi's crafted world looking thing very pretty game
(1:00:02) Al: I don't remember seeing this one at all.
(1:00:22) Kev: Um,
(1:00:23) Kev: but unfortunately, it's on Kickstarter, so that's the big asterisk that it may not exist or be completely different when it comes out.
(1:00:31) Al: Yeah, yeah, yeah
(1:00:35) Kev: Let's see here. Oh, here's another one. Let's build a dungeon. I mean, that's just, you know, that's what that is what it is. Like, I love let's build a zoo. Well, I try this. Let's build a dungeon probably, but it's a different gate flavor of the game, but we'll see.
(1:00:46) Al: Yeah, I mean, let's be honest, I didn't bring it up because it's not Cottagecore,
(1:00:49) Al: but it's related to the podcast and that we've covered. Let's build a zoo. So that's fair.
(1:00:50) Kev: Yeah.
(1:00:53) Kev: Yeah. Okay. Um, again, in that sub genre, we have covered of nonograms. They're squeak, squeak cross. Um, it's nonograms, but you're building furniture for little mouse rats. I'm very cute. That's a great name. I will say that. Um, it's just not a guys. What can I say? Um,
(1:01:14) Kev: big hops. That's like a platform with a frog. That was kind of interesting. Oh, winter burrow again, very not like cottage core.
(1:01:24) Kev: You're a little rat out in the snowy tundra fighting creepy bugs. Um, uh, it look cool though. Um, let's see. I think those are the ones in the big ones, but then at the end, they have this montage that has like twice as many days. And some of those actually caught my eye.
(1:01:45) Kev: I'm trying to get through this just to find the names because there's one or two in here that really that did catch my eye.
(1:01:53) Kev: Oh, oh, what is it? Llamalandia. You're playing as a llama. Just like building a llama town with other llamas. That's a good one. Llamalandia. There's a demo out. Um, you could put a jacket on your llama. Um, that's a fun one. Um, sorry, I'm going through the sheep birds. That's a good one. It looks like a co-op. You're a sheep dog and you're hurting a bunch of sheep, but you can do with friends. It looks very entertaining. I don't know something satisfying about that.
(1:02:22) Al: I don't remember that. Where's that? Was that in the Wholesome Direct?
(1:02:23) Kev: Um, it's in the montage. Yeah. Yeah.
(1:02:26) Al: Oh, it was in the montage. Oh, come on. The montage was like 10 minutes long.
(1:02:30) Al: You think I was watching a 10 minute long thing of like,
(1:02:34) Al: "Here's five seconds of a game that you don't care about"? Come on!
(1:02:36) Kev: there's like see this is what's amazing to me that the montage I think had almost
(1:02:42) Kev: just as many games as the rest of the series the the direct some of them were better
(1:02:44) Al: think it had more games. It's just, it's not a useful way to get information about games.
(1:02:51) Kev: no but there's a capybara game that's um what's the one there's a
(1:02:51) Al: I really hate it. Sure.
(1:02:59) Kev: oh there's one with a girl with a flower on her head running a flourish shop that's
(1:03:03) Kev: That's kind of, that one's kind of pretty.
(1:03:07) Kev: Oh, as I call it, hold on, puny the florist.
(1:03:11) Kev: Um, that one just look very pretty.
(1:03:12) Kev: I like that one.
(1:03:13) Kev: Um, okay.
(1:03:14) Kev: I think I've done, oh wait, no, a social draft.
(1:03:15) Al: >>Ashkahn No.
(1:03:17) Kev: Did you see a social giraffe?
(1:03:21) Kev: So in it, you're playing this giraffe who's a social and like it's, I
(1:03:27) Kev: don't know how to describe it.
(1:03:28) Kev: Like it's not very clear with the.
(1:03:30) Al: point and click adventure game about a giraffe attempting to live his day-to-day
(1:03:32) Kev: Yeah.
(1:03:34) Al: life while not talking to anyone. Big mood.
(1:03:36) Kev: Yeah.
(1:03:37) Kev: Yeah.
(1:03:38) Kev: Um, that's what it is.
(1:03:38) Kev: And it has very cute, like distinct art styles, very cutesy, but the part
(1:03:42) Kev: that got me was just, just, just, obviously it's montage the super quick trailer.
(1:03:47) Kev: There's this part where the drift just jumps out a window to avoid talking
(1:03:51) Kev: to someone or like a party or something.
(1:03:54) Kev: Um, that was pretty good.
(1:03:55) Kev: That was a good bit.
(1:03:56) Kev: Um, okay.
(1:03:58) Kev: I'm done.
(1:03:58) Kev: There you go.
(1:03:59) Kev: There's my, there's my montage of comments on other games I saw.
(1:04:03) Al: All right. Well, that was a lot of news, a lot of things. There were a couple of bits
(1:04:03) Kev: Um good stuff.
(1:04:12) Al: of news that we haven't covered here because they happened between our last episode and
(1:04:16) Al: this one. And we'll probably talk about them in the next episode, but I knew there was
(1:04:20) Al: going to be so much news that people would not keep it in their brain if I added any
(1:04:24) Al: more news. So I think we're done. Thank you, Kevin, for joining me.
(1:04:30) Kev: - Thank you, Al, for having me on.
