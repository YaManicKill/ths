## Transcript

(0:00:29) Aislinn: Hello, farmers, and welcome to another episode of The Harvest Season.
(0:00:33) Aislinn: My name is Aislinn.
(0:00:34) Codey: And my name is Cody.
(0:00:36) Aislinn: And we are here to talk about cottagecore games.
(0:00:39) Codey: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, I've been doing the wolf
(0:00:39) Aislinn: Woo-hoo!
(0:00:42) Aislinn: We got some extra in there.
(0:00:46) Codey: one. The wolfish. Oh, oh, oh, I don't know why. Oh, you know,
(0:00:47) Aislinn: Ooh!
(0:00:50) Aislinn: All I can offer is just the woo.
(0:00:52) Aislinn: I can give a little meow.
(0:00:55) Codey: well, you're the you're the coup, aren't you? The
(0:00:58) Aislinn: That's true. I am the coup.
(0:00:59) Aislinn: I'm just I'm in I'm in cat my brain is only cats with these
(0:01:03) Aislinn: two kittens. The two kitties. I did I did talk about them. I
(0:01:04) Codey: kittens. Have you talked about them? Okay, good.
(0:01:11) Aislinn: think I mentioned I think yeah, at the time when I record last
(0:01:17) Aislinn: recorded with Kevin in for wonder stop. It was pre Yeah, I
(0:01:18) Codey: Mm hm.
(0:01:23) Aislinn: was pre kittens. We were in the process of like getting them.
(0:01:24) Codey: Mm hm.
(0:01:26) Codey: Mm hm.
(0:01:27) Aislinn: And now we have them.
(0:01:29) Aislinn: So if y'all hear any craziness in the background, that's them having the zoomies because they're
(0:01:34) Aislinn: five months old and don't know how to relax sometimes.
(0:01:43) Aislinn: But today we are talking about Bugaboo Pocket.
(0:01:47) Aislinn: It is not to go into it too much, but it is essentially like a bug collecting.
(0:01:48) Codey: Woo.
(0:01:59) Aislinn: And caring type of game.
(0:02:02) Codey: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(0:02:03) Aislinn: It reminds me of Tamagotchi, but bugs.
(0:02:08) Aislinn: And we won't go too much into it, but that's the general gist of it.
(0:02:12) Aislinn: But otherwise, what have you been up to?
(0:02:16) Codey: I am still doing a PhD and I'm so close. I did get the approval from my committee that I should be
(0:02:22) Aislinn: so close.
(0:02:29) Codey: good to defend in the fall as long as I continue to follow my timeline. I'm so close to being a
(0:02:31) Aislinn: Yes. Oh my gosh. Oh
(0:02:37) Codey: doctor. So weird.
(0:02:38) Aislinn: My god, you're already a doctor in my heart, honestly
(0:02:43) Aislinn: I'm out of time and effort and energy and everything you put in you're you're already there. It's just you just need the technicalities of
(0:02:50) Codey: that like paper that says that I am. Yeah, basically. So I'm
(0:02:52) Aislinn: Exactly
(0:02:57) Codey: doing a lot of specimens. But, which is really fun. It's
(0:03:01) Codey: basically like just pouring out vials of dead bugs, we call it
(0:03:04) Aislinn: Oh!
(0:03:04) Codey: bugs, bug soup. So pouring out bug soup, and then going through
(0:03:10) Codey: and identifying it. And I found something super rare the other
(0:03:13) Codey: day, and I lost my mind. So there's this entire order of
(0:03:18) Codey: in Sarcs called Strepsipterin.
(0:03:20) Codey: It's actually called Strepsipterin, which is the one that's in this area.
(0:03:25) Codey: And it's also called Strepsipterin, which is actually called Strepsipterin.
(0:03:28) Codey: And it's this one, which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin.
(0:03:32) Codey: And it's also called Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is this
(0:03:36) Codey: one called Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is this one called
(0:03:38) Aislinn: Oh.
(0:03:38) Codey: Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin,
(0:03:41) Codey: which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is
(0:03:41) Aislinn: Oh.
(0:03:45) Codey: this one called Strepsipterin, which is this one called Strepsipterin, which is this one
(0:03:48) Codey: and then like mates with
(0:03:50) Codey: her while she's in the wasp and then she has babies.
(0:03:54) Codey: And it's just, so the female never has wings, but the males
(0:03:57) Codey: have wings and they have like, I believe really short flight
(0:04:00) Codey: periods. And I caught three males. So like just in the
(0:04:03) Aislinn: Oh!
(0:04:05) Codey: middle of my bug soup, I was just like, Holy crap, it's a
(0:04:08) Codey: strep septarin. And then I was like, Oh my God, there's more.
(0:04:12) Codey: So it was really cool because the whole, like one of the
(0:04:15) Codey: points of my study is to see if there's one of the three traps
(0:04:19) Codey: that I'm testing if one is.
(0:04:20) Codey: Better than the other, and these are only caught in that one type of trap.
(0:04:21) Aislinn: Oh, so you're making progress.
(0:04:24) Codey: So that's like, yeah.
(0:04:28) Codey: So it's like, okay, we'll look at this cool thing that was never, ever caught
(0:04:32) Codey: in the other traps, but is all has been caught in, um, this new trap thing.
(0:04:37) Codey: So that was cool.
(0:04:39) Codey: But other than that, I've been playing, I'm still playing Fortnite with my roommate.
(0:04:43) Codey: Um, just like something to, we like play a game or two at a time to just like.
(0:04:50) Codey: Chill.
(0:04:51) Codey: Um, and then I started playing breath of the wild.
(0:04:57) Codey: I have never finished it.
(0:04:59) Codey: Um, and I barely got into the game, to be honest, like the last times that I've
(0:05:04) Codey: played it, so I'm playing it now and I'm playing it kind of with Jeff, um,
(0:05:10) Codey: because he lives with me now.
(0:05:12) Aislinn: Wow! (laughs)
(0:05:12) Codey: And so like I play it while we're both in the same room.
(0:05:16) Codey: He's usually playing like factorial or something.
(0:05:20) Codey: We like watch it and play it together.
(0:05:22) Codey: So it's, it's nice.
(0:05:24) Codey: And hopefully having like a second person who's interested in the story will
(0:05:27) Codey: like help me to actually finish it.
(0:05:31) Aislinn: I think I have that same exact relationship with Breath of the Wild like I started it and to be
(0:05:36) Aislinn: fair I don't have it anymore because it was part of I think I've I feel like I've told the story
(0:05:38) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:05:41) Aislinn: like a bunch of times so you may or may not have heard it the listeners probably haven't heard it
(0:05:45) Aislinn: but long story short my switch got stolen years ago along with a bunch of games Breath of the Wild
(0:05:50) Aislinn: being one of them so I currently don't own it anymore the idea of buying it I'm just like do
(0:05:57) Aislinn: I really need to because I never really got into it in the first place.
(0:06:01) Aislinn: For some reason, but like I am interested in it as a whole entire overview.
(0:06:07) Aislinn: I just never fully got into it, but I think maybe if Chris and I like sat down
(0:06:13) Aislinn: on the couch and try to like play it together, that might encourage me more.
(0:06:14) Codey: Yeah, that's so that's what I'm doing with Jeff is kind of just like dedicating that time to just sitting down and playing it together and it's really nice.
(0:06:26) Codey: And so, doing that and then the last thing that I'll mention is that oblivion remastered came out and I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan, but I resisted the temptation, because I need to finish Zelda first I think I need to just like stick with one thing.
(0:06:44) Aislinn: I can't believe the way they dropped it, it was just like a shadow drop, right?
(0:06:44) Codey: So I looked at oblivion and I was like, you'll be here wait for me wait for me.
(0:06:54) Codey: It was Yeah, like, I remember like Jeff was like, Oh, babe, they're really there. They just announced this thing and then like two days later, one of my best friends who I actually played the original oblivion with back when we were in high school, or middle
(0:07:12) Codey: maybe even he was like, Oh yeah, I'm playing this.
(0:07:14) Codey: And I was bringing up so many memories.
(0:07:17) Codey: And I was like, Oh my gosh.
(0:07:18) Codey: So yeah, it was like just a straight up shadow drop.
(0:07:22) Codey: Um, and it's fun to see all the memes people are, are saying.
(0:07:26) Codey: So, but I am going to wait.
(0:07:28) Aislinn: Yeah, that's, you know, that's a fair point.
(0:07:30) Codey: I've played it before I can, it can wait for me.
(0:07:34) Aislinn: Breath of the Wild is a new game, new experience, but it's like, I don't know, watching the
(0:07:40) Aislinn: trailer for Oblivion, I've never played anything in that world.
(0:07:42) Codey: - Ooh.
(0:07:45) Aislinn: But like looking at the trailer and seeing how excited Chris was, because Chris is also
(0:07:47) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:07:48) Aislinn: a huge Elder Scrolls fan.
(0:07:52) Aislinn: He was so badly wanted to drop everything to play it, but he's like, we have things
(0:07:56) Aislinn: we have to do.
(0:07:57) Codey: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean, the other thing is that like, it's on game pass. So if folks if they
(0:07:58) Aislinn: But it looks amazing, so like, I don't know how you resist the temptation because I would be tempted to play something that I know I'm going to really really enjoy.
(0:08:16) Codey: don't know, it's on game pass. And so that was like the biggest temptation is my friend told me
(0:08:22) Codey: that it was out. And I was like, Yeah, but I can't afford that. I can't even afford $20 game
(0:08:26) Codey: little one is 60.
(0:08:28) Codey: And then I got on my Xbox and I saw that it was on game pass and I was like, oh, oh, no, oh, no, no.
(0:08:34) Aislinn: Yeah. I think when I was streaming earlier this week, he's like, "Sara, I ended up starting to download it while you just started streaming."
(0:08:44) Aislinn: He's like, "Did you notice any drops?" I was like, "Oh, no, but okay."
(0:08:44) Codey: I can't remember if I downloaded it or not.
(0:08:49) Aislinn: So he's all set up ready to go.
(0:08:55) Codey: I downloaded Ori and the Blind Forest because I was about to start playing that, too.
(0:09:02) Codey: I was playing that on my Switch and then we switched to Jeff's Switch and Jeff's Xbox.
(0:09:09) Codey: I was playing it on my Xbox and now we're on Jeff's Xbox.
(0:09:13) Codey: So I was like, Oh, I need to download that again.
(0:09:14) Codey: Um, but that I was like, but I need to focus and I, if I'm going to focus on a game right
(0:09:21) Codey: now, I want it to be Zelda.
(0:09:22) Codey: So all of this to say, uh, mostly Zelda.
(0:09:28) Aislinn: I so I will admit that I have been so so so so I think I already said this on the
(0:09:29) Codey: What about you?
(0:09:30) Codey: What have you been up to?
(0:09:31) Codey: What do you mean?
(0:09:39) Aislinn: wanders top episode actually no I was in a different I was less busy pre it's
(0:09:45) Aislinn: like pre and post wanders top is a is like a milestone in my mo in my life at
(0:09:50) Aislinn: the moment for some reason like pre wanders top I was busy but once I finished
(0:09:54) Aislinn: wanders up something? Actually, you know what, what happened was the cats.
(0:09:58) Aislinn: The cats came into the picture, and in addition to working, taking care of what feels like
(0:10:05) Aislinn: five toddlers simultaneously, even though it's just two kittens, and wedding, actively
(0:10:08) Codey: Yeah.
(0:10:13) Aislinn: wedding planning. It's been like very, very busy. But with that said, with the time that
(0:10:19) Aislinn: I do have, I've been trying to play as much bugaboo pocket as possible, which I've unlocked
(0:10:24) Codey: Sweet.
(0:10:26) Aislinn: or b-
(0:10:28) Aislinn: I made good progress in the story I think, but um I've also been playing whenever I can
(0:10:28) Codey: Okay.
(0:10:30) Codey: Okay.
(0:10:40) Aislinn: Persona 3 reload still. I'm a little bit more than halfway through the game and I finally finally
(0:10:48) Aislinn: finally finally picked up Fields of Mistria and I want to dedicate my entire life to that game
(0:10:51) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah.
(0:10:56) Aislinn: but I'm like, I-
(0:10:58) Aislinn: I have to resist, I have to resist 'cause I'm like, I do like, same with like Oblivion remastered just coming out, I'm like, I want to finish Persona first, but I'm already really really enjoying Fields of Mistria, which is like, it's been good, everyone has been saying it's good, and like, yeah, no, it's good, so, um, that's primarily what I've been doing.
(0:11:20) Codey: hmm okay awesome well we will talk more about bugaboo pocket but first there's news
(0:11:23) Aislinn: Yes.
(0:11:28) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:11:30) Aislinn: So I actually kind of want to talk a little bit about this
(0:11:32) Aislinn: first one.
(0:11:34) Aislinn: I don't know how to pronounce it.
(0:11:36) Aislinn: Dolok town, Dolok town.
(0:11:37) Codey: that's that I thought dolok I think that's right
(0:11:40) Aislinn: Either way in my quest for finding something to give me
(0:11:46) Aislinn: more energy today because today I've just been very low energy
(0:11:50) Aislinn: for some reason.
(0:11:50) Aislinn: I think because it's like my first proper day off and I just
(0:11:52) Aislinn: don't know how to function and not be like I don't know how to
(0:11:56) Aislinn: not be busy right now.
(0:11:58) Aislinn: It's just like a blob.
(0:11:58) Aislinn: But in my quest to try and like give myself some energy, I
(0:12:02) Aislinn: actually downloaded the demo because looking at it for this
(0:12:06) Codey: OK.
(0:12:06) Aislinn: podcast already caught my interest very quickly.
(0:12:10) Aislinn: And it's really cool so far.
(0:12:12) Aislinn: But early access is coming soon.
(0:12:16) Aislinn: There's just a demo.
(0:12:18) Aislinn: So if you didn't know, there is a demo, the demo.
(0:12:20) Aislinn: I didn't play much of the demo, but the demo already is like
(0:12:22) Aislinn: pretty cool.
(0:12:24) Aislinn: Um, but it is a
(0:12:28) Aislinn: farming sim in a way, but it's a side scroller, which feels
(0:12:33) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:12:34) Aislinn: very different from what I'm used to at least, it's someone
(0:12:37) Aislinn: that is very selective about farming games. And there's,
(0:12:42) Aislinn: yeah, there's crafting, there's cooking, fishing, farming, of
(0:12:47) Aislinn: course. And it looked like there was also like some actual like
(0:12:51) Aislinn: platform like platforming that is happening in some capacity.
(0:12:56) Aislinn: so it really caught my interest.
(0:12:58) Aislinn: I don't know if you know much about the game as well.
(0:13:02) Codey: I, I just looked at the what was on there so the quote that they had for the early access
(0:13:11) Codey: is immerse yourself in a rich farming experience with harvesting building crafting cooking
(0:13:15) Codey: fishing and more brave extreme weather and make it yours, no idea what that means explore
(0:13:22) Aislinn: I don't know what that means either.
(0:13:23) Codey: the vast wasteland and uncover the secrets beneath discover the the charm of Dolok town
(0:13:29) Codey: in the story of its people, a customizable drone.
(0:13:32) Codey: a companion designed to safeguard you and the wilderness. I'm assuming that means that there is one.
(0:13:46) Aislinn: Yeah, I think that's why I am definitely partial towards anime-esque.
(0:13:54) Aislinn: When you're actually in the game, it's less more so, it's definitely more leaning on the
(0:13:57) Codey: - Yeah.
(0:13:59) Aislinn: pixel aesthetic, but like the art for the game, yeah, has that anime aesthetic.
(0:14:04) Aislinn: But it's nice, like I could definitely see where they're trying to go with it charm-wise
(0:14:10) Aislinn: for the game.
(0:14:11) Codey: Mm-hmm this guy
(0:14:12) Aislinn: And like right off the gate, there's already some very interesting dialogue just in the
(0:14:16) Aislinn: background.
(0:14:18) Aislinn: So it seems like, or it says also over the past few months, the team has been working
(0:14:23) Aislinn: hard to refine the game and get it ready for its initial release.
(0:14:27) Aislinn: And we're thrilled to see that it's only two weeks away.
(0:14:30) Codey: Woo! So yeah, that's the big news, is that the Early Access is coming on May 8th.
(0:14:31) Aislinn: So yay!
(0:14:36) Aislinn: And also, just because I thought this was really cool, if you join the Discord, you
(0:14:40) Codey: Mm-hmm, oh, like a downloadable version?
(0:14:41) Aislinn: get the OST on launch, which normally you have to pay for that on Steam.
(0:14:46) Aislinn: So, I don't know exactly, because I don't talk about how exactly what that process is,
(0:14:53) Aislinn: but yeah, you can get the OST for free, it seems like, if you just join the Discord.
(0:14:59) Codey: Wow, have you how's the music?
(0:15:01) Aislinn: So that's pretty cool.
(0:15:03) Aislinn: So far, I already really like it.
(0:15:04) Codey: Okay
(0:15:06) Aislinn: It fits the aesthetic of the game really well.
(0:15:08) Codey: Nice
(0:15:10) Codey: Yeah, cool and the that early access is gonna have 20 hours of gameplay which is nuts for an early access
(0:15:16) Aislinn: Yeah, that's that's really good.
(0:15:18) Codey: And that that's only like part of the story
(0:15:22) Codey: crazy
(0:15:23) Codey: So cool. Well, we will continue to check in with you about Dolan
(0:15:29) Codey: You downloaded the demo
(0:15:33) Codey: I am the Disney Dreamlight Valley correspondent and here that is
(0:15:37) Aislinn: Yes.
(0:15:40) Codey: the next
(0:15:43) Codey: Sorry, I just was getting a phone call and it cut off my recording so al I'm sorry, there's two recordings
(0:15:51) Codey: Disney Disney Dreamlight Valley has a new update. So they have the Wonderland whimsy update which adds an Alice in Wonderland realm
(0:15:59) Codey: Alice and the Cheshire cat as characters
(0:16:02) Aislinn: I for some reason I thought there were already characters, but I am I still have yet to play this game
(0:16:02) Codey: so
(0:16:07) Aislinn: I think like you told me like when we first recorded way back when to play Disney Dreamlight Valley, and I still have not
(0:16:07) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:16:12) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:16:15) Codey: Yeah, it's a lot it's a lot and there is a poll like I feel the pull to it since
(0:16:16) Aislinn: This is a backlog
(0:16:22) Codey: Again switched to Jeff's Xbox. He has a Xbox series s so it's like a really better one
(0:16:29) Codey: And it does not when I played it
(0:16:32) Codey: Disney Dreamlight Valley does not have lag on his the way that it did on my Xbox one
(0:16:39) Codey: So I I feel the pull for sure
(0:16:42) Codey: I don't know. I'll have to look at the
(0:16:46) Codey: Because usually with these patches they also have like a small
(0:16:53) Codey: Gosh, what are they called?
(0:16:56) Codey: I'm trying to oh my gosh. Sorry. I was just
(0:16:59) Codey: looking at this. Oh, uh, oh, uh, does not include seasonal star path. Oh, that's something else.
(0:17:05) Codey: I'm wondering if they have a star path. Oh yeah, the regard garden of whimsy star path. So the star
(0:17:10) Codey: paths are like usually those are time limited. Um, and you can get some really neat items. So maybe
(0:17:15) Codey: I'll jump on this game here, uh, like to later today and see if there's any good items, um,
(0:17:21) Codey: for the star path and see if I'm really like tempted to get anything. Um,
(0:17:29) Codey: I don't know. Did you ever see like the old Alice game? That was like super creepy.
(0:17:36) Aislinn: I have like the vague, for whatever reason the way that you phrased it just gave me like the vaguest recollection of it.
(0:17:42) Codey: Um hmm. Yeah. So whenever I think of Alice in Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat, I think of
(0:17:44) Aislinn: Let me see if I look at- Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
(0:17:51) Codey: that one because the round little cuddly Cheshire Cat that's in, or I think of the one in the
(0:17:57) Codey: Johnny Depp films, because when I think of like, when I see this Cheshire Cat, like the
(0:18:01) Codey: original Alice in Wonderland Cheshire Cat, I'm like, this looks goofy versus like the
(0:18:07) Codey: original horror Alice games, uh, and kind of also the one.
(0:18:12) Codey: In the live action is like creepy. Um, and I prefer the Cheshire Cat being creepy. So, uh,
(0:18:21) Codey: yeah, so I will look at, look at it and see if there's anything cool in the star path. Um,
(0:18:27) Codey: later today. The other thing, the thing I was laughing about is, uh,
(0:18:31) Codey: uncrafting. So there's now an, there's now an uncrafting station, which I love it. Uh, so you can
(0:18:34) Aislinn: on crafting.
(0:18:42) Codey: uncraft non-quest crafted items and recycle the materials. Yeah. There are times like when the
(0:18:47) Aislinn: Oh, that's so good.
(0:18:51) Codey: characters like at the end of the quest. So I'm assuming I'm hoping it means like if they are no
(0:18:56) Codey: longer needed in the quest, because they'll be like, Oh, build me this beautiful gondola,
(0:19:03) Codey: like saying that I can, then we can get married under or something. And then you build this huge
(0:19:09) Codey: thing and then after the the action of it they're like
(0:19:12) Codey: okay here is the here have this and I'm like I don't want this like I don't
(0:19:20) Codey: actually want this yeah so yeah so you can now do that which is hilarious they
(0:19:21) Aislinn: Give me my materials back.
(0:19:32) Codey: also have upgradable chests which is amazing so instead of having if you have
(0:19:39) Codey: small chest and then you don't you want to get a large chest you
(0:19:42) Codey: have to like build the large chest and then set it next to the small chest and
(0:19:47) Codey: then like scooch everything over and it's just pain in the butt now you can
(0:19:50) Codey: just like upgrade the smaller chests instead which is awesome there's more
(0:19:57) Codey: alignment in the sub grid you can make your house bigger just like some basic
(0:20:03) Codey: things and then other changes and bug fixes so I'm excited looks cool
(0:20:10) Aislinn: I just, the idea, I don't know why the idea of being able to uncraft something has never
(0:20:17) Aislinn: crossed my mind, but now that that idea has been implanted into my brain, now I'm like
(0:20:23) Aislinn: why do more games not have this, because this is really cool and I really like that and
(0:20:28) Aislinn: that would be very nice.
(0:20:29) Codey: Yeah
(0:20:30) Codey: To be able to like I mean there are some games that can do that
(0:20:34) Codey: I know that I want to say minecraft has one where like a table that you can go take your stuff to and then it'll
(0:20:39) Codey: Like give you the components or something
(0:20:41) Aislinn: very cool indeed and I guess with that said do you have anything else that you
(0:20:42) Codey: Yeah, it's not super common so cool
(0:20:48) Codey: Yeah
(0:20:51) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:20:52) Aislinn: want to touch on with disney dreamlight valley
(0:20:54) Codey: No, I was gonna move on let's move on
(0:20:56) Aislinn: okay I guess I so I do you know anything about the roots of pacha
(0:21:00) Codey: I played roots of Pacha
(0:21:02) Aislinn: - Okay. (laughs)
(0:21:03) Codey: Or Pacha. I think I say Pacha
(0:21:06) Codey: It is a super cool like it's basically caveman stardew or prehistoric stardew
(0:21:12) Codey: I think is what we used to say so they have a 1.3 update that is out now and it adds two new regions
(0:21:18) Codey: so those regions are the
(0:21:20) Codey: Mograni mountains and
(0:21:23) Codey: the
(0:21:25) Codey: to do scroll scroll scroll yaku on islands
(0:21:29) Codey: um so I think it just like adds on to what is already in the game like
(0:21:34) Codey: different areas that you can just now go to that you previously couldn't go to
(0:21:39) Codey: each area has a decent amount of new characters um but overall there's 21 new characters uh and two
(0:21:48) Codey: of them are romanceable and I just always want to shout out that one of the characters who's
(0:21:54) Codey: romanceable, the mountain guy is older. So he's got like
(0:21:59) Codey: white hair, like gray hair. And I am just as I get into my
(0:22:03) Codey: elder years, I am just always so happy. You see that that
(0:22:12) Codey: they're, they're letting us old people. Old people mean love
(0:22:15) Aislinn: No, I agree, I do, I, like, I saw that note and I was like, "That's really, really awesome."
(0:22:18) Codey: too. Yeah, so that was cool. There's also new animals. They've
(0:22:28) Codey: We've got like a prehistory.
(0:22:29) Codey: For a giraffe thing, they've got something that was a precursor to the modern sheep.
(0:22:37) Codey: They got a dodo bird because of course, like why wasn't that in the game already?
(0:22:42) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:22:45) Codey: And then they also added modern animals.
(0:22:47) Codey: So I don't, I can't remember if it's like something that you can, like one of the ideas
(0:22:52) Codey: that you can add on that someone like thinks of like modernizing the animals or whatever,
(0:22:57) Codey: but you end up
(0:22:59) Codey: like with what you would think are the modern animals from it which is really cool.
(0:23:04) Aislinn: Oh, so they're not like actually modern animals, they're just what could be modern animals,
(0:23:10) Codey: So it's I think you basically like take the animal from before or the animal that's in the
(0:23:10) Aislinn: like reimagined?
(0:23:18) Codey: game already and I think you just like do some weird genetic stuff with it or something like
(0:23:23) Codey: that and then it's suddenly the the modern version. So yeah.
(0:23:29) Codey: That is cool. There's new clothing, decoration, seeds. They also added modern seeds. So I think
(0:23:37) Codey: similarly you can update the ones that you have to be like the legit modern seeds instead
(0:23:43) Codey: of working with like prehistoric versions. One of the mini games is a music game. So for people
(0:23:51) Codey: like Al who I know likes those like rhythm games, there's one of those where you use the up and down
(0:23:56) Aislinn: Yeah, I was looking at that too. It's cool. I like that. I also like a good rhythm game
(0:23:58) Codey: arrows kind of like
(0:23:59) Codey: I mean, it looks like basically guitar here, but
(0:24:02) Codey: using, yeah, I was a little, I was, I was interested.
(0:24:11) Aislinn: or music game. So like my I will revisit on a regular basis Project Diva, which is the
(0:24:17) Aislinn: Vocaloid music game. So like, I'm all over rhythm games. So any any inclusion of that
(0:24:23) Aislinn: I am so on it.
(0:24:25) Codey: Um, and then the final thing was that there is now bug catching with an asterisk.
(0:24:32) Aislinn: Whoa. Oh.
(0:24:35) Codey: So it's not, it's not like what you'd think it's that there's like a couple new places
(0:24:42) Codey: that you can go to.
(0:24:43) Codey: And then you basically like play an instrument and it like calls the bugs to you.
(0:24:49) Codey: And then you can catch them from there.
(0:24:51) Codey: It's just, it's not, it's not what you'd expect.
(0:24:55) Codey: Which I like that they're doing new things.
(0:24:57) Codey: They also have, they had a new way to like tame animals and a new way to fish and all of that.
(0:25:02) Codey: Super love the way that they've been doing, innovating in that regard.
(0:25:07) Codey: But, you know, I want to be able to just go catch bugs the way that I, the way that I do.
(0:25:12) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:25:16) Codey: On my hike today, there were a couple of people that came up because I was like flipping logs
(0:25:20) Codey: and they were like, what are you doing? What you looking for? And I was like, I mean,
(0:25:22) Aislinn: Ah ha.
(0:25:25) Codey: anything. I just want to see cool, cool bugs or salamanders or something.
(0:25:28) Aislinn: Just anything.
(0:25:30) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:25:33) Codey: It's a little early for that. But yeah, that's basically, I just want to be able to like find
(0:25:36) Codey: cool bugs. And that's, that's that update. So that update is out now. If you already own the game,
(0:25:36) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:25:38) Aislinn: Well.
(0:25:44) Codey: then you just get it. And if you do not own the game, maybe having a little bit more story and
(0:25:51) Codey: bug catching and the rhythm game, uh, push you, uh,
(0:25:55) Codey: to do it. Maybe that's something that's of interest.
(0:25:58) Aislinn: Yeah, that all sounds good to me. Will I play it? I don't know. Again, only so many farming
(0:26:06) Aislinn: games I can do. But I like the romanceable older person. That is like one thing that's
(0:26:08) Codey: - Yeah, I.
(0:26:14) Aislinn: like a game changer for me. I do like that a lot.
(0:26:16) Codey: Yeah, I have it on Windows.
(0:26:20) Codey: So if we end up moving my desktop up to my office,
(0:26:24) Codey: which is like a blessing and a curse
(0:26:27) Codey: because I want this to remain my work office,
(0:26:28) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:26:30) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:26:31) Codey: but also like I am not playing my desktop downstairs.
(0:26:34) Aislinn: Yeah? [laughs]
(0:26:34) Codey: But yeah, I might, I might bring that up and load this game back up and see, see how that
(0:26:44) Codey: older guy is. I like his personality or not.
(0:26:45) Aislinn: yeah hopefully he's got good personality I guess with that well not really with
(0:26:55) Aislinn: that said it's not really very good transition but another game that I
(0:27:00) Aislinn: unfortunately don't know much about over magica do you are you familiar oh
(0:27:03) Codey: Okay.
(0:27:08) Codey: Yeah, yeah, so OvaMagica is the like farming adventure,
(0:27:08) Aislinn: perfect wonderful
(0:27:15) Codey: whatever creature collector game where all of the creatures
(0:27:16) Aislinn: Mmhmm.
(0:27:17) Codey: are like these little round boys.
(0:27:19) Aislinn: Yeah!
(0:27:20) Codey: And so there's like, and they just kind of like blob
(0:27:23) Codey: around behind you, just super cute.
(0:27:26) Codey: They have released the 0.9 update that adds some new areas,
(0:27:31) Codey: new friendship events with the characters.
(0:27:35) Codey: And there's also a new thing, I can't remember what it's
(0:27:38) Codey: called, like Ovotron or something, but it's something
(0:27:40) Codey: that allows you to X-ray into a egg before it hatches
(0:27:46) Codey: to be able to see what is in the egg, which is super nice.
(0:27:51) Codey: Like say that you're trying to breed for something,
(0:27:55) Codey: you'd be able to see kind of like.
(0:27:56) Codey: Like expect what is in that egg.
(0:27:59) Codey: Um, which is cool.
(0:28:03) Codey: And so that zero of one ninth update is out now.
(0:28:07) Codey: Um, and the, they also said in this that the 1.0 is coming this year.
(0:28:12) Aislinn: Hmm. Oh no. Yeah. I feel like I've been seeing it like even though I don't know much about
(0:28:13) Codey: I cannot remember how many years that has been a promise.
(0:28:20) Codey: But I feel like it's been some, it could have just been one.
(0:28:23) Codey: They could have just been yet last year.
(0:28:24) Codey: I don't know, but I feel like this is a game we've been talking
(0:28:26) Codey: for a hot minute, so.
(0:28:31) Aislinn: it, I feel like I've somehow been like stumbling across it like pretty regularly. Um, so hopefully,
(0:28:34) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(0:28:38) Aislinn: - Hopefully, hopefully.
(0:28:39) Codey: No, Ms. Chloe.
(0:28:41) Codey: Yeah.
(0:28:42) Aislinn: - Hopefully, it's coming, 1.0, this year.
(0:28:45) Aislinn: I mean, there's a lot of this year left,
(0:28:47) Aislinn: so fingers crossed, and it looks like it's mostly,
(0:28:50) Aislinn: if not already, just about fully fleshed out game-wise, so.
(0:28:54) Codey: Yeah, they don't have too too much to add to it. So we'll see where it where it goes
(0:29:02) Aislinn: can I just say I love the cow blob in the in like the main photo
(0:29:04) Codey: Yeah
(0:29:07) Codey: They're
(0:29:08) Codey: They're all cute. I love the cow blob. I love the fox blob. The bee blob is cute. Like they I have not seen a blob
(0:29:13) Aislinn: oh
(0:29:16) Codey: I didn't love so
(0:29:18) Aislinn: I like the turtle one too they're all so cute
(0:29:19) Codey: Yeah, they're they're all very cute
(0:29:23) Aislinn: and shout out to motion sickness settings because that's a that's a
(0:29:26) Aislinn: that's a big one for me for a lot of games so anything with that that's nice
(0:29:28) Codey: - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, well, are we three for three?
(0:29:34) Codey: Have you heard of a game called GoGo Town?
(0:29:36) Aislinn: I know of, literally I only know of Gogotown because of this podcast.
(0:29:42) Codey: Okay, cool, we'll take it away.
(0:29:46) Aislinn: A lot of my new game knowledge comes from this podcast, I will not lie.
(0:29:55) Aislinn: But it looks like that online co-op is coming soon for Gogotown
(0:30:04) Aislinn: and looking at the video earlier that they took.
(0:30:06) Aislinn: It looks pretty good. It says that they still have some bugs, but they are working on it, and it's coming very soon.
(0:30:15) Aislinn: And also they do make a note that there will be no split screen for online co-op, just as a general note.
(0:30:24) Aislinn: There isn't much more of an update with that, but they did give a sneak peek. It looks cool.
(0:30:35) Codey: I don't know if we'd seen a video of it before, so that was nice to see.
(0:30:36) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:30:40) Codey: And I know people are always interested in like whether or not the co-op is split screen.
(0:30:44) Codey: So though I feel like this split screen is so 2000s.
(0:30:51) Codey: So I feel like it's just not like Jeff was Jeff and I were talking about possibly playing Halo.
(0:31:00) Codey: And I was like, we'd have to split screen.
(0:31:02) Aislinn: yeah it's so it is so old now that you like just reminding me the halo i'm just like oh yeah that
(0:31:08) Aislinn: is like an old thing
(0:31:09) Codey: Yeah, like I don't want to do that ugh
(0:31:13) Codey: gross, so
(0:31:15) Codey: Yeah
(0:31:17) Codey: They're not gonna have that which is a good thing. But also if you only have one copy of the game that
(0:31:22) Aislinn: Yeah, but I guess like general speaking, most people have their own version of the game in some
(0:31:27) Aislinn: capacity. So it's nice that you don't have to worry about split screen and everyone has their own
(0:31:32) Aislinn: screen and you can still do cool. But I think that's not really all we got on Go Go Town that
(0:31:32) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yup, yup, yup.
(0:31:39) Aislinn: that blurb from Steam isn't doesn't have too much beyond that. So I guess with that said,
(0:31:46) Aislinn: we move into Story of Seasons Grand Bazaar. And Cody and I before
(0:31:52) Aislinn: we even started recording, we're both just like, do you know what's going on? And I'm like, no,
(0:31:57) Aislinn: do you know what's going on? We're both just like, not really. So I will read whatever I can,
(0:32:04) Codey: uh-huh
(0:32:04) Aislinn: and then take that as you will. But it looks like 100 crops. So if you really want to be
(0:32:08) Codey: Yeah, I
(0:32:13) Aislinn: farming? Oh boy, you have a lot of options.
(0:32:16) Codey: Yeah, so this next bit like Al wrote it out and I, I think I read this like 10 times, and there's something about these words that I just like my brain just, they just bounce off my brain, I have a smooth brain when it comes to these words, I don't understand why.
(0:32:37) Codey: And they're not even hard words. So it just says, this is from Al, it has some stamina system that works differently than normal.
(0:32:46) Codey: But was in the original game, you can do more if you jump when doing an action, which is weird, but it costs more stamina, one per usage, six per jump usage, but you'll get three actions.
(0:33:03) Codey: So you're using up more stamina to save time, but you can still upgrade the tools as well.
(0:33:11) Aislinn: See, like, I'm picking up what he's putting down, Al, but to be fair, I've never played
(0:33:16) Codey: Yeah, Chloe.
(0:33:21) Aislinn: Story of Seasons before, so that is probably a big limiting factor for me.
(0:33:27) Aislinn: But if you've played Story of Seasons before, this might be appealing to you.
(0:33:32) Aislinn: And from my knowledge about farming games in general, being able to use, even if it
(0:33:40) Aislinn: sacrifices more salmon.
(0:33:41) Aislinn: I just want to say that I'm going to be jumping, like, in farming, like, what am I doing? Am I, like, planting and jumping? Like, I don't know. Am I jumping across my farm to water all of my 100 crops that I have?
(0:33:44) Codey: Okay, but like the logic of it, well, and like if you, so you jump, and it's more stamina because
(0:34:04) Codey: you're jumping, and that's like, that's very intensive, right? But what, but when you jump,
(0:34:08) Aislinn: I guess, I mean, that's what it looks like too, in the screenshot that I'm looking at
(0:34:10) Codey: you're just able to be more efficient.
(0:34:14) Codey: Yeah.
(0:34:18) Aislinn: on the website.
(0:34:20) Aislinn: There's just a character that's like doing like a skip type of jump type of motion.
(0:34:25) Aislinn: So are you like, I think it's you're skipping as you're farming and you're getting more
(0:34:29) Aislinn: done, but you're wearing yourself out because you're skipping.
(0:34:32) Aislinn: I mean, skipping is more work, like more body intensive than walking.
(0:34:36) Codey: Yeah. You're right, you're right. I don't know. I, that's how I felt when I read it.
(0:34:36) Aislinn: So, you know, it--
(0:34:38) Aislinn: this is such a silly conversation.
(0:34:46) Codey: I was like, I, and then this website is like fogu.com and I, this website, I was very,
(0:34:53) Codey: I was confused. And I, it is not Al. It is not, it is probably just me. I don't know
(0:34:57) Aislinn: No, yeah, well me too, because I'm also...
(0:35:03) Codey: of like my ADHD or whatever.
(0:35:06) Codey: It was just like, nope, but it was wild.
(0:35:11) Codey: So that's that, uh, I'm sure story of seasons.
(0:35:14) Codey: People are probably like, Oh, sick.
(0:35:16) Aislinn: But I have no idea, yes, options.
(0:35:16) Codey: Like that's going to be so awesome.
(0:35:20) Codey: I'm like, I'm happy for you guys.
(0:35:22) Codey: A hundred crops.
(0:35:23) Codey: I understand that.
(0:35:25) Codey: Uh, he also wrote more than any other story of season game.
(0:35:28) Codey: So more crop number go bur.
(0:35:34) Aislinn: And it looks like it comes out in, this is probably almost definitely announced at some
(0:35:40) Aislinn: point, but looking at the website, it's coming out August 27th in the states, in North America.
(0:35:46) Aislinn: Um, it is, no, it's already, it's there, it's all coming out at the same time.
(0:35:46) Codey: I think it's already out in Japan
(0:35:54) Codey: Oh.
(0:35:54) Aislinn: So August 27th slash August 28 in Japan, cause of, you know, time zone things and whatnot.
(0:35:59) Codey: Okay, cool.
(0:36:01) Aislinn: But yeah, we, we've, we, we tried our best.
(0:36:05) Aislinn: So I, I apologize to all the Storia season fans, it's the best you're going to get, but
(0:36:05) Codey: Sorry, Al.
(0:36:12) Aislinn: I can talk about Stardew Valley.
(0:36:14) Codey: Heck yeah, we can.
(0:36:16) Aislinn: I tried to get tickets for the Toronto one, and it was just a miserable failure, so I'm happy that they added more dates.
(0:36:20) Codey: Okay.
(0:36:27) Codey: Yay.
(0:36:32) Aislinn: We have not followed up on if we can get tickets for any of the other Toronto ones, or even just somewhere else in Canada, I guess, need be, or in the States or something.
(0:36:40) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:36:44) Aislinn: but I
(0:36:46) Aislinn: Am happy that they added more dates because trying to get tickets for those has been a wreck
(0:36:50) Codey: Yeah, and they added a bunch of dates. So like when I looked at the at the dates like the tour dates just in general
(0:36:58) Codey: There are many
(0:37:01) Codey: and then all the green ones on the
(0:37:05) Codey: The poster are like the new ones, but there's just they they better like
(0:37:12) Codey: Playing that music because my goodness
(0:37:15) Aislinn: it's a lot I i imagine is it all one is it all one what's the orchestra I was like what's the
(0:37:16) Codey: They are gonna be playing it
(0:37:20) Codey: I
(0:37:23) Codey: Orchestra, I'm I'm assuming like I don't think that I wouldn't think that there'd be like an orchestra at each location
(0:37:30) Codey: That's like I would think that it's like the one
(0:37:34) Codey: Orchestra, that's just kind of like moving around
(0:37:36) Aislinn: Right, I'm just like this is
(0:37:37) Codey: Which is probably super cool for people to travel like able to go places, but also this is a lot
(0:37:41) Aislinn: Yeah
(0:37:45) Aislinn: It is a lot like just looking at the dates in general
(0:37:48) Aislinn: It's like a lot of these dates are like back to back or like same day because of matinee
(0:37:52) Codey: Mhmm. But then they'll be followed by like, they'll be followed by like, uh, like a, like
(0:38:00) Codey: a week off or something. So it's, it's, it's cool, but lots. Yeah. Yeah. So if you have
(0:38:02) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:38:05) Aislinn: It's not like they're being overworked to an extent, but yeah.
(0:38:09) Codey: been wanting tickets and it has been sold out in your area, uh, definitely look, there
(0:38:14) Codey: are new dates in US, Canada, and Asia. Um, so new dates, new shows.
(0:38:23) Codey: That were already in the some areas, whole new areas too. Um, so yeah, take a look.
(0:38:25) Aislinn: Mhm. Yeah. Very, very cool. It's awesome that they were able to
(0:38:33) Aislinn: pull this off. Yeah, I guess that is all the news that we have,
(0:38:39) Aislinn: right? Yeah. Woo hoo. So I guess with that said, we can move
(0:38:40) Codey: A-woo!
(0:38:47) Aislinn: into Bugaboo Pockets, which I am so excited to talk about.
(0:38:50) Codey: Yeah
(0:38:53) Codey: Yeah, so let's first talk about what how we played it and how far we are
(0:39:00) Codey: so I played it on Mac and I was only able to get the demo and
(0:39:07) Codey: So I played what's on the demo, which is not a lot. I'll get into that later
(0:39:13) Codey: So I don't have a time. I have like literally like a half an hour
(0:39:20) Codey: When payday hits I might be pulling the trigger for this one for sure
(0:39:26) Aislinn: - Well, I guess we can get your take after you hear my takes.
(0:39:32) Codey: - Mm-hmm, so what have you played?
(0:39:33) Aislinn: Since I did buy the game,
(0:39:36) Aislinn: I have played it on PC primarily,
(0:39:42) Aislinn: which is why I've kind of barely played it
(0:39:44) Aislinn: because I haven't really been home so much too much
(0:39:46) Aislinn: because of work,
(0:39:47) Aislinn: but I did try to play it on my Steam Deck
(0:39:50) Aislinn: and it's technically Steam Deck compatible,
(0:39:54) Aislinn: But... eww.
(0:39:58) Aislinn: I don't think... I don't like it on a Steam Deck because it's... you could tell it's a game that's made for like a mouse.
(0:40:10) Aislinn: So like, I'm just running my finger along the Steam Deck screen pretty much, or like along the trackpad.
(0:40:16) Aislinn: And I just... if I hooked up a mouse, that'd probably be better.
(0:40:20) Aislinn: But like, if you're playing it just Steam Deck only, nothing else connected to it or anything.
(0:40:26) Aislinn: I didn't like it personally, but on PC it's great.
(0:40:32) Aislinn: And I have... so there are seven bugs total that you could unlock, and I have unlocked four?
(0:40:42) Codey: Nice.
(0:40:42) Aislinn: Let me double check. Let me go back.
(0:40:44) Aislinn: I have the game open in front of me just because of this reason.
(0:40:47) Codey: Yeah.
(0:40:48) Aislinn: But yeah, so I have the full thing. So I have one, two... no, one, two...
(0:40:52) Codey: The full game, yeah.
(0:40:56) Aislinn: three, four. Yeah, I have four. Four out of the seven bugs.
(0:41:00) Codey: Okay. Cool. Um, so yeah, it's basically like, to me, it feels
(0:41:08) Codey: like bug Tamagotchi. Um, but yeah, but with like a plus, like
(0:41:10) Aislinn: Mm hmm. I agree. I agree. Even the UI.
(0:41:15) Codey: there's some extra. So what they say on switch is quote, a
(0:41:19) Codey: relaxing semi idle pet game starring bugs from land, air and
(0:41:24) Codey: sea players play as a research scientist living in a cabin with
(0:41:28) Codey: It's just your bugs and a pen pal.
(0:41:30) Codey: It's not released yet, I don't think, based on the website, but it is in the cards.
(0:41:54) Aislinn: I don't know, I really hope that they like make this more, you know, controller friendly.
(0:42:04) Codey: - Yeah, well, maybe when they make it controller friendly
(0:42:07) Codey: for that, they'll have some ideas of how to make it
(0:42:10) Codey: more controller friendly for the Steam Deck too.
(0:42:14) Aislinn: - Yeah, we'll see, we'll definitely see.
(0:42:19) Codey: So it's just $20 for the base game,
(0:42:21) Codey: or there is a bundle on Steam right now
(0:42:24) Codey: called the Celebrate Bugs Bundle.
(0:42:27) Codey: And that bundle has webbed, which we have not talked about,
(0:42:32) Codey: but it's basically, it seems like it's a platform
(0:42:35) Codey: and you're a jumping spider, which is super cute.
(0:42:39) Codey: So there's that, there's Apico, there's Buggin's,
(0:42:42) Codey: oh my God, sorry, there's Buggin's Seek
(0:42:44) Codey: and this game Bugaboo Pocket, and they're all for $38.22,
(0:42:49) Codey: which is a steal given the fact that I think this game
(0:42:53) Codey: and Apico are $40 on their own.
(0:42:58) Aislinn: Yeah. And I think webbed has been, I realized webbed has been on my wishlist for a hot minute
(0:42:59) Codey: So it is like a really good price.
(0:43:09) Aislinn: because it looks so incredibly adorable. And then I've played AP, APico. Is that how it's
(0:43:14) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah, so it's a pico. Yeah.
(0:43:14) Aislinn: actually pronounced? Because I've been saying APico and I'm like, I never thought that was
(0:43:18) Aislinn: right. But I've played APico and there's so much to do in that game.
(0:43:28) Aislinn: The price of Bugaboo Pocket, yeah, for that bundle is really good.
(0:43:34) Codey: Yeah, um, so yeah, I also really just want to shout out that their
(0:43:39) Codey: developer and publisher, it's the same, same group are called Elytra games.
(0:43:45) Codey: Love it.
(0:43:45) Codey: 10 out of 10, um, Elytra for people who don't know are so Elytra are on
(0:43:50) Aislinn: I was gonna be like me, I don't get it.
(0:43:55) Codey: Beatles instead of having four wings.
(0:43:58) Codey: The front pair of wings have been like, are like kind of replaced by this
(0:44:03) Codey: modified.
(0:44:04) Codey: I think it's a really important shell thing. If you imagine a ladybug, and it has those two pieces of shell, and then those kind of move to the side, and then there's wings underneath of it, those things are called elytra.
(0:44:19) Codey: Yeah, so it's a bug thing.
(0:44:19) Aislinn: Oh, that's so cool to know the name of that all sick. Oh my god. Okay, so
(0:44:26) Codey: There are, there's also elytra in Minecraft, there are basically just, it's like a
(0:44:34) Codey: thing on your back that you wear that gives you the ability to like, not do powered flight, but you can like fall more gracefully.
(0:44:45) Codey: Like you basically can glide. So, really loved that.
(0:44:47) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:44:48) Aislinn: Oh, that's so cool.
(0:44:49) Aislinn: So more bug games moving forward from Elytra, hopefully.
(0:44:55) Codey: I would hope so, yeah. Give me a call if you guys want some free, but it seems like they already know what they're talking about so
(0:45:04) Codey: they probably don't need a consultant or whatever, but they do hit me up. I will, I will do it for free.
(0:45:08) Aislinn: But hey, you know if they do you know who to call
(0:45:16) Aislinn: You got a doctor on deck
(0:45:20) Codey: So they say that it's great for people who don't love bugs yet, or for validating people who already do.
(0:45:29) Codey: - What category were you in, Ace?
(0:45:32) Aislinn: I love bugs, so I'm having a great time with this game.
(0:45:36) Aislinn: I don't know if I can agree with the great for people who don't love bugs.
(0:45:39) Aislinn: I know there are some options within the game to like, so you can at least like reveal the
(0:45:43) Aislinn: species before it hatches or anything so you know what you're getting into.
(0:45:46) Codey: Mm hmm. I mean, I thought so there the species that you first start out with, or at least in
(0:45:47) Aislinn: But like, I think it's really cute.
(0:45:49) Aislinn: But I don't know for certain if like, you don't like, for example, worms?
(0:46:00) Codey: the demo was the rubber ducky ice pod. And I think that that's great. Like, it's super cute.
(0:46:06) Codey: And they look like rubber duckies when they're adults, and it's just so cute. So I thought that
(0:46:12) Codey: might be something that would be good for people who might not super be
(0:46:16) Codey: into bugs.
(0:46:18) Aislinn: I think just because one of the species like does start off basically looking like kind
(0:46:22) Aislinn: of like a wax worm and I know for some people that freaks them out so I don't know how people
(0:46:25) Codey: - Yeah, that's fair.
(0:46:28) Aislinn: feel about that so like take that as you will but like if you are okay with at least looking
(0:46:33) Aislinn: at bugs I think this game is still cute like they do a really good job of making the bugs
(0:46:37) Aislinn: like extra cute so if you like are okay with bugs and you like bugs great game if you hate
(0:46:43) Aislinn: bugs? I'm not sure. Hard to say.
(0:46:44) Codey: Okay.
(0:46:46) Codey: Um, and then I just love the story.
(0:46:48) Aislinn: But I do agree with you with the isopods.
(0:46:54) Codey: So if they say you play as a research scientist helping a forest recover after a devastating
(0:46:59) Codey: fire, discover her story through cut scenes, diagram entries and items, complete your bug
(0:47:03) Codey: compendium to unlock secrets and prizes.
(0:47:06) Codey: So I screamed when I started playing and it's basically like in the perspective of this
(0:47:14) Codey: research entomologist, um, I think her name is Sylvia.
(0:47:20) Codey: Um, cause she says like, when I was hired as an entomologist by the forestry solution,
(0:47:24) Codey: which, which is like a company, the forestry solution, I was just like, this is my dream
(0:47:30) Codey: job.
(0:47:30) Aislinn: Awwww! [laughs]
(0:47:31) Codey: Like I, I literally want to be a forest entomologist working on conservation and habitat restoration.
(0:47:38) Codey: So this is like, like, oh my gosh. Uh, and then some other things that just popped out.
(0:47:44) Codey: Right away.
(0:47:46) Codey: Um, basically you're breeding the insects to repopulate the area that was ruined by
(0:47:51) Codey: the fire.
(0:47:52) Codey: Um, and your friend is like dropping you off at this like remote cabin.
(0:47:56) Codey: And he's like, are you sure you want to stay here out here all alone?
(0:47:59) Codey: And she's like, yeah, also there's no rent.
(0:48:03) Codey: And I was like, bro.
(0:48:08) Aislinn: Yeah, you know what, I got to stay out here all along, all alone with my bugs and no rent.
(0:48:14) Codey: with no red excuse. This is not even a question my god. Oh, and
(0:48:16) Aislinn: Yeah.
(0:48:22) Codey: then the final thing was, he's like trying to talk to her. And
(0:48:26) Codey: then it just says, Sylvia is was too awkward to say anything. And
(0:48:31) Codey: I was like, did they just make me like, are they following me?
(0:48:36) Codey: Are they? So yeah, that was just like my from the demo. I was, I
(0:48:41) Codey: was, I was really enjoying it. So that's
(0:48:43) Aislinn: Okay, so I will say, obviously, the journey of living out on your own and everything from
(0:48:44) Codey: my stuff.
(0:48:56) Aislinn: the perspective of Sylvia is developed as you continue to allot things in the game.
(0:49:02) Aislinn: And the relationship with you and the person that like dropped you off and everything,
(0:49:08) Aislinn: They... yeah, their name is EZ and...
(0:49:09) Codey: Their name is EZ
(0:49:13) Aislinn: that is indeed further developed too because you can... you get like letters from EZ or actually so
(0:49:17) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:49:22) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:49:24) Aislinn: you get letters back and forth. So you see the letters in the communication between your character
(0:49:29) Aislinn: Sylvia and EZ and their relationship is continuing to develop and there is some emotion behind some
(0:49:37) Aislinn: of that and it's honestly... it's pretty good!
(0:49:38) Codey: Mm-hmm
(0:49:44) Aislinn: I'm not gonna lie! It's very... it's very simple but it's like simply good. I think that might be...
(0:49:51) Aislinn: if not... no, that is one of my... I was like I can't say that's my favorite part of the game.
(0:49:55) Aislinn: It's literally a bug game. I'm not... my favorite part of the game is not going to be the people
(0:49:59) Aislinn: but in a way it is like the... the character development and the interactions with the
(0:50:06) Aislinn: other person or a friend, EZ, in the game as you continue to do like your own research here.
(0:50:13) Aislinn: And rather recovery and everything of Beetleback Ridge continues. I do like that human interaction
(0:50:22) Aislinn: aspect continuing to develop so I think that's really cool. As for... I'm trying to think like
(0:50:31) Aislinn: where I want to go with this. I mean that's pretty much it with that without giving any
(0:50:36) Codey: the story, yeah.
(0:50:36) Aislinn: loyalers per se because I obviously don't want to spoil anything especially because you're most
(0:50:40) Aislinn: most likely going to get this game at some points.
(0:50:43) Aislinn: So I'm like, I want you and of course the listeners as well to be able to experience
(0:50:48) Aislinn: that.
(0:50:49) Aislinn: So know that the story hits in ways that I was not expecting.
(0:50:54) Codey: Mmmmmm.
(0:51:00) Aislinn: I will say this and this, I will say one line that I just read recently in the game that
(0:51:06) Aislinn: was really good was, and it's not a spoiler because it's not going to make any sense,
(0:51:13) Aislinn: I think you will really resonate with as well as even if they stop me, they can't stop my
(0:51:18) Aislinn: new friends and I'm like in, in friends in regards to the bugs.
(0:51:19) Codey: Aww...
(0:51:23) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:51:24) Aislinn: So I'm like, oh, so I'm really enjoying that aspect, but I guess so, so far, like I see
(0:51:27) Codey: Yeah...
(0:51:30) Codey: That's awesome.
(0:51:36) Aislinn: you have in the, the notes and everything, you have it like broken down in different sections.
(0:51:41) Codey: Yeah, so I kind of was just thinking of the mechanics of the game and what you do in the
(0:51:47) Codey: game after we talk about the music or the graphics, which the graphics are pretty simple. It's a
(0:51:55) Codey: Tamagotchi-esque game. I didn't have my music on, so I can't really speak to that.
(0:51:56) Aislinn: - Mm-hmm, yeah.
(0:52:06) Aislinn: I will just jump in really quickly because it's very quick the soundtrack of the game is very minimal. I think I played it with the soundtrack for like a day, or like one or two game sessions and then I've just had my own music on since then and just the game sound effects because it's very
(0:52:11) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:52:12) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:52:13) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:52:14) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:52:22) Aislinn: It's very repetitive, it's very limited from what I've seen.
(0:52:24) Codey: mm-hmm okay um yeah and then other than that I just put these out uh I put some notes
(0:52:33) Codey: but we don't have to go in any particular order and I figure uh since you've played more I will
(0:52:39) Aislinn: Sure. So I guess with that said, I can talk about the, in regards to the full game, the
(0:52:50) Aislinn: place that you kind of start at, if I remember correctly, which you can also speak on as well
(0:52:55) Aislinn: with the demos, you kind of start with Beetleback Ridge, because that is the place where you
(0:52:58) Codey: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm
(0:53:01) Aislinn: basically get like your quests. And the quests are cute. They all have like different tasks
(0:53:09) Aislinn: and the mechanics of the game as you continue throughout the game, do kind of build on top
(0:53:14) Aislinn: of each other and do require you to interact with multiple different aspects of the game,
(0:53:21) Aislinn: which I think is nice, but it doesn't like, well, actually, currently I'm stuck on this
(0:53:26) Aislinn: one thing that I think is going to be more involved than I would personally like it to
(0:53:31) Aislinn: be. But for the most part, the game doesn't like force you to do anything, any specific
(0:53:37) Aislinn: way beyond just the quest.
(0:53:40) Aislinn: So there is like nice flexibility with that for both the isopods, which you start out with in the in the demo, but also with all the other books.
(0:53:46) Codey: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
(0:53:52) Aislinn: How do you feel about the because then then you transition over into the terrarium section of the game? If I remember correctly, how do you feel about the terrarium?
(0:54:00) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(0:54:01) Codey: Yeah.
(0:54:05) Codey: I mean, I thought they were really cute.
(0:54:07) Codey: And so you can have--
(0:54:08) Codey: is this true of the full game, too,
(0:54:10) Codey: that you can have three going at a time?
(0:54:13) Codey: Yeah.
(0:54:14) Codey: So I only-- I mean, the demo only lets you have the one.
(0:54:17) Codey: Makes total sense.
(0:54:19) Codey: And they just kind of already put an ice pod in it.
(0:54:22) Codey: They put a rubber ducky ice pod in there.
(0:54:25) Codey: And if folks don't know, rubber ducky ice pods
(0:54:27) Codey: are just a species of isopod, or roly poe.
(0:54:30) Codey: And then as you play the game, you can get the currency is frass, which is poop.
(0:54:55) Codey: Um, and then as you play the game, you can get the currency is frass, which is poop. Uh,
(0:54:57) Aislinn: I mean, it's, it's, yeah, let's see now how to continue.
(0:55:00) Codey: um, so you can get silver or gold frass and you can use that to buy, um, different things.
(0:55:13) Codey: There's different decorations, different, like a bed, um, something to put on the floor.
(0:55:18) Codey: You can also get hats, um, and also food. So you can give them just a basic food that's
(0:55:27) Codey: It's free, but it's not a ton.
(0:55:30) Codey: Or you can give them like bigger pieces of food and they're happy.
(0:55:35) Codey: So, whenever you first get your arthropod, because ice pods aren't insects, whenever
(0:55:45) Codey: you first get your first arthropod, it has a personality, but it's like malleable based
(0:55:52) Aislinn: Yes Mm-hmm
(0:55:56) Codey: on what you do with it, I think, and based on it.
(0:55:59) Aislinn: Mm-hmm
(0:56:00) Codey: And it's tarot, um, so you basically like get to reroll the tarot card, whatever you
(0:56:09) Codey: get one, you like flip a tarot card over or whatever.
(0:56:12) Codey: And it has some of those traits, I guess.
(0:56:14) Aislinn: Yeah, I personally am still trying to understand the tarot card, but yeah.
(0:56:18) Codey: Yeah.
(0:56:20) Codey: So they just have like, I started and he had the fool was his tarot card.
(0:56:27) Codey: My sweet boy.
(0:56:28) Codey: I named him Darnell.
(0:56:30) Codey: Um, so, and then there's like different things you can do with them in the
(0:56:36) Codey: terrarium, so you can look at the log that tells you kind of how they're
(0:56:41) Codey: feeling, if they're hungry, um, if they're scared, it also has notes.
(0:56:47) Codey: So if you're interacting with them, um, and they don't like something happens,
(0:56:54) Codey: you can look at the log.
(0:56:55) Codey: So I remember trying to pet them when they were really young, when he was
(0:56:56) Aislinn: - Mm-hmm.
(0:56:59) Codey: was really young.
(0:56:59) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:57:00) Codey: And it like had a symbol and then I went into the log and it was like Darnell is too wee to touch.
(0:57:06) Aislinn: or it's like you can't pet the I think for the isopods it's the back you can
(0:57:08) Codey: Too tiny.
(0:57:16) Aislinn: only pet the head
(0:57:17) Codey: Yeah, they don't want their butt touched.
(0:57:21) Codey: So yeah, I mean they just have like their references.
(0:57:25) Codey: And so it'll tell you that in the journal, um, along
(0:57:30) Codey: with their mood and their tarot.
(0:57:33) Codey: And then the other things are the, um, the games.
(0:57:39) Codey: So the with Darnell, they had three games.
(0:57:43) Codey: One was called, was like basically Plinko.
(0:57:46) Codey: They call it stop, drop and roll.
(0:57:48) Codey: Where like, I don't know if y'all have ever played Plinko or seen Plinko from
(0:57:52) Codey: the prices, right, where there's just like you, you put a coin down, um, into
(0:58:00) Codey: it has a bunch of pegs, and then the pegs like kind of make it go certain ways.
(0:58:05) Codey: And then at the bottom you can get prizes.
(0:58:09) Codey: So you can get like some extra gold for us or something like that to be able to buy stuff.
(0:58:15) Codey: Um, so there's that game.
(0:58:16) Codey: There's another game, um, called forest forager, where you drop stones to create
(0:58:21) Codey: a path for them to walk across and then a rolling game where you try and avoid obstacles.
(0:58:26) Codey: So I was thinking about it.
(0:58:28) Codey: those games don't really relate.
(0:58:30) Codey: To possibly other insects, uh, other arthropods that would be in this game.
(0:58:35) Codey: Are the, the games are, are the games different for each species?
(0:58:38) Aislinn: So I was actually going to build off of that. Yes, they are, they are different mini games.
(0:58:45) Aislinn: I unfortunately don't have anything in my bug bin at the moment, so I can't like go in and see
(0:58:50) Aislinn: the games again and whatnot. But there are mostly different games for every single bug,
(0:58:59) Aislinn: except there is just a little bit of overlap for from what I've seen. This is I'm on my fourth bug
(0:59:06) Aislinn: and I've seen one game repeat so far.
(0:59:08) Aislinn: But it's just slightly different aesthetics for that specific bug,
(0:59:08) Codey: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
(0:59:12) Aislinn: but otherwise there are multiple different minigames that are more or less stressful.
(0:59:19) Codey: Mm hmm. Well, and it was so each game has like different levels and it was it was pretty fun.
(0:59:24) Codey: And then like when you get something, it'll it's said stuff like Darnell is getting confident
(0:59:30) Codey: because you're winning or Darnell knows that you tried.
(0:59:32) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(0:59:35) Aislinn: Yeah, that one's so cute. It's like you tried your best and I'm like, thank you.
(0:59:36) Codey: It's just like, oh my gosh.
(0:59:40) Codey: Thank you.
(0:59:42) Codey: Yeah.
(0:59:42) Codey: So.
(0:59:43) Aislinn: I really did.
(0:59:44) Codey: So that, um, depending on if you're successful or not.
(0:59:48) Codey: And I guess the Plinko game is like luck of the draw.
(0:59:52) Codey: So perhaps don't do that one.
(0:59:54) Codey: If you're trying to make a really confident bug.
(0:59:56) Codey: The other two are the other two games of the isopods were, um,
(1:00:00) Codey: more skill-based, like trying to get the timing right for things.
(1:00:04) Codey: things. So maybe stick with those if you.
(1:00:08) Codey: If you want to have a confident.
(1:00:11) Aislinn: and they're different each bug that you get they have different skills I guess that you could say
(1:00:17) Aislinn: that you have to apply for each game um there's one game in particular that I cannot remember the
(1:00:22) Aislinn: name of but it is associated with the third bug i'm checking in on the the bugs just to be sure
(1:00:32) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:00:32) Aislinn: with third bug yeah that is color based but if you are colorblind for example
(1:00:41) Aislinn: there is also a aspect of the game that allows you to still be able to play the game with no issues
(1:00:48) Codey: Nice
(1:00:48) Aislinn: so the accessibility with this game is also really good in that sense um just as a just as a general
(1:00:51) Codey: Nice
(1:00:55) Aislinn: note but yeah each game each bug generally has different games all different different types of
(1:01:03) Aislinn: games you can kind of pick and choose if you want something more or less stressful depending on the
(1:01:09) Aislinn: bug. I think so far from what I've played.
(1:01:11) Aislinn: My favorite games have come from the third bug.
(1:01:17) Aislinn: But the second bug, I'll just say there's the, you know, like
(1:01:22) Aislinn: the three cups and you like put something under the cup and
(1:01:24) Codey: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
(1:01:25) Aislinn: then it is one of those games and that just hurts my eyes so
(1:01:29) Aislinn: much. So just tough it out for the first because it's only for
(1:01:33) Aislinn: the first stage of that bug, tough it out for the first stage
(1:01:35) Aislinn: and then you could play the other games that are better.
(1:01:38) Aislinn: In my opinion, I don't, I just, that, that one-
(1:01:41) Aislinn: just hurts my eyes so much, like I finished those and I'm like blinking so much because my eyes are just like dry.
(1:01:48) Codey: yeah okay well that's neat uh each bug also has three life stages so that's I can I think
(1:01:54) Codey: what you were referring to of like wait until they're they like level up basically they grow up
(1:02:00) Codey: um do the different arthropods have different um time periods of their like how long it takes
(1:02:09) Codey: for them to grow because I will say darnell uh like it was only a half an hour before he was
(1:02:15) Codey: He was gone to the big...
(1:02:18) Codey: ...and then you can do something with his body afterwards, which was really cool. But like, do they... do other ones have longer lifespans?
(1:02:24) Aislinn: Yeah, I know.
(1:02:29) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(1:02:35) Aislinn: They, yes, it still depends,
(1:02:38) Aislinn: 'cause there are sometimes notes that come up
(1:02:41) Aislinn: to be like, "Your bug is aging faster than normal,"
(1:02:44) Aislinn: and I'm like, "Uh-oh."
(1:02:46) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(1:02:47) Aislinn: So it's kind of luck of the draw with that as well.
(1:02:49) Codey: - Okay, sweet.
(1:02:50) Aislinn: Um, even within like the specific so like the depending each bug will age at different rates, not only within the species, but also within the actual like that specific bug as well can sometimes differ.
(1:03:00) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(1:03:06) Aislinn: And you can kind of just what's nice about this game too is that because I was trying to actively or I was actively playing it today.
(1:03:13) Aislinn: Um, and I do find that this is a good game to like passively play for sure. So I definitely, I definitely recommend it.
(1:03:14) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:03:20) Aislinn: Playing it that way just as a general sense because you will probably burn yourself out pretty quickly if you actively play it.
(1:03:29) Aislinn: But I wanted to also talk about the like the include the little that you were talking about where you can spend their poo to go buy things.
(1:03:39) Aislinn: Um, and I will say there's actually also little things that you can read in regards to the stock, aka the furniture and the hats that you get.
(1:03:50) Aislinn: There's this little tidbits of information that you could read about each item to learn more about again your character Sylvia, which is really nice.
(1:03:58) Aislinn: And I don't know if they introduced this in the demo, but specific bugs like specific things.
(1:04:04) Codey: Oh, okay.
(1:04:04) Aislinn: And you can kind of see the aesthetic that they're going for for each bug and it's really cute.
(1:04:10) Aislinn: It's really, really silly and adorable.
(1:04:12) Codey: That's really cute. Yeah, I didn't really, I didn't get a lot of different things. I think
(1:04:17) Codey: I had a couple different hats available to me from like a game, or from like, I bought some stuff.
(1:04:25) Codey: So I, I put an acorn on his hat on his head. But I didn't, I didn't see like anything about whether
(1:04:34) Codey: I enjoyed it. Okay.
(1:04:34) Aislinn: Yeah, that's that would all be in there in their notes when you're in the terrarium section, but then you can also read about them
(1:04:41) Aislinn: Or in regards to like your own character at the computer
(1:04:45) Codey: - Okay.
(1:04:47) Aislinn: Otherwise though I actually I did want to ask you as well
(1:04:51) Aislinn: Unless I think we covered most about mostly with the terrarium pretty much
(1:04:56) Aislinn: It's like you get the bug bin you put the bug egg in there the bug hatches you take care of it
(1:05:02) Aislinn: You play many games with it.
(1:05:06) Aislinn: You can read about the bug, you can name the bug, you can, depending on what you do, with the minigames feeding it and everything that all adjust their personality, you have the tarot cards, and that pretty much encapsulates the terrarium section.
(1:05:20) Codey: Yeah, I would say also that they have personality like there's like a lot of different personality things and they're on like a sliding scale so they can go from like grumpy to happy and just as you interact with them and based on their Tarot like they might they'll settle on something.
(1:05:40) Codey: And then the quests in the main part of the game are for like like one of them's like raise a cheerful bug and so you want to try and make sure you're here.
(1:05:48) Aislinn: Yep. And then you figured that out.
(1:05:50) Codey: You're getting the right personality trait.
(1:05:53) Aislinn: There are little hints that are dropped as well as you continue throughout the game
(1:05:57) Aislinn: to help you with that process.
(1:05:59) Aislinn: But the one that I am currently stuck on, I have to Google and I like actively have a
(1:06:04) Aislinn: tap open because I'm just like, I have no idea what to do.
(1:06:06) Codey: Aww, that's fair.
(1:06:08) Aislinn: So I'm currently a little bit stuck at the moment.
(1:06:09) Aislinn: But like most of the all the hints thus far up until this fourth bug have been very
(1:06:16) Aislinn: clear.
(1:06:18) Aislinn: But with that said, the thing that I wanted to ask you about was the specimen section.
(1:06:23) Codey: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Move on to the great law, the great log in the sky.
(1:06:27) Aislinn: So did you, when your little Darnell moved on, you could say, what did you do?
(1:06:42) Aislinn: Because I know there are, and I don't think this is particularly a spoiler because you'll
(1:06:46) Codey: Yeah. Yeah.
(1:06:47) Aislinn: You'll see this option pretty much right away.
(1:06:48) Aislinn: So you can make them a specimen, aka pin them, or you can put them in the another type of bug soup, I guess.
(1:07:00) Aislinn: Or you can put them in the garden and give them a burial.
(1:07:05) Codey: Oh wait, you can bug soup them?
(1:07:08) Aislinn: As far as I know from what I've unlocked, only the isopod.
(1:07:14) Codey: Okay, then I love that. Yes, I can. Okay, so yes, I love that. Okay. So basically when Darnell passed, there was the two options was like bury it and then it said or pin it. And I was like, you don't pin isopods you don't do that. So I was like, Okay, well, I'm going to bury him then.
(1:07:15) Aislinn: I don't know why.
(1:07:18) Aislinn: You can answer that?
(1:07:20) Aislinn: Okay, great.
(1:07:22) Aislinn: I don't understand the logistics of this, so that's why I want to get your take on them.
(1:07:42) Codey: And then you bury him and
(1:07:45) Codey: so you bury them in the garden and then the garden grew a little bit. And then they also
(1:07:52) Codey: talked about parthenogenesis and blah, blah, blah. And so then they were released into the
(1:07:58) Codey: wild somehow by me burying him. Or maybe I had more of them or Darnell left me,
(1:08:07) Codey: I guess if they're parthenogenic, Darnell was female. But parthenogenesis is basically when
(1:08:12) Codey: when a female organism doesn't need a male.
(1:08:14) Codey: to fertilize her own eggs.
(1:08:16) Codey: So she just does it by herself.
(1:08:18) Codey: Um, and so if the, if the isopod is like that or whatever character, whatever
(1:08:25) Codey: creature is like that, then they don't even have to mate.
(1:08:28) Codey: They just do it themselves.
(1:08:29) Codey: And then, so I think that happened and then he had, she had eggs
(1:08:34) Codey: and then you release those too.
(1:08:36) Codey: But so for the majority of arthropods, you actually don't want to pin them.
(1:08:45) Codey: So if it is something that is super soft bodied, uh, like an isopod, you
(1:08:51) Codey: keep them in ethanol, um, which is bug soup, bug soup.
(1:08:54) Aislinn: Okay. Well, I'll tell you right now, my specimen thing, because I pinned two of them because
(1:08:57) Codey: So that's great.
(1:09:02) Aislinn: I came very attached to the first two bugs that I have. Pretty right off the bat. And
(1:09:05) Codey: Okay.
(1:09:07) Aislinn: I was like, well, because they didn't give the bug soup. I'm just going to call it the
(1:09:11) Aislinn: bug soup option. They didn't give me the bug soup option right away for some reason. I
(1:09:12) Codey: Yeah.
(1:09:14) Codey: Okay.
(1:09:18) Aislinn: don't know why. I may have missed the detail, but that detail I don't know why.
(1:09:18) Codey: Okay.
(1:09:22) Codey: Okay.
(1:09:24) Aislinn: So I pinned the first two and then, no, they did give me the option, but I didn't know
(1:09:29) Aislinn: what the jar was because it was just there. And I was like, the jar looks menacing. What
(1:09:31) Codey: Mm-hmm
(1:09:33) Aislinn: if it's a garbage instead of it? I was like, I don't want to throw it out. I got scared.
(1:09:35) Codey: Okay, yeah
(1:09:37) Aislinn: So and then I was like, well, I have to click on it and see. So then I clicked on it and
(1:09:42) Aislinn: I was like, Oh, you can put them in the soup. So yeah, that is an option. But again, I,
(1:09:49) Aislinn: it has not been an option for anything else. I will tell you.
(1:09:55) Aislinn: Generally speaking, to again, not give like spoilers to the rest of the bugs in this game,
(1:09:57) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:10:00) Codey: Yeah.
(1:10:02) Aislinn: that there is at least one beetle and also a mantis. Which I don't know if those can be
(1:10:04) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:10:08) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:10:13) Aislinn: bug soupified, you could say.
(1:10:15) Codey: Um
(1:10:17) Codey: So mantis beetles you will pin through usually the right elytra
(1:10:23) Codey: Mantids you will pin through the thorax
(1:10:27) Codey: and then bees and
(1:10:30) Codey: Wasps and flies you pin through the thorax
(1:10:34) Codey: Mods and butterflies you pin through the thorax
(1:10:38) Codey: If there's a spider that is ethanol if there is like a hemipteran or like something that's young
(1:10:45) Codey: You'll put it in ethanol
(1:10:48) Codey: Also, just like really really small stuff I usually just keep those in ethanol
(1:10:52) Aislinn: Okay. Well, I will say, I think in regards to the technicalities of how these bugs are
(1:10:57) Aislinn: pinned, I'm going to guess that it's not all technically correct looking at this, just
(1:11:01) Codey: Okay. Thank you.
(1:11:02) Aislinn: as a warning. I'm just like, from what my, my knowledge is basically through you of bugs,
(1:11:08) Aislinn: I'm like, that's definitely not pinned in the right, the right elytra. That's straight
(1:11:11) Codey: The right spot.
(1:11:14) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:11:16) Aislinn: down the middle. So take that as you will. But okay, cool. Good to know.
(1:11:22) Aislinn: So that's, that's cool. I don't, I don't know what bugs there are asked pretty much
(1:11:28) Aislinn: what I said. I don't think, I don't think these, I think I have a beetle and I have
(1:11:33) Aislinn: something else. I don't know what it is, but you will find out and whatnot. And you can
(1:11:39) Codey: Well, I, because you said that, uh, there's an, like, ethanol version, I have started
(1:11:40) Aislinn: update me on what I'm looking at.
(1:11:49) Codey: a new rubber ducky isopod.
(1:11:52) Codey: So we will see, um, yeah, yeah.
(1:11:59) Aislinn: We'll see if that option is there for you
(1:12:02) Aislinn: But that's pretty much it or actually one more thing to add on with the specimen section as well
(1:12:07) Aislinn: just to further break that down is
(1:12:10) Aislinn: You can also there's a cute little
(1:12:13) Aislinn: On the right side of the the device. I guess there's a little photo button
(1:12:19) Aislinn: You can store the photos that you take of your little bug guys
(1:12:23) Aislinn: when they are
(1:12:25) Aislinn: up in their
(1:12:28) Aislinn: Wonderful log in the sky
(1:12:29) Aislinn: And you can see like what traits they had you can see you can type up like a little
(1:12:36) Codey: epitaph
(1:12:38) Aislinn: Yes, I didn't I was like I see the word I don't know how to pronounce it
(1:12:42) Codey: Yeah, they said that in the so it's I have mine in the garden and there's an epitaph with him
(1:12:49) Codey: with Darnell and
(1:12:51) Codey: so
(1:12:53) Codey: And his epitaph, let me look at it
(1:12:57) Codey: Back out garden Darnell was a lazy eater and a beefy bug
(1:13:04) Aislinn: I have, for one of mine, Poki was a high roller and loved to hermit.
(1:13:08) Codey: Aww, bogey.
(1:13:11) Aislinn: So they have little, and they also auto generate names, which I actually really like a lot of the
(1:13:16) Aislinn: auto generated names that they've been giving, so I've just been leaving it. And they auto generate
(1:13:20) Aislinn: those epitaphs as well, which have been really fun to just see what it like just gives.
(1:13:24) Codey: But you can also change them too, which is cool.
(1:13:27) Aislinn: You have the option depending on what your play style is, which is nice.
(1:13:31) Aislinn: I love this one for Crispin didn't expect
(1:13:34) Aislinn: much and love to hermit as a mood I've been I've been pinning I've been doing
(1:13:38) Codey: So, have you only been pinning them then?
(1:13:47) Aislinn: the bug soup and I've been doing the garden as well so I've been doing like
(1:13:50) Codey: Okay, you're up.
(1:13:50) Aislinn: all of it collectively I pretty much my workflow you could say is I pin the
(1:13:56) Aislinn: first bug that I like meet when I've like meet that like new species I pin
(1:14:04) Aislinn: the first one and then I've been putting like the rest of them like in the garden
(1:14:07) Aislinn: essentially I don't know why that just has become my workflow for some reason
(1:14:08) Codey: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of like, I do that with my like, my specimens, for example, the
(1:14:20) Codey: first time I encounter something, I make sure that I do it really, really well. And then
(1:14:27) Codey: after that, I might just leave them in ethanol for like, to store them, because when they're
(1:14:33) Codey: just in ethanol it's less likely that they're going to get like damaged so for
(1:14:39) Codey: But I think it's also like something that we did we do with like Animal Crossing where you do the museum and then and you put your first one in the museum. I saw a joke the other day about like you put the first one in the museum and it was about your first born child like the first one goes to blathers.
(1:15:00) Aislinn: Yeah, literally that's basically what happens.
(1:15:05) Aislinn: The first one goes to blathers, the first one gets pinned.
(1:15:09) Codey: Mm hmm. Sorry, bud.
(1:15:13) Aislinn: I wanted to ask you two about the pinning process and how, I guess you could say accurate
(1:15:19) Aislinn: that is as well, but the thing is it already started off kind of rough because of the isopod
(1:15:25) Aislinn: being the first one to be pinned.
(1:15:27) Aislinn: So that will happen to be a great question at a later.
(1:15:31) Aislinn: But it looks pretty good from what I've seen.
(1:15:34) Codey: Yeah, so what is it, like, do you just hit a button and it pins it, or do you get to choose where the pin goes?
(1:15:42) Aislinn: So you get to choose where all the pin goes. So you can move the limbs, you can move the wings,
(1:15:47) Aislinn: you can extend and like put all like, yeah, you can move all of that stuff, which I've seen before
(1:15:47) Codey: Ohhh.
(1:15:53) Aislinn: in like museums and stuff. So I'm like, I'm thinking that it's pretty good in regards to
(1:15:59) Aislinn: accuracy with the, like what you actually do. It's pretty, it's pretty cool, though. I will,
(1:16:02) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:16:05) Aislinn: I think that aspect, like that little detail of the game, regardless, regardless if it's accurate
(1:16:11) Aislinn: or not is a
(1:16:12) Aislinn: cool little thing to if you that that caters to the if you are a bug type a bug person
(1:16:20) Codey: you're a bug type pokemon um yeah I i do really like that I um I don't usually position a lot of
(1:16:29) Codey: my bugs like limbs and stuff i'm going through so many insects I do not have the time but if ever
(1:16:32) Aislinn: Mm-hmm.
(1:16:36) Codey: there's something that's like really cool there's and there's certain standards like I always make
(1:16:41) Codey: sure that things aren't crumpled uh that everything's like always facing the right direction
(1:16:47) Codey: and it's on the pin correctly and all of that.
(1:16:50) Codey: Like the rest of it, I cannot be bothered, um, to do all of that stuff.
(1:16:52) Aislinn: You know what, that's fair, but you're also, again, like you said, cycling through many,
(1:16:56) Codey: It's just not, yeah.
(1:17:02) Aislinn: many, many specimens, and this is not the case in this game as much as much at least.
(1:17:04) Codey: So many.
(1:17:11) Codey: I will say, okay, one thing I'm looking through the computer.
(1:17:15) Codey: And so there's the dire, there's notes that's your diary.
(1:17:20) Codey: The letters you get, there are facts for the different insects.
(1:17:23) Codey: There's the stock, which is the stuff.
(1:17:25) Codey: And then the goals, the seventh page of the diary says being a lab breed.
(1:17:31) Codey: My bug was able to lay parthenogenic eggs, parthenogenetic eggs.
(1:17:36) Codey: I'll release them outside to see what happens.
(1:17:38) Codey: I have nothing to lose.
(1:17:40) Codey: Here's a PSA.
(1:17:41) Codey: If you have a lab bread, insect, anything, a lab, bread, anything, do not
(1:17:48) Codey: release it into the wild.
(1:17:50) Codey: Do not do that.
(1:17:54) Codey: That is bad juju.
(1:17:56) Aislinn: Yeah, you know what? That's fair. It's like releasing a animal race in captivity.
(1:18:02) Codey: Yeah, yeah, it's like releasing like your you release. Oh, yeah, he's too small. Like releasing a red eared slider turtle into the wilderness. It's not good. It's going to disrupt the system.
(1:18:02) Aislinn: That's not the smartest thing to do.
(1:18:16) Aislinn: Yeah. Now I'm reading through diary entries to be like, what else can I ask in regards
(1:18:22) Aislinn: to the technicalities? Because I just love seeing what in this game is technically accurate.
(1:18:35) Aislinn: Now I know, don't pin isopods. Put them in soup.
(1:18:38) Codey: Mm-hmm. Put them in, they belong in soup. I will say Petunia is growing a lot, oops,
(1:18:47) Codey: sorry, a lot slower. I accidentally touched her and she rolled into a ball.
(1:18:50) Aislinn: Oh, classic pill bug.
(1:18:55) Codey: Oh, classic. I think I'm gonna buy this item for her. Oh, it's a bed. Oh, she's back there.
(1:19:02) Codey: I played a lot of games.
(1:19:04) Aislinn: The games are fun! Again, the terrarium, with the terrarium and with the minigames, as you
(1:19:12) Aislinn: unlock more of the bugs and everything, they're fun, they're cute. But with the computer,
(1:19:20) Aislinn: I do actually also want to mention, which I think, I don't remember if we already mentioned
(1:19:26) Aislinn: it, what was also really cool is that, like you said, there are facts about the bugs themselves.
(1:19:32) Codey: Mm-hmm, yep, it's just an orifice. It's it's something that they can get put the put the water in.
(1:19:32) Aislinn: So, fun fact, pill bugs can--
(1:19:34) Aislinn: drink water with their buttholes.
(1:19:36) Aislinn: I didn't know that, but now I know that.
(1:19:48) Aislinn: Just didn't know that at all.
(1:19:52) Aislinn: But the fact that they give that information
(1:19:55) Aislinn: is cool for all the bugs that you've raised.
(1:19:58) Aislinn: They give three facts about each one,
(1:20:00) Aislinn: so you can learn a little bit, a little more about each one.
(1:20:04) Aislinn: But then also, they give general facts.
(1:20:08) Aislinn: So, for example, the first fun fact, I call it a fun fact that they give is petroleum fly larvae live in crude oil.
(1:20:14) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:20:17) Aislinn: So they have a bunch of facts. I would assume that they are true. I would hope that they are true.
(1:20:24) Codey: Yeah, I mean, I would assume all the facts that I've seen so far have been accurate.
(1:20:29) Codey: So I feel like they've done their due diligence.
(1:20:32) Aislinn: awesome because I also didn't know bees can tell time and now I know
(1:20:33) Codey: Yeah, yep.
(1:20:40) Aislinn: so I think that's a really cool thing again if you are the type of person that likes bugs I do think
(1:20:45) Aislinn: that's like like the game developers have said validating because I'm learning all these new
(1:20:51) Aislinn: things about bugs I'm like this is so cool I love learning new things about these bug guys because
(1:20:55) Aislinn: there's just so many bugs out there and I don't know how I'm gonna obtain all this information
(1:21:00) Aislinn: besides just you.
(1:21:03) Codey: I'm always here for my friends
(1:21:05) Codey: to just answer bug questions.
(1:21:07) Codey: Oh no, Petunia fell.
(1:21:08) Aislinn: Oh
(1:21:09) Codey: I was playing the game and she fell.
(1:21:12) Aislinn: Oh
(1:21:14) Codey: I'm gonna get her a log, have a log.
(1:21:18) Aislinn: But you should you should do like a fun factor of the day but bug fact of the day
(1:21:20) Codey: So yeah, they,
(1:21:25) Aislinn: Or like every like
(1:21:26) Codey: you should've asked this,
(1:21:28) Codey: should've asked this at the beginning.
(1:21:31) Aislinn: I
(1:21:32) Aislinn: Mean doesn't have to be right now. You definitely do not just saying just in general like you should have like in the slack like every
(1:21:35) Codey: Okay, I'll think about it.
(1:21:38) Codey: Oh, Friday Fun Facts.
(1:21:39) Aislinn: Fun facts fun fact Friday's about bugs
(1:21:42) Codey: I mean, you could, yeah, you can tag me
(1:21:45) Codey: and be like, Cody, give us our Fun Facts.
(1:21:47) Codey: I'll be like, oh, okay.
(1:21:49) Aislinn: That's my that's my Friday itinerary, oh, yeah, they can get mites too in this game
(1:21:52) Codey: Oh no, he has mites.
(1:21:57) Codey: Cure a sick, mite, smiter, love that.
(1:22:00) Aislinn: There's a bunch of little little details that they have in this game and again as you like continue on there's more and more little
(1:22:07) Aislinn: Things that they
(1:22:10) Aislinn: That make it just a little bit more interactive, but you're still you're so you're still playing the demo currently
(1:22:16) Codey: Yeah
(1:22:17) Aislinn: So you can still do that on the demo. That's nice. You're just limited to one bug
(1:22:20) Codey: Yeah, you just can only do one bug I don't know if they like are gonna kick me out at some point
(1:22:22) Aislinn: Interesting okay cool
(1:22:29) Codey: Why are you upset?
(1:22:32) Aislinn: I hope not
(1:22:34) Codey: She keeps getting grumpy, but I don't know I don't know any of the other like
(1:22:39) Codey: functionality things I only know the first two of cheery and hearty cheer so it's gloomy or cheerful
(1:22:46) Codey: Unsickly or hearty and I that's the only that's all I know
(1:22:50) Aislinn: Yeah, you will... You will unlock more at a later point.
(1:22:58) Codey: Yeah. Yeah, I will definitely say how they have the, I guess like the final summary is this,
(1:22:59) Aislinn: I'm really trying to like, be careful with my words to not spoil it because I want you to also eventually experience the magic of unlocking all these little things as you continue throughout the game.
(1:23:18) Codey: basically what they wrote in their thing is that there's a compelling storyline. There's seven
(1:23:23) Codey: different bug species, each with three distinct lifestyle stages. Oh, and three adult color
(1:23:27) Codey: variants.
(1:23:28) Aislinn: Yes, I've gotten two out of three for one of them which I'm excited about how do I unlock them?
(1:23:28) Codey: I don't know, but it's happened. Yeah, three mini games per bug, 50 plus real bug facts, 10 plus different personality traits, 20 plus tarot cards, gorgeous handcrafted art. Yeah, I'd say it's really nice.
(1:23:33) Aislinn: I have not you figured that out yet
(1:23:54) Aislinn: Yeah, no, it is really really like aesthetically this game is very very cute and
(1:23:58) Aislinn: Very like you can tell that the they're going for a specific vision with the art style of this game
(1:24:03) Codey: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. And they're, I mean, they're, they're nailing it, I think.
(1:24:06) Aislinn: But yeah, did you?
(1:24:09) Aislinn: Yeah, I most definitely definitely this is I guess long story short. This is definitely a
(1:24:17) Aislinn: digital pet game game
(1:24:19) Aislinn: like Tamagotchi, but indeed with modern depth and strategy because
(1:24:24) Aislinn: there is strategy to unlock different personalities. I'm
(1:24:28) Aislinn: sure the strategy to unlock the different color variants. So you
(1:24:34) Aislinn: do have to you do have to be strategic and it's much more
(1:24:38) Aislinn: interactive than a Tamagotchi. Like I I love Tamagotchi
(1:24:41) Aislinn: growing up, but I definitely got bored of it because there's
(1:24:43) Aislinn: only so much you can do with it. The mini games are only so
(1:24:46) Aislinn: involved and while the mini games are still simple in this
(1:24:51) Aislinn: game they're involved enough to have like a
(1:24:54) Aislinn: Gameplay loop and they do contribute to the life cycle of your bug as well, which is cool
(1:25:02) Aislinn: So it's not like the minigame is there and then you could play it and that's it
(1:25:05) Aislinn: It actually like also like means things so everything is is
(1:25:08) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:25:09) Aislinn: Intertwined in a way that I wasn't expecting. It's not just just collecting like there's more to it
(1:25:15) Aislinn: And you get to know your little bug friends, and then they eventually
(1:25:19) Aislinn: Pass and you get to memorialize them and learn about that process
(1:25:24) Aislinn: too and it's really really cute and cool but I yeah I will say that I do and
(1:25:27) Codey: - Yeah, I think that's a good summary.
(1:25:34) Aislinn: I don't I don't want to end on a negative note but I will say for the
(1:25:40) Aislinn: price of $20 I am hesitant to say it's currently worth it at $20 I would
(1:25:46) Codey: Mm hmm.
(1:25:48) Aislinn: probably wait till it goes on sale or get it in that wonderful bundle that you
(1:25:53) Aislinn: mentioned earlier?
(1:25:54) Aislinn: just because I feel like seven bugs yes there are three variants and different personalities
(1:26:01) Aislinn: but seven bugs doesn't feel like too much um the story is good though I will say like I think the
(1:26:09) Aislinn: story is so far like very interesting to me and i'm not sure about the mini games just yet but
(1:26:17) Aislinn: I do it has already been i'm only four bugs and there's already been one mini game that has
(1:26:23) Aislinn: It's overlapped.
(1:26:24) Aislinn: So I wish I could do more besides just read about my specimens or just read about like
(1:26:33) Aislinn: the garden.
(1:26:34) Aislinn: Like I wish I could do something in those.
(1:26:35) Codey: I mean, I think that's the idea is for it to be idle.
(1:26:37) Aislinn: True.
(1:26:38) Aislinn: Yeah, it is definitely like an idle game, but I, I, I just wish, I don't know what it
(1:26:43) Aislinn: would be, but I wish there was just a little bit more interaction because sometimes, like
(1:26:49) Aislinn: if you want to play this game actively, you're going to have to just kind of stare at the
(1:26:53) Aislinn: screen for a little bit.
(1:26:54) Codey: Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
(1:26:54) Aislinn: It's great for throwing on a YouTube video in the background, or I was actually playing the demo of what's it called again, the lockdown, as I was watching my bug in the terrarium.
(1:27:04) Codey: The dog walk down.
(1:27:10) Aislinn: So it's good in that sense, but if you want to play it actively, there is not too much to do, which is fine, but that is something to consider, depending on the type of gamer that you are.
(1:27:24) Aislinn: I wish I could customize my, like, I wish I could have a, like, terrarium with multiple, maybe this unlocks at a later point, but I wish I could have like a terrarium where I could put multiple bugs and see like all the bugs in.
(1:27:35) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:27:37) Aislinn: I know that could be an issue of certain bugs interacting with each other might be an issue, like one bug might eat the other bug because, you know, but I wish I could have just a little bit more customization slash more, just a little bit more with the terrarium.
(1:27:40) Codey: Mm-hmm.
(1:27:54) Aislinn: To be able to like learn more about the environment that that bug lives in, IRL, because the environment for some of the bugs overlap as well.
(1:28:07) Aislinn: So it's the same background. So I would like to just be able to have a little bit more distinction with that, but like, it's not necessary by any means. I just, I think the biggest thing for me is that for $20, I wish there were more bugs.
(1:28:18) Codey: Mm hmm. Yeah.
(1:28:22) Aislinn: Cause it's a bug game, yes.
(1:28:24) Aislinn: I guess there's like a cool character story with the human and everything but at the end of the day it is the focus is on bugs so I wish there was just a little bit more with that but I'm sure I don't know for certain I haven't heard anything but I assume there will be updates at some point.
(1:28:38) Codey: I mean it's ripe for it like for them to just give an update like drop like shadow drop them or
(1:28:46) Codey: I mean or announce it um I definitely would probably not want there to be an added price to it
(1:28:54) Aislinn: -Yeah. -Mm-hmm.
(1:28:54) Codey: um but I I think it's well worth playing I mean I'm sitting here just playing forest forager over
(1:29:01) Codey: and over and over again um to just trying to
(1:29:02) Aislinn: It's a great game for exactly what you're doing right now, recording a podcast and just
(1:29:08) Aislinn: having something to do with your hands.
(1:29:09) Codey: yep cause knitting knitting got boring um yeah so um but I mean I could see like if you have
(1:29:11) Aislinn: It's really, really, really good for that.
(1:29:20) Codey: something else going on maybe not super fun to uh like if you have something that's more active
(1:29:29) Codey: like you it wouldn't be good to have this on at the same time probably
(1:29:29) Aislinn: Yeah
(1:29:33) Aislinn: Yeah, it's you can't I was definitely like if I were playing like for example
(1:29:39) Aislinn: Honestly, I was playing like for example fields of mistria. I would not be able to play
(1:29:44) Aislinn: this game simultaneously, but if I
(1:29:48) Aislinn: Playing like the look town where it wasn't like time
(1:29:51) Aislinn: Anything like time limited playing a game wise I could not play both games at once
(1:29:55) Aislinn: But like again watching like a YouTube video or listening to a podcast
(1:29:58) Codey: - Mm-hmm, yeah.
(1:29:59) Aislinn: Something like that. This is a good game to complement that well, so depends on the type of gamer that you are
(1:30:05) Aislinn: I think I'm generally more of an active gamer, but I do like this game for when I don't feel like actively gaming
(1:30:11) Codey: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's very cute.
(1:30:15) Aislinn: I'm just a little I'm just a little bit hesitant on the price just because of the I wish there were more bugs
(1:30:21) Aislinn: That's pretty much it
(1:30:22) Aislinn: But hey, hopefully there's an update in the future for that. That would be really really awesome
(1:30:27) Codey: Mm hmm. Cool. I think that about right. Oh, it almost wraps it up. I have one question.
(1:30:29) Aislinn: You
(1:30:33) Aislinn: Yes, what is the bathroom
(1:30:34) Codey: What is the bathroom? So like, when you're on when you're in your place, there's a part
(1:30:41) Codey: of your space that is a so that has a bunch of question marks, but there's a toilet there.
(1:30:46) Aislinn: what oh the bottom left corner ah okay so that is what's called the scatalog that's um
(1:30:51) Codey: Yes.
(1:31:02) Codey: Okay, I'm here for it.
(1:31:04) Aislinn: and that is where you can buy different I totally forgot to talk about this section
(1:31:09) Aislinn: that is where you can buy the different walls the different floor the different beds the hats
(1:31:14) Aislinn: and you can also buy different
(1:31:16) Aislinn: shells aka the casing and like the backdrop of the the game so like the
(1:31:22) Codey: Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Okay.
(1:31:24) Aislinn: case of like the pocket game I guess we'll call it you can change that you
(1:31:28) Aislinn: could buy different different ones see it's in the settings the UI theme you
(1:31:33) Aislinn: can change the UI theme and then also in there there is finally a capsule section
(1:31:40) Aislinn: so there's a gotcha aspect of the game too which I just did a gotcha just for
(1:31:47) Aislinn: and I won a bug fact so I got cicadas have one of the longest lifespans in the
(1:31:53) Aislinn: insect kingdom that's the that's the bug fact but I just won and you could win
(1:31:59) Aislinn: like different hats you could win different you could basically win
(1:32:02) Aislinn: different home and hat things you can also win bug facts as well so that's
(1:32:04) Codey: okay sweet okay because so it's basically like where your bathroom is so
(1:32:08) Aislinn: what the the bathroom is
(1:32:12) Codey: it's funny that it's called the scat-a-log because like do you I'm
(1:32:15) Codey: assuming you like buy that stuff with the frass but it's not but it's where
(1:32:18) Aislinn: - Yes, exactly, bye.
(1:32:22) Codey: your toilet is
(1:32:25) Codey: so is it maybe it's like you're going you go to the bathroom and you're like
(1:32:31) Codey: on the toilet and you're just on your phone ordering this stuff.
(1:32:34) Aislinn: Um, I guess you could say so cuz like the the items that you get, for example, like
(1:32:41) Codey: Oh, I got it for free.
(1:32:42) Aislinn: the the acorn hat, let me pull it back up the acorn hat, acorn cap rather says for the
(1:32:52) Aislinn: description of it almost stepped on during one of my long walks, it survived and is now
(1:32:56) Codey: Okay, yep. Okay. And you're like, Oh, yeah, that you're like
(1:32:57) Aislinn: a fun cosplay accessory. So they're like your items. So it's like, I don't know, you're
(1:33:02) Aislinn: you're like sitting on the toilet and you discover.
(1:33:04) Aislinn: I don't know.
(1:33:07) Codey: reminiscing on the toilet. Fair. And you're and yeah, other
(1:33:08) Aislinn: Yeah.
(1:33:10) Aislinn: Something like that.
(1:33:12) Aislinn: With uh, with bug poo in one hand.
(1:33:18) Aislinn: Your poo coming out the other.
(1:33:19) Codey: things happening. Oh, no.
(1:33:22) Aislinn: Something like that, I don't know.
(1:33:26) Codey: Okay. Cool. I think that pretty much covers it.
(1:33:26) Aislinn: The logistics of that I didn't question, but now that you bring it up now I'm questioning.
(1:33:36) Aislinn: Yeah.
(1:33:38) Aislinn: That does, uh, I think that's everything that I've got.
(1:33:42) Aislinn: Good game overall.
(1:33:42) Codey: Cool. Well, where can people find you?
(1:33:46) Aislinn: They can find me, um, I guess primarily on Twitch at A's Trainer, A-I-S Trainer.
(1:33:57) Aislinn: Um, but I'm also on BlueSky, I'm on Instagram.
(1:34:02) Aislinn: I'm I don't know why I'm
(1:34:04) Aislinn: still on threads but I'm still on threads I still have yet to deactivate
(1:34:06) Codey: Okay.
(1:34:09) Aislinn: my Twitter but we're working on it and I haven't recorded in a hot minute cuz
(1:34:10) Codey: Okay.
(1:34:14) Aislinn: Chris and I have been just so busy but we also have our own podcast which I've
(1:34:18) Aislinn: mentioned before Muen'ku where we just talk about anything and everything and
(1:34:24) Aislinn: sneak peek which I've mentioned a couple times before is that the next episode
(1:34:29) Aislinn: that we are looking to record is an episode about...
(1:34:35) Aislinn: quote-unquote, "being too kind."
(1:34:36) Codey: Okay
(1:34:37) Aislinn: So that's a topic that we want to discuss, but yeah, what about you?
(1:34:42) Codey: You can find me at blue sky where it's just my name at Cody Mathis
(1:34:46) Codey: You can find me on Instagram at hiking beagle be eagle
(1:34:51) Codey: you can also find me on the slack, which is
(1:34:55) Codey: Something that you can get if you follow the podcast on patreon patreon.com slash THS pod support the show and
(1:35:04) Codey: Get access to that slack
(1:35:07) Codey: you can also go to the website harvest season club and
(1:35:12) Codey: Give us feedback give us some questions. Maybe tell us some different games to play
(1:35:21) Codey: Yeah
(1:35:22) Aislinn: Say hi to our friend Al in the Slack.
(1:35:26) Codey: Yeah, yeah say hi to the rest of us
(1:35:31) Codey: Who aren't on this podcast?
(1:35:35) Codey: - Yeah.
(1:35:35) Aislinn: And y'all can also find Al at the Scottbot on Mastodon dot Scott or Blue Sky as well,
(1:35:36) Codey: - Mm-hmm.
(1:35:42) Aislinn: just to shout him out as well because he edits all these and I want to make sure
(1:35:45) Aislinn: he gets a proper recognition too, but I think you covered the rest of it.
(1:35:46) Codey: This is, as I joke often, but this is his podcast.
(1:35:53) Aislinn: Yes, and we were just all living in his, in his world.
(1:35:56) Codey: We are just guests in it.
(1:35:58) Aislinn: We're, Al is the, the, what's the, what's the phrase? It's like the phrase,
(1:36:03) Aislinn: it's like something, something, and we are all living in it. Does that make any sense?
(1:36:09) Codey: It's just his world and we're all living in it, yeah, basically.
(1:36:12) Aislinn: That, you know, that's the phrase. I'm terrible at catchphrases like that or whatever,
(1:36:15) Aislinn: whatever. I don't even know what the word's called, but yeah, that.
(1:36:19) Codey: Just quote memes?
(1:36:20) Codey: I don't know.
(1:36:21) Aislinn: I don't know, either.
(1:36:22) Aislinn: I'm also terrible at idioms.
(1:36:23) Codey: I don't, I wouldn't say it's an idiom
(1:36:25) Codey: 'cause idioms you normally like learn something from.
(1:36:32) Codey: That's fine.
(1:36:35) Codey: They're weird and they get like merged over time.
(1:36:40) Aislinn: Me too.
(1:36:42) Codey: So cool, well, thank you guys for joining me
(1:36:46) Codey: slash me joining you on this.
(1:36:50) Codey: It was really fun.
(1:36:50) Codey: And this, I couldn't think of anyone else.
(1:36:53) Codey: Like I, well, I could think of other people
(1:36:55) Codey: who could do this podcast with me.
(1:36:58) Codey: But when I saw the game, I was like,
(1:37:00) Codey: I know that A's is someone that I would like
(1:37:02) Codey: to do this episode with.
(1:37:02) Aislinn: Yes. I can't think of anyone else. No offense on their hosts, but I can't think of anyone else to record with for this game exactly.
(1:37:04) Codey: So, well, it's a bug, it's a bug game, let's be honest.
(1:37:18) Codey: I'm here for it.
(1:37:18) Aislinn: But it's always nice chatting with you, so it was nice to record this nonetheless. Bugs are no bugs.
(1:37:19) Codey: Mhmm.
(1:37:20) Codey: Cool.
(1:37:21) Codey: Thanks, A's and thanks, listeners.
(1:37:30) Codey: And until next time, have a good harvest.
(1:37:32) Aislinn: Have a good harvest!
(1:37:34) Theme Tune: The harvest season is created by Al McKinlay, with support from our patrons, including our
(1:37:45) Theme Tune: pro farmers, Kevin, Stuart and Alisa.
(1:37:49) Theme Tune: Our art is done by Micah the Brave, and our music is done by Nick Burgess.
(1:37:53) Theme Tune: Feel free to visit our website harvestseason.club for show notes and links to things we discussed
(1:37:59) Theme Tune: in this episode.
(1:38:08) Codey: But first there's news, but also I need to, I can't tell if you can hear this dog or not, but I need to let a, I need to let a dog in this room, give me a second.
(1:38:14) Aislinn: I can. No problem.
(1:38:20) Codey: Cuz Chloe, come on Miss Chloe, you can come hang out with me.
(1:38:26) Codey: Okay, I am currently dog sitting two dogs in my home.
(1:38:28) Aislinn: Wow.
(1:38:31) Codey: But one of them just plays with Stella the whole time, but Chloe is a Yorkie and she was upset that she was not in the same room as me.
(1:38:34) Aislinn: Oh.
(1:38:38) Aislinn: Yeah, there's so many good dog Snapchats recently from you. So much good content with that.
(1:38:38) Codey: Yeah, yeah, there's some good hiking ones today.
(1:38:47) Codey: Oh, I should send you the car one too, but that's I didn't record that on Snapchat, but I will.
(1:38:52) Aislinn: Will I will take I will take anything and everything
(1:38:56) Codey: They are very cute.
(1:38:59) Codey: Yeah, so let's move on Chloe. Well, let's move on to news
